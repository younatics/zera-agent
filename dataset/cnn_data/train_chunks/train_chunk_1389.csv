"Twisted ISIS supporters are distributing a sickening video game that allows users to play the role of Islamic extremists on a mission to murder Westerners. Supporters of the terror group, which has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, have modified the popular video game ARMA III to create characters based on ISIS militants. The user-generated modification, or 'mod' in video game parlance, is understood to reward users for killing Westerners and characters based on Syrian regime soldiers and the brave Kurdish peshmerga fighters who have formed the most effective resistance against the terrorists in real life. Although the mod is  not part of an official release by Czech developers Bohemia Interactive, ISIS supporters are said to be using it to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable, distributing it free on gaming forums to those declaring their support for the terror group's self-styled caliphate. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Supporters of the terror group, which has brought rape and massacre to vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, have modified the popular video game ARMA III to create characters based on ISIS militants . Masked: The user-generated modification, or 'mod' in video game parlance, rewards users for killing Westerners and characters based on Syrian regime soldiers and brave Kurdish peshmerga fighters . The modification actually started as an anti-ISIS update according to Vocativ, with video game players creating characters to fight against who were based on the Islamist militants. However ISIS supporters quickly 'hijacked' the mod and enabled users to play as the jihadis themselves, encouraging them to murder characters based on Westerners and anti-ISIS troops. According to the website, one ISIS supporter took to a well known pro-terror web forum to promote the mod, posting: 'In the latest version of the game ARMA III there are mods in which a user can play as an ISIS militant, especially against the Peshmerga and Syrian army.' A second anonymous supporter replied: 'I will, with the help of Allah, make dozens of copies for this game and distribute it for free to all the brothers that use the name of the Islamic Caliphate.' It is not the first time ISIS has hijacked Western video games to spread propaganda, having previously used Grand Theft Auto 5 to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable. Modified: Although the mod is not part of an official release by Czech developers Bohemia Interactive, ISIS supporters are said to be using it to recruit children and radicalise the vulnerable . Chilling: ISIS' black flag of jihad is seen painted on cars and flying on flag poles in the video game mod . Hijacking the ARMA III modification is just the latest attempt by ISIS supporters to use the growing influence of video games to recruit children to their twisted cause and radicalise the vulnerable. Last September ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube that carried the group's chilling black jihadi flag and showed violent scenes from the game - including police officers being gunned down and lorries being blown up by suicide bombers. At the start of the video a message appears that reads: 'Your games which are producing from you, we do the same actions in the battelfields (sic)!!'. As the video continues, the players can be heard chanting Islamist slogans whenever a bomb explodes or another character is killed. Pro-jihadi music is also heard playing throughout the video, which is designed to look and sound like the terror group's real-life footage of brutal slaughter that it has filmed in Syria and Iraq. The modification actually started as an anti-ISIS update, with video game players creating characters to fight against who were based on the Islamist militants. Users initially played the game as the Iraqi army (pictured) Sick: ISIS supporters are now distributing  the ARMA III modification on gaming forums to those declaring their support for the terror group's self-styled caliphate . Egyptian media said that the video is meant to 'raise the morale of the Mujahideen, and the training of children and young teenagers to fight the West, and throw terror into the hearts of opponents of the state', according to Forbes. ISIS has also made continual references to the hugely popular Call of Duty, producing slick posters that adopt the video games title to refer to jihad. They have even produced slick propaganda films that ape Call of Duty's gameplay, using HD helmet cameras, freeze frame footage and heavily edited audio to make the terrorists' real-life murder and massacre in the Syrian city of Kobane look like little more than a video game. A man has  been blindfolded and thrown off a tower block in Syria for 'being gay' before being stoned to death after surviving the fall. New images emerged appearing to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad. The man, who was supposedly being punished for having a 'homosexual affair', apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block. Footage shows the man sat on a plastic chair, while blindfolded, before being thrown off the tower block . The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, claims the man was thrown from the building before being beaten to death. Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded. He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues. The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first. The man was hurled from the building, at least seven storeys high, as punishment for 'being gay' The crowd appeared to surround the man before beating him with stones until he fell unconscious .","ISIS supporters have modified ARMA III so users can play as the militants .

"Mrs Kirchner: The president's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of Alberto Nisman . A prosecutor shot dead after accusing Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of helping cover up a terrorist bombing was trying to have her arrested, it emerged last night. Investigators probing the killing of Alberto Nisman – found dead in his bathroom before he could testify over the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires – revealed they had found a draft document requesting Mrs Kirchner’s detention. Chief investigator Viviana Fein said the warrant was found in a wastepaper bin at the apartment where Mr Nisman’s body was discovered on January 18. It was not included in a complaint Mr Nisman had filed in the federal court days earlier. The 51-year-old was found slumped in his bathroom with a bullet wound in his head hours before he was to appear before congress to detail allegations that Mrs Kirchner agreed to protect those responsible for the bombing, which killed 85 and injured more than 200. The attack was believed to have been masterminded by Iran. Mrs Kirchner, whose country is facing economic chaos, has rejected Mr Nisman’s claims and has suggested that rogue intelligence operatives were behind the special prosecutor’s death. His allegations, she said, were based on false information given to him by the former head of the intelligence services. Mr Nisman had been appointed a decade ago by Kirchner’s late husband, President Nestor Kirchner, to investigate the bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association. In 2013, he released an indictment accusing Iran and Hezbollah of organising the blast. Iran denied the allegations but last month Mr Nisman accused Mrs Kirchner and other senior officials of agreeing not to punish at least two former Iranian officials believed to have been involved.

"More than half of adults are now expected to get cancer at some point in their life, research shows. The risk is increasing so quickly that experts fear as many as two-thirds of today’s children will develop the disease. Charities said yesterday that the NHS could face a ‘crisis’ if it does not plan ahead for the increase in cases. Scroll down for video . The warning came after a study found our odds of getting cancer are steadily increasing due to longer lifespans and unhealthy lifestyles. The projections are the most accurate calculations to date from Cancer Research UK, which had previously estimated that one in three Britons would develop cancer. They take into account the effects of modern lifestyles – namely poor diets, lack of exercise, how many of us sunbathe and smoke. The number of cancer cases is also set to rise due to longer life expectancy and improved healthcare. BREAST CANCER: 96 per cent of women survive for at least one year, 87 per cent do so for five years, and 78 per cent for a decade. SKIN CANCER: 88 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women the figures are even better, with 92 per cent predicted to survive for at least five years. LUNG CANCER: Just 8 per cent of men survive for five years or more, compared with 12 per cent of women. PROSTATE CANCER: Some 85 per cent of patients survive for five years or more. BOWEL CANCER: 59 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women, the figure is 58 per cent. The chances of surviving the illness have increased substantially in recent decades thanks to earlier diagnosis and more advanced treatment. At least half of patients can now expect to live for at least ten years, at which point experts say they are effectively cured. The new figures, published today in the British Journal of Cancer, show the average lifetime risk of getting cancer for anyone born after 1960 is now 50.5 per cent. It is slightly higher for men (at 53.5 per cent, compared with 47.5 per cent for women) because they are more likely to smoke. The study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, looked at the risk of being diagnosed with cancer for those born between 1930 and 1960. For the oldest age group the odds were under 40 per cent, but the risk rose steadily with each passing decade. Professor Peter Sasieni, an expert in cancer trends who is based at Queen Mary University of London, predicted that for today’s children the chances of getting the disease would be about two in three. He added: ‘If people live long enough then most will get cancer at some point. But there’s a lot we can do to make it less likely like giving up smoking, being more active, drinking less alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight.’ Preventative steps: One expert said children could reduce their risk of having cancer in later life by giving up smoking, being more active, drinking less alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight. (File image) Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research’s chief executive, warned that if the NHS ‘doesn’t act and invest now’ then ‘we will face a crisis in the future – with [survival rates] going backwards’. However, he added that ‘for some types of cancers we effectively do have a cure’. ‘If you look at testicular cancer we’re up at survival rates in the high nineties now,’ he said. The latest figures show there are around 331,000 new cases of cancer in the UK each year, most commonly in the lung, breast, prostate and bowel. Despite improved survival rates, our figures lag well behind those of other European countries. They are particularly low for elderly patients. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Cancer survival rates are now at their highest ever level, and we are on track to save an extra 12,000 lives this year. ‘But cases of cancer are likely to rise with an ageing population – so we are focused on earlier diagnosis, improving care and tackling preventable cancer.’","Cancer risk is increasing due to longer lifespans and better healthcare .

"Facebook has started collecting information about the other websites users visit, the links they click on and their searches. The social media site already harvests details people share on their profiles, including where they went to school, their interests and where they live. But under a new privacy policy – to which anyone who has signed into Facebook since Friday has been opted in automatically – it can track activity outside the website, including online searches and some of the details users share with retailers. Facebook has started collecting information about the other websites users visit, the links they click on and their searches. It said that the changes help Facebook 'to better serve more relevant advertising to you' A Facebook spokesman said: ‘It takes into account pages and places visited on Facebook, alongside browsing on the internet.’ She added that the changes help Facebook 'to better serve more relevant advertising to you.' The site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to Facebook. The new terms were introduced as part of a wider update to Facebook's privacy policy, which - the social network claimed - was designed to make the rules easier to understand. However, most users remain unaware of the radical change they have signed up for. The move has been condemned by privacy campaigners and has reignited fears over the threat the social network poses to people's privacy online, and the transparency with which it behaves. Labour MP Helen Goodman said it is 'absolutely typical of Facebook' to prioritise profits over the interests of its users. She added: ‘What this does is clearly put their financial interests ahead of the interests of their informed consumers. 'They’re taking a significant step forward in terms of the amount of information they collect. It makes me feel very uneasy.’ Facebook's profits more than doubled to $1.1bn (£727m) in the last quarter as advertising revenues soared. John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP, said that Facebook owed it to its members to be more transparent about the way it uses their data. The site uses cookies – small files which it places on your web browser or device – to collect information which can then be transmitted back to Facebook. The move has been condemned by privacy campaigners . 'If Facebook has changed what it is doing, it should make that clearer to the people that use it,' he said. 'I have used Facebook since Friday and they haven't made it clear to me.' Renate Samson, chief executive of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, added: ‘This privacy change was not clearly announced to users of Facebook. ‘It is vital that companies seek informed consent from their users before making changes to privacy settings and enable the user to choose whether to accept the service or not. 'The ability to opt out should be straight forward and not an arduous round the houses task.' The social network claimed that it has made its privacy policy much clearer than in the past, by condensing 12 pages of legal terminology down to four. It also claims it has told users how they can limit the amount of information they share, by adjusting their privacy settings or electing not to see certain kinds of adverts. A spokesman said there is 'a powerful ad preferences tool…accessible from every ad on Facebook,' explaining why that advert was shown in the first place, and offering users the chance to say when they are not interested in a particular kind of service. Last year, is also harnessing the information to sell advertising space on behalf of other websites, so that advertisers effectively 'follow' users around the internet.

"Burnley and Championship leaders Derby are exploring a potential move for Ecuador's latest sensation Junior Sornoza. The 20-year-old has been grabbing the headlines in South America as one of the up and coming talents and English clubs are being sounded out as he looks to make a move to Europe. Sornoza has been likened to Real Madrid's James Rodriguez as he can play as a second striker, on the left wing or as an attacking midfielder yet is available for around £3.5million. Importantly, he is also a regular for Ecuador so will meet work permit criteria. Junior Sornoza (left) plays for Ecuador against the USA in an international friendly in Connecticut in October . Ecuador teammates West Ham's Enner Valencia and Antonio Valencia of Manchester United have already encouraged him to make the move and his agents are due in England over the coming weeks to talk to interested parties. Sornoza plays for Independiente and has shot to prominence with his assists and a variety of goals including a long range winner against Botafogo in the Copa Libertadores in March. He ended the tournament with four goals and three assists in six games. Sornoza (right) celebrates after scoring for Independiente in the Copa Libertadores in April . Although relatively small in height, he is a strong runner with good balance and is adept at taking set-pieces. Burnley do not want to spend big in January and will look at loans in the main but they are interested as the price falls within their budget and Sornoza would represent good sell-on value.","Junior Sornoza is looking to make a move to Europe .

"Rona Fairhead: The new chairman of the BBC Trust, pictured, has warned the corporation not to become too 'high and mighty' The new chairman of the BBC Trust has warned the corporation not to become too 'high and mighty', and distanced herself from her predecessors by promising she won't 'gloss over' its faults. Rona Fairhead used her first speech as chairman of the BBC's governing body to urge television bosses to 'challenge themselves', and warned them that she would not become the Corporation's 'cheerleader'. 'I'm not someone to gloss over the BBC's faults, problems or challenges – I see it as part of my job to identify and pursue them,' she said. In doing so, the 53-year old executive distanced herself from her predecessors Lord Patten and Sir Michael Lyons, who were accused of being too 'cosy' with the BBC's executives and becoming blind to the Corporation's faults. Mrs Fairhead also admitted in her inaugural address that the Corporation needs to become more 'agile', and vowed to consult the public on what shape it should take in the future, rather than leaving decisions to a 'small elite'. '[There needs to be] a very real debate about the future, size and shape of the BBC….and I believe it needs to be a proper public debate, not one conducted by a small elite,' she said. 'The debate must include the voices of all the people out there who pay for the BBC, who love its programmes, who are its true owners.' Mrs Fairhead's comments come as the BBC prepares for its next Charter Review, in 2016, when the corporation will effectively negotiate its future funding. BBC acolytes insist that the corporation must be kept intact. However, many of the BBC's critics have argued that it should be shrunk, for example by cutting back on its in-house production unit or local news services. Mrs Fairhead, who was finance director of Pearson before she joined the BBC Trust, admitted that the Corporation may need to shrink but added that it does not need to become 'much' smaller. However, she used a story about her son to warn the Corporation not to become too complacent. She told television executives in London that she had once returned home from a conference 'feeling rather pleased' with herself, only to see he had loaded a screen-saver onto her computer, with the slogan: 'High and mighty. Just because you're at the top doesn't mean you're useful'. 'It was a good challenge. Everyone – and I include in that every organisation – needs to challenge itself from time to time. And because the BBC is paid for by the public, that challenge needs to take form of a wider debate,' she said. Predecessors: Lord Patten, left, and Sir Michael Lyons were accused of being too cosy with BBC executives . She added that the BBC should do more to cooperate with other media groups, for example by sharing content. 'The BBC has to show that it can be more open and collaborative – while respecting its editorial position. It should do more sharing of IP and content, get better at linking and attribution,' she said. 'Clearly the BBC is a major market intervention and, while it needs to serve all licence fee payers, it also needs to be sensitive to commercial players operating in the UK market.' In recent years, the BBC has come under heavy fire over its free-to-access local news websites, which have helped to accelerate the decline of commercially run newspaper operations in those areas. 'We need a vibrant press as part of a healthy democracy and the public deserve a choice of providers,' Mrs Fairhead said.","Rona Fiarhead gave first speech as chairman of BBC's governing body .

"The children of mothers who smoke and breastfeed are more likely to develop serious health problems as they grow up, scientists warned yesterday. Even a small period of exposure to nicotine in the first months of life raises the danger of illnesses such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, compared with those breastfed by non-smoking mothers. Last night, scientists demanded better information for new mothers on the long-term effects of nicotine exposure on their children’s health. The new research, which was carried out on rats, follows earlier studies on humans which suggested breastfeeding mothers who smoke may pass on long-term health risks to their babies. Scientists are demanding better information for new mothers after research revealed even a small amount of nicotine while breastfeeding can be harmful for baby . The rats were fitted with nicotine-producing implants to model the effect of smoking during breastfeeding. They nursed their offspring as normal and the health of the babies was monitored into adulthood. The babies grew up to develop problems such as obesity and underactive thyroid glands – hypothyroidism – while those raised by mothers without the nicotine implant remained healthy. Around 5,000 babies die in the womb or shortly after birth each year in Britain as a result of their mothers smoking during pregnancy. Yet one in four pregnant women smokes, despite warnings about the effects on their baby and widely available NHS services to help smokers quit. Children exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb are at greater risk of a range of health disorders and cot death, as well as later behavioural problems. The latest study looked at how nicotine exposure in the first months after birth affects cell and hormonal development. The research team, based at the State University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, found the nicotine exposure caused a reduction in thyroid hormone levels compared with the baby rats of non-smoking mothers. The study - which used rats - looked at nicotine exposure in the first months after birth affects cell and hormonal developmen . Sensitivity to the hormone leptin, which controls appetite and signals when it’s time to stop eating, was also lower in the infants of breastfeeding rats that were fitted with the nicotine implants. It is thought that smoking in human mothers could affect the health of children in the same way. Dr Patricia Lisboa, who led the study published in the Society for Endocrinology’s Journal of Endocrinology, said: ‘We have shown that even a small period of nicotine exposure during breastfeeding can permanently damage the future health of a child. ‘Future work on this project will investigate the addiction potential of nicotine and the neurological effects of smoking while breastfeeding on offspring.’ In the UK, warnings by doctors about the effects of smoking on the unborn baby were first made in 1971, while the first national no-smoking campaign was launched in 1974. But Dr Lisboa says it is vital that more advice is aimed at new mothers. She said breastfeeding mums in particular had to be told: ‘Smoking during breastfeeding can be as dangerous to offspring as smoking during pregnancy.’","Scientists say even a small amount of nicotine can affect baby for life .

"It is an astonishing animation, letting you travel through the solar system at the speed of light. Riding Light is a 45-minute short film that attempts to recreate what it would be like to hitch a ride on the back of a photon. The realtime video allows viewers to travel from the core of the sun to beyond the orbit of Jupiter. See the full video below . The realtime video allows viewers to travel from the core of the sun to beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Here, the journey begins on the sun's surface. As the journey progresses, users are shown stats about how far they have travelled - and when the next planet is coming up,. 'In our terrestrial view of things, the speed of light seems incredibly fast,' animator Alphonse Swinehart said. 'But as soon as you view it against the vast distances of the universe, it's unfortunately very slow. 'This animation illustrates, in realtime, the journey of a photon of light emitted from the sun and traveling across a portion of the solar system.' Although the video does not address how we would even perceive light and time if we were traveling at the same speed, it does use accurate distances and speeds to convey how big our solar system really is. 'I've taken liberties with certain things like the alignment of planets and asteroids, but overall I've kept the size and distances of all the objects as accurate as possible,' said Swinehart. The animation ends at Jupiter - to keep the film under an hour . 'I also decided to end the animation just past Jupiter as I wanted to keep the running length below an hour.' The upper left corner keeps track of distance traveled and time elapsed since you've been vomited from the sun's core and the upper right has a countdown to your next planetary encounter. Swinehart, a Los Angeles animator who has worked for everyone from Apple to the BBC, said he got the idea from a book. 'After nerding out on some astronomy books and documentaries, I wanted to illustrate how slow the speed of light is in relation to the vast size of the universe.

"A mental health trust where patients have been punished with a dangerous form of restraint faces being put into special measures. Inspectors found serious problems at the body that oversees mental health services in Norfolk and Suffolk. These included patients being held in the face-down prone position and being put in seclusion as a punishment. The prone position involves two or more staff holding a patient face-down on the floor and pinning down their arms, legs and torso. It can result in compression of the chest and airways and can be fatal. The Norvic Clinic - which is run by Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust - was singled out for its use of the 'prone' position in a report which found the trust 'inadequate' overall . Last April, Lib Dem care minister Norman Lamb announced controls banning its deliberate use on patients. The Norfolk and Suffolk Trust’s secure unit had been told to review its procedures after 38-year-old patient David Bennett died while being held in the prone position for almost 25 minutes in October 1998. A 2003 inquiry into the incident led by Sir John Blofeld found prone position restraints were ‘always dangerous’ and should never be used for more than three minutes. But a damning report into the trust released yesterday by the Care Quality Commission revealed prone restraints were not only still being carried out at the trust’s secure unit, they were being used as punishments. The report said: ‘Some patients told us that restraint and seclusion were used too frequently at the Norvic Clinic. ‘We were concerned about the high levels of face down (prone) restraint and that there was a punitive attitude towards patients. We observed that some episodes of restraint and seclusion may have been punitive. ‘While on the unit we saw that people who became violent were restrained and removed to the seclusion ward. Five people told us that they had been restrained and secluded following refusal to follow staff instructions. One person told us that if you do not sit correctly on the chairs you could end up being restrained and secluded.’ The Norfolk and Suffolk Trust’s secure unit was told to review its procedures after 38-year-old patient David Bennett died while being held in the prone position for almost 25 minutes in October 1998 . In its report, the CQC said it was unacceptable that patients who were secluded did not always have access to toilets and had to use a urine bottle or bedpan. Inspectors expressed concern that ‘high numbers’ of prone restraints being used at the trust’s acute and psychiatric intensive care wards, as well as its two centres for adults with learning difficulties. Nearly a third of all incidents where patients were restrained involved prone positions. The report stated: ‘We found there was not a safe, effective or responsive service at this trust and the board needs to take urgent action to address areas of inadequacy.’ It revealed there was a widespread problem with staffing shortages and a lack of training. The CQC suggested the trust’s problems were the fault of senior management, saying there was ‘a lack of leadership, support and awareness’ in some areas. But it praised frontline staff for being ‘kind and caring’ and rated the trust as ‘good’ in the care category. It was rated ‘inadequate’ overall however and the CQC has recommended to health services regulator Monitor that it go into special measures. In a statement, the trust said it accepted the findings and ‘vowed to put patients and staff first’ under a management team which had seen ‘extensive changes’. Deputy director of nursing Michele Allott said the trust was implementing Department of Health guidelines on restraint. She added: ‘The Norvic Clinic is a secure unit that looks after mentally disordered violent offenders deemed to pose a risk of serious harm to the public. ‘The guidelines are clear that there must be no planned restraint of a person in a prone position and we are reviewing and improving all of our training to help staff make better use of positive behavioural support, de-escalation and prevention strategies. ‘Restraint of a patient is only used as an absolute last resort where all other interventions have been exhausted.’","Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust rated 'inadequate' by watchdog .

"A touching video has shown the moment a two-year-old boy was reunited with his mother after she underwent three weeks of chemotherapy. Laura Martancik, a single mother from Hawaii, was first diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in July 2013 and went into remission for three months before the cancer returned in September. After the diagnosis, she moved to Connecticut with her son James to live with her sister while she underwent grueling treatment and a stem cell transplant at Yale Cancer Center. She recently stayed at hospital for three weeks and when she was reunited with her son, her sister caught their sweet embraces on camera. Joy: Laura Martancik opens her arms to her son James after arriving home from three weeks of chemo . A video of the moment they were reunited has been shared to Martancik's YouTube page. It shows her smiling as James runs and throws his arms around her before holding onto her tightly with a big grin for the camera. She then puts him on the ground and he backs up - before taking another running leap towards her as he giggles. They repeat their game several more times, with both mom and son reveling in the moment. 'What did I tell you?' Martancik tells the little boy. 'Mommy always comes back! I'm all back from the doctor.' Speaking to Today.com, she explained how she had undergone six days of nonstop 'gnarly, insane crazy chemo' after being admitted to the hospital on New Year's Eve. Reunited: Two-year-old James leaps into his mother's arms after she arrived at her sister's home . Happy: The youngster smiles as he holds on to his mother, who is fighting cancer for the second time . Touched: The mother and son repeat the game several times - as Martancik grins at James' reaction . The intense treatment prepared her body for the stem cell transplant, she said. For the entirety of her stay, all she could think about was her son. 'When you're sitting there alone, you feel like you're never going to make it and all you want to do is be home with your baby,' she said. Being reunited with him was 'the best feeling in the world', she said. She has now returned to the hospital and is undergoing tests, but she told Today.com she hopes that if other patients undergoing chemo see her video, they'll know that they'll make it through. 'It's really important to stay positive and to stay happy,' she said. 'People need to know you do make it out, you really do get to go home.' Together: Martancik, a single mother, and her son moved from Hawaii to Connecticut for her treatment . Fighter: Martancik, pictured after shaving her head, has been fighting Hodgkin's lymphoma since July 2013 and went into remission for three months before the cancer returned in last September . Now she is looking forward to returning back to Hawaii, she said. On Tuesday, one of her friends, Erica Bartol, wrote a blog post about sitting with Martancik as her hair was shaved off - and her joy when the task was finally completed. 'She continues to fight,' she wrote. 'And I believe she will. And she will get through this for her son James. And for herself. And when she’s back thriving in Hawaii I will come visit her and say, ""Remember when?""' Martancik has set up a gofundme page to continue to raise funds for her treatment.","Laura Martancik, a single mother battling Hodgkin's lymphoma for the second time, was reunited with her son James after the grueling treatment .

"Even by the sick standards of the Islamic State - whose fighters have tortured, beheaded, executed, crucified and stoned its victims - yesterday's brutal execution of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh plunged to new depths. The shocking video, released yesterday afternoon, shows the captured airman trapped in a cage, being engulfed by a trail of flames, in gruesome footage which sent shockwaves around the globe. And it appears the ISIS PR machine was well-aware of the stir the execution footage would cause, even before the disturbing images were circulated online. Scroll down for video . Horror: The video, which is ISIS' most sickening yet, begins by showing Moaz al-Kasasbeh being paraded in front of heavily armed men wearing combat fatigues and yellow masks . Brutal: The footage, which is titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight . Just ten minutes after the video was released, the jihadist group published a checklist of justifications, in a bid to encourage ISIS supporters to defend the barbaric actions. The post, uploaded onto pro-ISIS jihadi forum Al-Platform, offered guidance to ISIS sympathisers over what they should say if questioned about the merits of the brutal murder. In the post, entitled 'Moaz Was Burnt Alive, Below Is the Islamic Justification for Such an Act', it gives a list of apparent defences which it says might be in accordance with Islamic principles. It then concludes: 'This is what you should say if confronted about these actions.' In the sickening video, the pilot is seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is seen being set alight. Flames then quickly spread across the dirt to the cage, where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish. Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . ISIS PR machine was well-aware of the stir its chilling footage would cause, even before the gruesome images was circulated online . Extremists then pour debris, including broken masonry, over the cage, which is later flattened by a bulldozer. In the advisory post, it says people were 'going to ask themselves whether or not this is approved by religion', vocativ reports. But it then adds: 'Most scholars think nowadays it is fine to burn the victim.' The post does not provide any clear religious basis for the execution, but other forum members later commented on the post with their own selection of religious justifications. The pilot was captured in December by triumphant ISIS fighters when his F-16 jet crashed near the group's Syrian headquarters of Raqqa during a US-Coalition led airstrike . It is not the first time the militant group has published guidance for its followers on such sickening subject. In December, the group released what appears to be a pamphlet providing its followers with guidelines on how to capture, keep and sexually abuse female slaves. Among the most shocking rules were that it is 'permissible' to rape a female slave 'immediately after taking possession of her' and that it is 'permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse'.

"England risks being held to ransom by Scottish Nationalists unless Labour agrees to implement a system of ‘English votes for English laws’ at Westminster, William Hague said yesterday. The Leader of the Commons said Ed Miliband was refusing to back a veto for English MPs over legislation that applies only to their constituents, to keep open the possibility of a Labour-SNP coalition. The Conservatives said they planned to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given the Scottish Parliament will soon have control of all these issues. Leader of the House of Commons William Hague speaking at The Policy Exchange yesterday, where he proposed that English MPs would have a veto on English only issues . The reform would make it impossible for an incoming Labour government to press ahead with its plan to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England, for example, without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Mr Hague said it was a ‘simple matter of fairness’. But his blueprint prompted a furious response from Labour and the SNP – as well as some Right-wing Tories who want to go further and create an effective English Parliament. Former prime minister Gordon Brown claimed the proposals ‘put party before country’ and ‘risk the very survival of the UK’. He said governments had failed for 150 years to resolve the issue of ‘English votes’ while maintaining the ‘unity of the UK’. Mr Brown said the Tory plan ‘means only one thing: restricting the rights of Scottish MPs to vote in the House of Commons, even to the extent of excluding them under legislative consent motions from Budget votes on key tax issues. ‘And the Conservatives have acted with huge cynicism: it was the Conservatives who proposed devolving all Scottish income tax to the Scottish Parliament, and they have now made this the pretext for giving English MPs the power of veto on the annual Budget vote on income tax rates.’ Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown claimed Mr Hague's proposals ‘put party before country’ and ‘risk the very survival of the UK’ Stewart Hosie, SNP deputy leader and Treasury spokesman, condemned what he called a ‘shambolic and confused plan to stop Scottish MPs voting on parts of the entire UK budget’. Labour would also be reluctant to embrace a full-blown system of ‘English votes’ because it has traditionally relied on the votes of its Scottish MPs – currently 40 – to get legislation through when in government. Tuition fees and foundation hospitals were passed into law thanks to votes of Labour’s ‘tartan army’, though neither applies in Scotland. Polls suggest that since last year’s independence referendum, however, Labour support has collapsed in Scotland as voters switch to the SNP, which is hoping to win 20 or 30 MPs in May. Former Tory donor turned pollster Lord Ashcroft is today due to release the most detailed analysis to date of the SNP surge. Despite the anger of Labour and the SNP, some Conservative MPs insisted Mr Hague had not gone far enough. Mr Hague added Ed Miliband, pictured, was refusing to back a veto for English MPs over legislation that applies only to their constituents, to keep open the possibility of a Labour-SNP coalition . While he proposes a veto for MPs in England on issues that are decided north of the border by the Scottish Parliament, legislation would still require the ultimate approval of all UK MPs to pass. Former frontbencher David Davis said: ‘It has built into it a formula for another constitutional crisis.’ John Redwood, a former Cabinet minister, welcomed the proposed power for English MPs to block legislation only applying in their constituencies and not Scotland. But he said Scottish Nationalists or Scottish Labour MPs could still ‘all gang up and try to block an English proposal until we cave in on what they wanted’. Mr Hague said: ‘The Prime Minister and I have decided that the option we will put forward to Parliament and the country will be one that gives an effective veto to English MPs over matters only affecting England, or England and Wales, while maintaining the integrity of the United Kingdom Parliament. ‘We Conservatives believe that this principle of English consent, the English veto should be extended to taxation when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to Scotland – and under a Conservative Government it will be. ‘This is a fundamental matter of fairness. How could it possibly be right for the Scottish Parliament for example, to vote for a reduction in Air Passenger Duty in Scotland and then for Scottish MPs to come to Westminster and be able to impose an increase in Air Passenger Duty in England?’ He rejected the argument that reform will weaken the UK, insisting: ‘I say that failure to act would be the true weakening of the United Kingdom.’","William Hague wants to stop Scottish MPs from voting on English issues .

"Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, pictured, is the first doctor to go on trial for FGM in the UK . The first British doctor to stand trial accused of female genital mutilation has been made a ‘scapegoat’ for his hospital’s failings, it was claimed. Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, is accused of carrying out the potentially deadly procedure on a young mother after helping to deliver her first child at the Whittington Hospital in north London. But yesterday, Dharmasena’s defence team argued he had been ‘hung out to dry’ and should never have been put in the position he found himself in. His lawyer, Zoe Johnson QC, also questioned the Crown Prosecution Service’s decision to bring the case to trial. She said the woman, who is known only as AB, should have been identified before the birth as a victim of FGM, which the court heard she had first undergone in Somalia. This would have meant she was put on a special care ‘pathway’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases. But this opportunity was missed, so when she arrived at the hospital in labour in November 2012, Dharmasena had to cut through stitches so the baby could be born. He then claims he put a figure-of-eight stitch back in to stop the woman’s bleeding – but the court heard this procedure amounted to FGM. ‘If AB had followed the FGM pathway he would never have been in the situation he found himself in,’ Miss Johnson said. Closing her case after two weeks of evidence, she added: ‘We do suggest that Dr Dharmasena has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital and their failings. ‘There was a complete failure to pick up AB as someone who had suffered FGM. That failure by the midwife and hospital is at the root cause of all that has followed. ‘She should have been referred to a specialist FGM midwife. She was not. That was a serious failure. These are serious, systematic failings, none of which are Dr Dharmasena’s fault.’ The court heard that the woman had first undergone FGM when she was six years old. Her labia were cut and then stitched together, leaving her at risk of infection. She later married and in 2011, after moving to the UK, she had the procedure reversed and become pregnant. Zoe Johnson, defending, told the court her client 'has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital (pictured) and their failings' The prosecution claim Dharmasena was encouraged to replace her stitches by a second defendant, Hasan Mohamed, 41, who was acting as the woman’s translator. He is on trial alongside Dharmasena, accused of encouraging and assisting an offence. Earlier, prosecutor Kate Bex claimed the doctor – who was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the time – had bowed to pressure from Mohamed and carried out FGM by stitching the woman back up to her ‘pre-delivery state’. Making her closing speech to the jury yesterday, Miss Bex said: ‘The prosecution case is Dr Dharmasena, ordinarily a very good, caring and competent doctor, found himself in the position where Hasan Mohamed was interfering. ‘He kept coming over and insisting that AB’s anterior incision was repaired so as to put her back in the same situation she was in when she arrived. ‘Dr Dharmasena obeyed the patient’s wishes, but it was not clinically necessary or therefore connected with the labour and birth. ‘He did it the way he did because of Mr Mohamed’s insistence.’ However, Miss Johnson insisted her client was not a ‘quivering and trepidatious’ doctor who would give in to a patient’s demands, but an ‘honourable, honest and ethical man’. Dharmasena, of llford, Essex, was suspended from his job in March 2014. He pleaded not guilty to one count of carrying out FGM. Mohamed has denied aiding and abetting the procedure as well as an alternative count of encouraging and assisting the offence. The case continues.

"Fraud: Derek Snelling, pictured outside court today, withdrew up to £38,000 from bank accounts belonging to his late mother, Ellen, and used the money to go on a string of exotic holidays . A son has admitted to stealing more than £30,000 from his late 93-year-old mother after she accused him of taking the money in a police interview recorded before her death. Derek Snelling withdrew up to £38,000 from bank accounts belonging to his mother, Ellen, and used the money to go on a string of exotic holidays. He originally denied the fraud charges against him but changed his plea after watching the video of his mother on the second day of his trial at Exeter Crown Court. During the police interview, Mrs Snelling, who died just months after the police interview in 2013, said she wanted 'wring his bloomin' neck' after finding out what he had done. Snelling, from Hartland, Devon, stole his mother's money over a six year period between 2007 and 2013, prosecutor James Taghdissian told the court. The 67-year-old, who lived off a state pension and disability allowance, became the signatory on his mother's accounts in order to pay bills and withdraw her pension for her. His actions came to light when his own children became suspicious over him taking a string of holidays and a Caribbean cruise when he had  been declared bankrupt in 2005. Two of his daughters, Shelley Cornish and Glenda Pengilly, took their grandmother to her bank and discovered sums of money had been taken. They later found that Snelling had also taken money from accounts set up by Ellen Snelling for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren to pay off his overdraft . Snelling, who has moved to Wickford, Essex, since his arrest, denied four counts of fraud but changed his plea on the second day of his trial. He took between £30,000 and £38,000 from his mother and smaller amounts totalling less than £1,000 from his grandchildren. Mrs Snelling was interviewed by police in April 2013 and died in September the same year. In the taped interview, she said Snelling was 'paying all the bills for her and he had all her money and went to the Post Office to withdraw her pension'. The court heard she did not spend much money because of her age and allowed her son to handle her affairs. Mr Taghdissian said: 'He was spending large sums of money and living beyond his means.' He said there was no dispute that Snelling was responsible for the transactions and 'his children did not approve of him being the signatory'. Admission: Snelling originally denied the fraud charges against him but changed his plea after watching the video of his mother on the second day of his trial at Exeter Crown Court, pictured. He will be sentenced later . He said Snelling and his partner, now his wife, went on foreign holidays and a Caribbean cruise and 'the only way he was going to do it was by stealing his mother's money'. And the prosecutor said when he was no longer signatory on his mother's accounts her spending went down. Snelling said in police interviews that his mother's memory was poor and he said he had repaid money to her – and that holidays to Tunisia and Lanzarote had been paid by his wife. The court heard he admitted putting £4,000 of his mum's money into 'someone else's name' and told one of his daughters it would be his if she died. He produced two undated notes which claimed that his mother had given him £1,500 as a present and another saying she had consented to let him have her money. Mr Taghdissian said: 'He was using his mother's money as his own.' Snelling denied four charges of fraud but changed his plea after his mum had given her video evidence. John Dyer, defending, asked for the case to be adjourned so prosecution and defence could agree a figure for how much was stolen, which he said would be below £38,000. Snelling will be sentenced later.","Derek Snelling took up to £38,000 from late mother Ellen's bank accounts .

"Radical Muslim student David Souann, 20, who wanted the black flag of ISIS to fly over Downing Street has been jailed for three and a half years . A radical Muslim student who wanted the black flag of ISIS to fly over Downing Street has been jailed. David Souaan, 20, was found guilty of planning to join rebel forces in war-torn Syria following a trial at the Old Bailey in December. He had visited Syria in December 2013 and was on his way back to fight the jihadist cause when he was arrested at Heathrow Airport on May 31 last year, the court heard. The Birkbeck College student, who comes from a wealthy family in Serbia, denied the charge and insisted his earlier visit to Syria was to collect his grandfather's belongings. But after nine hours of deliberation, the jury convicted him of preparing for terrorist acts in Syria and he was jailed for three-and-a-half years by judge Peter Rook today. He will serve 13 months before being released on licence because he has been on remand for eight months. Sentencing Souaan to be detained in a young offenders institution, Judge Rook told him that his case was at the lower end of the scale but nevertheless serious. The judge told the student that due to his age and immaturity he had been 'vulnerable to extremist views' to which he was exposed after he left home for London. And he added that his praise for Islamic State came at a time before the organisation's true character was known. 'The jury rejected your evidence that you wished to go to Syria to assist with humanitarian aid,' he said. 'The prosecution is unable to say which terrorist group you were to fight for save it was against President Assad. 'It follows that fighting against the forces of Assad comes under the definition of terrorism, as does fighting for ISIS or ISIL. 'However in this case there is not the aggravating feature you were planning to fight against British or coalition forces. 'You were lonely, depressed, bored and isolated. You were highly susceptible to the malign influence of others.' Souaan (pictured) visited Syria in December 2013 and was on his way back to fight the jihadist cause when he was arrested at Heathrow Airport on May 31 last year . Judge Rook told the student (pictured in a video clip) that due to his age and immaturity he had been 'vulnerable to extremist views' to which he was exposed after he left home for London . The judge praised the actions of his mother Anica in trying to stop Souaan from going to Syria. He added: 'But for her intervention the sentence I have passed would have been longer.' Souaan, who faces being deported to Serbia as part of the foreign prisoner release scheme, blew kisses to his family sitting in the public gallery as he was led down to the cells. His trial had heard how the student, the son of a Serbian Christian mother and Syrian Muslim father, grew up in his mother's country but had close family ties to Syria and had adopted his father's religion. He came to the UK in 2013 on a three-year visa to study global politics and international relations at Birkbeck College in London, living in halls of residence in Malet Street. He was arrested after fellow students became concerned at his radical views on Islam and he showed off pictures of himself posing with guns. Classmates had described him as a 'nice, quiet, softly spoken young man' when he started studying global politics and international relations. Souaan was arrested after fellow students became concerned at his radical views on Islam and he showed off pictures of himself posing with guns . But he became more vocal in his religious beliefs after a trip to Syria in December 2013. On  January 3 last year he sent a Whatsapp message to a friend saying: 'Hello from Syria', which contained an image of Souaan sitting on part of a destroyed building. He also posed for pictures with members of the local Free Syrian Army forces which had control of the area around his grandfather's house in Deir az-Zor. A university friend said Souaan, who he had lived with  in  student halls, had talked about his friends dying in battle. 'He pulled out his phone and started showing me pictures', said the witness. 'He made the reference to these dead people being people he knew. They died in battle.' Souaan also boasted of taking one picture of the bodies himself, and had posed with weapons for other snaps. 'He said they were his friends and he said he was there when it happened', the witness added. 'He was involved in the activities, and he was quite pleased with his actions. 'He said he was part of the ongoing struggle that's out there in Syria in terms of liberation. 'He said that the people have been oppressed for a long time, they need to be liberated, and what's happening is wrong. 'He said there should be something for the people within the confines of Sharia Law and what the Koran teaches, not what the western world and anyone else thought. Souaan had claimed he had only posed for pictures with guns because he wanted to look 'cool' 'It should be a proper Islamic State.' By May 2014 Souaan was leafletting around London to try to persuade others to convert and even suggested that his brother come with him to Syria. He called people 'kaffir', meaning infidel or unbeliever, and became serious when anyone mentioned girls or alcohol. On 31 May last year he and his mother Anica were stopped by police as they were about to board a flight to Serbia. When police seized his laptop and phone they found pictures, videos and documents revealing his 'extremist sympathies' and that he had not only been fighting with rebels in Syria before, but was intending to return, the Old Bailey heard. A document found on Souaan's laptop, written in Serbian, was titled 'apology, Leader of Al Kaida' and referred to the Islamic State. The Birkbeck College student, who comes from a wealthy family in Serbia, denied the charge and insisted he had only visited Syria to collect his grandfather's belongings . It said: 'The State is not subservient to Al Kaida, not it ever was, it's more likely that if you enter Al Kaida Islamic state's territory it is your duty to give oath to the State.' Prosecutor Sarah Whitehouse QC said one video clip found on Souaan's phone was 'so graphic and so shocking' that it could not be played in court. It featured a young-looking man kneeling with his head held back as another man cut his throat. Mrs Whitehouse said: 'The victim was pushed face down in the mud where his last breaths can be heard. It cannot be said that Mr Souaan was present when that took place, it may have been downloaded from elsewhere.' Another clip, created on 20 December 2013, showed Souaan and four others walking through a derelict urban site carrying automatic weapons. The court heard that Souaan filmed himself attending a demonstration in the UK involving hate cleric Anjem Choudary. Souaan said he had been lobely in London, and had kept in contact by text with his Christian Serbian girlfriend, Ana Lazovic (pictured, who had gone to Miami in the US to study . Mrs Whitehouse said that a man - probably Souaan - could be heard in the background saying: 'The flag of Tawheed in London, all praise be to Allah the lord of the universe. She told the court: 'This is a reference to the fervent wish of Muslim extremists to see the tawheed - the black flag of Islam - one day flying in Downing Street.' In his defence, Souaan told jurors he had accompanied his father to his home town of Deir ez-Zor in Syria for two nights in December 2013. Miss Lazovic called Souaan by his pet name 'little panda' and he told her he loved his 'little sweetie' 'more than anything in the world' He said he went to help retrieve his 82-year-old grandfather's belongings after the older man had been forced to flee to Turkey with just the clothes on his back when his house was destroyed. The defendant thought it was 'pretty much safe' for them to travel unarmed and alone six or seven hours by road from the border to the town in Eastern Syria, the jury heard. He claims that he dressed in combat trousers and a black and white head scarf because his father told him they needed to 'blend in'. Souaan said none of the weapons belonged to him and claims he wanted the pictures as 'trophies'. 'It was my first time seeing a gun, a real, proper gun, and for me it was something new so then I just asked can I have a look,' he added. He posed for pictures with guns because he wanted to look 'cool', he said: 'At the time when I was there I felt something like I wanted some trophy - the photos. 'As the teenagers say nowadays, it looks ""cool"". So that was the reason.' Souaan, whose father made a fortune in the construction business in Serbia, insisted that, while he was in the town held by the Free Syrian Army, he never had a weapon. He said he had been 'lonely' in London after arriving for his first term of university on October 6 last year. He kept in contact by text with his Christian Serbian girlfriend, Ana Lazovic, who had gone to Miami in the US to study. She called him by his pet name 'little panda' and he told her he loved his 'little sweetie' 'more than anything in the world'.","David Souaan, 20, convicted of preparing for terrorist acts in Syria .

"Motel staff were shocked when a customer came into their lobby after being shot in the face. Employees at the Budget Lodge, north of central Phoenix, called for an ambulance around 10.20pm on Monday night, and the man was taken to hospital. The shooting victim was 'less than cooperative with suspect information' and is believed to have been attempting to purchase drugs when he was shot, Phoenix police told Daily Mail Online. A man shocked staff when he walked into a Budget Lodge (pictured) just north of central Phoenix with a gunshot wound on his face . The man was in critical condition when taken from the budget motel next to Interstate 17, but he is expected to survive. The shooting is thought to have taken place in a room at the motel, according to the Arizona Republic. The highway-side location had developed a reputation as a place for criminal activity before Monday's violent episode. A TripAdvisor reviewer who stayed in 2013 said: 'The people staying at the hotel are shady to say the least' and that he felt 'unsafe' in the accommodation. A 2011 post says that  hypodermic needles were found underneath a bed. Another review says that the lobby has a sign that 'pledges management will pay $100 for the reporting of drug dealing on the premises'.

"With a long-serving MP nicknamed the Beast of Bolsover, it should perhaps come as little surprise. But if the latest census survey is to be believed, the former mining town in Derbyshire is a hotbed of Satanism. The district has the highest concentration of Satanists in England and Wales, according to the countrywide survey, with 17 people out of a population of 75,866 residents claiming Satanism as their religion at the 2011 survey. Scroll down for video . The Derbyshire town of Bolsover (pictured) has the highest concentration of Satanists in England and Wales with 17 people out of a population of 75,866 residents claiming Satanism as their religion at the 2011 survey . Bolsover District Council has now urged caution when interpreting the census results for its district, which is on the edge of the Peak District and is home to Bolsover Castle (pictured) The figure gives Bolsover - represented by left-wing firebrand Labour MP Dennis Skinner, whose nickname comes from his outspoken and belligerent manner - a higher proportion of Satanists than Bristol, which topped the census table with 34 Satanists out of a population of 428,234. That means the number of Satanists in Bolsover works out as 0.02 per cent of the population, compared to 0.008 per cent of the population in Bristol. Bolsover District Council yesterday urged caution when interpreting the census results for its district, which is on the edge of the Peak District and home to Bolsover Castle. Ken Walker, chairman of the council, said he had not heard of Satanic activity in the area, adding: ‘There’s the usual traditional harvest festivals or flower festival, but that’s more or less a fundraising job for the churches. ‘I think it’s a load of rubbish.’ Bolsover district includes a number of outlying villages as well as the towns of Bolsover and Shirebrook . The Church of Satan also poured scorn on the figures, suggesting many people may have lied on their census forms because ‘they think it is funny’. The organisation was founded in the USA in 1966 as the first ‘above ground organisation’ dedicated to what it describes as man’s true nature of ‘carnal beast’. Priestess Serena Malone, administrator for the Church of Satan, said: ‘We tend to think someone is playing a prank here. ‘While we have many members throughout the UK, that area does not have any exceptional concentration of our adherents.’ Left-wing firebrand Labour MP Dennis Skinner (pictured), whose nickname the 'Beast of Bolsover' comes from his outspoken and belligerent manner . The Church of Satan said it does not give out statistics on where its members are based, because ‘many bigoted people still see us as some form of threat’. In the 1990s US shock-rocker Marilyn Manson became a card-carrying member of the church, while flamboyant pianist Liberace was said to be one of the church’s earliest devotees. It describes Satanists as ‘self-centered’ atheists who do not worship the devil but consider all morals and values as ‘subjective human constructions’. The Church says it does not believe in Satan as a being or person. However, Satanism is a broad term and many other people may identify themselves as Satanists. Derbyshire Constabulary said it was not aware of any incidents reported in Bolsover - or anywhere else - which could be connected to Satanism. A total of 1,893 people wrote Satanism as their religion in the 2011 census. County Durham, with 31 Satanists out of a population of 513,242, came second in the census Satanist survey. The religious question in the census was first introduced in 2001, as a voluntary option. Most people answered it even though they did not have to. In some other countries such as France, state questions about race, ethnicity or religion are not permitted. According to the 2011 census, England and Wales boasts 180,000 Jedi Knights - down from 390,000 people who described themselves as Jedi ten years earlier - and 60,000 Pagans. Bolsover, which was mentioned in the Domesday Book, is less well known as the birthplace of the ‘forgotten geographer’ Peter Fidler, the first person to map parts of Canada and the first to find coal there. Although its castle sits on a hill which was once home to a Norman castle, Bolsover Castle is actually a 17th Century mansion.","Derbyshire town of Bolsover has highest concentration of Satanists in UK .

"Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire has been put on the market - with a price tag that hopes to fetch more than £200million (about US$301million). The famous luxury hotel, which is known for its three golf courses and also hosted the prestigious Ryder Cup in 2014, boasts 232 bedrooms and 14 function rooms. It also includes Scotland's only two Michelin-starred restaurant, run by chef Andrew Fairlie. Scroll down for video . Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, has recently been put on the market for a staggering £200million by owners, Diageo . The Hotel is home to three famous golf courses, including the PGA course, and, last year, hosted the prestigious Ryder Cup tournament . The view from the PGA course's 8th hole is absolutely breathtaking, overlooking the rolling Perthshire hills . Gleneagles has been put on the market by owners Diageo, who have been operating the property since 1984. Back in 1998, the drinks company attempted to sell the sprawling hotel, which sits on its own 850-acre estate, but did not receive the amount they were hoping for, which was believed to be about £100m. It is understood that this time, there have already been several expressions of interest. But this time around, industry experts believe that the hotel could raise even more than its current £200m price tag. Especially following the notoriety that the hotel has gained from hosting last year's Ryder Cup, which attracted 250,000 fans from 96 countries. It's believed that property firm Jones Lang LaSalle are overseeing the sale. Gleneagles is also home to Scotland's only two Michelin star restaurant and houses 262 palatial guestrooms on its estate . For those who aren't at home on the green, the hotel also offers extensive spa facilities and well-appointed suites for relaxing in . Conveniently, the property is nearby to the train station, which exclusively services the hotel, on the Sterling to Perth line . Many of the suites' sitting areas offer unobstructed views of the rolling mountains and the picturesque countryside . The hotel sits on 850 acres in the middle of rolling Scottish hills, which offers plenty of space for activities from falconry to gundog school . A spokesman for Diageo told STV: 'Gleneagles is one of the UK's finest luxury hotels and one of the world's most fantastic golf resorts. 'We are sure there are many people who would love to own Gleneagles and have received numerous expressions of interest over the years, and particularly since the Ryder Cup. 'As you would expect, we have a duty to consider such interest carefully.' Although Diageo has attempted to sell the stunning property before - in 1998 - the drinks giant was unable to attract the £100m requested . The hotel, which boasts impressive gardens, originally opened in 1924, after being conceived of by Donald Matheson in 1910 . Viewing the sunset from the right ridge of the PGA Centenary Course's second hole casts incredible shadows across the fairway and green . The hotel originally opened in 1924. It was conceived by Donald Matheson, who was the then-general manager of the Caledonian Railway. Matheson was said to be so impressed by the breathtaking Perthshire countryside that he developed the idea of a palace-like hotel surrounded by golf courses. It's said that Matheson was so impressed with the countryside that he developed the idea of a palace-style hotel surrounded by golf courses . A good night's sleep is all but guaranteed in the hotel's stylish guestrooms, like this one, accented with subtle metallics and red pillows . For those who aren't at home on the green, the hotel also offers extensive spa facilities and alternative health and fitness programmes . Although there are many acclaimed restaurants to enjoy, guests can also dine in the comfort of their room - or terrace . For those who aren't avid golfers, the hotel has since added on extensive spa facilities and offer a wide range of alternative health and fitness specialists for guests to consult, as well as a range of activities, from falconry to wildlife photography. Adding to the property's worth is the nearby train station, which exclusively services the hotel on the Sterling to Perth line.

"The brutal treatment of sheep at a halal abattoir led to demands for a crackdown on slaughterhouses yesterday. Shocking undercover footage of workers ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats has provoked a public outcry. Last night, campaigners called for CCTV to be installed in all abattoirs to prevent similar cruelty, and a ban on the practice of killing animals without stunning them first, which is allowed for Jewish and Muslim producers. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The CCTV film at the Bowood Lamb abattoir near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, shows a clench-fisted worker manhandling a sheep. One worker has been sacked and three others suspended pending an enquiry . The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers. Pictured: A worker throws an animal onto the conveyors . The secret filming by Animal Aid took place in December at the Bowood Lamb abattoir near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, where sheep did not appear to be killed according to Islamic law. One worker has been sacked and three others suspended pending a Food Standards Agency investigation that could lead to prosecutions. The controversy has fuelled concerns that similar abuse could be going on across the country. All abattoirs must be approved by the FSA, but the regulatory body does not check whether halal meat is prepared according to religious rules. Many certify themselves as adhering to halal standards or are accredited by unofficial halal organisations. Halal rules state that animals must be killed with a single sweep of a surgically-sharp knife through the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe while a Muslim recites a prayer. They should not see the knife or witness the death of other animals. But the Animal Aid video shows many of these practices being flouted. Its secretly installed spy cameras showed staff laughing as a sheep bled to death after a worker allegedly drew spectacles around its eyes in green paint. They were filmed taunting animals, waving knives in front of them, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. More than 100,000 people have signed a British Veterinary Association petition demanding a ban on slaughtering animals without stunning them first – but the Government has refused to outlaw the practice. Philip Lymbery, chief executive of Compassion In World Farming, said: ‘I am shocked by the abhorrent cruelty to animals in the slaughterhouse in question. ‘Whilst I fully support Animal Aid’s call for mandatory CCTV, we need the Government to close the loophole and to ban slaughter without stunning.’ Fuseini Awal, of the independent Halal Food Authority, which monitors the halal meat trade, said of the Bowood abattoir: ‘What happened there has nothing to do with halal because the animals were abused well before they were slaughtered. Campaigners are now calling for CCTV cameras to be installed in all abattoirs to prevent similar cruelty . Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir are allegedly seen ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats . ‘It is to do with the lack of training of the operators and their appalling behaviour. The level of animal-welfare problems in our slaughterhouses is appalling. 'It is not restricted to one type of slaughterhouse or just to halal. It is across the board. Until CCTV becomes mandatory it will continue unabated.’ The abattoir was operating as normal yesterday. Owned by Northamptonshire farmers Robert Woodward, 67, and his son William, 29, the parent company Bowood Farms Ltd had a turnover of £29million in 2013. A spokesman said the abattoir was accredited with a halal organisation and insisted animal welfare was its ‘highest priority’, adding: ‘Everyone working for us knows and understands the standards we require.’ All abattoirs have an FSA vet on site. However, Animal Aid said secret filming at ten slaughterhouses over six years revealed cruelty and illegal actions in nine and proved officials were not doing an effective job. Animal Aid director Andrew Tyler said none of the filming showed any vets, and described the standard of supervision as ‘hopeless’. He said the staff allegedly caught mistreating sheep worked in ‘a killing factory’. In one horror killing at the abattoir, it appears that the men erupted into laughter as a sheep bled to death . Campaigners did not want to stir-up anti-Muslim feeling but felt withholding the footage would be a 'betrayal' A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain called for a national accreditation system for halal meat production. He added: ‘There are urgent questions this case raises. Since each abattoir is under veterinarian supervision, how were these practices overlooked? These revelations will undermine Muslim consumer trust.’ Ukip angered Jewish groups last night by backing plans to outlaw animal slaughter without stunning, which is necessary for meat to be kosher. The party said it would ‘not allow the demands of religions to override the UK’s compassionate traditions of animal welfare’. Jewish Chronicle editor Stephen Pollard said Ukip’s stance meant ‘Jews may not keep kosher and remain in the UK’.","Campaigners calling for CCTV to be installed in all abattoirs across the UK .

"New Roswell footage has emerged which claims to show the body of an alien being handled by American soldiers during the 1940s. New Zealand-based magazine, Uncensored, has done a frame-by-frame analysis and claims it proves 'there were aliens in Area 51'. But Philip Mantle, the UFO expert who was involved with the release of the original Roswell films, says these latest images are nothing but ‘utter b*******’. Scroll down for video . New footage has emerged which claims to show the body of an alien being handled by American soldiers in Roswell during the 1940s. New Zealand-based magazine, Uncensored, who says it found the footage, is adamant about its authenticity after doing a frame-by-frame analysis . It has since became apparent that the footage was taken from the film Alien Autopsy starring Ant and Dec, released back in 2006. According to Isaac Koi, who specialises in studying UFO film footage, the footage is the work of artist John Humphreys who has confirmed he made the alien being. But despite this, conspiracy forums have reignited theories that alien beings have visited Roswell, New Mexico in a secret army hanger dubbed Area 51. ‘UFO hunters think this might be part of a disinformation project to distract us from the real evidence,’ Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual told MailOnline. It has since became apparent that the footage was taken from the film Alien Autopsy starring Ant and Dec, released back in 2006. Pictured is a scene from the film . ‘Others think we are getting close to the day of full disclosure about the alien presence in our skies, and stories like this are being leaked out to get us accustomed to this idea.’ Roswell, New Mexico sprang to international fame on July 8, 1947, when the local newspaper reported the capture of a 'flying saucer' by government officials in the town. Over the decades since the discovery, conspiracy theorists have insisted that the debris came from an alien spacecraft, and that the fact was covered up by the military in their secret hanger, Area 51. The continuing belief of alien activity in the area led the Air Force to launch an investigation into the crash in 1995. Officials concluded that the 'UFO' was part of a balloon launched into the atmosphere as part of a secret government surveillance programme aimed at the USSR. However, many have refused to accept that explanation, alleging a conspiracy to hide the existence of extra-terrestrial life. Mexico sprang to international fame on July 8, 1947, when the local newspaper reported the capture of a 'flying saucer' by government officials in the town. Over the decades since the discovery, conspiracy theorists have insisted that the debris came from an alien spacecraft, and that the fact was covered up by the military. Due to public pressure, internal investigations were launched by the US General Accounting Office to disclose the truth. Their first report, in 1995, confirmed that the wreckage was of a Project Mogul balloon. In 1997, their second report looked at the rumours and stories about recovered alien bodies. This concluded that they were a combination of rumours, and half-forgotten memories of missions involving the recovery of injured pilots or anthropomorphic dummies. In 2011, Roswell hit the headlines again when a book by journalist Annie Jacobsen - Area 51: An Uncensored History of America's Top Secret Military Base - claimed that the aliens recovered from Roswell were actually genetically mutated 12-year-old children. This is the Iconic image of the alien autopsy footage said to have been carried out after an alien spacecraft crash in 1947. It was later discovered to be a fake . They were sent by the Soviet Union to the USA in a remotely piloted aircraft to promote hysteria in the American population. A similar theory was put forward by Nick Redfern, who claimed that the Roswell crash was caused by a balloon based on Japanese technology. ‘The balloon was used to launch a glider that had a pilot and crew consisting of handicapped people,’ said Mr Watson. ‘The object of this and other missions was to study the effects of radiation and high altitude on the human body.’ ‘Conspiracy theorists will no doubt claim this is part of the project to make us slowly become aware of, and accept, the aliens who have been visiting us since that crash in 1947.’","Footage is in fact from the 2006 film Alien Autopsy starring Ant and Dec .

"Homeowners in Clinton, Massachusetts managed to capture the shocking moment a hot air balloon downed power lines in their neighbourhood. The video begins with the balloon gliding dangerously close to the ground, looking as though it was aiming to land on a house roof. Locals reported that people on board were waving and taking photos, before the balloon crashed straight into power lines. An onlooker in Clinton, Massachusetts, filmed a hot air balloon flying dangerous close to some power lines . The shocking video shows how panic descends among people on the street as sparks fly and two separate explosions occur. ‘They’re going to hit those lines,’ videographer Jose Papaleo's voice off-screen is heard saying as he films the ordeal from a car park across the street. 'They're going to land on top of this guy’s house right here,' Papaleo adds seconds later. The cameraman immediately drops the camera as an explosion is heard and a flash of white light is seen. Once he regains his composure, the footage shows the balloon seemingly on fire, emitting a thick, black smoke. Unfortunately, the balloon got caught and caused a massive explosion nearby to neighbourhood homes . ‘What the f***?’ an off-screen observer yells. A police car immediately races to the scene, but not before another explosion erupts from the balloon caught in the downed lines. Locals reported injuries at the scene with some passengers suffering from burns. Others reported a car which was also damaged in the blast. The Federal Aviation Administration has since opened an investigation into the crash, which took place on a residential street.","Homeowners in Clinton, MA, shocked by massive powerline explosion .

"A study has found that the same amount of wealthy families shopped at budget chains like Aldi in the last three months as lower income families . Class and snobbery are no longer a barrier for middle-class families when it comes to shopping at budget stores. A study shows 45 per cent of wealthy households have stopped at Aldi or Lidl in the past three months – exactly the same percentage as for lower income families. While the budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, they have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings. Just this week, Aldi has unveiled some new additions to its ‘Specially Selected’ range including Ultimate Sirloin Steak, Scottish Lightly Smoked Salmon Fillets, gourmet Gorgonzola cheese and Chorizo. The survey of shopping habits was conducted by experts at the Wilson Drinks Report, which analyses where the nation is buying its wine. Managing director of the organisation, Tim Wilson, said: ‘In the past we might have expected a much higher proportion of C2DE shoppers to buy food and alcohol at the big discounters. However our new research confirms that the upper and middle classes are just as happy to grab a bargain. ‘Initiatives like the recent launch of premium French wine in Lidl, endorsed by a Master of Wine, only adds to the increasing credibility of the discounters in the minds of the shopper.’ He added: ‘We think that this provides real evidence that any perceived embarrassment of more middle and upper class shoppers being seen shopping at the discounters has now gone.’ Aldi said its ‘Specially Selected’ range of products are chosen based on a measure of outstanding quality, ingredients, provenance and recipe. Its Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘The launch of these new lines shows you can now buy your basic weekly shop at Aldi, but also premium food items, to really add a little bit of luxury to your everyday meals. Budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, but have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings . ‘This is particularly important at this time of the year when people are trying to beat the January blues. Shopping at Aldi enables customers to save money, while treating themselves to something extra special. ‘In the past three months, we have expanded our entire core range by 11per cent to match the wants and needs of our customers. We will continue to work towards delighting our customers with our range, and offering the best quality and price in the supermarket sector.’ The new larger range of products also includes Halloumi cheese, Long Sliced Smoked Salmon and Sweetened Soya Milk.","Budget chains made their name selling household essentials at low prices .

"The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium has been ordered to stop using cattle dogs in a way that causes 'behavioral stress' to its elephants. Australian cattle dogs have been used at the zoo to help handlers control elephants since 2012. And the zoo's president and CEO, Dr Barbara Baker, said since their introduction, neither the dogs, elephants nor keepers have been injured. However, following an inspection report last month, the zoo has been told by the federal government to immediately stop using the dogs in ways that upset the elephants. The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium has been ordered by the US federal government to stop using cattle dogs to cause 'behavioral stress' to its elephants (a dogs at the zoo with the elephants pictured above) Australian cattle dogs (herders Major and Zeta pictured at the zoo above) have been used to help handlers control elephants since 2012. The zoo's president and CEO, Dr Barbara Baker, said since their introduction, neither the dogs, elephants nor keepers have been injured . The January 7 report conducted by the US Department of Agriculture was released yesterday by animal rights group PETA, who complained about the practice last year. 'When elephants, dogs and human handlers freely mix, everyone is in danger,' said Delcianna Winders, a lawyer for PETA. Australian cattle dogs give staff an important safety buffer when dealing with the giant animals, according to the zoo. Officials from the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service visited the zoo on January 6 and watched an unnamed manager demonstrate how the dogs are used, according to the report. The manager called one dog to 'create a barrier between the husbandry staff and an elephant' which had reached its trunk through the enclosure bars. During the demonstration, the dog 'showed aggressive behavior, growling and lunging at one elephant' and entering its enclosure before being called back by the manager. A January 7 report conducted by the US Department of Agriculture was released yesterday by PETA, who complained about the practice last year. They have called on the zoo to use a 'safe' and 'modern' method . Baker said their method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method . The report also revealed the manager said the dogs had bitten the elephants during the course of their work. A television news clip from May verified by zoo officials also 'showed the elephants exhibiting signs of distress when charged by one of the dogs, including ear flapping, trumpeting, and turning and running away,' according to the report. Baker issued a statement defending the method, and said the dogs read the behavior of the animals, alert the keepers to any disruption in the herd preventing potential safety concerns for the staff and elephants. She said: 'This method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method.' The zoo defended its use of the dogs in a written statement and said the method has been scientifically proven and recognized by the USDA . The Pittsburgh Zoo (above file photo) must now control the elephants without causing them 'behavioral stress' and was ordered the change 'from this point forward' Baker also said that during the inspection, 'our elephant manager demonstrated a drill simulating the dog's response to a keeper being in an extreme and unlikely situation. We showed how valuable the dogs can be should a keeper's safety be in question.' The zoo must now control the elephants without causing them 'behavioral stress' and was ordered the change 'from this point forward.' PETA contend zoos should use barriers to separate handlers and elephants at all times and use only positive reinforcement to control elephants. Winders said: 'PETA is calling on the Pittsburgh Zoo to switch to safe and modern elephant-management method — or, better yet, to retire the elephants to an accredited sanctuary where they'll be free from harassment for the rest of their lives.' 'The introduction of the dogs has been a valuable tool as we continue to elevate the care and management of our elephant herd,' said Dr Barbara Baker, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Zoo. 'The safety of our keepers and animals is a top priority and we provide an additional safety level with the use of trained cattle dogs. 'The dogs read the behavior of the animals and alert the keepers to any disruption in the heard, preventing potential safety concerns for the staff and elephants. 'This method of animal management, in the livestock field, is referred to as a low-stress method. 'These methods, which have been scientifically proven and recognized by the USDA, ensure a calm and controlled interaction between an animal, the dogs, and keepers they work with.' During the recent USDA visit, upon direct request of the USDA inspector, our elephant manager demonstrated a drill simulating the dog's response to a keeper being in an extreme and unlikely situation. 'We showed how valuable the dogs can be should a keeper's safety be in question,' said Dr Baker. Since the arrival of the dogs in 2012, no keepers, elephants, or dogs have been injured. Also, the USDA has conducted six annual inspections, at the Zoo and International Conservation Center during that period, and found no non-compliant concerns. In cooperation with the USDA, the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium is in the process of developing a study that examines a variety of facets regarding the welfare of elephants, including a unique examination of stress. This research will provide additional information into understanding elephant biology and behavior. Source: Pittsburgh Post Gazette . Zoo officials have said they do not punish their elephants for not complying with human handlers and use only positive reinforcement to control their behavior. The Pittsburgh Zoo has begun working with the USDA on a study 'that examines a variety of facets regarding the welfare of elephants, including a unique examination of stress,' said Baker. The USDA noted that a sea lion at the aquarium had swollen corneas from too much chlorine in her water, and that a zoo veterinarian determined most 'marine mammals have had issues with corneal disease' likely caused by too much chlorine. The zoo was supposed to have addressed that issue by January 21, according to the report.","Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium given order following January 7 inspection report after USDA visited zoo .

"A federal jury ordered Toyota Motor Corp. to pay nearly $11 million to victims of a fatal Minnesota crash on Tuesday after ruling that a design flaw in the 1996 Camry was partially to blame for the 2006 wreck. The jury said the company was 60 percent to blame for the accident, which left three people dead and two seriously injured. But jurors also decided that Koua Fong Lee, who has long insisted he tried to slow his car before it slammed into another vehicle after he exited Interstate 94 in St. Paul, was 40 percent to blame. Blame: Koua Fong Lee (photographed) spent more than two years in prison after a fatal 2006 car crash killed three people, but a jury ruled on Tuesday that Lee was not solely to blame . Lee's attorneys insisted the crash was caused by an acceleration defect in his vehicle, but Toyota argued there was no design defect and that Lee was negligent. 'No amount of money will bring my life back, my life is not the same anymore,' Lee said outside the courthouse. When asked what he would say to the family of the people killed in the crash, he said: 'I want them to know that I tried everything I could to stop my car... I want them to know.' After the 2006 wreck, Lee was charged and convicted of vehicular homicide, and sentenced to prison. But he won a new trial after reports surfaced about sudden acceleration in some Toyotas, and questions were raised about the adequacy of his defense. Freedom: Lee was convicted of vehicular homicide and sentenced to prison but was released after reports surfaced about possible defects in the vehicle . Camry: Attorneys at the trial said Lee's Camry's auto-drive assembly could stick, and when tapped or pushed while stuck, it could stick again at a higher speed . Reliability: Toyota was accused of never conducting reliability tests on nylon resin pulleys that could be damaged under heat and cause the throttle to stick . Prosecutors opted against a retrial and he went free after spending 2 ½ years behind bars. Lee and his relatives, along with other people who were injured or lost loved ones in the crash, later sued Toyota in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis. Jurors started deliberating the afternoon of Jan. 28, and the verdict was announced late Tuesday afternoon. During the trial, Lee's attorney, Robert Hilliard, told jurors that there was a defect in the car's design. He said the Camry's auto-drive assembly could stick, and when tapped or pushed while stuck, it could stick again at a higher speed. Lawsuit: Lee and his relatives, along with other people who were injured or lost loved ones in the crash, later sued Toyota in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis . Negligent: Toyota said there was no defect in the design of the 1996 Camry, and that Lee was negligent . Hilliard also accused Toyota of never conducting reliability tests on nylon resin pulleys that could be damaged under heat and cause the throttle to stick. 'This is what makes the car go. This is what turns it into a torpedo, a missile, a deadly weapon,' Hilliard said during his closing argument. Toyota said there was no defect in the design of the 1996 Camry, and that Lee was negligent. The company's attorney, David Graves, suggested that Lee was an inexperienced driver and mistook the gas pedal for the brake, and that's why the car accelerated. Toyota also noted that Lee's car was never subject to the recalls of later-model Toyotas. Family: The Trice-Adams family (photographed) were the other plaintiffs in the case, the crash killed a father and son in the family as well as a six-year-old . Jurors were asked to decide whether there was a defect in the design of the 1996 Camry that was unreasonably dangerous, and if so, whether that defect caused the plaintiffs' injuries. The crash killed the driver of the other vehicle, Javis Trice-Adams Sr., and his 9-year-old son, Javis Adams Jr. His 6-year-old niece, Devyn Bolton, was paralyzed and died in October 2007. Trice-Adams' daughter, Jassmine Adams, who was 12 at the time, was seriously injured, as was Trice-Adams' father, Quincy Ray Adams. Those two and Devyn Bolton's mother, Bridgette Trice, were the other plaintiffs in the case.","A federal jury ordered Toyota Motor Corp. to pay nearly $11 million to victims of a fatal Minnesota crash on Tuesday .

"A California man has stolen the crown of husband of the year, by surprising his wife with a birthday trip to London. And as a reminder of the occasion, the cheeky husband, from Upland, in San Bernardino County, recorded his wife's reaction to the gift. 'My wife wasn't able to travel much growing up,' he wrote online. 'She had always wanted to go to Europe, especially London, and we had always talked about going someday.' In this sweet video, a woman from Upland, California, receives the ultimate birthday surprise from husband . Unbeknownst to his wife, her loving husband had began saving money for the trip of her dreams. 'I wanted to deliver the surprise to her in a really exciting way,' he explained. 'She was already so excited to go to Santa Barbara for her birthday weekend that the thought of going to Europe would be totally off her radar.' 'She told me not to get her anything else for her birthday, but I got her a few 'small' presents anyway.' The woman had wanted to visit London for many years, so her husband made her a travel scrapbook . After flipping through pages of iconic London imagery, his wife unfolded her real gift: airline tickets! The video starts out inconspicuously enough, with him presenting his wife with a wrapped gift, telling her to open it in front of him. 'The first one she opened was a dress that she wanted and the second one was the scrapbook,' he wrote later. 'It's just something in case we travel,' her husband explains off camera, as his wife pulls the large travel photo album out of the gift bag. At first, she was too shocked to believe it, but as it sunk in, she began to cry tears of joy . Her husband had booked the entire two-week getaway unbeknownst to her - including accommodations . As she flips through, she notices that every picture slot is filled with iconic London imagery. 'Just in case we ever go to London, so I decided to fill it with stuff,' her husband explains. 'I decided to sort of play off of our 'dream' of going to Europe some day by filling the book with pictures of our 'would be' trip, since we talk about it so often,' he wrote online after the fact. Later, her husband explained the video online, saying that his wife had never really travelled as a child . She had long wanted to go to England and the two had often talked about their 'would be' European trip . And when she gets to the final page of photographs, she finds an airline ticket sticking out. 'I knew she wouldn't expect there to be actual tickets included - that's why it takes a moment for it to sink in.' His shocked wife questions at first whether or not they are really going, before beginning to tear up and bury her face in her hands. As she wipes away tears, her husband tells her that the photos are actually of where they will be staying . 'Oh my gosh,' the woman exclaims, once she's able to regain her composure. 'I have to get a passport!' 'I've always wanted to go!' she says through her tears. And just when she didn't think the news could get better, her husband revealed that the images of London that he had filled the book with her actually photographs of the flat that they will be staying in. 'Oh my gosh, I have to get a passport!' she exclaims.","Woman from Upland, CA, surprised by husband with dream birthday gift .

"Eternal youth could be one step closer following the successful transformation of old human cells into young ones. The process increases the length of the 'telomeres', which are the protective caps on the end of chromosomes that impact ageing and disease. Researchers in the US say the technique could extend human life and provide new hope for battling diseases that arise from old age. Scroll down for video . Telomeres (artist's impression pictured) are the caps on the ends of the strands of DNA called chromosomes, which house our genomes. The process increases the length of the 'telomeres' to keep cells healthy . Telomeres - often described as being like the plastic caps on the end of shoelaces – help keep DNA healthy. These protective end caps become shorter with each DNA replication, and eventually are no longer able to protect DNA from sustaining damage and mutations, causing people to age. In young people, telomeres are about 8,000-10,000 organic molecules, or nucleotides, long. 'Now we have found a way to lengthen human telomeres by as much as 1,000 nucleotides, turning back the internal clock in these cells by the equivalent of many years of human life,' said Helen Blau of Stanford University. The breakthrough could allow scientists to generate large numbers of cells that could create to an effective anti-aging drug and help keep older people active . To make the discovery, researchers used modified messenger RNA to extend the telomeres. Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of the strands of DNA called chromosomes, which house our genomes. In young humans, telomeres are about 8,000-10,000 nucleotides long. They shorten with each cell division, however, and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies. This internal 'clock' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings. RNA carries instructions from genes in the DNA to the cell's protein-making factories. The RNA used in this experiment contained the coding sequence for TERT - the active component of a naturally occurring enzyme called telomerase. When the cells are treated, they behave as if they are younger and multiply quickly rather than dying. 'One day it may be possible to target muscle stem cells in a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for example, to extend their telomeres,' said Dr Blau. 'There are also implications for treating conditions of aging, such as diabetes and heart disease. 'This has really opened the doors to consider all types of potential uses of this therapy.' The researchers also hope that the method will be able to allow scientists to generate large numbers of cells that could someday lead to an effective anti-aging drug.","Stanford University has found a way to increase the length of telomeres .

"Iain Duncan Smith will say government reforms led to almost £50billion of savings in a speech today . Britain's benefits system is growing at the slowest rate since the inception of the welfare state, Iain Duncan Smith will say today. The Work and Pensions Secretary will point to almost £50billion of savings for the taxpayer thanks to government reforms. He will hail a ‘momentous reversal of Labour’s reckless spending’ and claim that the lives of hundreds of thousands of people have been ‘transformed’ by pushing them into work. Despite Labour’s claim that austerity measures would cost a million jobs, there are 1.75million more people in work, and 700,000 fewer people in workless households, he will say. Mr Duncan Smith will attack the ‘accepted wisdom of the Left: that poverty is solely about money, and more state money solves it’. The Work and Pensions Secretary’s intervention comes as the election battleground moves on to welfare and with Labour’s work and pensions spokesman today accusing the Tories of failing on the issue. Rachel Reeves will claim the stagnation of wages over much of this parliament has meant more people in work becoming reliant on the state. She will say that by 2020, the number of working people depending on housing benefit to meet the costs of their home will have more than doubled, at a cost of over £14billion. Former Labour work and pensions secretary David Blunkett is expected to unveil his own proposals for welfare reform, including curbs on benefits paid to better-off pensioners. But Mr Duncan Smith, speaking at the free market think-tank Reform, will attack Labour for opposing every one of the Government’s measures to cut the welfare bill. Labour allowed welfare bills to ‘spiral out of control’, having rocketed by 60 per cent in real terms, he will say. ‘Now, welfare spending is under control, seeing the first real terms fall for 16 years. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the cost of welfare next year will be nearly £17billion lower thanks to our reforms.’ Controversial measures introduced by the Coalition include freezes on uprating of benefits, tax credits and public sector pensions to the less generous CPI measure of inflation, the removal of child benefit from better-off families and a £26,000 household benefit cap. Mr Duncan Smith’s analysis suggests £50billion will have been saved cumulatively over the course of this parliament, from 2010 to 2015. ‘We had to get spending under control – for under the last Government, welfare expenditure had increased on a trajectory that was entirely unsustainable by 2010, costing every household in Britain an extra £3,000 a year,’ Mr Duncan Smith will say. ‘Yet it was not enough simply to top-slice the budget. To do so would be equally unsustainable in the long-term, for problems would simply accumulate further down the line or emerge elsewhere – with consequences for the health system, the justice system and more. ‘Rather in its true sense, welfare reform is about transforming the life chances and outcomes of those on benefits – bringing down the cost of social failure in the process.’ The Government’s reforms have been designed so the state is ‘no longer just putting money in, maintaining people in dependency’, but tying spending to improved outcomes. Back-to-work providers are paid by results, depending on how long someone moving from benefits into a job keeps it. And the new universal credit, which is gradually replacing all the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits, is designed to bring about ‘a complete shift in the welfare culture’. It ensures it always pays for people to move into a job and take more hours, while allowing the state to place new requirements on claimants. Labour's Rachel Reeves will claim the stagnation of wages over much of this parliament has meant more people in work becoming reliant on the state . ‘Gone are the days when it makes more sense to sit on benefits than enter work,’ Mr Duncan Smith will say. A welfare system that ‘can catch you when you fall, lift you when you can rise’ is the ‘strongest statement yet of this Government’s commitment to helping people get on’, he will argue. Despite the progress, Mr Duncan Smith will warn that the ‘disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been’. ‘We have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom,’ he will say. ‘Yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life. I believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well.’ Mr Duncan Smith will urge the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘social enterprises’ in deprived neighbourhoods. Miss Reeves is expected to say: ‘The Government’s failure to make work pay has meant they are struggling to keep social security spending under control. ‘Last week the IFS confirmed that, for all David Cameron and George Osborne’s rhetoric, social security spending will be no lower next year than it was when David Cameron took office.’","Iain Duncan Smith will say that government reforms led to £50bn savings .

"The hotel maid who accused then IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault four years ago - a sensational case that left his career in tatters - is now running a New York restaurant. The six-minute encounter in May 2011 between Nafissatou Diallo and one of the world's most powerful men led to his resignation from the International Monetary Fund, ultimately ended his marriage and shattered his dreams of becoming French president. Terms of the confidential settlement of Diallo's civil suit against Strauss-Kahn have never been disclosed, although France's Journal de Dimanche newspaper reported in January 2013 that the figure reached was $1,440,000. Nafissatou Diallo recently moved back to her old neighborhood in the Bronx, where she runs Chez Amina - which is serving up African, American and Spanish food . The six-minute encounter in May 2011 between Nafissatou Diallo, left, and Strauss-Kahn led to his resignation from the IMF, ultimately ended his marriage and shattered his dreams of becoming French president . Diallo initially went to ground but recently moved back to her old neighborhood in the Bronx, where she runs Chez Amina - which is serving up African, American and Spanish food. The restaurant, next to a mosque and opposite a Pentecostal church, opened in May and operates daily from 5:00 am to 3:00 am, though it was briefly closed on Tuesday - apparently because of the many journalists dropping by. But late on Monday, a smiling Diallo - dressed in jeans, a blue shirt and multi-colored headscarf - was there to welcome customers in from the cold for plates of burgers, rice dishes or take-away. 'The best cuisine in New York,' says the menu. But Diallo herself quickly clammed up in front of a journalist. 'I don't speak French,' said the immigrant from French-speaking Guinea. She then politely refused to answer questions in English and retreated behind the counter. The restaurant, next to a mosque and opposite a Pentecostal church, opened in May and operates daily from 5:00 am to 3:00 am . Diallo is reported to have secured a $1.4 million settlement in her civil suit against Strauss-Kahn . The restaurant is furnished with red faux leather banquettes and TV screens screwed to the wall, with closed-circuit cameras providing security. Diallo has not given an interview since the incident, but some of her customers seemed to know who she is. 'It's that woman,' said a French-speaking African client in his 40s, who refused to give his name, before exiting with his take-out meal. 'A friend recommended the restaurant to me, it seems very good,' he added. Her former lawyer Douglas Wigdor says Diallo and her daughter are doing well. He told French radio RTL this week that while she may have more money than ever before, she would have preferred to have stayed a chambermaid and that nothing had happened. Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn of jumping on her naked and forcing her to perform oral sex, but New York prosecutors dropped the charges because they said they doubted her credibility. Strauss-Kahn admitted a sexual encounter took place in the Sofitel hotel in May 2011 but insisted it was consensual. Strauss-Kahn went on trial in France on Monday accused of pimping as part of a prostitution ring. He risks spending up to 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $1.7 million if convicted.

"Actress and UN Special Envoy Angelina Jolie is leading a worldwide campaign against female genital mutilation . Ignorance surrounding the life-threatening practice of female genital mutilation is 'worryingly high', a leading charity has warned today. More than one in three people (35 per cent) in the UK do not understand the term, a survey commissioned by Plan UK has revealed. The illegal practice, which can result in death, has attracted growing media attention in recent years, with Hollywood A-lister and UN Special Envoy Angelina Jolie leading the campaign to wipe it out. But despite the widespread coverage, the survey findings show 'ignorance of FGM remains worryingly high'. A quarter of the 2,208 adults questioned said they knew of the term but did not fully understand what it means, while another one in 10 said they had never heard of FGM at all. Plan UK chief executive, Tanya Barron said: 'It's clear that while a third of the public remain unaware or even oblivious to this practice, girls remain at risk, both here in the UK and overseas. 'Tireless campaigning by a small group of people has put FGM firmly on the agenda in the UK. This research shows that we must continue to build on that progress. 'And we must remember that this is a global problem that requires a global effort; ending FGM here in the UK means ending it in the countries across the world in which it is prevalent.' Plan UK runs the Because I Am A Girl campaign, which works with countries across the world to bring an end to FGM. The YouGov survey was designed to assess the British public's knowledge of the practice, which involves the full or partial removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. When those surveyed read what FGM amounted to, almost nine in 10 (87 per cent) agreed it was a human rights violation. 'Recognising that FGM is a fundamental abuse of girls' rights is the first step to ending the practice,' said Ms Barron. Plan UK estimates three million girls and young women in Africa are at risk of the life-threatening female circumcision each year, with around 65,000 girls in the UK at risk (file picture posed by a model) Female genital mutilation, also known as female circumcision, is the practice of partially or totally removing the external genitalia of girls and young women for non-medical reasons. It commonly leads to infection, infertility and even death. The practice is commonly carried out between infancy and the age of 15. FGM causes 'untold physical and emotional trauma'. Around three million girls in Africa and 20,000 in the UK are at risk of FGM each year, Plan UK estimates. In countries that openly practise FGM,the incidence can be very high - such as in Egypt (91 per cent) and Somalia (97 per cent - despite it recently declaring FGM illegal). Source: Plan UK . 'And we know from our programmes in countries such as Mali and Egypt that slowly but surely this recognition, along with education about the significant health risks, can bring down prevalence of FGM.' Young people in the UK showed the lowest levels of understanding of FGM. Almost one in five (19 per cent) of those aged 18 to 24 said they had never heard of it, while nearly a quarter (24 per cent) said they had heard the term but did not understand it. Ms Barron said young people are central to tackling FGM. She said: 'Young people are absolutely critical to the success of the global campaign to end FGM. It is their generation that can break the cycle.' Madina Bocoum Daff, Plan's FGM programme manager in Mali, said: 'The world is now a ""big village"", everything is linked. 'An international approach is indispensable to eradicate this scourge. 'More and more in Mali, FGM is considered an act of violence for girls and women. 'And people are starting to see this violence as a violation of children's rights.' More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to FGM, according to the World Health Organisation. The practice can lead to infection, infertility and in some cases death. The findings come as the trial of NHS doctor Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, accused of carrying out FGM in the first prosecution of its kind in the UK, continues. He denies the charge.","Charity Plan UK said survey reveals ignorance of female circumcision is 'worryingly high' with more than a third of people unsure what it means .

"York scientists say the largest rodent ever (artist's impression shown) had giant incisors that it used like elephant tusks, based on skull analysis . The largest rodent ever to have lived may have used its front teeth just like an elephant uses its tusks, according to a new study. The rodent would have been the size of a buffalo, with the largest incisors of any rodent ever known to have existed. Josephoartigasia monesi, a rodent closely related to guinea pigs, lived in South America approximately three million years ago. It is the largest fossil rodent ever found, with an estimated body mass of 2,200lbs (1,000kg), and it was similar in size to a buffalo. The study was led by scientists at the University of York and The Hull York Medical School. Dr Philip Cox, of the Centre for Anatomical and Human Sciences, a joint research centre of the University's Department of Archaeology and HYMS, used computer modelling to estimate how powerful the bite of Josephoartigasia could be - comparable to that of a tiger. Speaking to MailOnline, he said the only fossil they have is a skull that is around 20 inches (50cm) in length - which makes it the largest rodent ever. But using it was enough to work out how large and powerful the teeth of the rodent would have been. ‘Like all rodents it had just a single pair of incisors in the upper and lower jaw, and these are large curved structures that grow throughout life,’ he said. ‘Like most rodents it was herbivorous, and the environment it lived in was something like an estuary or water land, at the margins of water, eating maybe aquatic plant material or something.’ He thinks the incisors  were likely used either to dig into the ground to get at roots to eat, or to defend the animal. The entire circular length of the incisors was likely about 10 inches (25cm), with only a small part of that actually protruding from the mouth. The rest pushed back into the skull. Josephoartigasia monesi, a rodent closely related to guinea pigs, lived in South America approximately three million years ago. It is the largest fossil rodent ever found, with an estimated body mass of 2,200lbs (1,000kg), and was similar in size to a buffalo (shown in this comparison) Dr Philip Cox, of the Centre for Anatomical and Human Sciences, a joint research centre of the University's Department of Archaeology and HYMS, used computer modelling to estimate how powerful the bite of Josephoartigasia could be from a limited skull of the animal . Dr Cox found that, although the bite forces were very large - around 1,400 Newtons, similar to that of a tiger - the incisors would have been able to withstand almost three times that force, based on earlier estimates by a team who first described the fossil in 2008. This could have been a 'safety' measure to survive some of the rodent's more strenuous tasks. He said in a separate statement: 'We concluded that Josephoartigasia must have used its incisors for activities other than biting, such as digging in the ground for food, or defending itself from predators. 'This is very similar to how a modern day elephant uses its tusks.' The research, which is published in the Journal of Anatomy, involved CT scanning the Josephoartigasia monesi specimen and making a virtual reconstruction of its skull. This was then subjected to finite element analysis, an engineering technique that predicts stress and strain in a complex geometric object. Dr Cox found that, although the bite forces were very large - around 1,400 Newtons, similar to that of a tiger - the incisors would have been able to withstand almost three times that force, based on earlier estimates by a team who first described the fossil of the skull (shown) in 2008 .","York scientists say the largest rodent ever had giant incisors .
Based on analysis of a skull fossil, they are thought to have been used like elephant tusks to dig and for self-defence .
The animal was the size of a buffalo and had the bite power of a tiger .

Josephoartigasia monesi, which lived three million years ago, was herbivorous - so the incisors were not used to eat other animals ."

Secret exposed: During last night's episode, Bruno Bettencourt, 24, called Violetta (pictured) 'ugly and anorexic' during a volatile fight in their shared Chicago loft . She explained that her family didn't even know about her struggles before the episode aired. She also added that she had been 'doing really well' before the show. 'Coming into the house, my eating disorder wasn't a problem,' she said. 'But after being there for so long, and just going through the stress of it, it just became so overwhelming, and I started to lose faith in who I was.' She continued: 'With me, it's a control thing. The reason I do it is because something is happening in my life that I can't control. And I need that feeling of control. But I didn't voluntarily bring this up in the house.' In the beginning of the episode, Violetta's other roommates privately shared their concerns about her weight loss. After her confrontation with Bruno, she admitted that she isn't happy until her rib cage is showing. 'I think everyone in the house kind of had an idea already,' she told Cosmopolitan. 'I mean, it's pretty obvious if you're binging and purging between meals when you're living with people full-time.'

"The average price of a house in central London is now more than £1.6million, as the capital’s property boom shows no sign of slowing. House prices in fashionable Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster - dubbed 'prime London' by estate agents - soared by 11.29 per cent over the last 12 months, with the number of sales up 20 per cent to the highest number since 2007, just before the financial crash. Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to Land Registry figures released today. The average price in Greater London hit £533,489 between April and June – up 12 per cent on the same time last year. Scroll down for video . House prices in London continue to pull away from the rest of the country, with properties in the capital now costing more than half a million pounds on average - double the price of homes across England and Wales . The cost of a home in London is now double that in the rest of the country, the latest figures show. In England and Wales the average house price reached £256,883 by June – up 5.9 per cent over the same time last year. London's booming house prices  - while making it harder for first time buyers to get on the property ladder - also risk accelerating the wealth divide between those living in the capital and those outside. Anyone lucky enough to have bought a property in 'prime London' a year ago will have seen £166,216 added to the value of their property on average, according to the Land Registry figures. Homes in central London cost an average of £1.47million last year - but have risen to £1.64million this year. In contrast, families across the capital as a whole saw their homes jump £57,160 in value over the past year - from £476,000 to £533,000. In the rest of the country meanwhile, the average house price increase was just £14,312. While the cost of buying a house is falling behind the capital, the number of sales has boomed across the country. Transactions across the whole country at their highest level since 2007, with 848,767 sales over the last year - up 30.93% in a year. Naomi Heaton, of the firm London Central Property, said the growth in house prices should be matched by a hike in stamp duty thresholds. Stamp duty jumps from one per cent to three per cent on houses above £250,000 – which is now below the average in the UK. Ms Heaton said increasing the threshold would ‘crucially help open up the market to first time buyers, for whom finding an additional £5,000 of stamp duty may make it impossible to save up for their deposit’. Property prices in central London - home to many of the world's wealthiest tycoons - have soared by 11 per cent over the last year . Today's figures, suggesting that accelerating prices are refusing to slow, comes after experts this week warned of a crash next year. A survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors indicated that the numbers of houses on the market now exceeds the number of buyers. Prices are likely to rise for a further 12 months, the RICS expects said. But they expect prices to fall after that. House prices rise twice as fast under Conservative governments than under Labour, a new survey has revealed. Since 1970, Tory Prime Ministers in Downing Street have overseen a boom in house prices of 19 per cent a year on average. This compares to 10 per cent during Labour’s 18 years in power. Labour’s 10 per cent a year growth is buoyed almost entirely by Tony Blair - who saw prices rise by 21 per cent each year during his ten year term. Margaret Thatcher in comparison oversaw property price rises of 22 per cent a year during her 11 years in power, according to research by the estate agents emoov.co.uk. When elected in 1979 the average house price in the UK was £17,793. When she left office in 1990 the average home cost £61,495. House prices soared by more than 30 per cent every year under Edward Heath, before Harold Wilson and James Callaghan took over for Labour. Prices boomed again under Margaret Thatcher and then Tony Blair .","House prices in 'Prime London' soared by 11% over the last 12 months .

"It was teeth poking through the mud that caught an amateur fossil hunter’s attention. The sight led Jonathan Stewart to discover the remains of a prehistoric rhino on a Norfolk beach, after the cliffs were eroded by stormy weather. He came across the two rows of teeth at the foot of the cliffs at West Runton beach, which are thought to belong to a species of rhino that roamed the area around 700,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . Teeth poking through the mud (pictured) caught an amateur fossil hunter’s attention and he discovered  the remains of a prehistoric rhino, including two rows of teeth, some eroded parts of the skull or jaws, and bone that could be from the ribs . Mr Stewart called in local geologist Martin Evans to save the remains before they could be washed away, because he was due to catch a flight the following morning. Mr Evans spent a day carefully removing the fossil by covering the exposed area with plaster of Paris before cutting around it. The remains, which were uncovered last week, date from the Cromerian interglacial period - some 700,000 years ago. The period is named after Cromer, in Norfolk. Jonathan Stewart (pictured left) discovered the remains of a prehistoric rhino on a Norfolk beach, after the cliffs were eroded by stormy weather. Local geologist Martin Evans stepped in to carefully remove the remains (pictured right) which were at risk of being washed away . Experts are working to determine which species of rhino the bones come from, but Mr Evans thinks they are likely from to the Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis. A mounted skeleton of the ancient species is shown . Stephanorhinus is an extinct genus of rhinoceros native to northern Eurasia that lived during the Lower to Early Late Pleistocene epoch. An expert estimates the remains found in Norfolk are around 700,000 years old. The prehistoric rhino had two horns and weighed over 6,613lbs (3,000kg). It measured around seven ft (two metres) tall and 13 ft (four metres) long - a similar size to a white rhino. There were two species of Stephanorhinus living in Eurasia at the time, but the remains are thought to belong to the species with a narrower nose. Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis was an unspecialised animal evolved for  browsing rather than grazing, while Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis, with its wider nose, preferred forest and woodland habitats. They include two rows of teeth, some eroded parts of the skull or jaws, and bone that could be from the ribs. Experts are working to determine exactly which species of ancient rhino the bones come from, but Mr Evans thinks they are likely from to the Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis species. He said: ‘They ranged across Europe and were adapted more for browsing rather than for grazing.’ One of the most complete skeletons of a mammoth ever found was uncovered on the same area of beach in 1990. ‘Anything found in the West Runton Freshwater Bed is significant,’ said Mr Evans, former curator of Cromer Museum. ‘It is another piece in the jigsaw of what Britain was like 700,000 years ago. ‘It was in danger of being washed away. I had to ensure I rescued it before the tide washed it away.’ Mr Evans, 63, who now runs a microbrewery, added: ‘Mr Stewart is quite experienced in collecting fossils - I would like to see him involved in the process of analysing and preserving it. ‘The ideal outcome would be for the findings to be donated to a public collection.’ Mr Stewart found a rhino bone in the same area in 2012 and Mr Evans discovered tooth rows from another rhino and an even older rhino femur in the 1980s and early 1990s.

"Pine nuts have become a target for large-scale theft after poor harvests sent prices rocketing. Italy in particular has seen a rise in pine-nut related crime, as the seed is a key ingredient in pesto. Some supermarkets selling the little nuts in the country are even adding anti-theft devices to their stashes. Pine nuts, pictured, have become a target for large-scale theft after poor harvests sent prices rocketing . A gang of eight thieves recently raided a factory owned by Noberasco, a top wholesaler, and drove away with 7 tonnes of the nuts worth an estimated £300,000. Two months earlier, an employee at the company was allegedly caught red-handed carrying 17kg of pine nuts out of the factory in a plastic bag. Last week, a 23-year-old was arrested in Perugia in possession of €200 worth of stolen pine nuts. His two alleged accomplices, who were suspected of being involved in an earlier nut stealing incident, evaded police, but investigators told the Ansa news agency that they believed the suspects were stealing the nuts for sale on the black market. Italy in particular has seen a rise in pine-nut related crime, as the seed is a key ingredient in pesto . The soaring price of the nuts over the last few years is seen as the chief motivator behind the thefts. Wholesale prices have climbed to nearly £40 per kg owing to poor weather and a parasite that has hit pine trees in Italy and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. A small 100g packet of pine nuts currently costs around £3.50 in British supermarkets.","Italy has seen particular rise in crime as the seed is key ingredient in pesto .

"Freed journalist Peter Greste is finally back on Australian soil after his 400 day ordeal in an Egypt jail. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed at Brisbane Airport at 12.45am and, with a huge grin, stepped off the plane into the arms of his ecstatic family. 'Mr Greste, welcome to Australia,' an officer told the journalist, according to The Guardian. An excited contingent of around 100 loved ones and supporters were waiting for Greste at the airport terminal, filled with relief after a long campaign to bring the journalist home. 'Are you guys waiting for someone important?' Greste joked as he address media. 'I cant tell you how ecstatic I am to be here, this is a moment I've rehearsed over and over. Well, I've rehearsed it about 400 times over the last 400 days.' Although, Greste was quick to acknowledge his former inmates who remain behind bars, including fellow Al Jazeera staff. 'I will say this a million times, this is tempered with worry for my colleagues and all the other guys imprisoned beside me.' 'Are you guys waiting for someone important?'

He urged Australians to not forget the plight of those fighting for freedom in Egypt. 'This has generated a lot of goodwill in Australia. ''Egypt has a chance to show justice doesn't depend on nationality. if it's right for me to be free its right for all of those who were convicted to be free.' Greste expressed his enormous gratitude to his family who drove the campaign for his freedom. 'My family have been my rock through all of this, I couldnt have done this without them. 'I wouldn't be here without them. You guys (the media) wouldn't be here.They've been the ones to drive this.' The consummate journalist, he asked the media, 'does everyone have okay shots?' laughing good-naturedly, smiled for more and then left with his arms around his family. Greste was accompanied by his brother Mike for his journey home. Earlier in the week after his release, Greste took to Twitter to express his sheer joy after being released from an Egyptian prison where he was held for over 400 days. The 49-year-old Al Jazeera and ex-BBC journalist shared a photo of himself on a beach in Cyprus at about 9:30pm Australian time on Tuesday, with his arms thrown in the air and the caption: 'Free in Cyprus! Feels sweet. Peter back online for first time in 400+ days. Special thanks to Mike 4 [sic] nursing twitter'.

The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year . However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed. 'Special thanks to all who've supported us over the past year. MUST NOT FORGET THOSE STILL IN PRISON @Bahrooz #FreeAJStaff @MFFahmy11… Keep shouting #FreeAJStaff' he wrote. The three men were sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, a message on his account read: 'This is Mike who has been running Peter's twitter account since his arrest. A truly massive thank you to everyone who joined the campaign. It was followed by a Tweet that confirmed Greste was on his way home and looking forward to seeing his family again . However a shadow of grief continues to underlie even the Tweets of Greste, who continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed . 'Your contribution has been immense. I now gladly pass over the reins to @PeterGreste Freedom in Cypress!!' Greste was released from prison and deported Sunday after a presidential 'approval,' according to an Egyptian prison official and the nation's official news agency. The official and an Interior Ministry statement said he was released under a new deportation law passed last year. Greste also used his first interview since being deported to call on Egypt to release the other detained journalists and reveal the trauma of leaving his colleagues behind in the Cairo prison. The journalist said he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. 'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. Just prior to his first tweet in more than a year, these two tweets appeared on his account . Greste appears in a defendants' cage in a courthouse near Tora prison in Cairo, Egypt in May last year. 'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.' Greste said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'. 'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.' The Australian said the key to surviving jail had been to stay fit physically, mentally and spiritually. Greste exercised by running, kept mentally fit by studying and remained spiritually strong through meditation. He and his colleagues  were sentenced to up to 10 years in jail in 2013 after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi . Greste's family (left to right): mother Lois, brother Andrew and father Juris,  in Brisbane following his release . Greste's family gave a press conference after he was released following 400 days in an Egyptian prison . 'It was a way of enforcing a kind of discipline on myself and dealing with each day as it came,' he said. 'Hopefully ... I've come out of it not too damaged.' The award-winning correspondent described his release as a massive step forward. 'I just hope that Egypt keeps going down this path with the others,' he said. 'If it's appropriate for me to be free it's right for all of them to be freed.' Greste wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. However while running on Sunday the prison warden called him over and told him to pack his things. 'I said ""What do you mean?"" and he said ""You're going"" and I said ""Where, to another prison?"" and he said ""No the (Australian) embassy is coming they'll be here in an hour"".' Greste said Monday that his freedom was something of a 'rebirth' and that key to his well-being while incarcerated for more than a year was exercising, studying and meditating .

Fahmy's relatives expect the Canadian-Egyptian to also be deported under a decree passed by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial. Canada said Greste's release was positive and it remained 'very hopeful' Fahmy would be freed soon. Al Jazeera also vowed to pursue the campaign to free its other two journalists. But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at the channel, admitted she wasn't confident Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released. '(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,' she said. 'We are not going to leave him there.'

"The links between where you live and the adverse affects on your health are well documented. Busy roads, power plants and a dense urban neighbourhoods all increase a person's exposure to air pollution, and secondhand smoke - raising the risk of stroke, heart disease and cancer. But location is also thought to be vital when it comes to the health of your skin. A new study has found a person's postcode could determine their risk of developing eczema - a painful skin complaint affecting one in five people. Skincare company Salcura examined almost 24,000 orders for treatments to help ease the condition in adults and children. And their findings highlighted a direct correlation between hard water and demand for eczema cures. In the last 18 months, demand for treatments was highest in London, with the West Midlands, Essex and Surrey also appearing in the top five. Experts noted all are areas of very hard water. Click here to take the test . Skincare company Salcura has developed an online portal allowing people to discover if they are at increased risk of eczema because of the water in the area where they live. By entering your postcode on the site, you can discover the hardness of your water supply . The only exception in the top five was Lancashire, an area of soft water. The lowest levels of demand for eczema treatments were in Perthshire, Falkirk, Orkney Islands and Clackmannanshire - all areas with soft water, according to Southern Water. And the company has now devised an online portal to enable people to check the water in their area. Dermatologists and the NHS recognise hard water is a common trigger for exacerbating eczema. The skin requires a certain level of moisture, fats and oils to lubricate the skin, retain water and keep the skin plump. Past studies have found eczema sufferers often don't produce the necessary levels to maintain healthy skin. When the skin is dry, gaps can appear between the cells, allowing germs, bacteria and allergens to get through and cause irritation. That irritation can trigger the symptoms of eczema - itchy, red, inflamed, cracked and sore skin. Some chemicals can aggravate the condition, with sufferers finding certain detergents, soaps and perfumes can cause problems, stripping the skin of its natural oils. Hard water contains a considerable amount of dissolved minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, whereas soft water only contains sodium. It can also be responsible for scum on dishes and bathtubs as the minerals make soap less effective. Dr Stefanie Williams, medical director at European Dermatology London said these minerals lessen moisture levels in our skin, which, in turn, can aggravate skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. On top of this - in areas with soft water, people use less soap, shampoo and washing powder on a daily basis, which therefore moderates skin contact to harsh chemicals and potential irritants. Bio-medical research scientist, Dr Martin Schiele, founder of Salcura, said: 'From a scientific point of view the idea that hard water will have an effect on eczema makes sense on paper. 'I have always believed that it formed part of a wider mix of external factors affecting the prevalence of eczema. 'Where hard water exists, an often invisible layer of minerals deposit on the skin after bathing or washing. 'Where the skin barrier function is deficient, these alkali deposits can irritate skin and cause inflammation and itching in the same way that other allergens such as chlorine and pollens cause the same sort of problems.' While the top three areas, showing highest demand for eczema products, all have big populations the sales are not directly related to population size. Somerset, which is also in the top 10, has roughly the same population as Warwickshire, which comes in the bottom 50. The links between hard water and eczema have long been debated by scientists. A study by the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology in the UK in 2010 failed to prove if a water softener in the homes of children with eczema helped to reduce the severity of the condition. However, an earlier study by Professor Williams of Nottingham University in 1998, found eczema is up to 44 per cent more common in primary school children living in hard water areas, than in those who live in areas where the water is soft. NICE also identified hard water as an environmental trigger of eczema, in its 2007 guidelines on atopic eczema in children. Commenting on the findings of the 2009 Softened Water Eczema Trial, Tony Frost, from the UK Water Treatment Association, said: 'While this trial did not provide the supporting evidence expected, 66 per cent of home owner participants opted to purchase the water softener after the trial. Highest incidence of eczema . 1. London - hard . 2. Lancashire - soft . 3. West Midlands - hard . 4. Essex - hard . 5. Surrey - hard . 6. Kent - hard . 7. West Yorkshire - hard . 8. Hampshire - hard . 9. Somerset - soft . 10. Middlesex - slightly to moderately hard . Lowest incidence of eczema . 1. Perthshire - soft . 2. Louth - hard . 3. Kinross - soft . 4. Falkirk - soft . 5. Rutland - slightly to moderately hard . 6. Orkney Islands - soft . 7. Clackmannanshire - soft . 8. Ayrshire - soft . 9. Shetland Islands - soft . 10. Caerphilly - soft . Eczema causes itchy, red, inflamed, cracked and sore skin. Mother-of-one Henriett Azam said her daughter started to suffer with the painful condition, pictured on her arms, when she was just 10 months old. Cases are usually diagnosed within the first few weeks or months of life . 'In addition, water softener suppliers continue to receive customer reports of improvement in eczema conditions after a water softener has been installed.' Mother-of-one Henriett Azam, from Peterborough - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10-month-old daughter's eczema in just four weeks, after installing a water softener. She said: 'I started to see a difference in my daughter's skin in a month, and after two months, her eczema had cleared up completely. 'Previously, her eczema would be exacerbated when she was hot, and at bath-time – even if we just used water.' Dr Schiele added: 'These sales figures clearly illustrate that customers living in areas of hard water in the UK are buying more products to treat eczema, than those living in areas of soft water.' The analysis carried out by Salcura included sales from the Bioskin Junior Range, which has five products including a daily spray, a cream and three bath time products, as well as the adult range of products. Salcura products contain nutrient based formulations which help to support the skin's natural healing process, effectively delivering proven active ingredients into the skin and restoring moisture. Paula Beattie, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokeswoman, said: 'There is increasing evidence that children living in areas with domestic hard water have an increased risk of eczema and more severe eczema especially if they have a genetically inherited tendency to dry skin. 'The reasons for this have not been fully elucidated but using increased amounts of soap to produce the same lather contributes."" And Sandra Lawton OBE, dermatology nurse consultant and BSF spokeswoman, added: 'We know from work previously undertaken that eczema is more common in hard water areas and that a further study showed no benefit of using water softeners. 'What is important for children with eczema is to use emollients on a regular basis to wash,moisturise and protect their skin.' Also known as atopic eczema, it is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin. Atopic is the term used to describe conditions such as asthma, eczema, seasonal rhinitis and hayfever - which often have a genetic basis. Eczema is the term used to describe the changes in the upper layer of skin. They can include redness, blistering, oozing, crusting, scaling, thickening and sometimes pigmentation. The skin condition affects both men and women and is commonly diagnosed in the first weeks or months of life. Ms Azam, from Peterborough - an area of hard water - said she saw a difference in her 10-month-old daughter's eczema in just four weeks, after installing a water softener, pictured . It is most common in children, affecting at least 10 per cent of infants at some stage. Eczema often disappears in childhood, but it can carry into adult life. In rare cases it can develop for the first time in adulthood. The causes of eczema are still not fully understood. The condition tends to run in families, with genetic make-up thought to play a part. The main symptom is an itching sensation. Scratching to relive an itch may be the cause for many of the changes seen on the skin. It can be so severe it interrupts a sufferer's sleep. The condition can affect all areas of the body, including the face. Most commonly sufferers find the bends of their elbows and knees, the area around their wrists and neck, are affected. A sufferers skin will be red and dry and scratch marks and bleeding are common. During a flare up it is common to see small water blisters on the hands and feet, or the affected areas become moist and weepy. A number of factors can trigger a flare up, including heat, dust and contact with irritants including soaps and detergents. Having a cold, bacterial and viral infections, stress and dry skin can also result in a flare up.

"The girlfriend of Aaron Hernandez's alleged victim said  the defendant was stressed and kept to himself in the days following the murder. Shaneah Jenkins was on the stand for the third day on Wednesday in Fall River, Massachusetts where she was cross-examined by the defense. Her sister Shayanna, the fiancée of Aaron Hernandez, also returned to court for the first time since last week. She sat with Hernandez's family in the front row behind the defendant and took notes. Shaneah Jenkins, a graduate law student, is a witness for the prosecution and has been sitting with the family of her late boyfriend, Odin Lloyd, in court. Hernandez, 25, has been charged with the murder of Lloyd in 2013 after the 27-year-old's body was found with gunshot wounds in industrial scrub land. Scroll down for video . Divided: Shaneah Jenkins, girlfriend of the victim, (pictured right) faced cross-examination by the defense on Wednesday at the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez. Her sister Shayanna, who is the defendant's fiancée, was also in court (left) Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, took the stand on Wednesday where she was shown a photo of her son from when she identified his dead body at the medical examiner's office . The former New England Patriots player has pleaded not guilty. Lloyd's mother also took the stand on Wednesday where she kept check of her emotions as she identified her dead son in an image of his face from the medical examiner's office. Ursula Ward was advised by Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh not to cry while on the stand. Ms Ward answered questions from the prosecution about her son's upbringing and the last time she saw him. Ward has left the courtroom in tears on two previous days when seeing photos in court of her son's body. Ms Ward testified that she had never met Aaron Hernandez and did not know him to be a friend of her son, saying the ex-Patriots player had never come to her home. The defense declined to question Ms Ward who left the stand after about ten minutes. On Wednesday morning, Shaneah Jenkins told the court that she went to her sister and Aaron Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts the morning after she found out Lloyd was dead. She told defense attorney Charles Rankin that in the days that followed, Hernandez 'seemed stressed'. The defense read Shaneah her previous grand jury testimony where she said that Hernandez 'appeared shaken up'. Shaneah said that she did not recall saying those precise words but confirmed she said that Hernandez did not eat a lot and was 'isolated' at the home. The defense team used the cross-examination of Miss Jenkins to reinforce a picture of Aaron and Odin as good friends, who regularly hung out together and smoked marijuana. Shaneah  testified about occasions when Lloyd and Hernandez spent time together but reiterated that they weren't close and just had 'the beginnings of a friendship'. Her sister Shayanna sat in the front row behind Hernandez, taking notes while she spoke. The two sisters didn't make eye contact. Hernandez also took notes in court on Wednesday as the jury was shown photographs of Odin Lloyd's shaving kit bag in which he carried marijuana. Aaron Hernandez takes notes in court on Wednesday as a photo showing Odin Lloyd's bag full of marijuana was shown in court. The defense is attempting to characterize the pair as friends who smoked weed together . As the trial resumed on Wednesday, Shaneah reiterated what she had said in court on Tuesday, that she saw her sister going to basement with a black trash bag the day after Odin's murder. She confirmed for the prosecution that still images from surveillance cameras in the Hernandez home showed her in the living room while Shayanna goes to the basement with the garbage sack. At trial on Tuesday, Shaneah had broken down in tears as she recalled the middle-of-the-night call which brought news that her boyfriend was dead. Miss Jenkins also told the court in Fall River that she had a close relationship with her sister but that Shayanna 'was not being normal' the morning after Odin's murder. Shaneah said that Shayanna took a number of phone calls in another room at her home and then went to the basement several times, on the last occasion carrying a black garbage bag. Shaneah said that Hernandez, 25, only briefly spoke to her once about her 27-year-old boyfriend's untimely death. 'He [Hernandez] came into the dining room, rubbed my shoulder and asked me if I was okay,' Miss Jenkins said. 'He told me he had been through this death thing before and it will get better with time.' Hernandez remained emotionless and stared at the ceiling as Miss Jenkins, who had been dating Lloyd for 18 months, became tearful as she recalled the last time she spoke to him. Miss Jenkins said that she spoke to Odin several times on June 16, which was Father's Day, from her home in Connecticut. Odin told her that he was going to work the following day and he had to return a rental car after he finished. Murder victim Odin Lloyd's family were in court on Wednesday (pictured to the front of the picture). Hernandez's family sat in the front row on the opposite side . The victim's girlfriend leant over and closed her eyes as details of his body at the crime scene were revealed in court on Wednesday . During her morning commute the following day, she called Odin at 7.30am but was unable to reach him. Miss Jenkins testified that she called him at lunchtime, got no response and again, at 8pm that night. Shaneah was woken up late that night by Trooper Benson from North Attleboro who informed her that Odin was dead. The law student, who has remained composed and given measured, articulate answers on the stand, broke down as she recalled finding out he had died. Miss Jenkins dabbed at her nose and eyes with a tissue but was able to continue. She testified that in the early hours of June 18, she tried to call Shayanna but couldn't get through to her sister. Shayanna then called back and 'sounded like she was in the car', Shaneah said. The grieving young woman then drove from her home in Connecticut to visit Odin's family in Massachusetts and some hours later, then drove to her sister's home about an hour away. Shaneah testified that on June 18, Hernandez left the home and she stayed in the living room for some hours with her sister, niece and uncle. Sometime around noon, Shayanna received a number of phone calls and text messages. 'Her responses were short and she kept getting up and leaving the room,' Miss Jenkins said. 'She was not behaving normally. She was being secretive.' Shaneah said Shayanna went to basement two or three times. On the last time she went, she had a black garbage bag which she did not explain what was for. Shayanna then borrowed Shaneah's car - which she had never done before, saying that she had to go to the bank to collect money for the housekeepers. When her sister returned, Shaneah said she then left to visit Odin's family and on her return, found police searching the Hernandez home. The trial continues.","Shaneah Jenkins was on the stand for the third day on Wednesday in Fall River, Massachusetts .

"Hidden wealth: Ronald Read died last year at age 92. The frugal gas station attendant had secretly accumulated a $6 million fortune through canny investments and in his will left it to his local Vermont library and hospital . A Vermont man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood also had a hidden talent for picking stocks — a talent that became public after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital. The investments made by Ronald Read, a former gas station employee and janitor who died last June at age 92, 'grew substantially' over the years, said his attorney Laurie Rowell. Rowell said that Read's entire fortune added up to around $8 million. He also left behind a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000. For almost 25 years Read worked at Haviland's service station. He retired but got bored and decided to work for JCPenny until 1997. Read, who was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap,  gave no hint of the size of his fortune. 'He was unbelievably frugal,' Rowell said on Wednesday. When Read visited her office, 'sometimes he parked so far away so he wouldn't have to pay the meter.' The bequest of $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and $1.2 million to the town's Brooks Memorial Library were the largest each institution has ever received. Read also made a number of smaller bequests. 'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison. In addition to cash, he had an antique Edison phonograph with dozens of recording drums that he left to the Dummerston Historical Society, Rowell said. 'It's really a beautiful machine,' said Historical Society president Muriel Taylor. Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney. Secret millionaire in their midst: Ronald Read, (left, in his trademark baseball cap), and his friend Dave Smith eat Christmas Dinner at the American Legion in Vermont a few years before Read's death . Gas station employee: Ronald  Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970 . In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970. Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer he visited Read every few months, more often as Read's health declined. The only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal. 'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.' It's unclear as to if Read gave any of his fortune to his stepson. Is that you Ronald?: This Google street view shows Ronald Read's modest home and that may even be him pictured in the right corner near his Toyota parked outside . Reformer.com reports that each institution was extremely grateful for their large financial gifts and said they never expected such a large donation from a man they knew so little about. 'This bequest is incredible. It's transformative,' Brooks Memorial Library Executive Director Jerry Carbone said. 'It's going to really provide for our future and relevance in the community and allow us to keep up with the times, and keep up with what this community needs to access quality library services.' Carbone said that Read wasn't well known at the library but over the past six or seven years he had been quietly coming in to read and take out books. Read's attorney said that her modest client had his two favorite hobbies which were investing in stocks and cutting wood. Huge donation: Ronald Read gave $1.2 million to the town's Brooks Memorial Library,  the largest donation the institution ever received . 'He had two lifelong hobbies: Investing and cutting wood,' she said. 'The generous bequests to the Brooks Library and Brattleboro Memorial Hospital attest to his skills at investing. The well-stocked woodpile in his garage attests to his love of cutting wood.' His step-son Philip Brown said Read was cutting his own firewood well into his 90s, and the two would often drive around looking for downed wood Read could throw in the truck and take home for his wood stove. Other Vermont residents had no idea that Read had the money he did and even assumed he might be down on his luck. 'People were stunned that he had that much money,' resident Ruth Marx said. 'I bought some old fence wiring from him once because I thought he could use the money.' Marx even once knitted him a hat for fear he might need it to get through the winter.

Security Council was scheduled to vote on a new resolution aimed at . pressuring the Syrian regime to comply with a peace plan. Two brigadier-generals were among some 600 Syrians who fled from Syria to Turkey overnight, a Turkish official said on Wednesday. It brings the number of Syrian generals sheltering in Turkey to 20, including a retired general. The official could not immediately confirm if other defected officers had also arrived in Turkey in the last 24 hours but said a number of lower-ranking soldiers usually accompanied defecting generals. The number of Syrian refugees in Turkey rose to 43,200 after 600 more arrived overnight, he said. But Russia remained at loggerheads with the U.S. and its European allies over any mention of sanctions and Chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in Syria. Besides a government crackdown, rebel fighters are launching increasingly deadly attacks on regime targets, and several massive suicide attacks this year suggest al-Qaida or other extremists are joining the fray. Activists say more than 17,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in March 2011. The state-run news agency SANA reported that Wednesday's blast was aimed at the National Security building, a headquarters for one of Syria's intelligence branches and less than 500 meters (yards) from the U.S. Embassy. Police had cordoned off the area, and journalists were banned from approaching the site. Earlier Wednesday, SANA said soldiers were chasing rebels in the Midan neighborhood, causing 'great losses among them.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said army helicopters attacked the neighborhoods of Qaboun and Barzeh. Stumbling block: Russian President Vladimir Putin meets with United Nations envoy Kofi Annan yesterday. Russia and China continue to the Assad regime by opposing UN sanctions . Residents pray in front of the body of Issa Injary, whom activists say was killed by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad . The key stumbling block is the Western demand for a resolution threatening non-military sanctions and tied to Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in Syria. Russia is adamantly opposed to any mention of sanctions or Chapter 7. After Security Council consultations late Tuesday on a revised draft resolution pushed by Moscow, Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Alexander Pankin said these remain 'red lines.' Russia has said it will veto any Chapter 7 resolution, but council diplomats said there is still a possibility of last-minute negotiations. While facts on the ground often cannot be verified because independent media are largely excluded from Syria, the conflict is now seen by observers to have changed from an uprising in poor towns and villages to a civil war that has reached the streets of the capital. It has also become a proxy war between Russia and Shi'ite Muslim Iran, which back Assad, one one side, and Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar, which are arming and funding the Sunni rebels on the other. The rebels now include the Free Syrian Army, a group of army defectors joined by Sunni youths, al-Qaeda style Jihadists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and local pro-democracy Sunni liberals. Weapons are being smuggled across the borders from Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Jordan. 'Syria ... is clearly right now a battleground for proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, reflecting a centuries-old conflict between Shi'ite and Sunni powers,' said Ayham Kamel of Political Risk consultancy Eurasia. While the rebels inside Syria are gaining ground, the Syrian political opposition in exile remains bogged down in factional divisions and is losing influence. The government is meanwhile losing its ability to spread fear. Defections of senior officers and officials have accelerated in recent weeks although the backbone of the military remains intact due to Alawite solidarity. 'The Syrian regime is slowly and totally sinking. I don't know what the timeline will be. It is becoming difficult for the state to control the country. It is like a fire engine, they extinguish one fire and find that another fire has started in another place, said a senior Western diplomat. 'The army is overstretched, the government is under sanctions and there is erosion of power,' he added.","Youngsters suffered appalling shrapnel wounds after their homes were shelled .

"Prince Harry has proved he's up to speed with modern technology after becoming the first member of the royal family to feature in a series of GIFs. The 30-year-old appears in the animated images, which you can view below, to promote Guillemot, an independent film funded by The Royal Foundation, of which Prince Harry is patron. The fourth in line to the throne poses with the cast of the film and looks as cool and comfortable as they do in front of the camera. Scroll down for video . Dressed casually in navy chinos with a zip-up jumper and jacket worn over a shirt, the prince - famed for his cheeky sense of humour - is seen sharing a joke with the actors in one of the animated images. The prince has previously proved he's up-to-date with the technological era as the Royal Foundation - which he runs with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - joined Twitter and Instagram last month. A tweet from the Full Effect account yesterday shared the GIFs for the first time writing: 'We are excited to have worked alongside @KensingtonRoyal to create the first ever Royal GIFs with #PrinceHarry' The Guillemot film has been made as part of the Full Effect project - a community initiative in St Ann's, Nottingham, aimed at tackling problems including youth violence and gangs, as well as improving opportunities for the young people involved. A still from the GIF shows Harry with the cast from the film Guillemot which has been funded by The Royal Foundation as part of the Full Effect project to support young people in Nottingham . Prince Harry travelled to Nottingham yesterday to be reunited with the cast and crew and watch the premiere of the film at the city's Cineworld multiplex. Before the screening started, the prince made a speech in which he explained the aims and achievements of the project and how it intended to 'create young leaders'. He added: 'This project means a lot to me. I can really feel the passion here. There's a positive future out there for all of us. Please keep aiming high. Well done.' Harry has taken a special interest in Full Effect and yesterday was his third visit to see it in action. Many of the teenagers who spoke to Harry said they had met him before, and one said he was becoming a 'regular visitor' to the area. Prince Harry is welcomed as he arrives at the Cornerhouse Cinema in Nottingham for the premier of Guillemot yesterday . The prince sits in the front row to watch the film which he has taken a keen interest in . Harry spent more than half-an-hour talking to the film-makers, including the star of the 30-minute movie, Tylar Slaney, 18. Danny Mulvany, 16, said he plays the main villain in the film. He said: 'It's an honour meeting him everytime - it's good. I've met him three times now. 'It makes the youth feel like there's hope - we can do things. There's people looking at us right now and actually seeing that we've got talent, they can actually see that we're creative people.' Danny said it was good news for St Ann's. 'It definitely means a lot because we haven't had these things happen for a long time, so for Harry to come back again and show his respect is very good.' Danny added: 'If you meet him, you'll know he's definitely a good guy.' Micaiah Jackson, 17 - who plays Biggs in the film, said: 'Harry definitely seemed interested, I think he's passionate about it. It looks like he's got a real drive to help us out, help us do more and get up there. 'He wanted to know if we enjoyed it, what kind of thing we wanted to do in the future, what kind of path we want to go down and if we want to carry on doing more films.' Harry picks up the mic ready to make a speech at the film premiere . During his speech, Harry praised the way the project has 'created young leaders' Harry met the young movie-makers as part of a longer visit to the primary school, during which he talked to youngsters involved in a range of after-school activities provided as part of the Full Effect project. He joked with children showing him round their eco-garden and examined the handiwork of a group learning basic bike maintenance. The Full Effect project is training a group of young people to be fully qualified youth leaders and also supports primary school children by providing the extra curricular activities.

"A Pennsylvania architect says that two years ago airport security threw him in a jail cell for 23 hours because he wished to file a complaint when his search was taking too long, said a lawsuit for $75,000 in damages filed last week. Roger Vanderklok was at a security checkpoint at Philadelphia International Airport on January 26, 2013 hoping to fly to Miami to run a half-marathon when security mistook his Power Bars and his watch for a bomb and explosive device. Vanderklok claims that he complained when TSA official Charles Kieser and other staff searched his bag for 30 minutes without telling him what they were searching for. Lawsuit: Roger Vanderklok, who was detained for 23 after a search of energy bars and a sports watch in his carry-on bag at Philadelphia International Airport, has sued the Transportation Security Administration . Confusion: TSA workers initially thought that the power bar in Vanderklok's bag along with a heart-monitoring watch were a possible explosive device . Philly.com reports that the employees asked him what a tube shaped item in his bag was to which he replied his heart-monitoring watch. Vanderklok claims that TSA Staff then went on to ask him if he had any ‘organic matter’ in his bag meaning food. Vanderklok who thought ‘organic matter’ meant just fruit and vegetables said no. Power Bars  are considered organic matter because they are made with milk, grain, and sugar. They also vaguely resemble a common homemade explosive. TSA agents believed that the watch may have been the item used to detonate a bomb which they thought might be the Power Bar. Vanderklok said that airport staff later deemed his items harmless and that's when he asked to file a complaint because the search took a long time and they failed to communicate with him effectively. He said that had someone told him what they meant by 'organic matter' the search would not have taken as long as it did. That's when Vanderklok was allegedly escorted to a holding cell without any explanation as to why he was there. He was later arraigned at 2 a.m. on 'threatening the placement of a bomb' and making 'terroristic threats,' according to Philly.com. Scared for his life: 'I was scared to death. I have never been arrested in my life, never had handcuffs put on,' Vanderklok said of the traumatic experience . Preparing to race: Roger Vanderklok was at a security checkpoint at Philadelphia International Airport on January 26, 2013 hoping to fly to Miami to run a half-marathon . 'I was scared to death. I have never been arrested in my life, never had handcuffs put on,' Vanderklok said. 'Throughout the night, I was in a dark place; no one knew where I was. I thought, ""I could fall off the face of the earth right now, and no one would know it."" ' Kieser told the court following the arrest that Vanderklok was detained because he became agitated and told TSA agents while pointing his finger, 'I'll bring a bomb through here any day I want … you'll never find it.' Vanderklok repeated the aggressive finger-pointing two more times, Kieser testified. Vanderklok was only released after his wife shelled out 10% of his $40,000 bail. Philly.com reports that surveillance footage of the interaction shows no conflict or any evidence of finger pointing. Bailed him out: Vanderklok wasn't released from his 23 hour fiasco until his wife Eleanor bailed him out by paying 10 per cent of his $40,000 bail . The surveillance footage shows no sign of distress by TSA employees either. They can be seen chatting with one another, checking their cell phones, and sipping on soda. Kiesler's story changed when spoke with police  and when he testified. He told police that Vanderklok became agitated and said 'Anybody could bring a bomb in here and nobody would know.' Kiesler in court said that Vanderklok threatened them with a bomb directly. Surveillance foitage proved that Kielser was lying and a judge acquitted Vanderklok of all charges.","Roger Vanderklok was at a security checkpoint at Philadelphia International Airport on January 26, 2013 when his bag was searched by TSA .

"A petite events waitress has told how she was bottled in the face by a thug who she asked to stop following her round a nightclub. April Parslow, 22, was left needing five stitches and felt forced to move cities by 29-year-old Nikki Harrison, who attacked her just weeks after she moved to Newcastle with her boyfriend. Harrison grabbed the 5ft 2in clubber around the throat, left her covered in blood and scarred her for life during his assault - but was spared jail by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Attacked: Waitress April Parslow, 22 (left) has told how she needed five stitches in her forehead after being bottled by a thug who she told to stop following her round a nightclub - but Nikki Harrison (right) was spared jail . Instead he was handed a 12-month suspended sentence with a three-month curfew and 150 hours of unpaid work after he admitted unlawful wounding and assault. He was also told to pay £2,130 compensation to Miss Parslow and £500 to a friend of hers who was hurt as he tried to intervene. Miss Parslow moved to Newcastle with her boyfriend Adam Ruys in November 2013 and went on her first night out with work friends shortly after Christmas. They were in the city centre's Madame Koo nightclub when Harrison bumped into her, spilled his drink, stared at her and followed her around. When she told him to leave he smashed his beer bottle repeatedly at her forehead, leaving her needing five stitches and eight painkiller injections at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. Harrison's violent assault only stopped when bar staff came and intervened. He was restrained by bouncers until he was arrested. Wounds: Miss Parslow was left covered in blood and needed to have five stitches in her forehead . Miss Parslow, a keen traveller who is originally from Surrey, said she was left scarred and frightened to go out in Newcastle city centre at night time. She and her boyfriend left the area after just two months and are now living for a year in Ontario, Canada. 'I didn't do anything to the man who attacked me,' she said. 'I was new to the area and went out in a big group to make friends at work and he singled me out and wouldn't leave me alone. 'He approached me and wouldn't stop staring. I found him really creepy and tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me out of his sight. 'He wouldn't stop staring so I asked him what his problem was and he threw the drink over me. 'He then grabbed me by the throat and glassed me. I started screaming really loudly because there was blood everywhere, all over my face, outfit and shoes. 'I'd only lived in the area for a month and it ruined my life in that city. 'It's disgusting that a man can do that to a woman and think it's acceptable. If someone says no they should back off. 'I had constant nightmares and my boyfriend and I had to move house because I didn't feel safe. 'Eventually, two months later, I couldn't take it any more and we moved away from the city back down south. Party: Miss Parslow was on her first night out with work friends at Newcastle's Madame Koo nightclub . 'I felt completely isolated and so we headed back to Ibiza for the summer because it was where we had met. 'Despite the nightlife scene out there, I didn't feel afraid because I was with Adam. 'My boyfriend, Adam, is extremely protective of me and I don't usually like to go on nights out if he is not there now as he is 6ft 7in and I only feel like I am safe when he is there. Protective: The waitress said she only feels safe with her 6ft 7in boyfriend Adam Ruys (left) 'I was left with a scar on my forehead and I have to wear my hair a certain way now because I get paranoid when people can see it.' Harrison was sentenced in August 2014, but this is the first time his victim has felt brave enough to speak out. At the time, the court heard Harrison was so drunk he could not recall what happened but appeared shocked when told what he had done. He and the victim were both on the dance floor, which was busy, and Harrison bumped into her more than once and spilled some of his drink on her. She asked if he had missed his mouth and he stared at her. Prosecutor Neil Pallister said: 'A few minutes later he grabbed her round the throat, squeezing it tightly. She was in a bit of a panic and had difficulty breathing. 'He then hit her to the top of the head with a bottle. 'She said others appeared to release his grip but he grabbed her again. 'Her friend said there was one blow followed by two or three further blows which connected with her head, as he was being pulled away.' Miss Parslow's friend Philip Fletcher was also hurt in the attack as he tried to intervene, the court heard. Paul Caulfield, defending, said: 'These offences are an aberration. He has expressed regret and remorse.' But Judge John Evans told Harrison: 'The two victims were enjoying a night out when, for reasons best known to yourself, you decided to smash a bottle across the heads of the two of them. 'Why someone with your history should decide to behave in that way is difficult to comprehend.' Free: Harrison was spared jail when he was sentenced last summer at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) Miss Parslow said: 'Now I know it is over and the guy has been punished, I feel like I can finally move on with my life and get over it. 'Now he has faced justice I feel it is a step forward. I am getting there and hopefully one day soon I'll feel 100 per cent confident in going out alone. 'I'm only young and I don't know why Harrison singled me out. In a way I feel as though he has made me miss out on a lot, but I don't want him to win.'","April Parslow, 22, was on her first night out after moving to Newcastle .

"The fashion industry often comes under fire for promoting a one-size-fits-all idea of beauty with some brands only using models of a certain height and weight for their campaigns. Diesel, however, is proving a point with its spring/summer 2015 campaign, which aims to promote 'tolerance, equality and unconditional love'. The star of the new shoot is, without a doubt, 19-year-old Winnie Harlow who has vitiligo, a pigment condition that causes white patches to form on skin. Scroll down for video . Diesel is proving a point with its SS15 campaign, which aims to promote 'tolerance, equality and unconditional love' and stars the likes of Winnie Harlow, centre, who suffers from the skin condition vitiligo . Winnie, a former America's Next Top Model contestant, whose real name is Chantelle Brown-Young, was diagnosed with vitiligo around the age of four. She was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' because of the white patches covering her face and body growing up. Michael Jackson famously had the same condition and explained his pale complexion was  a result of the lack of melanin in his skin. Now Winnie, who describes her self as a 'vitiligo spokesmodel' on Instagram, is being celebrated for her distinctive look. She has hundreds of thousands of followers on social media and she was recently invited back to her high school to do a motivational talk with students touching on the discrimination she faced. Winnie first spoke publicly about her skin condition in 2011 by posting a video to YouTube titled 'Vitiligo: A Skin Condition not a Life Changer'. Winnie, far right, was diagnosed with vitiligo around the age of four and said growing up she was cruelly nicknamed 'zebra' and 'cow' but she's launched a hugely successful career . Conceived by creative director Nicola Formichetti and styled by Anna Trevelyan, the new Diesel campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic, say the brand . Although then just 17, she eloquently told viewers: 'People have black skin, people have brown skin, I have both. 'When I got older, it got harder because when kids get older they get meaner, so I went through a lot of bullying and people calling me like zebra or cow so it was really hard growing up.' She said at certain points she was plagued with suicidal thoughts but found the strength to pull through. Moving from California to Canada with her family also provided the opportunity for a fresh start. Speaking about the campaign, which also stars Charlotte Free, front, Nicola said: 'The challenge was to work with an avant-garde photographer, Nick Knight, and get him to do something he's rarely done - which is shoot people smiling' After 'blossoming', Winnie said she found it strange when people started telling her how beautiful she was. 'I'll turn pink and say ""thank you so much,'"" the teenager giggled. Vitiligo occurs when the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that determines the color of skin, die or stop functioning. This causes slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on the skin over time. Vitiligo affects all races, but may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, although many experts believe that it is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys certain cells. There is no cure and the goal of treatment, which can include ointments and skin grafts, is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss. She says that things have worked in her favour because she accepts her originality and has used it to her advantage. 'I loved myself. And with that, opportunities start to fall into my lap. And I thank God for all of them. Try loving yourself,' she concluded. As well as starring on America's Next Top Model, she walked in Ashish's catwalk show in London and starred in a SHOWStudio campaign. This Diesel campaign is the latest string to her bow. Conceived by creative director Nicola Formichetti and styled by Anna Trevelyan, the campaign aims to be provocative and optimistic, inspiring people to live life in the moment and to enjoy the ride. Speaking about the campaign, which also stars alternative model Charlotte Free, Nicola said: 'There are so many crazy things happening now that you don’t see people just having fun any more. 'The challenge was to work with an avant-garde photographer, Nick Knight, and get him to do something he’s rarely done - which is shoot people smiling. 'It feels spontaneous, like they are selfies and he’s just the one snapping the photo.'

"On November 9, 2005, Sajida Al-Rishawi held one finger over the trigger of her suicide belt, ready to spray hundreds of innocent wedding guests in Jordan with deadly ball bearings  in the name of al-Qaeda. But her belt jammed and she fled as her newly-wed husband took the lives of dozens of guests, including the bride and groom's fathers at the luxury Raddison SAS hotel in Amman. Held for ten years on death row, she has now been hanged in an apparent retaliation after Islamic State militants released a sickening video showing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage. Sajida Al-Rishawi, seen here showing her suicide belt on Jordanian television, was sent to death by her brother on a suicide mission with her husband . Al-Rishawi, was held in prison in Jordan for ten years following her failed suicide bomb attempt at a packed wedding in the luxury Raddison SAS hotel in Amman . An ambulance, which is believed to be transporting the bodies of Iraqis Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziyad Karboli, leaves Swaqa prison near Amman . Her story takes her from a powerful Iraqi family to being sent to her death by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the lieutenant of her own Islamist extremist brother. Following her failed attack in 2005, which was coordinated with two other near-simultaneous attacks on Amman hotels, killing 60 people, she told Jordanian television: 'We went into the hotel. '[My husband] took a corner and I took another. There was a wedding in the hotel. There were women and children.' 'My husband executed the attack. I tried to detonate and it failed.' 'People began to run, and I ran out with them.' Although little is known about al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, her family are said to have hailed from a powerful Sunni clan in Western Iraq. Al-Rishawi, who was from the city of Ramadi in Iraq's militant stronghold of Anbar province, seemed to have a motive for her failed attack after two of herbrothers were killed during U.S. military operations in Anbar. Although al-Rishawi fled, her husband successfully detonated his bomb, killing 38 people in one of three coordinated attacks at similar venues on the same day in Amman, Jordan . Destruction: The damaged banquet hall of the Radisson SAS Hotel, site of one of three November 9 suicide attacks that killed 57 people and injured at least hundred, is seen November 12, 2005 in Amman, Jordan . Horror: Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary  visited the damage of the Radisson SAS hotel after the blast . The luxury wedding suite inside the Radisson SAS hotel was almost unrecognisable following the explosion which killed the bride and groom's parents. But her suicide attempt at the packed luxury wedding venue was ordered by her brother's lieutenant, al-Zarqawi, a top lieutenant and founder of al Qaeda's Iraq branch - which went on to form Islamic State. Al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2006. In the days after she fled the carnage of her failed suicide attack, al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for all three attacks and mentioned a woman being involved. Jordanian officials arrested al-Rishawi four days later at a safe house, one of two apartments the suicide team rented in a residential neighborhood. Several days later, al-Rishawi appeared on Jordanian state television, opening a body-length overcoat to reveal two crude explosive belts, one with RDX and the other with ball-bearings. Later at the trial, al-Rishawi pleaded not guilty and said through her lawyer that she never tried to detonate her bomb and was forced to take part in the attack. But an explosives expert testified that the trigger mechanism on al-Rishawi's belt had jammed. Al-Rishawi, who was in her 40s, was sentenced to death by hanging and an appeals court later ratified her sentence, describing her as 'guilty beyond doubt of possessing explosives and having had the intention and the will to carry out terrorist attacks whose outcome is destruction and death.' In the aftermath of al-Rishawi's attacks, Jordan's Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing a suicide belt when she was captured. But she was found with two explosive belts. One was reportedly filled with  RDX, a powerful explosive, and the other held the deadly ball bearings, ready to be sprayed into the crowds. Deadly ball bearings are regularly used as shrapnel packed around the explosives which are tied onto the body on a vest or belt. When the explosives are detonated, the balls are launched in every direction with their speed and  power close to that of bullets. The explosion has been described as equivalent to a shotgun blast going off in all directions. The ball bearings, regularly 3-7 millimeters in diameter,  cause the most damage from the explosion. Ball bearings are often used with other small metal objects, including nails. 'The aim was to inflict the largest number of casualties,' Muasher said. Little is known about husband Hussein Ali al-Shamari. It was reported that lights went out at the wedding before he jumped on the dining table and detonated his bomb, killing 38 people. Moments before the attack in the wedding suite of the Amman Raddisson, bride Nadia al-Alami stood next to her new husband, Ashraf Mohamed al-Akhras, posing for photos before dozens of guests were killed. Al-Rishawi's execution, at about 4am local time today, came just hours after Islamic State militants released a sickening video showing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage. Jordan had vowed a swift and lethal response and government officials this morning revealed that two prisoners, Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been hanged. The executions took place after gruesome footage emerged showing Jordanian pilot  al-Kasasbeh being torched to death by his captors.","Failed bomber Al-Rishawi from a powerful Sunni clan in Western Iraq .

"A Georgia barber is offering area parents a new way of punishing their misbehaving sons: by shaving off the top of their hair to make them look like balding old men. Russell Frederick from A-1 Kutz in Snelville calls it his 'Benjamin Button Special' and offers it for free to kids who need to 'act grown.' The 34-year-old father says he started advertising the unique punishment after using it successfully on his own 12-year-old son. Scroll down for video . Not smiling anymore! A Georgia barber is offering free 'Benjamin Button Special' cuts for kids whose parents can no longer handle their naughty behavior . Frederick told the Washington Post that he came up with it after his son Rushawn's grades began to fall last fall. After the cut--named for the 2008 Brad Pitt film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button--he says Rushawn's marks 'skyrocketed dramatically.' Interest in the offer also skyrocketed after Frederick posted before and after photos online of the first boy whose parents brought him in for the Benjamin Button. The ornery boy initially looks to have not a care in the world but his smirk quickly goes away for the after photo. Frederick told the Post that some naysayers have likened the punishment to abuse. 'There are a few people that are saying it's emotional abuse; but on average, everyone is applauding,' he said. Like a bald old man: A-1 Kutz co-owner Russell Frederick says he had the idea after successfully using the punishment technique when his own 12-year-old son's grade's last year . Lots of interest: Russell offers the cut for free three days a week and says interest skyrocketed after he posted his first taker's before and after pictures on social media . Anyway, said Frederick, the punishment isn't meant for everyday use. 'I hope that most people won't have to do this unless it's an extreme circumstances and nothing else is working,' he said. 'First, you talk or implement your restrictions. 'But when the conventional ways don't work these days, you have to get creative.' The first boy to get the special wasn't forced to walk out of A-1 Kutz with the crazy cut. Once the lesson set it, Frederick buzzed off his remaining hair for a more presentable look. 'He understood why it happened and he rolled with it and allowed it to make him stronger,' Fredrick said. 'He understood why it happened and he rolled with it and allowed it to make him stronger': Russell won't force his subjects to leave the shop looking like Benjamin Button--he lets them learn their lesson then gives them a more presentable 'do .","Russell Fredrick, an owner at A-1 Kutz in Snelville, Georgia, tried it out on his own unruly son and says his behavior immediately improved .

"It's the perfect setting: millions of tons of dirt, plenty of space and an atmosphere that stays at a constant 58 degrees. A new underground bicycle park with miles of dirt trails, jumps and stunt courses is being built inside an abandoned limestone mine in Louisville, Kentucky, that has been recycled into a popular tourist attraction. The owners of the 320,000-square foot park say it will be the largest indoor course in the nation. Scroll down for video . Popular tourist attraction: A new underground bicycle park with miles of dirt trails, jumps and stunt courses is being built inside an abandoned limestone mine in Louisville, Kentucky . Room to ride: The owners of the 320,000-square foot park say it will be the largest indoor course in the nation . Top notch: It's pegged as the perfect setting: millions of tons of dirt, plenty of space and an atmosphere that stays a constant 58 degrees . 'We have a very large area to work with,' said Tom Tyler, who co-owns the former mine, now called the Mega Cavern. 'You can't duplicate it. Somebody would have to go out and dig rock for 40 years before they have what we've got here.' Tyler and the other owners started out using the mine's nearly one million square feet of underground space as a dumping site for dirt and rock in the early 1990s, and later as a storage site for businesses. About five years ago, they installed zip lines in a section of the mine and in recent years set up a drive-thru underground Christmas light show that draws long lines of cars during the holidays. Two decades of dumping gradually built the floor up over time, and gave the owners plenty of earth to work with. Tyler said there were requests from visitors and bikers to build a bike park in the mine. Three, two, one, lift-off! Workers have been busy sculpting the earth into jumps and ramps . In high demand: Tom Tyler, who co-owns the former mine, now called the Mega Cavern, said there were requests from visitors and bikers to build a bike park . Sheltered: Indoor bike parks like Ray's MTB in Cleveland allow bikers to ride during cold winters, and Tyler said he expects the Mega Cavern's park to be busiest in the coldest months . Geared up: Bike riders Brad Titzer, left, and Derek Fetko walk their bikes during a test run through a new underground bike park . Looking around the vast space spread over five football fields, with dirt trails unfolding in every direction under a 35-foot-high ceiling, the course has the breadth and feel of an outdoor space. Indoor bike parks like Ray's MTB in Cleveland allow bikers to ride during cold winters, and Tyler said he expects the Mega Cavern's park to be busiest in the coldest months. The difference is the trails at Ray's and other indoor parks are typically built with wood. Burlington Bike Park in Washington is all dirt but it is much smaller than the Louisville park. 'The dirt is a lot smoother for the steeper jumps, which we really like,' said Derek Fetko, a local rider who has been invited in to test out the course. Innovative business idea: Tom Tyler, center, co-owner of a new underground bike park, talks with riders Derek Fetko, left, and Nabil Imam inside the park . Still more work to do: The course is expected to be open to the public in March . Into the darkness: The Mega Cavern - approximately 100 acres - was mined from the early 1930s to the early 1970s . 'Plus being able to ride on dirt in the winter, it's just something we typically can't do here in Kentucky, because the ground freezes and thaws, it's just too messy.' Two course designers from Washington state, Joe Prisel and Jeff Perkins, were brought in and began designing the course in October. Prisel designed the Burlington course. 'We brought them in and said here's the canvas, paint it the way you would like to see it done,' Tyler said. It has long smooth stretches for take-it-easy riders, steep jumps for daredevils and plenty of rocks and other physical obstacles to ride around and on top of. The course is expected to be open to the public in March. Piled high: Over 850,000 truck loads of backfill have been delivered so far to the cave to raise the floor up to the level that it is at today . What lies above: Approximately 70per cent of the Louisville Zoo is located above the cavern .","'We have a very large area to work with,' said Tom Tyler, who co-owns the former mine, now called the Mega Cavern .

"Five gang members have pleaded guilty to murder and weapons charges after a girl was killed by a stray bullet while eating breakfast at her family's Omaha home. Payton Benson, aged five, was caught in the crossfire of a gun battle between rival gangs about a block from her home in January 2014. A year on, all the members of the gang behind her killing have pleaded guilty to various charges, and each face hefty jail sentences. Guilty: Adonus Moses, 22 (left) and Vincent Hicks, 20 (right) both face years behind bars after admitting murder charges . Facing jail: Jacob Brown, 21 (left) and Jaylen Brown, 18 (right) were involved in a gun battle between rival gangs when five-year-old Payton Benson was killed in the crossfire . Website Omaha.com reported how Payton's mother Tabatha Manning said she was pleased that the family wouldn't have to face the ordeal of a trial. “I don’t have to testify to the world what I saw when Payton died, ” she told the website. “I don’t want to share that with the world, because I don’t want everyone else’s hearts to break like mine has.” A hail of at least 15 bullets were fired by the men at a rival gang, who were running through the streets near Payton's home in Omaha on January 15, 2014. All of their shots missed their targets - but one penetrated Payton's apartment block and went through a wall and couch, hitting and killing the girl as she ate her breakfast. Senseless: Payton Benson, five, was shot dead by a stray bullet as she ate breakfast on January 15 . Gang member Vincent Hicks faces at least 15 years in prison and a maximum of life behind bars after pleading guilty to second-degree murder and weapon use. Jaylen Montgomery admitted to gun charges and could spend up to 54 years in prison. He will serve a minimum of eight years in jail. Jacob Brown, aged 21, entered a plea of guilty on the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree murder. Both Brown and Adonus Moses, who pleaded no contest to the same charge, face up to 25 years behind bars. Meanwhile, another gang member, Kevin Peak, who was found with a gun as detectives investigated the incident, could serve up to 25 years in prison. He was not there on the day of the shooting, but pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a weapon. The men will be sentenced in April. Police believe their car was chasing a rival gang member in rival gang territory before at least three of the men got out of the vehicle and opened fire. The Wichita Eagle reported last year how the men had initially been arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with a stolen Jeep seen on surveillance video. But police began to put the pieces of a bigger crime together through input from the community. 'These arrests are the product of a community that has stepped forward to assist law enforcement, coupled with gang and homicide detectives that have worked tirelessly to solve this case,' Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said in a written statement. At the time of the shooting, witnesses told WOWT they heard at least 20 shots fired from multiple high-powered rifles. ‘What I heard was just massive amounts of gunfire, both guns had to be completely unloaded,’ Nick Todd said. ‘Both guns were very large guns. They weren't small guns.’ The family’s van had a flat tire after being struck by a separate stray bullet and Mrs Benson was unable to take Payton to hospital. The Fontenelle Park neighborhood, where . the shootings occurred, is not known as a particularly violent area. There are . only four violent crimes per 1,000 residents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The suspects: Police released surveillance footage showing at least three men getting out of the stolen Jeep . The getaway: Cops believe the men sped away in this vehicle . Callous: the stray bullets even pierced the tires of the family van, making it impossible to rush the dying girl to the hospital .","Payton Benson, five, was killed by a stray bullet while eating breakfast .

"An estimated five million Australian adults continue to be affected by childhood abuse . The Australian government could save between $6.8 billion and $9.1 billion a year by effectively responding to child abuse, a new report has found. Commissioned by Adults Surviving Child Abuse (ASCA), a national organisation which works to assist adults who have been scarred by childhood traumas, the study was completed by Pegasus Economics to highlight the financial costs of dealing with the long-term impacts of child abuse experienced by about five million adults across the country. It found that if the government invested in timely and comprehensive interventions for children who experience sexual, emotional and physical abuse, it could avoid spending millions of dollars on dealing with the destructive coping mechanisms developed by victims later down the track. 'Early life trauma and abuse affect the developing brain and have many possible impacts on daily adult life,' the report states. 'These include the coping strategies children adopt... [which] may still be used in adult life. Perpetuated when the underlying trauma is not resolved, these coping strategies are associated with health risks in adulthood.' Strategies can include alcohol abuse, drug abuse, eating disorders, overeating and smoking and can also see adults have 'encounters with the criminal justice system'. A report commissioned by Adults Surviving Child Abuse found that the government spends up to $9.1 million each year on dealing with the destructive coping mechanisms (some of which are pictured in the table above) developed by abuse victims in their childhood and often continued on later in life . 'The resultant effects of such behaviours include mental health issues, medical problems (lung and heart disease -smoking, obesity-diet, liver disease-substance abuse related, suicide); social problems (criminal convictions and jail sentences); and economic problems (loss of income, gambling debt) to name a few.' Individual costs associated with some of these behaviours were also assessed by the report, which found that on average $4984 per person is spent on addressing alcohol abuse in  childhood trauma victims. This is coupled with the $5281 per person spent on addressing suicide issues, $6042 on eating disorders and $7687 on mental illness. A number of recommendations are made by the report including training GPs to identify trauma in their patients and deal with it appropriately, as well as investment in help lines and online counselling services. 'The GP role is critical - they see many survivors every day and if trauma is not on their radar they won't think about it,' ASCA's director Dr Cathy Kezelman told the ABC. Barbara, a Queensland woman who suffered sexual and physical abuse in various homes throughout 16 years of her childhood, which the government offered her $21,000 in compensation for, said she welcomed the report . Dr Kezelman urged the government to read the report and recognise the benefits of investing in effective strategies for dealing with child abuse. 'We are in a situation where we have a major structural budget deficit so this is in response to Tony Abbott's call for policy around saving the projected exponentially expanding health forecast,' she said. Barbara, a Queensland woman who suffered sexual and physical abuse in various homes throughout 16 years of her childhood, told the ABC that she welcomed the report. She also opened up about the trauma she continues to experience which the government offered her $21,000 in compensation for. 'I can't sleep without the light on, I am constantly angry, I don't want to be around people,' she said.","An estimated five million Australian adults continue to be affected by childhood abuse they have experienced .

"A 19-year-old charity fundraiser hanged himself after suffering severe 'lows' which followed weekend-long cocaine and alcohol binges, an inquest heard. A coroner called cocaine an 'evil of our society' after the mother of popular mechanic Dylan Jackson said she could think of no other reason for his death. Bolton Coroners' Court heard Mr Jackson was a loving, upbeat teenager who ran the 12-mile Tough Mudder assault course two weeks before his death for military charity Help For Heroes. Death: Teenage charity fundraiser Dylan Jackson hanged himself after suffering severe 'lows' from weekend-long cocaine and alcohol binges, an inquest heard. His parents said he had never showed signs of depression . He had also completed 10k runs with his stepfather Stephen Dwyer, who described him as 'my training partner and my soulmate'. Following one weekend party in September, Mr Dwyer found his stepson's body in his garden shed in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, after phoning local hospitals in a desperate bid to find him. Yesterday a coroner recorded an open verdict, but said cocaine and alcohol had a 'dangerous effect' on the teenager and  it would have caused 'impairment of judgement'. The inquest heard Mr Jackson would stay out from Friday until Sunday visiting  friends' homes, pubs and nightclubs where he would drink and take cocaine. On Monday mornings his parents said he would be a on a 'massive low' which could last for up to three days, and he would not want to go to his night shift job. Fundraiser: The 19-year-old (left) ran the Tough Mudder assault course with stepfather Stephen Dwyer (right) His mother Michaela Dwyer, 38, said she assumed her son was using cocaine around a year before he died. Mr Jackson told her he was not taking drugs, despite text messages about them on his mobile phone. 'I knew it had been going on,' she told the inquest. 'He wasn't coming home all weekend, he was rough going to work on Monday. 'He would say he didn't want to go and I said ""that's because you are taking drugs and it will make you feel like this"". Damning: Coroner Alan Walsh (pictured) said cocaine was 'one of the evils of our society' 'He did admit about two weeks before he died that he had some funny thoughts where he mentioned about one day when he stopped on a bridge and wanted to throw himself from the bridge. 'I told him how devastated we would be if he ever did anything like that.' On the night before his death Mr Jackson was said by a friend to be 'dancing' and in 'good spirits' on a night out, and he talked of visiting Blackpool to see a DJ. He then took a taxi back to the family home with friends, the inquest heard. His mother and stepfather were on a night away, but the noise disturbed his sister Bethany. Mrs Dwyer said: 'I got a phone call from Bethany saying he had all his mates in. 'I asked him to get them out the house because his sister was due to get up for work the following day and didn't want to be disturbed. He said ""I'm sorry"" and that was the last thing he said to me. 'If he hadn't have been under the influence he wouldn't have harmed himself.' Mr and Mrs Dwyer returned home on Saturday afternoon  to find Mr Jackson missing. By 7pm the next day, he still was not home and the family frantically phoned local hospitals and  his friends in a bid to find him. At around 11pm the same day, Mr Dwyer, a railway engineer, looked in his shed to find his stepson's body. Toxicology tests showed Mr Jackson had cocaine in his system and was more than twice the drink drive limit at the time of his death. His stepfather told the hearing: 'He would be down in himself after the weekend. It would affect him for about three days. He would be on a massive low. 'We loved him so much. He had everything to live for and I can't understand it. Soulmates: Stephen Dwyer and his stepson. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict and said: 'Cocaine is one of the evils of our society, particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol' 'My view is that most teenagers go through periods where nothing is going right and for him to do that it had to be something else. It had to be a major comedown from some drug or something affecting his brain to make him do that.' Coroner Alan Walsh recorded an open verdict and said: 'Dylan's family believe, and I accept, he had everything to live for. 'He was a young man who committed himself to help others, particularly in raising money for those less fortunate than himself by going on runs for charity. A Class A drug, cocaine is a powerful stimulant with short-lived effects. This means it makes users feel confident, happy, hyper-alert and awake, leading some to appear arrogant or aggressive. It raises the body’s temperature, makes the heart beat faster and reduces the appetite. But many users experience a lengthy 'comedown' when the effects of the drug wear off. This crash can last for days after heavy use of the drug. The effects are worse when cocaine is taken with alcohol, because the two drugs interact to product a toxic substance in the liver called cocaethylene. This can increase the depressive effects of alcohol, making the reaction to  cocaine stronger and making the user more likely to be aggressive. Cocaethylene also takes longer to flush out of the user's system than   alcohol or  cocaine, subjecting the heart and liver to a longer period of stress. Sources: Frank and Drink Aware . 'It is important I pay testament to Dylan for those efforts he made largely of his own volition to raise money for those less fortunate than himself. He was a young man the family should be proud of. 'He was a young man who enjoyed socialising and going out with friends. He seemed to enjoy a drink and without knowing how or why he became involved with cocaine. 'Cocaine is one of the evils of our society, particularly if taken by young people and particularly if taken with alcohol. The risks and dangerous effects on the brains of young people and the judgement of young people is there to be seen in relation to the death of Dylan Jackson. 'He was already planning to go out with his friends the following week and had planned runs and was not someone who had indicated any intention to harm himself in the past when free of alcohol and drugs. 'He would have had impairment of judgement caused by alcohol and the dreadful effects of cocaine. 'Sometimes coroners are able to give stark warnings on the way it not only places lives in jeopardy and causes the deaths of young people but also the devastating effect to families and loved ones who have lost a young, vibrant and caring individual. 'Dylan was a caring young man who should remembered for his charitable intents and equally for the jeopardy he placed himself in by the use of cocaine.' After the hearing, Mr Dwyer said: 'It's such a tragedy losing such a wonderful person, me and his mum loved him so deeply. 'It basically shows the dangers of taking drugs and alcohol and what they can do to you. He is a massive loss to not only us but the community as a whole. 'I have lost my training partner, my best friend and my soul mate, in a way.' Mr Dwyer already plans to run this year's Tough Mudder and the Bupa 10k run in Manchester in his stepson's memory.

"A small village in Staffordshire is fighting to keep the name of their local pub and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple. Yarnsfield locals have battled for 20 years to keep the sign in the 166-year-old Labour In Vain pub, after it was first removed in 1994 after two 10-year-old girls complained. It was then replaced by a farmer sowing seeds. In 2001, then-licensees Christine and John Glover found the sign and hung it in the beer garden, prompting the Stafford and District Racial Equality Council to request it be removed from view. The sign was given less prominence, but remained on display in the garden. A small village in Staffordshire is fighting to keep the name of their local pub - Labour In Vain - and its original signage which shows a black boy being scrubbed in the bath by a white couple . The original sign, featuring a white couple engaged  trying to scrub a black boy white, was removed in 1994 after two young girls complained that it was racist; it was then subject to a council letter in 2001 asking for it to be removed from view, before being displayed again in 2009 . In 2009 Vince Hannant and Debbie Donovan took over the pub and again there was talk that the 'sign should come down'. But at the time Mr Hannant was reported as saying the locals told him, 'Don't even touch it, we've been though so much to keep it.' Pub regular Richard Charwood was said to have then arranged a referendum of villagers to find out if they wanted to keep it. They were reportedly overwhelmingly in favour of doing so. The pub is presently closed undergoing renovations, and the owner, Enterprise brewery, has said it is now considering changing the name, but won't say what they might change it to. The future of the controversial sign also remains unclear. A Enterprise spokeswoman said 'no decision' has been made about whether it will remain as part of the pubs' fixtures and decorations. It is understood that Enterprise may rename the pub the Yarnfield Arms. Pub regular Jimmy Cawdell, 56, said: 'If it goes ahead, which we're sure it will, it will be political correctness gone mad. In 2009 Vince Hannant and Debbie Donovan, pictured, took over the pub and again there was talk that the 'sign should come down', but the licencees were told to keep it up as the locals had fought so hard to keep it . 'We are too upset about offending people these days, even if it means sacrificing our pub heritage. 'Everybody is outraged. There is not one person who uses this pub that thinks the name or the sign is racist. 'It should stay as it is because the pub is an integral part of the village's history.' Local John Rogers, 80, said he fears the pub and village will lose its identity and its heritage if the name is changed. He added: 'It has been called the Labour In Vain for more than 100 years. 'They only want to change the name to attract interest and deceive people into thinking it's a new pub. 'I hope the people in the village boycott a new name, I really do.' The original sign was replaced with this one, showing a field being attacked by gulls immediately after being ploughed; the pub's new owner, Enterprise, is now considering changing its name and it is not known if the original sign will remain at the premises . Diane Lander, who runs Yarnfield Post Office, has set up a petition that has so far gained 300 signatures. The 47-year-old said: ' There is strong opposition against it. It has been the Labour In Vain for 166 years. ' Brian Eyre, who sits on Yarnfield Parish Council, added: 'In the past there a little bit of aggravation on the name and the sign because it is not seen as politically correct and caused a race row. 'I can understand why the people in the village want to retain the name as it is part of our heritage.' But Mr Eyre said he also understood why Enterprise might want to change the pub's name. 'In the 25 years I have lived here the pub has closed a couple of times and the tenants don't seem to survive very long. 'It has to be a positive that Enterprise wants to invest the pub and village because at the moment it's not particularly attractive.' A spokesman for Enterprise Inns said: 'We are currently reviewing several options for this popular village pub with the aim of having it back open and trading at the heart of the Yarnfield community as soon as possible.'","The Labour In Vain pub has been serving Staffordshire locals for 166 years .

"When snow began falling across northern England last week four excited sisters rushed to windows of their house to await the first flakes of winter, eager to build a snowman. But Kacey, nine, Heidi, seven, Maisy, five and Erin Reynolds, four, were left bitterly disappointed when their village of Poppelton, near York, remained frost-free. However, not to be deterred, father Nick, 48, packed the family into his van and drove more than 40 miles to the North York Moors where several inches of snow had fallen over previous weeks. Snowy: (Left to right) Erin, four, Kacey, nine, Heidi, seven and Maisy Reynolds, five, pose with father Nick, 48, with the snowman they made despite their village near York remaining frost-free . Hero: Mr Reynolds drove his daughters 40 miles to the North York Moors to build Snowy after no snow fell on Poppleton, just outside York where the family lives with mother Joanne, 42 . Once there the group used stones, planks of wood, sunglasses and a hardhat to build a snowman, who they named Snowy. But when the time came to leave the girls couldn't bear to be parted with their creation - so dad Nick helped them dismantle it, roll it into his van, and transported it back home. Snowy has now taken pride of place at the end of the family driveway, leaving other residents baffled because there is no snow for miles around. Mother Joanne, 42, said: 'They built a snowman and brought the snowman home by dismantling him and rolling him into their dad’s van. Joy: The girls constructed Snowy on Sunday using planks of wood, gloves, stones, sunglasses a scarf and hardhat, but when it came time for them to leave him behind they couldn't bare to do it . Far from home: Mr Reynolds helped the girls to carefully dismantle the snowman, roll it into the back of his van, and then drove it an hour home before reassembling it at the end of their drive . Freezing: While there has been no snow in Poppleton, the sub-zero temperatures of recent days have meant the snowman lives on, much to the bemusement of passers-by . 'We could not believe the response. People have been coming taking photographs. People have been going out of their way to see it.' Mr Reynolds, who helps to run a landscaping business with his wife, had promised his daughters they would go sledging once the snow came. But when the wet weather didn't make it to them, he said he would take them to the snow instead, and they drove off in search of some on Sunday. Job well done: Mrs Reynolds said that Snowy has brought joy to the village of Poppleton, with people diverting from miles around to come and see him and take pictures . Standing out: Residents have been left scratching their heads by the snowman which has appeared in the centre of Poppleton despite there being no snow for miles around . Since bringing him back to his new home on their front lawn, passers-by have been scratching their heads wondering where he came from. Mrs Reynolds added: 'One woman asked if it was real snow. We have just had comments galore. It’s just brought a lot of joy to Poppleton.' She added: 'There are lots of school children that go past and they just stop and stare.'","Kacey, Heidi, Maisy, and Erin Reynolds wanted to build snowman in garden .

"Hundreds of terrified parents were left panicking after a school wrongly reported their children were missing after accidentally sending them a bulk truancy text using its automated service. On Monday, the parents of children at Wadebridge School in Cornwall received the text message saying their kids had not arrived for the day. But when they frantically called the school they were told the message had been sent in error. Despite the school's initial claims there was an issue with its automated truancy service, it was later confirmed that the message was sent after a mistake was made by those operating the service. The message was accidentally sent to hundreds of parents whose children attend Wadebridge School (pictured) Pictured is the letter sent from the school to parents regarding the erroneous text. Despite initially saying there had been a error with the service, it was later discovered a user had made the mistake . One grandmother said that her daughter, who has a child at the secondary school, had been 'frightened to death' by the text. She said: 'She went haring to the school. She thought something had happened to my grandchild. She's still in a state of shock now.' Sharon Meehan, 42, works at the Molesworth Arms Hotel in Wadebridge. She has a son in year seven called Patrick. She said: 'My husband got the message and rang me while I was at work. He was going mental because obviously we both thought that Patrick was in school. 'I thought he had not gone to school that morning, had walked out or just missed registration. It is worrying though, especially when you are at work and your son has only just started at the school. 'What's worse is that it took me half an hour to get through and this is the second time this has happened to me. My husband works away and it is really hard to imagine what would have happened if Patrick had genuinely gone missing. The school need to sort it out.' Gabriella Cleave, 38, of Wadebridge, is unemployed, and received the text to say her son Jake, 12, was absent from the school. Pictured is the text message, sent by accident, and received by parents asking why their child was absent . She said: 'It was a bit of a strange experience to go through. I was at home and this text came through to say that Jake was absent. 'That sparked off a big panic. I knew that Jake had got on the bus up the road, so I phoned my husband panicking. 'All kinds of potential scenarios were going through my head. I thought the bus might have crashed or someone might have grabbed him – all kinds of things were going through my mind. 'It was worrying. I was trying to phone the school for about 30 minutes but I could not get through as it was engaged. I just thought – where on earth is he? Jake is not one to play truant and I had never seen a message like that before. 'After a while I phoned a friend, who said she had got the same message about her son and we started to think someone might have hacked the school’s message system. 'But none of us could not get through to the school. I think every parent must have been trying to get through. 'Some of the parents have been saying it was not that bad. But me and my friends were very worried. 'I still cannot understand how it happened. At first I was a bit angry – but now I am just confused by it all. And just thankful it turned out that nothing had happened to my son.' Parent Melanie Barber, said: 'I was concerned that my daughter wasn't at school, but as the school switchboard was then constantly engaged for 10 minutes, I made the assumption that lots of people were calling in, and so it was likely that the message had been sent to a lot of people. Headteacher Tina Yardley (pictured) has since apologised to all parents who received the alarming message . Another mother, who asked not to be named, confirmed she had received the text alongside an apology approximately 20 minutes later. She said: 'I heard that they contacted every single person they had a number for by accident. 'It must have been hundreds and hundreds of people. Obviously there is an amusing slant but as a parent receiving that text it was really worrying. 'Even if you knew where your child was, like I did, you still question it.' Headteacher Tina Yardley apologised to parents who received the text. She said the school uses electronic alerts if a child fails to arrive - but was 'completely unaware' of the problem until messages started to flood in. 'We use the 'Truancy Call' system to send a text to the parent or carer to alert them to a child being absent in the morning register,' she said. 'This will always take place before 11am. Parents and carers then text back at various points during the day to explain why.' Ms Yardley said that on Monday their attendance officer was trying to see if they had received any new messages but instead sent a 'truancy text'. Parents got the message just after 2pm. Ms Yardley would not disclose what was in the message but it is thought that it contained the child's name, said they were absent from school and asked the parents to call or respond. Staff were only made aware of the mistake by children asking questions and parents calling the office. Although it was initially claimed it was the fault of the automated truancy system, Ms Yardley later said it was an 'administrative' issue.","School administrators accidentally sent a truancy text message to parents .

"Innocent Mohamed Navid Bashir, of West Yorkshire, was locked up for three days after he was wrongly identified as a man wanted in Scotland on fraud charges . An innocent chef was kept locked up in prison for three days - despite repeatedly telling police they had got the wrong man. Mohamed Navid Bashir found himself wrongly locked up after a traffic patrol pulled his car over in Calderdale, West Yorkshire, on December 15 last year. His fingerprints were taken, and a search of the police national computer appeared to reveal Mr Bashir, of Elland, was wanted on a warrant for failing to appear at court on a fraud charge in Scotland. The officers detained the father at Halifax Police Station for the next 26 hours, before he was carted off to Glasgow, where he was kept for another night - all the time professing his innocence to the authorities. Mr Bashir even had a different name to the man they were looking for. It was only when he appeared at magistrates court that the enormity of the mistake was acknowledged - when the real wanted man's lawyer appeared and told the court, 'that's not my client', according to the Huddersfield Daily Examiner. 'It was like an episode of a police comedy, except it wasn’t funny for me or my family,' Mr Bashir, 35, told the Express. Mr Bashir, who ended up missing his son's first nativity play, is now suing West Yorkshire Police. His case was raised today in Prime Minister's Questions by his local MP Craig Whittaker after the police 'failed' to answer Mr Bashir's questions. The Tory MP asked David Cameron to get Home Secretary Theresa May to look into the case. Mr Cameron promised he would discuss it with Ms May, adding: 'This does sound a very concerning case. My understanding is that West Yorkshire Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the arrest and detention of Mr Bashir.' Following it being discussed in the House of Commons, West Yorkshire Police have now admitted the error - although they say it was not their fault. Mr Bashir, who was stopped by traffic officers in West Yorkshire, found himself in Glasgow - where the lawyer for the wanted man finally got the authorities to reveal their mistake . Mr Bashir's local MP Craig Whittaker brought the case up in Prime Minister's Questions today, asking David Cameron to speak to Home Secretary Theresa May.  Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, of West Yorkshire Police, has since admitted the mistake - but said it happened 'in good faith' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom explained Mr Bashir's identity 'had been circulated in error'. 'Mr Bashir was an entirely innocent party and has been wrongfully arrested and detained in custody,' he acknowledged. 'However, West Yorkshire Police were not responsible for the error that led to his arrest, with our subsequent actions being conducted unaware of the error and in good faith. 'We have responded to Mr Bashir's solicitors outlining the circumstances and suggesting they may wish to raise the matter further with Police Scotland. 'Although we may not have been responsible for Mr Bashir's distressing experience, we very much regret our involvement and a senior officer will be meeting with him personally.'","Mohamed Naved Bashir, of Halifax, was wrongly imprisoned for three days .

"Experts today named discount supermarket Aldi as the best place to buy wine with some of its £3.99 bottles judged better that ones being sold elsewhere for £45. The budget supermarket was named the new wine retailer of the year at the prestigious Drinks Retailing Awards, beating previous winner Waitrose, and top drinks merchant Majestic Wine. The award, designed to celebrate the best wine merchants in the country, is the latest accolade Aldi has received for its wine range. Last year  the retailer - which sells wine from just £2.99 a bottle - was handed 121 medals at international competitions. Scroll down for video . Cream of the crop: Budget supermarket Aldi has been named as the best place to buy wine - stealing the crown from last year's winner Waitrose. It is the latest in a series of gongs for the German discount chain . Cheap: The supermarket giant's wines - including a Baron Saint Jean rosé (left) - start at just £2.99. One of the cheapest medal-winners last year was its £3.99 Kooliburra reserve Shiraz (right), which won a silver medal . These included Gold at the International Wine Challenge for its Caversham Cream Sherry, which costs £5.25. It was also given Gold at the Decanter World Wine Awards for The Exquisite Collection Plan de Dieu, which costs £6.49. It was one of only six Rhone reds in the world to receive a gold medal . Other awards included a Gold at the International Wine Challenge for The Exquisite Collection Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (£7.99); the only dry sauvignon blanc to win. And Aldi's Kooliburra Australian Shiraz Cabernet 2013 (£3.99) got a Silver award at the International Wine & Spirits Competition, beating a host of expensive bottles. These included the Eileen Hardy Shiraz 2010, which typically retails at £45 - 11 times the price of the Aldi winner. Cheap: Aldi wines won 121 medals in international competitions last year, including gold for its Caversham Cream Sherry, which costs £5.25 (left) and its £7.99 Exquisite Collection Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (right) Beaten: Last year's winner Waitrose had its crown stolen - but won five awards including for cider and spirits . Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, . By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since. Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year. The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount. After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world. The panel of experts crowned Aldi best retailer at an awards ceremony in London last night. Tony Baines, MD Buying at Aldi, said: 'We're thrilled to receive this fantastic award. It's a real testament to the excellent quality wines our talented team work tirelessly to deliver. 'Our close relationships with some of the best suppliers from around the world enable us to bring the best quality wines to our customers, whether they cost £3 or £10'. It stocks wines costing between £2.99 and £9.99, with more expensive, 'premium wines' introduced at Christmas. It was not all bad news for Waitrose, however - as the upmarket retailer managed to win five other awards compared to Aldi's one. While Aldi scooped the gong for wine, Waitrose won prizes for cider, spirits and champagne. It was also named supermarket of the year and online retailer of the year. It came as an influential report found class and snobbery are no longer a barrier for middle-class families when it comes to shopping at budget stores. A study shows 45 per cent of wealthy households have stopped at Aldi or Lidl in the past three months – exactly the same percentage as for lower income families. While the budget chains have made their name by selling household essentials at low prices, they have also made a concerted move to attract the wealthy with upmarket food and drink offerings. Tim Wilson, of the Wilson Drinks Report, which carried out the survey, said: 'Any perceived embarrassment at being seen shopping at the discounters has now gone.'","German chain stole crown from Waitrose at the Drinks Retailing Awards .

"Two thugs forced a former trainee butcher to help them cut off his own toe in a torture ordeal described by a judge as 'like a Quentin Tarantino movie'. Richard Headford was bundled into a Mercedes by Blake Waldron and Curtis Jewell after they accused him of stealing drugs from them. He was driven to a property in Campian Walk, Inns Court, Bristol, where he was forced to sit in a chair and choose between losing a finger or toe. Using his knowledge as a butcher, terrified Mr Headford instructed Waldron on the cleanest way to sever his little toe to prevent a worse injury. Blake Waldron (left) and Curtis Jewell (right) were sentenced to a total of 19 years jail for the terrifying crime . Wannabe gangster Waldron, 24, pocketed the digit and told his bleeding victim he could only have it back in return for £3,000. Judge Martin Picton jailed Waldron for 11 years and three months and Jewell, 22, was sentenced to eight years and eight months at Bristol Crown Court. Jailing them, he said: 'The scene that played out, as graphically portrayed on the prosecution papers, is reminiscent of the sort of thing that might be expected to feature in a Quentin Tarantino movie or the like. 'For your victim this was an utterly terrifying event, in the course of which he, for good reason, believed he was to die.' The court heard Waldron asked Mr Headford to look after a parcel of drugs for a day in return for £200 in June last year. But when Waldron picked it up, he claimed 'seven ounces' were missing and that Mr Headford had opened the package and removed drugs. Although no drugs were ever recovered, police said they suspected it to be a Class A narcotic. The following month Waldron picked up 'terrified' Mr Headford in his black Mercedes and with Jewell in the back, drove him to a house and produced what appeared to be a black handgun. Waldron demanded £3,000 upfront and then £7,000 in a month, and told Mr Headford to call his father for the cash, but he couldn't help. Distraught Mr Headford was told to sit in an armchair while Jewell appeared with a large bread knife, and a hammer, knife and some ties were taken from a bag and laid in front of him. While he protested his innocence, Jewell put his knife to his face and told him to shut up, and Waldron told Mr Headford to choose between losing a toe or a finger. Mr Mooney said: 'Mr Headford was relieved. He felt that the loss of a limb was preferable to death. 'He told Waldron he was prepared to lose the little toe in his left foot.' After Jewell laid a sheet of plastic on the floor, Waldron told Headford to remove his shoe and sock and picked up a knife with a curved blade but repeatedly swung it and missed. Mr Headford was driven to a property at Campian Walk (pictured), Inns Court, before being confronted with the gun and knife . Mr Mooney added: 'Mr Headford told him if he carried on like that he would take half his foot off. He assisted in his own mutilation to prevent a worse thing happening. 'He asked for tissues, placed them between his little toe and next toe, and instructed Waldron in the most effective way to remove his toe. 'He asked him to get closer and chop it off, rather than hack it off.' Mr Mooney said that it took several attempts to remove the toe, adding: 'Socks and cable were shoved into the mouth of Mr Headford to prevent him from crying out in the agony he must have been feeling.' The court heard Waldron wrapped the toe in tissue, put it in his pocket, and said he would return it for £3,000 telling his victim: 'I'm on a downer now. I don't really like hurting people.' Mr Headford went to hospital and while his foot healed, he said the experience was a 'nightmare'. In a statement, the trainee butcher from Knowle West, Bristol, said: 'I left the area immediately. I left all my family and friends behind and left Bristol. 'It has put a huge strain on my relationship and I've moved several times.' Mr Mooney said the ordeal of 'calculated barbarism' was designed to 'establish himself as a feared criminal'. He added: 'The violence and torture meted out to Richard Headford had a greater purpose. They were designed to let those involved in crime know Mr Waldron had arrived and were he to be crossed this would be the result on those who crossed him.' Both the men from Knowle West, Bristol, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Timothy Rose, defending Jewell, said his client picked up the knife but did not use it, but admitted he had previously been convicted of GBH, when he bit a man's ear during a fight. Farah Rashid, defending Waldron, said: 'Mr Waldron takes full responsibility for the offence and his actions. Extreme low intelligence may well have contributed to this.'","Richard Headford was accused of stealing drugs from two men in Bristol .

"A mother of three is in a critical condition in hospital after she fell into the path of a van following a row with another woman outside the school gates. Robyn McHale, 28, was airlifted to hospital after she fell in front of the van outside Forres Primary School in Hoddeson in Hertfordshire. Friends and relatives have claimed that Miss McHale, a former beauty queen, had previously complained she was being bullied outside the school gates. Robyn McHale is in hospital fighting for her life after she fell into the path of a van and suffered head injuries, shortly after being involved in a row with another parent at the gates of Forres Primary School in Hoddesdon . Miss McHale suffered head injuries after the accident and was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital on Monday afternoon. Police arrested a 38-year-old woman and a 15-year-old girl at the scene of the crash but the pair were released without charge last night after officers said they had not committed any crime related to the accident. A family friend of Miss McHale, a former beauty queen, said they were 'shattered' by the news. They told The Sun: 'She complained that she was being bullied at the school gates and by one woman in particular. When she complained to the school the woman confronted her outside.' Dean Patient, chief inspector for Broxbourne, said at the time they had been 'aware of a brief exchange between the injured woman and another woman'. He said: 'This will be an extremely difficult time for the woman's family and friends and our thoughts are with them. The former beauty queen fell into the path of a van outside Forres Primary School and suffered head injuries . 'An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident was undertaken and this has now been reviewed by detectives from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit. 'Following this investigation and review, the two people arrested yesterday, a woman and a teenage girl, will face no further action as there is no evidence to suggest that the two arrested have any criminal liability for what happened.' The accident took place outside Forres Primary . Police said the driver of the van had fully cooperated with inquiries and dispelled rumours that he had failed to stop after the accident. Parents also commented on social media after the incident. Nicole Amber wrote on Facebook: 'Was a fight really worth a child potentially losing a parent?' Chloe Chapman posted: 'I can't believe what I've herd god bless you and the kids, I really hope you pull through Robyn McHale thinking of you all at this terrible time lots of love.' Ms McHale was previously Hoddeson's carnival queen.","Robyn McHale was airlifted to hospital after falling into path of a van .

"The manned version of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is ready to undergo a series of crucial safety tests in a bid to return America to manned spaceflight. Nasa hopes the capsule, dubbed Dragon V2, will be ready to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station by 2017. SpaceX recently posted two photos of the test vehicle on Twitter, writing: 'America's next-gen crewed spacecraft is almost ready for a test flight. Pad abort vehicle shipping to Florida shortly.' Scroll down for video . The manned version of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft is ready to undergo a series of crucial safety tests. Nasa hopes the capsule, dubbed Dragon V2, will be ready to take astronauts to the ISS by 2017 . The 'pad abort' trial, which will take place in the next few weeks, will reveal how the Soyuz-replacement will behave if there is a problem during launch. Former astronaut Garrett Reisman explained that during the test, Dragon will sit on a truss structure instead of a Falcon 9 rocket. 'We're going to have a crash-test dummy inside and a prototype seat, so we'll get data from that,' Reisman said. 'We're going to have a very flight-like propulsion system as far as everything that goes into the abort, including the avionics, which are going to be identical to the avionics we plan for the flight vehicle.' The 'pad abort' trial, which will take place in the next few weeks, will reveal how the Soyuz-replacement will behave if there is a problem during launch. Pictured a flight engineers preparing the prototype craft . SpaceX recently posted two photos of the test vehicle on Twitter, writing: 'America's next-gen crewed spacecraft is almost ready for a test flight. Pad abort vehicle shipping to Florida shortly. Eight SuperDraco rocket engines will push the spacecraft away from the truss platform, launching it several thousand feet into the air. Three parachutes will then unfurl and the Dragon will, hopefully, land the Atlantic Ocean just offshore Cape Canaveral. If all goes to plan, the second test will see SpaceX' Dragon 2 take to the sky on a Falcon 9 rocket. In September, Nasa revealed that Boeing and SpaceX will both build America's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Boeing will be the first commercial company to carry a Nasa astronaut to space in July 2017 under a contract with the US space agency, followed by its competitor SpaceX, officials said last month. Nasa is funneling billions of dollars to both companies so that they can replace American access to the orbiting International Space Station after the US space shuttle program was retired in 2011. The announcement of $4.2 billion for Boeing and $2.6 billion for SpaceX was made in September 2014. However, a legal challenge by Sierra Nevada -- which was developing a space-shuttle-like vehicle called Dream Chaser and was closed out of the competition -- meant that officials could not reveal many details until now. Commercial Crew Program Manager Kathy Lueders said at a press conference in Houston, Texas that Boeing would be the first to make two contracted missions to carry Nasa astronauts, since it has completed two milestones so far, and SpaceX just one. The long-awaited $6.8bn deal to replace the Space Shuttle and end reliance on Russia's Soyuz craft was revealed at the Kennedy Space Center, where launches will take place from 2017. Under the deal, Boeing will be given $4.2 billion and SpaceX $2.6 billion. Nasa hopes it will spur private development in space. 'Ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that's the vision of a commercial space industry,' said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one Nasa astronaut aboard to verify the rocket and spacecraft system can launch and dock to the space station. Once each company's test program has been completed successfully, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station. SpaceX and Boeing said last month that they are on track to carry out their first manned test flights to the space station in 2017. U.S. manned launches ended with the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. Until SpaceX and Boeing begin flying crews from Cape Canaveral, Nasa astronauts must continue to hitch rocket rides with Russia. Nasa's commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the average price for a seat aboard the SpaceX Dragon and Boeing CST-100 capsules will be $58 million. That compares with $71 million a seat charged by Russia under its latest Nasa contract. If all goes to plan, the second test will see SpaceX' Dragon 2 take to the sky on a Falcon 9 rocket. Elon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX, left, sits with guests inside the Manned Dragon V2 Space Taxi in Hawthorne, California . Former astronaut Garrett Reisman explained that during the test, Dragon will sit on a truss structure instead of a Falcon 9 rocket. Pictured is a prototype model of the Dragon craft . 'I don't ever want to have to write another check' to the Russian Space Agency after 2017, said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden, a former shuttle commander. 'If we can make that date,' he said, referring to 2017, 'I'm a happy camper.' Unlike the Russian charge, the $58 million per-person cost estimate includes a fair amount of cargo to be flown aboard the SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft, along with four crew members. The Russian Soyuz holds a maximum of three people, with at least one a Russian to pilot the craft. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the future enhanced Dragon capsule could carry five astronauts — one more than Nasa's stipulated four - and still meet all the cargo requirements. The Hawthorne, California, company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, was the space station's first commercial shipper. It's been successfully delivering supplies since 2012 with the Dragon. Boeing's CST will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations from 2017, it was revealed . Boeing's vice president and general manager for Houston-based space exploration, John Elbon, said an unmanned test flight of the CST-100 capsule in 2017 will be followed a few months later by the first crewed test flight. That first manned mission will include one Boeing test pilot and one NASA astronaut, he said. SpaceX said an unmanned test flight could occur as early as 2016, followed by a crewed flight in 2017. Bolden has previous said Nasa wouldn't be able to do deep-space exploration if it was still saddled with getting supplies and people to low-Earth orbit. 'We're about going to Mars,' he said. The Boeing capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule .","The pad abort test will take place in Florida in the next few weeks .

"If you didn't get a chance to watch the Super Bowl adverts, don't despair - the most popular of Sunday night's commercials have been recreated in Lego. Stop-motion animated film Brick Bowl film follows an American football fan as he wanders into the Super Bowl adverts for brands such as T-Mobile, Snickers and Toyota. The figure is seen searching for a lost dog in a take on Busweiser's emotional ad, photo bombing a Lego Kim Kardashian's tennis selfie for T-mobile and taking on a challenger in a version of Skittles' arm wrestling competition. Brick Bowl, by UK-based A+C Studios, refashioned scenes from this year's crop of Super Bowl ads, including Snickers and Skittles, using thousands of Lego bricks . The three and a half minute video was created using thousands of Lego bricks by the UK-based A+C Studios within just 36 hours. Most Super Bowl adverts are kept under wraps until they air during the game so the animators had to work quickly to recreate the content. Dan Richards, director at A+C Studios, told the Telegraph: 'Stop motion productions can take anywhere between four months to four years to make. Turning this animation around in 36 hours and working with Lego to recreate the most prestigious ad slot in history into a new story has been a huge accomplishment.' The stop-motion animation film includes scenes from Budweiser's emotional lost dog story advert . The Skittles arm wrestling competition advert also features with the figure, and dog spot, arriving to challenge a competitor . A+C was the studio behind last year's animated advert from Harrods which tells the story of a mouse turning on the store's Christmas lights. The studio used a big team of model makers, animators, editors and storyboard artists, along with specialized animation software and equipment to create the film. The film kicks off with the fan settling down on his sofa to watch the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks when the TV coverage cuts to the break and he dives into the commercials . Esurance's Breaking Bad parody, As he falls through each ad, the figure is also seen being chased through a maze by Bud Light's Pac Man, a disastrous attempt t snowboarding with Amy Purdy for Toyota's and a tense chat with a Lego Walter White in Esurance's Breaking Bad parody. Katy Perry's half-time ends with the Lego figure accidentally throwing an axe at the singer and knocking her off her ride . Snickers' Brady Bunch remake, Katy Perry's half-time show and Jurassic Park's new trailer were also featured. This year's Super Bowl game attracted a record 114.4m viewers to the live broadcast with advertisers baying to get a slice of air time. As the most expensive advertising slot in the world, just 30 seconds of air time costs $4.5m (£2.97m). Budweiser's story of the lost dog was rated the best ad of the Super Bowl by USA Today's Ad Meter, which asks a consumer panel of roughly 6,700 people to vote for each advert. Busweiser's was also declared the Super Bowl's most viral ad, racking up more than 2m shares by Monday.","Stop-motion animated film Brick Bowl recreates the best Super Bowl ads .

"He was abandoned at a train station, left with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy. Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed became the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with the case. But now, after dozens of offers from across the world to give the animal a new home, Kai has a new owner. Ian Russell, 52, was chosen by the Scottish SPCA from a list of hundreds of people who wanted to give him a home. Scroll down for video . Kai, the dog found abandoned and tied to railings at a train station with a suitcase containing his belongings, has a new owner in Ian Russell - one of hundreds of people from around the world who offered him a home . Kai was discovered just after Christmas with the suitcase - containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy . 'When I heard about Kai I knew the little guy needed a break but I never thought in a million years I'd get him,' said Mr Russell, a self-employed hydraulic engineer from Newton Mearns in East Renfrewshire. 'I called the Scottish SPCA just to check he was OK and see if there was anything I could do to help. Fast-forward a few weeks and here I am taking him home. I honestly think it was meant to be.' Mr Russell's pet Dalmatian died just before Christmas and he said getting Kai was like winning the lottery. He added: 'I work all over Scotland, mainly outdoors, driving wherever I'm needed in my van. Kai will come with me and when it's appropriate I'll let him out to run around and play safely while I work. Then we'll jump back into the van together and head to the next place. We'll be able to hang out all the time.' Kai was discovered by railway staff on January 2 after an internet sale fell through. He was left there by Fin Rayner who claims she was tricked into buying him on Gumtree. The animal was found looking forlorn, tied to a railing and accompanied by a case containing a pillow, toy, food and bowl. The Shar-Pei crossbreed was taken in by the SSPCA who managed to fundraise to operate on his eyes . The images of the abandoned dog went round the world and the animal welfare charity said people from as far afield as New York, Canada, Hong Kong, Spain and the Philippines offered to give him a new home. The charity received almost 200 offers to rehome the dog. Scottish SPCA animal care assistant Alan Grant said: 'Kai's story was really sad and many people likened him to Paddington Bear, given he was found alone at a railway station with his suitcase. 'One of the reasons we chose Ian was right from the start he said he was interested in rehoming Kai but he would take our advice if we thought one of the many other dogs in our care would suit him better. Kai was found with a painful eye condition but is now in good health after an operation funded by wellwishers . Mr Russell was chosen to give the animal a home and said getting Kai was just like 'winning the lottery' Mr Russell phoned the SSPCA after he learned of Kai's plight and offered to give him a home or help out . Ian Russell, from Aberdeen, said he never thought he would get Kai because of all the offers to rehome him . 'It was really important for us to select an owner who wanted Kai for all the right reasons and had really thought through their decision to take on a rescue dog. 'We know Kai will have a fantastic new life with Ian and we couldn't be happier for him. 'This is a great opportunity for us to remind people that we have hundreds of other animals in our care just like Kai who all need new homes.' Station staff looked after Kai when he was discovered on January 2, until the Scottish SPCA rescued him . After he was taken in by the Scottish SPCA Kai needed needed surgery for entropions, inward-curling eyelids. The charity set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the dog's £1,000 operation and managed to raise double the target in a day. There was also an enthusiastic response on social media, with author Irvine Welsh tweeting: 'If I was in Ayr that boy would be coming home with Welshy. Yes he would! Yes he would!’","Kai, a Shar-Pei crossbreed, was found abandoned at Ayr station, Scotland .

"Transport minister John Hayes (pictured) said today that Britain must build new roads that 'lift the soul' and banish the ugly and 'brutalist' monstrosities of the past . Britain must build new roads that 'lift the soul' and banish the ugly and 'brutalist' monstrosities of the past, Transport minister John Hayes said today. He announced that new highways will in future have to pass a 'beauty test' before they are built, with local residents and campaigners having a key voice in their design. They should 'invoke the spirit of poet Sir John Betjemen and be in 'harmony' with their surroundings and 'blend in' with the landscape rather than being 'brutalising, ugly and dull'. A special 'Roads Design Panel' comprised of campaign groups, architects, engineers, highways authorities and suppliers, would have vet a new highway's aesthetic appeal. Firms bidding for road contracts will have to consider beauty – not just cost-cutting budgets - when tendering. The aim is to end fifty years of brutalist blight since the 1960s when Britain got it 'very, very wrong' and to create a future where Britain is 'criss-crossed by award winning roads' rather than 'hideous footbridges.' Mr Hayes said: 'I want design to create new landmarks that will be featured in local guides for decades to come. 'I want new bridges that are not only useful but that are loved by the people who use them.' The Minister's plan to end decades of poorly designed highways in the countryside and inner-cities was unveiled at an event hosted by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England and the Campaign for Better Transport and attended by former Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion who chairs the CPRE. Mr Hayes said: 'There is a well-trodden path we have been down as a nation many times when it comes to major public projects over the past century – and that is the path of mere utility, of banality, even ugliness.' The former energy minister who insists 'wind turbines are 'simply ugly' said the view from the driver's seat of a legendary E-Type Jaguar should be as beautiful as the car itself: 'It's perhaps ironic that we care so much about car design, about the sleek lines gracing our sports saloons, about the leather trimmed interiors and the burr walnut dashboards…when the scene outside the car is often so ugly.' The former energy minister who insists 'wind turbines are 'simply ugly' said the view from the driver's seat of a legendary E-Type Jaguar (pictured) should be as beautiful as the car itself . The rot set in after the 1950s, he said: 'As the road network developed we seem to have cared less and less about good design. We grew to accept that roads and motorways must be intrinsically ugly.' But he insisted: 'I believe roads can lift the soul.' He made a strong connection between ugly roads and the 'failure of tower blocks as a social experiment' from the 1960s and '70s noting: 'It seems so obvious that beautiful buildings and places can places designed in harmony with nature can often lift the spirits and inspire people…while so many discordant, ugly, post-war tower blocks and housing estates have blighted lives and destroyed communities.' Mr Hayes drew on the Prince of Wales's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £15billion of new roads by 2020 . Announcing a 'fresh start', he said: 'Roads are part of our landscape. We cannot uninvent the car or order people to stay in the village of their birth. So we need to integrate roads into their surroundings, flowing with the landscape or concealing structures where possible.' He said: 'Beauty should not just be seen as a 'nice to have' something important that can enhance well-being. 'We want roads to be based on principles of good design'. And he noted: 'Good design need be no more expensive than bad design.' He said the Hindhead Bypass and the planned Stonehenge by-pass were examples of what could be achieved while the Boston Manor viaduct on the M4 was an example of what to avoid. Citing bold new stations on the railways he said: 'We have reclaimed the vision of Sir John Betjeman, whose statue rightly adorns the reborn St Pancras. 'I want to see a similar vision for our road network and for the service areas, the bridges and tunnels that are integral to it.' He stressed: 'Let's be absolutely clear. For a long time we got it very, very wrong. We allowed sub-standard, ubiquitous, drab, cheap, soul-sapping design to proliferate until it became the norm. And as a nation we shrugged our shoulders.' He also noted: 'As individuals we may not have liked it. But collectively as governments, local councils, highways authorities, motorist organisations, architects, we didn't do anything to change it.' But he stressed: 'Right now we have an opportunity to banish ugly design from new road schemes and make sure it never returns.' More tunnels and better noise barriers will help roads blend more easily into the landscape. But Cutting light pollution should not be at the expense of road safety. In 1994, Prince Charles began developing Poundbury (pictured), an eco-village in Dorset, inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning . As an example of what can be achieved, Roads minister John Hayes cited the recent Hindhead Tunnel bypass: 'A tunnel was built to bypass the village of Hindhead and remove a notorious traffic bottleneck. 'Developers planted 200,000 trees and shrubs to provide a magnificent haven for wildlife and lovers of our countryside.' The scheme reunited two previously split commons creating the largest area of lowland heath in Southern Britain and the National Trust sowed heather on broken earth where the old road had been. The A30 main road into Cornwall from Bodmin to Indian Queens – lined with local Cornish hedges of stone and vegetation - is another 'award-wining' scheme. The proposed Stonehenge Tunnel to bypass the ancient monument in Wiltshire is among the schemes that also exemplify ambitions for the future, as well as the A27 on the South Coast and the A417 in Gloucestershire where design and environmental concerns have been considered. He said: 'I want these schemes to be trail-blazers for the future – a future where Britain is criss-crossed by award-winning roads.' By contrast he cited the Boston Manor viaduct on the M4 as an example of what to avoid, describing it as 'a set of brutalist monoliths that seem to have escaped from the grimmer end of some American metropolis.' And with some councils fretting more about the plight of newts than the landscape, he said: 'Some recent examples of good practice have perhaps focussed too much on local amphibian populations.' Mr Hayes noted: 'Ring-roads, footbridges, underpasses and pedestrianisation have all served to create a destructive sense of alienation from the built environment.' He said he wanted to put 'pride' back into UK roads: 'Our goal is not just to undo the most intrusive road design of the past 50 years. It is to create new aesthetic values that reflect and even magnify the beauty of the local landscape.' Mr Hayes plans to appoint a special 'Roads Design Panel' including campaign groups such as the CPRE and architects, engineers and suppliers, to 'enhance the beauty of the countryside' while also involving local communities in planning. Local people would be involved early in design issues and at public consultation stage. Under the new proposals materials, size and pavements and other aspects of design could be considered locally . He also drew on the Prince of Wales's ten design principles set out last year as inspiration for government plans to build £15billion of new roads by 2020. In 1994, Prince Charles began developing Poundbury, an eco-village in Dorset, inspired by his ideas about architecture and planning. The eco-village – which is now home to 5,000 residents – was built so the houses, pedestrian-friendly streets, squares and lanes reflect the surrounding landscape and architecture. Sir Andrew Motion, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) and former Poet Laureate welcomed the ministers plans but said building new roads through the countryside should in any case be a 'last resort'. He said:'The Minister's ambition to create a greater harmony between our road network and our priceless countryside is a noble aim, and I wholeheartedly welcome his understanding that our roads must be improved for the benefit of communities and the countryside. 'I hope his ideas for blending existing roads with the landscape - while reducing the noise, air and light pollution they produce - are taken just as seriously by his colleagues in the Government. And in outlining such good ideas for improving our existing roads, it raises the question - why spend the vast majority of the DfT's budget on new roads?' Sir Andrew said: 'If we care about the countryside – its look, its feel, its sustainability, its durability - we must not trail yet more concrete highways through green fields, so they can simply fill up with more cars, emitting more fumes to hasten the death of the planet. New roads should always be an option of last resort.'","Roads minister John Hayes said new roads must pass 'beauty test'

"Only a small minority of people have ever seen the ghostly crimson lights that dance on top of thunderstorms. Known as 'red sprites', these rare flashes create red tendrils more than 50 miles (80 km) above the ground that last for just a few milliseconds. Now, photographer Petr Horálek has been able to capture this incredible sight at the La Silla Observatory on the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama desert. The Small and Large Magellanic Clouds can be seen just to the right of centre of the image and the faint green streak of a meteor just to the left of the Milky Way.These striking heavenly regulars are eclipsed, however, by the presence red sprites (bottom left of the main image). The six panels below the main image magnify a series of red sprites which were caught a few hours before daybreak . The Small and Large Magellanic Clouds can be seen just to the right of centre of the image and the faint green streak of a meteor just to the left of the Milky Way.

Named after Shakespeare’s mischievous sprites Puck, from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Ariel, from The Tempest, sprites are caused by irregularities in the ionosphere.

The incredible flashes of light are caused by huge electrical discharges of lightning in the sky, and they get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air. They can be seen in the D region of the ionosphere. This is the area of the atmosphere just above the dense lower atmosphere, about 37 to 56 miles (60 km to 90 km) above the Earth . Red sprites are electrical bursts of light that occur above highly active thunderstorms. They can be seen in the D region of the ionosphere. This is the area of the atmosphere just above the dense lower atmosphere, about 37 to 56 miles (60 km to 90 km) above the Earth. The incredible flashes get their deep red hue from nitrogen molecules in the air. Atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century, but their origins were a mystery. They only last a few milliseconds and are relatively dim compared with other lightning. The late experimental physicist John Winckler accidentally discovered sprites, while helping to test a new low-light video camera in 1989. Typically seen as groups of red-orange flashes, they are triggered by positive cloud-to-ground lightning. This is rarer and more powerful than its negative counterpart, as the lightning discharge originates from the upper regions of the cloud, further from the ground. In a short burst, the sprite extends rapidly downwards, creating dangling red tendrils before disappearing. The sprites pictured here occurred over the course of about 40 minutes and were most likely more than 310 miles (500km) away. In October, another photographer was able to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in Vivaro, Italy. Marko Korosec, 32, managed to capture the rare pictures whilst standing in a corn field, over 200 miles (320km) away from the phenomenon. 'Sprites are not easy to capture, and might occur just a few times in hours, but this storm system was very active this time. 'It was very difficult to get these shots as they are so rare and you simply have to be quite lucky that the storm will produce them. 'You might take hundreds of photos without capturing any of them,' added Mr Korosec, who works as a system administrator for highways in Slovenia. Atmospheric sprites have been known for nearly a century, but researchers have been baffled as to how, and why, they form. In May, Penn State University researchers managed to model the elusive phenomenon, which forms above thunderstorms and appears as a 'jellyfish' shape in the sky. They say they believe that sprites form at plasma irregularities and may be useful in remote sensing of the lower ionosphere – an area that facilitates radio communication on Earth. For decades, airline pilots were the only people lucky enough to catch sight of the natural phenomenon known as red sprites. Now one photographer has managed to capture this elusive light after spending months on the road following storms in Vivaro, Italy .

"Jordan's decision to execute its ISIS-linked prisoners in retaliation for the death of its pilot will only serve to fuel more revenge attacks by the terror group, a security analyst said today. The Kingdom hanged two jihadists this morning hours after vowing to avenge the death of Moaz al-Kasasbeh, who was shown being torched alive in a video released yesterday. Jordan has also promised to follow through on a threat to execute four other prisoners convicted of being associated with ISIS. But while such an uncompromising strategy may have struck a chord with the Jordanian public, security experts have warned of the dangers of adopting an eye-for-an-eye response. Andreas Krieg, a professor for defence studies at King's College London in Qatar, told MailOnline: 'The Jordanian response to the execution of their pilot was purely an act of blind revenge. Scroll down for video . The decision by King Abdullah II of Jordan (left) to fast-track the executions of ISIS-linked prisoners in retaliation for the death of pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (right) will provoke more terror attacks, experts warn . Taken away: An ambulance believed to be transporting the bodies of Iraqis Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouli leaves Swaqa prison near Amman after the Al Qaeda militants were executed . 'It was driven by negative emotions such as anger rather than the ambition of achieving justice. 'Moreover, punishing jihadists by executing senior commanders will only cause revenge – something that Jordan, a country under pressure, should try to avoid. 'At its core, the Islamic State can still act with impunity. Executing some Al Qaeda operatives who were only marginally related to the roots of ISIS is not going to change this. 'This round goes to ISIS. Jordan puts itself on the same level by letting anger and hatred prevail over justice.' The gruesome death of 26-year-old Lt Al-Kaseasbeh, captured while participating in airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition, sparked outrage and anti-Islamic State group demonstrations in Jordan. Newspaper headlines warned Jordan 'will take revenge' for his slaying as King Abdullah II, a staunch Western ally, rushed back to his kingdom from Washington. In its first response, Jordan executed Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouly, two Iraqis linked to Al Qaeda, government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said. Jordan has executed two ISIS-linked prisoners including Sajida al-Rishawi (left) hours after militants released a sickening video that showed captured Jordanian fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (right) being burned alive . Sajida al-Rishawi (pictured inside a military court in 2006) and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been executed after Jordan promised a swift and lethal response to the brutal ISIS video . Islamic State had demanded Rishawi's release in exchange for the life of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. However, Goto was later beheaded by the group, with images of his death released in a video last Saturday. Jordan had insisted that they would only release the woman as part of a deal to free the pilot, who, it has since emerged was killed a month ago making a mockery of any negotiations. Dr Krieg added: 'This act of vengeance by the Jordanian King is really not a sign of strength. It is an act of weakness. '(The executions) are a desperate attempt by King Abdullah to show strength to an outraged public that has been unusually vocal in their criticism of the palace's dealing with the hostage situation. 'After agreeing to negotiate the execution of the pilot, which already happened a month ago, it is a slap in the King's face. 'ISIS demonstrated that they can stage an execution in this manner in their capital Raqqa while appearing untouchable.' Some analysts also believe Jordan could escalate its involvement in the campaign against Islamic State, which has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria, Jordan's neighbours to the north and east. Brutal: The footage, which is titled 'Healing the Believers Chests', shows the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is seen being set alight . Depraved: The flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot. It is later flattened by a bulldozer . The latest murder by Islamic State terrorists represents a new level of barbarity from a group notorious for its savagery. As with previous beheading videos, footage of Moaz al-Kasasbeh’s murder is characterised by its slick production values and graphics. But unlike the others, it contains an added cinematic dimension clearly designed to achieve heightened impact – as if the horror of burning alive wasn’t enough. ISIS blames the fighter pilot for burning houses and killing babies with airstrikes before he was captured in December. The manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into ‘non-believers’ and encourage doubters within their ranks. And while the beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John were often static – showing the terrorist standing behind his victims – this clip combines aerial shots, panoramic views and changing camera angles that would have taken far longer to edit. Reports from Jordan suggest al-Kasasbeh may have died as long ago as January 3, suggesting the video has been a month in the making. The new clip also contains more of the landscape than has previously been shown, which intelligence experts will analyse for clues as to the jihadists’ whereabouts. It is the latest in a propaganda war in which the terror group seem intent on finding new ways to provoke horror and disgust. As well as posting footage of executions on social media, they have also used captured British photojournalist John Cantlie – who is still believed to be alive – to present videos attacking the West. In Washington, Abdullah II and President Barack Obama vowed in a hastily arranged White House meeting Tuesday not to let up in the fight against the Islamic State group. Abdullah has portrayed the campaign against the extremists as a battle over values. In a speech later aired on Jordanian state television, he urged his countrymen to unite. 'It's the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of Jordanians in the face of these hardships,' Abdullah said. U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter Jr, a California Republican, said after a meeting with congressional lawmakers and King Abdullah that the Jordanian monarch had been visibly angry and promised swift and certain retaliation against Islamic State group militants. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. 'They're starting tomorrow,' Hunter told the Washington Examiner in an interview published online Tuesday night. Hunter added the king also said: 'The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets.' That uncompromising response will strike the right chord with his own people, who were shocked over the brutality of ISIS's latest execution video. But Dr Labib Kamhawi, a Jordanian political analyst once threatened with prosecution for criticising the King, says this commitment to engaging with ISIS may wane before too long. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘The initial effect is that there is a massive feeling of anger and solidarity amongst the people of Jordan against ISIS. 'But you cannot count on this as time passes because initially Jordan was severely divided over this particular issue and a good number of them feel this is not our war, we should not be involved. ‘Lots of people wouldn’t be willing to express this position now because they might be labelled as anti-patriotic.' He said the decision to join the airstrikes did not come out of public debate or consultation. He added: 'The King made the decision and the King knows and only he knows exactly why Jordan is involved in this fight. ‘Personally I don’t think our involvement would lead to anything or mean anything. It’s symbolic involvement but its repercussions are immense. ‘I think ISIS itself knows that what’s taking place is funny, not serious. Airstrikes never won a war against paramilitary organisations. ‘They will continue to grow as long as there’s enough grievances and anger among people in the region. President Barack Obama (right) met late last night with  King Abdullah II  in the Oval Office of the White House, hours after the Moaz al-Kasasbeh was executed . He was escorted under heavy security through a basement corridor at the U.S Capitol after meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and other leaders in Washington . ‘I would not support [further air strikes]. It would lead to nothing. Jordan is far too weak. 'Jordan’s political position is far more important. If it put an end to the supply route to Syria across Jordan that could be more effective.’ After word spread that the pilot had been killed, dozens of people chanting slogans against the Islamic State group marched toward the royal palace to express their anger. Waving a Jordanian flag, they chanted, 'Damn you, Daesh!' - using the Arabic acronym of the group - and 'We will avenge, we will avenge our son's blood.' 'There is no religion accepts such act,' Amman resident Hassan Abu Ali said. 'Islam is a religion of tolerance. (The Islamic State group) have nothing to do with Islam. This is criminal act.' Protesters also marched in the pilot's home village of Ai and set a local government office on fire. Witnesses said the atmosphere was tense and that riot police patrolled the streets. Al-Kaseasbeh is from a tribal area in southern Jordan's Karak district. The tribes are considered a mainstay of support for the monarchy, but the pilot's capture has strained that relationship. Members of the pilot's family have repeatedly accused the government of botching efforts to win his release and have also criticized Jordan's participation in the anti-Islamic State group alliance. Jordan faces increasing threats from the militants. Jordan borders areas of Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate. There also have been signs of greater support for the group's militant ideas among Jordan's young and poor. David L Phillips, a former State Department adviser on the Middle East, said he believes the pilot's killing could backfire, antagonising Sunnis against the extremists, including Sunni tribes in Iraq. He also said the extremist group's recent military setbacks may have fueled the killings. 'They need to compensate for that with increasingly gruesome killings of prisoners,' said Phillips, director of the Program on Peace-building and Human Rights at Columbia University.","Kingdom hanged ISIS-linked prisoners after vowing to avenge pilot's death .

"The parents of Oscar winner Marisa Tomei have filed a lawsuit against the son of famed musician John Lennon. Gary and Addie Tomei are suing Sean Lennon claiming in the six years since he purchased the property next to them, both located on West 13th Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, he has refused to cut down a tree in his front yard whose roots are now destroying the Tomei home, this despite numerous requests from the couple. As for damages, the couple are asking for $10million - and that the tree be removed. Scroll down for video . Gary and Addie Tomei (above) are suing Sean Lennon over a tree on the musician's property whose roots have extended into their yard and are causing damage to their home . The Tomeis say they tried for a year to get in touch with Lennon (above) to no avial . The tree, see above in the middle of the Tomei home on the left and Lennon's home on the right, is a 60-foot-high ailanthus tree . According to court documents obtained by the New York Daily News, the Tomeis are claiming the 60-foot-high ailanthus tree which grows in Lennon's front yard has  'compromised the basement wall and interior ... (causing) irreparable damage to the structural integrity of the building.' That's not all either, with the couple saying their concrete foundation and front stoop have also been compromised, all 14 doors in the two-family home are unable to close because of the damage to the foundation and the facade of the home could become damaged next if the tree does not go soon. As for the reason behind the lawsuit, the Tomeis claim they have been trying to get in touch with Lennon for a year to no avail. Lennon, who bought the townhouse in 2008 for $9.5 million and has focused on remodeling the ritzy residence since then, has yet to respond to this lawsuit, though his lawyer, Jonas Herbsman, did admit he was shocked when told just how much the Tomeis are looking for in damages. 'He refuses to do anything. He’s owned it for six years and neglected it. I like him personally but he’s stubborn and he has a lawyer who is very belligerent,' explained Mr. Tomei. Even Ms. Tomei, who says she is pro-tree, wants the tree gone. 'I hate to see this tree come down, but it’s destroying my stoop,' said the actress. 'There are cracks everywhere. The masons don’t want to make repairs because they say it’s just going to happen again,' added Mr. Tomei. 'I want him to take the tree down and pay my expenses. It’s not cheap. I tried but you can’t talk to him. He’s always traveling.' The couple's daughter Marisa (above) admits that while she hates to see a tree cut down, it is destroying her parents' brownstone . As for the tree, it is an invasive species that was introduced to the United States through China,  nicknamed by some as the Tree of Heaven. It is also known the for the sour odor it produces when cut, grows new roots constantly and moves those roots around to steal from the supply of other plants - or even crack the walls of a basement. The New York Post revealed that even Lennon's own arborist and mason were aware of the problems the tree, which is also hollow and rotting, was causing, and urged him to chop it down. This is not the first time Lennon's home has wrecked havoc on the Tomeis, with a pipe burst happening early last year that forced the duo to move in with their daughter. The Tomeis, who purchased the home in 1994, also rent out a duplex in the brownstone for $9,000 a month.","Gary and Addie Tomei, the parents of Oscar winner Marisa Tomei, are suing their neighbor over a tree in his yard .

"Death rates rose by almost a third in England and Wales last month – driven by a fatal combination of vaccine-resistant flu and the cold snap, figures reveal. Almost 29,000 people died in the fortnight before January 23 – about 7,000 above the five-year average. Most of those who perished were elderly and many fell victim to a strain of flu which has mutated more than usual this winter. The latest death rates, published by the Office for National Statistics reveal in the two weeks ending January 23, 28,800 deaths were registered - up 32 per cent from the average for this time of year, calculated over the last five years, is 21,859 deaths . As a result, fewer people who had vaccinations were protected from the most common form of the virus – H3N2. Early estimates show one in five people who developed flu in January fell ill despite having had the jab. Doctors say problems arise because the vaccine is prepared about eight months before the flu season starts in November and is designed to tackle strains likely to be the most dominant. But this year the H3N2 strain had already mutated by the time the critical flu period arrived. Professor John Newton of Public Health England told the BBC: ‘There can be mutation so that the circulating type [of flu] might not be as well matched at the end of the flu season as it was at the beginning.’ Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at the authority, added: ‘In recent weeks we have seen evidence of significant excess mortality, particularly in the elderly, with more deaths than expected at this time of the year. ‘Two important causes of excess deaths during the winter are influenza and cold snaps, although estimating exactly how much can be attributed to each takes more time. Experts say the cold snap is one of the reasons behind the unusually high death rates . ‘The main type of flu that has been circulating this winter so far – influenza H3N2 – is well recognised to particularly impact groups such as the elderly and those with underlying chronic health problems, resulting in increases in hospitalisations and deaths. That is why we recommend these groups receive flu vaccine each year ideally before the flu season starts.’ More than 72 per cent of people aged over 65 have received a flu jab this winter, a similar level to previous years. Although the vaccination programme identified the right type of flu, it could not guarantee protection from a changing virus. Public Health England carried out a study last year which found that one in five patients with flu had the mutated strain, against which the jab would be ineffective. However tests were based on a small sample of 24 patients, five of whom were found to have the mutated strain. Other experts say the true numbers could be higher. Researchers at PHE have since carried out a larger study and the findings are due to be published later this week. In the US, which has also been badly hit by flu this winter, as many as half of all cases of the virus are mutations and several patients have died despite being vaccinated. The H3N2 strain of flu, circulating this year, is also particularly virulent in the elderly and those with existing health conditions causing a rise in hospitalisations and deaths . Last month specialists at Southampton General Hospital blamed the mutation on a doubling in the number of patients with serious chest infections to about 50 a day. The Office for National Statistics, which published the latest figures yesterday, said mortality rates had already been running close to the five-year average at the end of 2014. By the first week of January the number of deaths was up by 3,960 on last year. There were 3,721 more in the second week and an extra 3,220 the week after – bringing total excess deaths to 11,340 over the three weeks. More than three quarters of deaths were among those over 75. Dr Pebody added: ‘We offer advice throughout the winter to health professionals and the public about staying safe and healthy in cold weather – which includes looking out for older people who may be more at risk from the effects of very cold weather.’","Fortnight ending January 23 saw 28,800 deaths in England and Wales .

"An underground fire could burn for years after breaking out in a disused 119-year-old coal mine. Bemused walkers dialled 999 over the weekend after smoke started pouring out of the ground on a footpath between a golf club and the River Tyne near Newcastle. Since then the fire has shown no sign of going out - and experts have established it is on land which formed part a colliery that closed permanently 49 years ago. Scroll down for video . Blaze: This underground fire broke out on the weekend next to a Tyne and Wear golf club - and shows no sign of going out. It is on land that was part of a 119-year-old disused colliery and no one knows when it will go out . Shut: Production slowed in the 1950s and the mine employed fewer than 600 people by the time it shut in 1966 . They believe the land was part of the Clara Vale Colliery, which opened in 1896 and employed more than 1,100 people at its peak in the 1930s. The mine's production declined in the 1950s and it employed fewer than 600 people by the time it closed in 1966. Fortunately for the firefighters, they believe the blaze's fuel is spoil which was used to fill in two ponds - not a coal seam, which have been known to burn for thousands of years. One seam, Burning Mountain in New South Wales, Australia, is thought to have been on fire for 5,000 years since it was ignited by a lightning strike - providing an unusual attraction for tourists who flock to the smell of sulphur. Another coal seam fire in Ohio is still burning despite being set alight in 1884. Some way to go: One coal seam, Burning Mountain in Australia (pictured), has been smoking for 5,000 years . Found from China to the U.S., underground fires can burn for centuries and are at their most serious when they involve coal or peat. Fires need fuel, oxygen and heat to burn, which means mines or jagged fissures (in the case of Australia's Burning Mountain) are ideal for them to keep alight for years. In coal mines, especially active ones, the fires have an ample supply of fuel. The oxygen is then drawn down through the mine shaft - and in such an enclosed space, the heat takes care of itself. They can be ignited by natural causes such as a lightning strike or wildfire, and once they begin they are hard to stop. Most underground fires 'smoulder' rather than burning with a naked flame, especially in a damp substance such as peat. Without significant excavation the experts still have no idea how long the new fire in Crawcrook, Tyne and Wear, will be alight. They have closed the footpath as a precaution amid fears the land will cave in, bringing the trees which line the river with it. Gary Yates, watch manager at Swalwell fire station, said: 'There is an underground fire which is quite a rare occurrence. 'Generally they are caused by either a coal seam or a mix of aggregates accumulated and spoil from the coal heap. 'In this case we spoke to the National Coal Board and it's unlikely to be a coal seam. 'We looked at an Ordnance Survey map from the 1940s and in the exact spot as the fires there used to be two large ponds and these have been back filled. 'That's what appears to be on fire, we can't say for certain but it's likely to be a mix of spoil. 'The last one of this nature was at the site of Watergate Park in 1993 - that fire went on for two years at the former Watergate Colliery.' He added: 'The fire could burn for a day, a week or a month. The fire could burn itself out. It is one of the most difficult incidents to deal with.' Closed: Firefighters fear the fire could cause surrounding land to collapse and bring down trees . Gary Yates, watch manager at Swalwell fire station, said: 'The fire could burn for a day, a week or a month. The fire could burn itself out. It is one of the most difficult incidents to deal with' The closure is a blow to the rural area's well-worn riverside walk. 'It is a very popular route,' Mr Yates said. 'There is a possibility of collapse - if the fire is burning underground there's a potential to create a cavity. 'There are trees between 25ft to 40ft from the path and with the fire burning underground there it could be burning the roots and they could then fall.'","Land thought to be part of 119-year-old Clara Vale mine, Tyne and Wear .

"Staples has decided to snap up its nearest rival Office Depot for $6.3 billion, in a bid to monopolize the office supply market. The Massachusetts-based company, which has more than 3,000 stores worldwide, started negotiating the deal last September and the merger is expected to close by the end of 2015. Last year Staples reported annual sales of $23.11 billion, while its Floridia-born competitor Office Depot reaped in $17 billion. Revenue for the two businesses combined is expected to top $39 billion. Scroll down for video . Set to grow: Office supply giant Staples has decided to snap up its nearest rival, Office Depot for $6.3 billion . The cash-and-stock deal comes a little more than a year after Office Depot combined with OfficeMax, with too many stores fighting for too few sales. Businesses and consumers have shifted rapidly to online shopping at the same time that printers and the use of other traditional office supplies have diminished. That shift coincided with a recession that substantially altered the way companies spend money. Office Depot Inc. shareholders will receive $7.25 in cash and 0.2188 of a share in Staples Inc. at closing. The transaction values Office Depot at $11 per share. The companies put the deal's equity value at $6.3 billion. Staples has a market capitalization of approximately $11 billion, while Office Depot, which tied up with OfficeMax in November 2013, has a market capitalization of about $4 billion. The two companies began talking about a buyout in September, they said Wednesday. Staples said it will realize at least $1 billion in annual cost savings by the third full fiscal year after the transaction is complete. 'These savings will dramatically accelerate our strategic reinvention which is focused on driving growth in our delivery businesses and in categories beyond office supplies,' Staples Chairman and CEO Ron Sargent said in a printed statement. Sargent will continue to serve in those roles and Staples will keep its corporate headquarters in Framingham, Massachusetts. New future ahead: Last year Staples reported annual sales of $23.11 billion, while its Floridia-born competitor Office Depot reaped in $17 billion - Revenue for the two businesses combined is expected to top $39 billion . Last month activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP urged Staples to combine with Office Depot. In a letter addressed to Sargent, Starboard suggested he immediately hire an investment bank and legal advisers to help the board evaluate, structure and execute a transaction with Office Depot. Starboard disclosed in a regulatory filing in December that it had purchased a 5.1per cent stake in Staples and boosted its stake in Office Depot. New York's Starboard has a history of buying stakes in companies and then pushing for change. Early last year Staples said that it was closing up to 225 stores by the end of 2015 because people were using less office supplies and shopping more online than they were at its stores. The deal, which was unanimously approved by both companies' boards, is expected to close by year's end. It still needs approval from Office Depot shareholders. Once the closing occurs, Staples board will increase from 11 to 13 members and include two Office Depot directors approved by Staples. Staples said that it is temporarily suspending its stock buybacks so that it can concentrate on paying down debt related to the deal. Shares of Staples shed 22 cents to $18.79 in premarket trading.","The Massachusetts-based company which has more than 3,000 stores worldwide, started negotiating the deal last September .

"When model of the moment Kendall Jenner made her video debut for beauty brand Estee Lauder, one thing that stood out most - other than the 19-year-old's confident catwalk strut - were her impressively lengthy lashes, which she took every opportunity to flutter at the camera. And rightly so, for Kendall is the face - or rather the eyes - of the beauty brand's newest 'must-have' eyelash launch, the Little Black Primer, a product which claims to give the wearer the same natural-looking length and volume as modeled by Kendall. But do the results live up to the brand's promise of 'silky black lashes' both day and night? Scroll down for video . Length and volume: Estee Lauder's new Little Black Primer, as modeled by Kendall Jenner, promises to boost the wearer's eyelashes . The end result: While my lashes were not as natural-looking as Kendall's, the combination of primer and mascara did result in longer, thicker eyelashes than I would normally achieve with just mascara . According to Estee Lauder's description, the Little Black Primer can be worn  by itself, to give lashes a natural boost of 'color and lift', underneath mascara, to provide a 'base for volume, lift and length', or on top of mascara, as 'a long-wearing, water-resistant topcoat'. My lashes are naturally very thin, straight and generally lacking when it comes to volume and length. In other words, I need all the help I can get when it comes to mascara. Even if that means taking the time to apply an additional coat of product in the mornings.If it can help me to achieve Kendall's impressive results, I'm on board. So, I put Estee Lauder's claims to the test - trying out the primer in all of the three ways that the brand suggests it should be used. After first applying the Little Black Primer by itself, I didn't notice any major differences to my lashes. While Estee Lauder describes the product as being 'tinted black' - the majority of other alternative eyelash primers are white - it looks like more of a dark grey to me. It certainly doesn't offer the same bold, black results that I'm used to from my mascara. Natural talent: The Little Black Primer promises natural-looking results and Estee Lauder claims it can be worn on its own, without the need for any mascara . Where's the flutter? After just applying a coat of the primer, it was difficult to see a real difference to my lash length, volume or color . Upon the closest of inspections, I do see an increase in definition, and a hint of added volume - but certainly nothing as impressive and fluttery as seen on Kendall. If you are lucky enough to be blessed with lengthier lashes than mine however - and you're in the market for an effortlessly natural eyelash look - this could well be just the product for you. Personally however, I'm looking for something a lot more obvious, results that make me think 'wow' when I look in the mirror, and create a really noticeable difference to my lashes. So I'm relieved to see that after applying a coat of mascara on top of the primer, the results are, thankfully, much more impressive. While I would normally need a good two or three coats of mascara before really achieving the kind of volume and length that I desire in my lashes, after using the primer, it takes just one thin layer. After re-applying the primer on top of my mascara, the same results remain - however after applying an overly-generous second layer of primer, I did notice my mascara started to flake slightly.

Luckily it wasn't anything a quick dab of a tissue couldn't clear up, but definitely something to bear in mind if you are eager to keep your look as natural as possible. But on the whole, I am impressed with the results. My lashes look noticeably longer, thicker and have a really strong black tint to them. So much so that a colleague even commented on them, asking what product I had used to make them look so lengthy. Sadly however, they don't have quite the same natural look to them as Kendall's do in the Little Black Primer ad. It is hard to tell whether she is wearing the primer by itself or with mascara layered on top but it appears that the seemingly effortless flutter she flaunts at the camera can only be achieved by possessing the same Jenner/Kardashian gene - or a very talented make-up artist.","Kendall, 19, stars in a video campaign for the brand's Little Black Primer .

"An unemployed father-of-26 branded Britain's most feckless father has previous convictions for drugs offences, drink driving and anti-social behaviour, it emerged today. Peter Rolfe, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons by 15 women and says he rakes in £46,000-a-year-in welfare handouts, has been convicted of a string of offences but has always avoided prison. The 64-year-old, who has been married at least seven times, was cleared of bigamy over his 1997 wedding to Claire Drake when the CPS dropped the case ahead of trial for 'insufficient evidence'. His criminal record began at the age of ten and also includes using threatening behaviour, drink driving and having eight children in the back of his van. Scroll down for video . Father-of-26 Peter Rolfe has caused fury among neighbours by getting a five-bedroom council house. It emerged today that he has a string of convictions for anti-social behaviour and drugs offences . Rolfe has dodged jail since 1987 partly because he has so many children to care for. In 2005, a police raid on Rolfe's home in Newport on the Isle of Wight found amphetamines in his freezer, cannabis in his kitchen and stolen Marks & Spencer bedding and clothing. Judge John Dixon told Rolfe: 'You are 53 and have had a working life of offences. The latest are yet another step in an utterly dismal history of which you should be ashamed.' But after considering the welfare of Rolfe's children, he handed him an 18-month community rehabilitation order at Isle of Wight Crown Court. In 2004, Rolfe was given a two year conditional discharge by magistrates on the island for having ammunition - bullets - without a licence. He told police he found them in a box of drill bits he had bought at a car boot sale. Later that year at the same court, he admitted threatening behaviour against a shop supervisor. Magistrates heard that Rolfe had already made 33 previous court appearances and had a criminal history going back 44 years, but he was given another conditional discharge for nine months. He has since made at least four more court appearances. Rolfe - who moved into the house with seven of his children and two grandchildren - has always dodged prison sentences partly by claiming he needs to look after his children . In 2004, he was also evicted from a housing association property after a dossier of anti-social behaviour was presented to Isle of Wight county court. A Newport GP said that a rise in mental and physical illness among patients was 'directly linked to the actions of Rolfe and his family'. Rolfe recently outraged other residents by landing a five bedroom, taxpayer-funded house in Newport. Last year, he appeared on Channel 5's Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole and ITV's This Morning. The single dad claimed on TV that he deserves the £500,000 plus in benefits that he has raked in during over 20 years that he has been unemployed. At that time, none of Mr Rolfe's children, who range in age from four to 43, were in work. Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe branded him Britain's most feckless father and said he does not deserve a tent, let alone a council house. Rolfe's ex-wife has claimed 'he will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough' Ex-wife Claire Drake, 43, had six children with Rolfe in seven years after meeting him in 1992. The barmaid said: 'I had to get away. He's just evil. He should be castrated. He will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough. 'It is absolutely disgusting the amount he receives in benefits while I am working for a roof over my head. 'I have nothing but hate for that man. When I watched him on 'This Morning', I was shaking; my legs were going; and I was sweating. He makes my skin crawl.' Their six children lived with Rolfe from 2001. He moved into his new house with six of his children and two grandchildren after complaining to the council that his previous three bedroom semi was 'like a prison'. But daughter Leeanne is already moving out into her own welfare-funded flat with her one-year-old twins Lexi and Courtney and fiancé Danny Beck. Asked about his 46-year criminal record, Rolfe said: 'My convictions are all in the past and nothing whatsoever to do with these children. 'I took these children under my care in 2001. I have turned my life around. I am ashamed of my past - of course I am.' This family tree shows the size of Rolfe's huge brood, nine of whom moved into the house with him . Jan 1987: Three year ban for drink driving . May 2003: Cleared of bigamy and perjury at Isle of Wight Crown Court after CPS dropped case for ""insufficient evidence"". July 2003: Two year community rehabilitation order at Isle of Wight Crown Court for handling stolen goods - phone cards and £700 worth of cigarettes stolen from a shop. May 2004: Two year conditional discharge at Isle of Wight magistrates' court for having ammunition - eight.22 calibre bullets - without a licence. Nov 2004: Evicted from housing association property after dossier of anti-social behaviour presented to Isle of Wight county court. Dec 2004: Conditional discharge for nine months at Isle of Wight magistrates' court for threatening behaviour against a shop supervisor . Feb 2005: Eighteen month community rehabilitation order for possessing drugs and attempting to handle stolen goods at Isle of Wight Crown Court. Court heard Rolfe's long criminal record included drugs, dishonesty and handling stolen goods.

"A construction worker has been hailed a hero for saving the life of a child whose dad then shot dead the youngster's mother and himself. Sarah Drewer, 33, was killed by her estranged husband Douglas Drewer, 46, at their home in Scottsdale, Arizona, yesterday morning. At least two construction workers heard the screams of a child coming from the house, which was being renovated, at around 8.30 a.m in a neighborhood near 68th Street and Chaparral Road close to downtown Scottsdale. Sarah Drewer was shot dead by her estranged outside the couple's home in Scottsdale, Arizona . Douglas Drewer had one gun taken from him before returning with another in order to kill his wife . The scene of the shooting in a neighborhood near 68th Street and Chaparral Road in Scottsdale . One of the workers ran into the home and found Drewer arguing with his wife over a handgun. The worker wrestled the weapon from the husband and took the wife and child outside. Seconds later Drewer later emerged from the home with a second handgun and told the worker to take the child away from the scene. He did so before Drewer shot and killed his wife and then himself outside on the street. Emergency services descended on the scene on a clear morning in the suburban area of the city. Police Sergeant Ben Hoster said the man was 'a hero for saving that kid's life.' According to azfamily.com, Scottsdale Police spokesman Kevin Watts called him a 'pretty brave individual to move to the aid of that child. 'It starts with him just hearing the screams for help and he moves across the street and enters the house.' Officers had recently dealt with domestic issues at the couple's home. They served an order of protection on Drewer on Friday, took away several guns and ordered him to stay away from his wife and the home, Hoster said. The couple had a daughter and a son together, though it is not clear which child was present at the shooting . The scene was soon swarming with emergency services after the double shooting at around 8.30am . Police parked outside the couple's house. Their bodies lay out in the street after the shooting . azcentral.com reported that a 2009 petition said Douglas Drewer had hit his wife in the past and had also been abusive toward her then three-year-old daughter, now thought to be aged seven. The order was issued more than a week after Sarah Drewer gave birth to their son, now five years old, according to the petition. 'He was screaming and throwing things,' she wrote. 'He has a history of this sort of violent behavior, and I'm afraid for my children and me.' It is not clear which of the couple's two children was present at the shooting. Police took custody of that child, who was unharmed, and their sibling, who was not home at the time. Hoster said the construction worker would be protected under the state's good Samaritan laws despite entering the house without permission and fighting with the husband.

"This 'hugely offensive' collection of Holocaust memorabilia is set to go under the hammer in the US just days after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The auction has been branded 'deplorable' for including more than 75 Holocaust-related items such as a wrought metal street sign proclaiming 'Jews not allowed', a guide book on how to gas Jews and an anti-Semitic children's book. Other  items up for sale include a pair of spectacles once owned by vile Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi commander responsible for the building and running of their concentration camps, and the visor cap worn by a death camp officer. A solid wooden disc with the words 'He who buys from a Jew is a national traitor' carved into it also features, as does a death certificate issued for Jewish man at Austrian death camp Mauthausen. Scroll down for video . This street sign, which reads 'Jews not allowed,' is due to go under the hammer with more than 75-Holocaust related items at Alexander Historical Auctions in Maryland. A buyer is expected to have to pay around $6,000 for the sign . A pair of glasses belonging to Heinrich Himmler, the Nazi commander responsible for the building and running of their concentration camps, are expected to fetch up $8,000 . This SS officer tunic and dress trousers will also go under the hammer during the sale, two weeks after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. It is expected to sell for around $3,000 . The sale takes place on February 10 and 11, two weeks after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz which happened on January 27, 1945. Nazi memorabilia sales are illegal in France, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Large auction houses in Britain including Christie's, Sotheby's and Bonhams refuse to sell such material, as does eBay. It is however legal to hold sales in the US, and the sale at Alexander Historical Auctions in Maryland is the first of four it will hold this year. The auctioneers have defended the sale, saying they are making sure the horrors of The Holocaust are not forgotten. Nazi memorabilia sales are illegal in France, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Pictured: A concentration camp officer's hat has a guide price of $12,000 . But they have come under fire from a Holocaust survivor from, Dorset, England, not only for running the sale but also for taking fees of up to 25 per cent from its proceeds. Harry Grenville, 88, whose parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, were killed at Auschwitz, said the auction was 'hugely offensive' and 'deplorable'. He said: 'The thing that is most upsetting about this auction is the commercialisation of the Holocaust. 'It is worrying that this auction house is set to make a tidy sum of money from the sale of items that are hugely offensive to a lot of people. 'It raises again the question about freedom of speech - you can't force people to stop selling Holocaust memorabilia and making money from it but you can deplore it. 'The sale is also very badly timed, being so close to the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. This Nazi book entitled Sterilization, Decontamination, and Disinfection, is said to be a guidebook for the gas chamber. It is expected to be sold for around $2,000 . Julius Streicher's anti-Semitic children's book called 'Do not trust a fox in a green pasture or a Jew upon his oath.' Auctioneers expect it to fetch $2,000 . One of the anti-Semitic messages from inside the book that was given to German children during World War II . This Nazi book on how to spot a Jew is expected to gain bids of around $700 in the auction later this month . An SS document, stating that recruits have been examined, is also up for auction with a guide price of $150 . 'It is very sad that while most people are quietly remembering the horrors of the Nazi death camps, others are looking to profit from them.' A wrought iron street sign which reads 'Juden nicht erwunscht' - Jews not allowed - taken from a village in Germany at the end of the war is among the 'highlights' of the sale and has an estimate of $6,000 - around £4,000. This token, expected to fetch $2,000, has the inscription 'He who buys from Jews is a national traitor' The catalogue listing notes: 'This item is, regrettably, as genuine as it gets, and is still as disturbing as it was 70 years ago.' A book titled 'Sterilisation, Decontamination and Disinfection Employment Instructions for Hospital and Laboratory of the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen-SS, Book 3' carries detailed information on how to gas Jews. The auction house calls it 'an excessively rare 'how-to' book for the Holocaust' and says it is worth $2,000 - around £1,500. Himmler's glasses come with a note attached to them written by his daughter Gudrun reading 'Papa's old glasses'. They are up for sale for $8,000 - or £6,000. A children's book titled 'Do Not Trust a Fox in a Green Pasture or a Jew Upon His Oath' contains a host of vitriolic anti Jewish stories. The book, said to be worth £1,500, was created by Elvira Bauer, an 18-year-old art student, and issued to schoolchildren in Germany in 1936. Rabbi Andrew Baker, director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee, said: 'It would be preferable that Nazi-era artefacts disappear and not be recycled for profit by auction houses. 'The Maryland auction reminds me of a set of artefacts that was presented to the Vienna Jewish Museum twenty-five years ago shortly after it was established by the City of Vienna. 'They were a compelling illustration of how anti-Semitism was once such a part of everyday life. The challenge for the museum, according to the director, was how to present this in a public exhibition. 'They wanted to be sure that it would demonstrate the evils of anti-Semitism and not inadvertently contribute to it. The sale is happening just days after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Pictured: The gates of the notorious concentration camp . British Holocaust survivor Harry Grenville, 88, pictured left today and right in 1946, whose parents, Jacob and Klara Greilsamer, and grandmother, Sara Ottenheimer, were killed at Auschwitz, said the auction was 'hugely offensive' and 'deplorable' Mr Grenville and his sister Hannah were sent to Britain when they were just two years old.  His mother and father, Jakob and Klara Greilsamer, died in Auschwitz . 'It's hard to believe that the people likely to bid on these items will have the same noble goals in mind.' The Community Security Trust, a British charity established to protect Jews from anti-Semitism, said it would not comment because its staff did not have time to research the auction. Bill Panagopulos, president of Alexander Auctions, defended the sale saying that by making the items available to buy he is ensuring the atrocities of World War II are not forgotten. He said: 'Our consignments come from all over the planet - everywhere from dusty attics to unwanted museum holdings. 'The market is quite good for this material. Why? Well, think of another six year period of history that affected the world as greatly as did World War II. This anti-Semitic book, that features caricatures of Jews, is expected to fetch $400 . Anti-Semitic images inside one of the books up for auction at the sale in Maryland, US . 'In this day and age when so little history is taught in schools, the war remains relevant, important and vitally interesting to almost everyone. 'Many believe that the buyers of this type of material are neo-Nazis, revisionists, or people who idolise the Third Reich. That could not be further from the truth. 'They want 'proof', a connection, a relic - something to prove that these people existed, and that these events happened, good or bad. 'I am committed to making this material available as I believe that 'not all history is good history' and destroying or neglecting these items will only make it easier for revisionists decades or centuries from now to pretend that the Holocaust never happened. 'Dedicated collectors and institutions must have access to this 'criminal evidence' which would otherwise be sold privately and never offered to them.'","More than 75 Holocaust-related items set to go under the hammer .

"The SNP are on course to sweep across Scotland, wiping out senior Labour and Lib Dems, a devastating new poll showed today. Labour election chief Douglas Alexander and Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander are among those who face losing their seats to the Scottish nationalists. Polling in 16 seats by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft found Nicola Sturgeon's nationalist party ahead in 15 of the 16 seats, putting the SNP on course to hold the balance of power after May's election. Polls carried out by Lord Ashcroft in 16 key seats show the SNP is on course to win in all but one of them . Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander (left) and Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander both face losing their seats . Labour has been rocked by the extraordinary surge in support for the SNP in the wake of the independence referendum in September, despite voters rejecting their plan for separation. First Minister Alex Salmond quit as SNP leader to be replaced by Miss Sturgeon, but now plans to stand for election to Westminster. Polls have repeatedly suggested the SNP will make huge gains, with Labour facing heavy losses and the Lib Dems and Tories wiped out altogether. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been called back to the frontline to support new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy in an attempt to stem the losses. Lord Ashcroft's research focused mainly on Labour seats in areas which had voted in favour of independence, or only narrowly voted against. Of the 16 seats, it found only Glasgow North East is likely to back Ed Miliband's party. The swing from Labour to the SNP varies from 21 to 27 per cent. If a swing of 21 per cent was repeated across Scotland, Labour would lose 35 of its 41 seats in Scotland. Writing on his website Lord Ashcroft said: 'Douglas Alexander, Labour's campaign manager and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, would lose his Paisley & Renfrewshire South seat with a swing to the SNP of 25 per cent. 'Elsewhere, (Alex) Salmond would be back in Westminster with a comfortable majority over the Lib Dems, and Chief Secretary Danny Alexander would lose by 29 points.' The surge in support for the SNP puts Nicola Sturgeon's party on course to hold the balance of power, with Labour's Ed Miliband falling short of an overall majority . The most popular outcome for May, Lord Ashcroft found, is a Labour-SNP coalition, with 39 per cent of voters, including 62 per cent of SNP supporters and 79 per cent of Labour-SNP switchers, favouring that option. Just 38 per cent of people said they were dissatisfied with David Cameron as Prime Minister and would rather have Ed Miliband. Lord Ashcroft said an SNP swing of 21 per cent, as found in his research, repeated across Scotland on May 7 would endanger 35 of Labour's 41 seats there. He added: 'But we cannot assume such a uniform swing. Most of the seats in this survey are in areas which returned a particularly strong yes vote in September, where the SNP attraction will naturally be greater; in future rounds of research we may find a different pattern where support for independence was lower. 'Even so, the prospect of losing heartland seats will be a blow to Labour's hopes: every seat they lose in Scotland means another they have to win from the Conservatives in England, while the national polls could not be much narrower.' Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been called back to the frontline to support new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy in an attempt to stem the losses . Lord Ashcroft said the polls should be seen simply as a snapshot, not a prediction, but advised the Labour party it has 'room for improvement' in its electioneering over the next three months. Just over two thirds of those who have switched their support from Labour to the SNP said they had definitely ruled out voting Labour again this year, leaving the party with a third of voters who are 'at least open to the idea of returning', Lord Ashcroft said. Mr Murphy, elected the new Scottish Labour leader after Johann Lamont quit last year, admitted the polls show that Scottish Labour is 'well behind and has a big gap to close'. He added: 'In the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are David Cameron and the Tories. ""It is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government. The more seats the SNP get from Labour, the more likely it is the Tories will be the biggest party and David Cameron will get into government through the back door. ""That would be a terrible outcome for Scotland but it's what might happen if Scotland votes SNP.""","Lord Ashcroft poll reveals snapshot of voting intention in 16 Scottish seats .

"Norway has proposed a law which would make it illegal to help people begging in the street. The draft for the anti-begging law would not only make it a crime to  to ask for money, but also to help those who beg. The rules will state that those offering money, food or shelter to beggars will also face up to a year in prison. Criminal: The Norwegian government has proposed a law that would criminalise organised begging and those who aid begging, making it punishable with a prison sentence of up to one year . Individual council's have been able to ban begging since last year, but now the centre-right government wants a nationwide ban. The proposed law would criminalise organised begging, making it punishable with a prison sentence of up to one year. Justice minister Vidar Brein-Karlsen, said the law was needed to outlaw those running begging networks as an organised business. He said: 'We need to give the police the legal authority to crack down on people who arrange for beggars to get here, often in large groups.' Anti begging: Justice minister Vidar Brein-Karlsen, from majority party Fremskrittspartiet, says the legislation is needed to outlaw those running begging networks . But socialist MP Karin Andersen accused the government of 'criminalising poverty'. She wrote on Twitter: 'Europe's richest country criminalises Europe's poorest people. The freedom of speech to ask for help is cut off.' Inger Husby, from Bøler outside Oslo, who frequently volunteers to help homeless people in the capital, said she now feared her altruistic acts to land her in prison. She said: 'I give the homeless food and drink when they need it. 'I think I would become even more eager to help them if the law came into force. To me, it doesn't sound possible to punish people who are helping others who are in trouble and who are poor.' The bill has been sent out for consultation with a deadline of February 15th.","Proposed law in Norway would make begging in the streets illegal .

"Rory McIlroy has settled his bitter court battle with his former agent over the right to back out of the contract in a deal believed to have cost him more than £16.5 million. The world's number one golfer was suing Conor Ridge's Horizon Sports Management over the cut the firm was taking from on-and off-course earnings. But today the High Court in Dublin was told that the row had been resolved following ten hours of last-ditch negotiations between the star's lawyers and advisers and the company. Rory McIlroy (pictured at court yesterday) has settled his multi-million pound legal dispute with his former agent over the right to back out of the contract he claimed he was misled into signing . The world's number one golfer, pictured yesterday at court, was suing Conor Ridge's Horizon Sports Management over the cut the firm was taking from on-and off-course earnings . McIlroy was not in court for the brief hearing and the terms of the settlement were not detailed in court. But a source close to the case said the settlement was 'far north' of $20 million, the equivalent of £13.1 million, which McIlroy is believed to have paid to Horizon Sports Management. 'It's in the public domain that the amount of money owing under the contract and the money likely to be generated from the the contract was $20 million,' a source said. 'The settlement was in excess of that, plus costs.' It is understood the figure was $25 million, or £16.4 million, which includes substantial legal costs. McIlroy, fresh from a weekend victory in Dubai, had sued Mr Ridge's agency over the cut his firm was taking from on and off-course earnings in a potentially ugly row over £4.2 million in fees. Mr Ridge, who was flanked by supporters in the public gallery, hugged and kissed them after the announcement was made. A brief statement agreed between the McIlroy and Ridge camps was released following the hearing. Agent Conor Ridge (pictured outside the hearing) was in court today, and was seen hugging and kissing his supporters as it was announced that the settlement had been reached . 'The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties, who wish each other well for the future,' it said. 'The parties will be making no further comment.' The two sides had been locked in talks for about 10 hours yesterday at the Four Courts complex in central Dublin, with McIlroy leaving last night at about 9pm without making any comment. When the case was called this morning, Paul Gallagher, senior counsel for McIlroy, told the court: 'The entire matter has been resolved.' Judge Brian Cregan said the dispute was undoubtedly a long and difficult issue for both sides to deal with. McIlroy was in court yesterday, just days after he won the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday . Sunday's win at the Dubai Desert Classic is a repeat of McIlroy's first as a professional back in 2009 . He also wished Mr Ridge success as a sports agent in the future and McIlroy success on the golf course. McIlroy is believed to have offered Ridge almost £8m to settle prior to Tuesday's adjournment at the High Court. That offer was turned down by Ridge, who was confident his company had a watertight contract with McIlroy that entitled them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of his endorsement money until 2017. McIlroy's deal with Nike, which he signed while with Horizon, is reportedly worth around £150 million, which gave Horizon plenty of reasons to fight for a larger settlement. McIlroy had terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to form his own company, and was suing the form and leading agent Mr Ridge, claiming he was misled into signing the contract. In court papers when the case was launched later that year, it was claimed that McIlroy signed up with Mr Ridge's agency at an informal meeting on the day of Horizon's Christmas party in 2011. Mr Ridge had counter-sued the golfer after the lawsuit was launched in late 2013 for walking away from his contract - claiming that he owed the company millions of dollars in lost commissions. The case had been scheduled for eight weeks in the big business division of the Irish High Court - reserved for cases where disputes are worth more than 1 million euro (£755,000) - before the prospect of long and potentially personal arguments being teased out in full public view led to renewed attempts at a settlement. McIlroy and Mr Ridge together at a State Dinner at the White House in Washington in 2012 . Two days of talks between both camps last December yielded nothing. The dispute centred on McIlroy's contract with Dublin-based Horizon and two other linked companies - Malta-based Gurteen, and Canovan Management, also based in the Irish capital. At the heart of it was rates the golfer was being charged - pre-tax 5 per cent of prize winnings and 20 per cent of sponsorship and appearances money. McIlroy, pictured outside the Dublin Crown Court yesterday,had terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 and formed his own company . When the lawsuit was launched in late 2013, McIlroy's lawyer had contended that the fees were up to four times what one of the best golfers in the world would expect to pay to agents. The golf star, who took up the game as a youngster in Holywood, Co Down, and now has a home in Florida, claims the terms were inferior to those given to other top 10 players including fellow countryman and major winning friend Graeme McDowell, who was in the same stable. McIlroy's business interests are now overseen by Rory McIlroy Incorporated, which is headed by Donal Casey, formerly of Horizon, his father Gerry and family friend and business executive Barry Funston, who also oversees much of the golfer's charitable work under the Rory McIlroy Foundation. Along with the golfer's personal assistant Sean O'Flaherty and family member Brian McIlroy, the golfer's team spent about 10 hours in the Four Courts yesterday thrashing out the terms of the deal. His father Gerry arrived at the courts yesterday at 5pm. None were in court today. Among the disputes raised when the case was launched was a row over an alleged 166,000 euro (£125,350) donation to Unicef on the eve of a trip to Haiti when McIlroy was an ambassador for the charity. There was another fallout over Horizon using complimentary airline seats on a flight to Abu Dhabi booked by tournament organisers in McIlroy's name. The young golfer's career soared in the year after he signed for Mr Ridge from Chubby Chandler's stable earning more than £10 million in 2012, before a slump took hold in 2013 and earnings fell back to around £1.5 million. Last season McIlroy appeared more driven, earning more than £7 million, and he is now favourite to complete the career grand slam of golf at the US Masters in April. McIlroy broke off his engagement to tennis plater Caroline Wozniacki in May last year . McIlroy was with Horizon when he won the 2012 PGA Championship, rose to number one in the world and signed the five-year sponsorship deal with Nike. A dip in form followed and his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ended, but the Northern Irishman has four majors to his name. If recent form on the course offers any insight into his demeanour with a massive and costly contract row hanging over him, McIlroy appeared focused when picking up his latest trophy. Sunday's win at the Dubai Desert Classic is a repeat of his first as a professional back in 2009. McIlroy is due back in competition Honda Classic at Palm Beach in Florida at the end of the month where the winner will walk away with £724,00.","Number one golfer was suing Conor Ridge's Horizon Sports Management .

"An 11-year-old girl scared off a burglar who broke into her Michigan house while she was home alone by pointing her own shotgun directly at him. The girl hid in her bathroom closet after she heard two intruders - James Wasson, 53, and Rhonda Steward, 31 - enter the residence around 3pm on January 30, and grabbed the firearm, which was stored in a gun safe. When Wasson opened the closet door and found himself staring down the barrel of the 12-gauge, he ran off and both burglars fled, MLive.com reported. An 11-year-old Michigan girl hid in a bathroom closet and scared burglars James Wasson (left) and Rhonda Steward (right) away from her home after pointing her shotgun at Wasson when he opened the door . Lapeer County Sheriff Detective Sgt. Jason Parks called the girl a 'protector of her home' and said she was responsible and calm during the break-in last week. The girl pointed a 12-gauge shotgun that she uses for frequent hunting trips with her father (file photo) 'She was able to defend herself from an intruder and resolve an event even most adults would be taken aback by.' Parks said the shotgun belonged to the girl and that she was 'familiar' with it, as she uses it often to go hunting with her father. He added that the girl, whose parents had not yet returned home from work, showed she was capable of 'making sound, good decisions' and had demonstrated she was more than able to stay home by herself. Wasson, 53, and Steward, 31, from Detroit, were arrested in a nearby city shortly after the home invasion. Police believe they are connected to between 25 and 50 similar break-ins. Wasson is charged with home invasion, burglary tool possession, receiving and concealing stolen property, felon in possession of a firearm and firearm used in commission of a felony. Steward is charged with home invasion and burglary tool possession. Both remain in custody at the Lapeer County Jail.","Michigan girl's parents were at work when James Wasson, 53, and Rhonda Steward, 31, broke into her home .

"Wade Lange is the Brisbane-based rag-trader who has taken on the biggest clothing manufacturers in a David and Goliath battle ... and won, claiming the much sought-after licence to produce garments bearing the Marvel Comics Superheroes. With a specific focus, at the moment, on women's wear - Mr Lange and his team of 15, including girlfriend Kelly, have already developed a wide range of the hugely popular Captain America wear and Guardians of the Galaxy garments. They have just started on the other super hero themes, including Spiderman, which will be officially launched on Tuesday. If the demand to fit out female devotees of the Marvel comics stable has been significant, Mr Lange is expected to be over-run once the men's clothing is on the rack. He revealed to Daily Mail Australia that 'our designers are already looking at what we can do in the area of stretch-wear for the blokes, so yes that is already on the cards'. Other favourites to be feature including Ironman, Thor, Hulk and the Avengers. 'Business has quadrupled.' The Captain America range from Living Dead Clothing is now compete.

Agents of SHIELD leggings (left) will also be in supply as Mr Lange expands his range of Marvel clothes for women . The pitch to Marvel pitted him against some of the biggest names in clothing, keen to get their hands on the lucrative contract with Disney. He is convinced it was dedication that got them over the line. 'I haven't had a day off for many months now and we are determined to be successful,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'His dedication certainly rubs off on all of us,' added Living Dead Clothing PR boss Taryn Watt. It's the quintessential local boy made good story. 'I started doing it (making leggings) on a bit of a whim, I already had a 9-to-5 job, so it was just a bit of extra work in my garage,' he said. Things began to move very quickly, within months the small side business had begun to grow and then the Disney deal was on the table. The team of two quickly grew to a staff of 15 inside a large all-encompassing warehouse. 'We've gone from working in a small garage to a million dollar company,' he admitted. ''We've secured this exclusive contract for the Marvel characters in stretch-wear and moved into new premises - we are all 100 per cent dedicated to be successful, like him and we work hard for it,' said Ms Watt. 'We stood out from the others because we could show we really cared about our customers and they are very loyal to us.'

While they have ­released an extensive Captain America range, including leggings, bodysuits, swimwear, skater dresses and skirts and rain makers, for the ladies - it's what is in store for the blokes which has them super excited.

And everything is developed and produced in-house. 'We do not bring anything in from overseas, not one thing,' Ms Watt added. 'It's 100 per cent Australian, from the ideas, to the designing, printing, packing and shipping, we do it all,' Ms Watt added.

"Giddy fans of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots chanted 'Brady! Brady!' and leaned on massive snowbanks for better views as players danced and waved their way through Boston in a Wednesday parade celebrating their fourth NFL title. Well-wishers pumped their fists and screamed from behind barriers as the team rolled through downtown aboard the World War II-style amphibious 'duck boat' vehicles that have become a staple of the city's championship parades. Some fans peered from behind giant piles of snow left from last week's blizzard, straining to get a glimpse of quarterback Tom Brady and his son Benjamin, coach Bill Belichick and other players as a truck blew plumes of confetti into the air.

Dalton Hayes, 18, was indicted on 11 charges, including rape in the second degree and violation of custodial interference on Tuesday. According to authorities, Hayes was behind a two-week long crime spree – along with his 13-year-old girlfriend - that came to an end in Florida last month. Scroll down for video . Dalton Hayes, the older half of the teenage due dubbed Bonnie & Clyde after a multi-state crime spree of stolen vehicles and pilfered checks, has been indicted by a grand jury in Kentucky . Because his girlfriend is underage, authorities are unable to comment on the charges she could be facing. She is expected to face charges in juvenile court. Hayes’ bond has been set at $250,000 and he remains behind bars at the Grayson County Detention Center. He reportedly cried during his arraignment last month when he pleaded not guilty to charges that included statutory rape, custodial interference, criminal mischief, trespassing, theft and burglary. Hayes' defense lawyer had argued that the teen was not mentally competent to stand trial. The brazen nature of the alleged crimes and the age of the two teens involved caused national media attention. Hayes ran away with his 13-year-old girlfriend and allegedly went on a multi-state crime spree before the two were caught in Florida . Hayes and his girlfriend were caught in Panama City Beach, Florida, on January 18. He was extradited back to Kentucky to stand trial. The girl was sent back to her father - from whom she ran away. The girl's mother, Sherry Peters, faces charges of custodial interference after she allegedly picked the girl up from her father's house - even though she has no parental rights.","Dalton Hayes has been indicted by a grand jury in Kentucky on 11 charges including rape in the second degree and violation of custodial interference .

"For millenia we have found comfort in the light from a flickering fire and the rising sun. But light also takes many forms that are largely invisible and undetectable without modern technology. Now a new Unesco exhibition, entitled the International Year of Light, is showcasing the wonder of light in all its forms. Microscopic images as well as photos of natural wonders such as the Northern Lights are featured in a new exhibition that forms part of Unesco’s International Year of Light. This image shows crystals of cold medication and sodium citrate taken using a camera attached to a microscope. It was taken in polarised light, when light is restricted to vibrating in one plane . It aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science, its applications, and its importance to humankind. ‘Light allows us to communicate, entertain, explore, and understand the world we inhabit and the Universe we live in,’ the exhibition website says. ‘This exhibition series shows the myriad things light can do, and how it plays a critical role in our lives every day.’ The year aims to raise awareness of the achievements of light science, its applications, and its importance to humankind. This beautiful scene in the Gippsland Lakes in south eastern Australia, shows bioluminescence as well as stars in the Milky Way. It's produced by a chemical reaction inside a living organism. Most bioluminescence occurs in deep water where sunlight cannot reach . All lasers are based on controlling the way that energised atoms release photons, or packets of light. Lasers emit light coherently allowing it to be focused to a tight spot up close or over long distances. The image on the left shows how beaming a laser into the sky, astronomers can measure the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere, allowing for clearer images of distant cosmic objects. The image on the right shows shadows in Antelope Canyon in Arizona as sunlight streams through an opening above . A microscopic image showing a tall green plant with yellow flowers called levisticum (pictured) is among those on show. Polarised light is used to bring out the details of the plant, but is also used for sunglasses, for example. Polarised glasses block most light oriented in a horizontal direction, which often happens when light is reflected from a flat road or smooth water . Among the pictures currently on show are microscopic images showing the composition of cold medication in polarised light, the cells in a mouse's eyes, as well as light bulbs under an X-ray and fibre optics, which are used to connect the world. Natural wonders such as bioluminescence on a beach, impressive sundogs in the snow, Aurora Borealis, dramatic lightning strikes, fireworks and cosmic images of the Milky Way also form part of the gallery. Natural wonders such as dramatic lightning strikes against city spaces (pictured) are included in the gallery. This image shows the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In storm clouds, the friction between particles  builds up a large separation of electric charge, creating voltages approaching 100 million volts. This causes a discharge that heats the gas around it to  ten thousand degrees, causing a bright glow observed as a lightning bolt . A laser scanning microscope scans a sample point-by-point, assembling the pixel information to generate one image, forming a high-resolution and high-contrast image in three dimensions. This image shows a mouse retina, where the cells have been stained with fluorescent dye to show different features . Solar panels (pictured) allow us to harness some of the vast energy that is provided to us every day from the Sun. Photovoltaic cells within the solar panels generate electrical power by converting light from the Sun into electricity using semiconducting material such as silicon.  Many people consider solar power as one of the most promising sources of renewable energy . This image shows  the Sun in ultraviolet light through a telescope with better resolution than the most sophisticated high-definition television. This telescope, called the Solar Dynamics Observatory, gets these amazing views of our closest star in an orbit high above the Earth's atmosphere. This gives it unfettered access to ten different wavelengths of light being emitted from the sun . The International Year of Light aims to inspire future scientists and engineers, while also promoting the possibilities of using solar power in the developing world and advances in medicine, communications and astronomy, for example. The Duke of York, who is patron of the project in the UK, said: ‘The International Year of Light is about how we have used light over the centuries; it is how we are applying light, photonics and various other aspects in order to make the world a better place, not only for ourselves, but for future generations.’ This intriguing photo shows a 'sun dog' - a pair of bright lights seen on either side of the sun, typically when it is setting. Sun dogs belong to a large class of atmospheric phenomena caused by the bending of sunlight by small ice crystals in the air. The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays. If the crystals are randomly oriented in the atmosphere, a complete ring around the Sun a halo is seen (shown) Optical fibres (shown) - hair-thin flexible strands of glass or plastic - carry massive amounts of data in the form of light and serve as the backbone of the Internet. They can be used in endoscopes for imaging the interiors of both people and machines. or as fibre lasers, can generate light energy to cut everything from human tissue to thick steel . Protozoa, or 'first animals' are single-celled animals that play a key role in maintaining and balance of microbial life. This photograph illuminates one particular type of protozoa called vorticella using a technique called dark field microscopy, which blocks out the direct light from the source, so that only light scattered by the specimen is observed, enabling brilliant bright images to be seen again a dark background . This year has been chosen by the United Nations, because it marks a number of anniversaries of significant discoveries, such as early works of optics by Ibn al-Haytham in 1015 and the centenary of Einstein’s theory of relativity. Ibn al-Haytham, the Medieval polymath, made contributions to the principles of optics, visual perception and astronomy. His research on optical systems using mirrors led to the discovery that the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant and he investigated the magnifying power of lenses. Throughout the year, events will take place across the world to celebrate the applications of light. Scientists have captured  X-ray emissions from young stars with masses similar to our Sun outside our Milky Way galaxy for the first time. In this composite image of the Wing the Chandra - one of our galaxy's closest neighbours -  optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope is shown in red, green and blue and infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope is shown in red . While the first headlights on cars were fuelled by kerosene or acetylene, today's versions are far safer and more effective. Newer cars use halogen or light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of incandescent bulbs, but reflected lasers may be used in the future. This image combines eight photos, each lasting for 30 seconds, showing traffic on a road . For centuries, lighthouses have kept mariners safe by illuminating rough stretches of water and dangerous rocks.  This image of a lighthouse off the west coast of Wales has additional beautiful illuminated elements. From the top left to the lower right in the sky, Venus, Jupiter, and the Moon reflecting light from the sun can be seen hanging over Dublin, in Ireland . Together with the sun, most people instantly think of light bulbs when considering light. This image shows assorted bulbs as a coloured x-ray .","Images of different forms of light, from polarised microscope images to lightning strikes are featured in a new exhibition that forms part of Unesco’s International Year of Light, which runs this year .

"Bad teacher: Michelle Ladd, 41, a married teacher from Indiana, has been charged with having sexual relationships with two 17-year-old students . A 41-year-old teacher from Indiana has been charged with having sex with two 17-year-old students and giving them thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts, including alcohol, guns and cars. Michelle Ladd, of Miami County, was arrested Monday on charges of child seduction, unlawful transfer of a handgun and providing alcohol to a minor. Investigators with the Miami County Sheriff's Office say the instructional assistant with the Maconaquah School Corporation's alternative program started a relationship with one of her students in 2010 after she and her husband hired the 17-year-old to work on their farm to earn some extra cash. During an interview with police, the boy said his first sexual encounter with the teacher took place at her home where he stayed for two weeks. Court documents cited by Fox59 state that in the course of their affair, which lasted until the summer of 2013, the married teacher's aide bought the victim alcohol and two cars. As her first affair was winding down, Ladd allegedly began exchanging sexually explicit text messages with another 17-year-old boy nor long after he was released from a juvenile center, where he had been sent for committing a burglary. The teen told sheriff’s deputies he and Ladd consummated their relationship for the first time in April 2013, and the pair continued seeing each other romantically until November 2014, reported Kokomo Tribune. According to investigators, Ladd again was showering her teenage lover with presents, which included handguns, despite his criminal history. Preying on the weak: Ladd is an instructional assistant with the Maconaquah School Corporation's alternative program, working with middle and high school students struggling with homework or social skills . When questioned by police last month, Ladd allegedly admitted to both trysts. Maconaquah School Corporation Superintendent Dr. Doug Arnold said news of Ladd's arrest came as a shock to him because the educator has been effective in the classroom, working with middle and high school students struggling with homework or social skills. Mrs Ladd has been released on $56,000 bond. She is due back in court February 19.","Michelle Ladd, from Indiana, charged with child seduction, unlawful transfer of a handgun and providing alcohol to a minor .

"A new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim. The software, developed by biomedical experts at Columbia University, analyses blood samples taken with a finger-prick dongle. The kit, which attaches to any smartphone or computer, replicates a lab test and can give a diagnosis in the field in just 15 minutes. The device is nearly 540 times cheaper than current lab testing machines, and has already been tested on patients in Rwanda during a pilot study. Scientists at Columbia University have invented a new dongle that attaches to a mobile phone and can diagnose HIV and syphilis in 15 minutes. This means millions of lives could be saved through early diagnosis . Health workers tested the blood of 96 patients who were enrolling into clinics aimed at preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child, or those visiting voluntary counselling and testing centres. The dongle was developed to be small and light enough to fit in one hand. It draws its power from the smartphone allowing it to be used in remote areas, providing the phone is charged. Samuel Sia, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University, said the team's work showed that full laboratory-quality tests can be run on a smartphone app. This makes a diagnosis accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones. 'This kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world,' he added. In the past, Professor Sia's team has worked on creating miniature testing kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. He said: 'We know that early diagnosis and treatment in pregnant mothers can greatly reduce adverse consequences to both them and their babies.' The new kits are expected to cost around £22.50 to manufacture, compared with the £12,150 cost of a standard lab testing machine. In Rwanda, healthcare workers were given 30 minutes of training and 97 per cent of patients said they would recommend the device. This was because of its fast turnaround time, ability to offer results for multiple diseases and the simplicity of procedure. The dongle, which plugs into any smartphone or computer, draws its energy from the device, allowing it to be used in remote areas. The team which created it estimate it will be 540 times cheaper than existing machines . Professor Sia said: 'Our dongle presents new capabilities for a broad range of users, from health care providers to consumers. 'By increasing detection of syphilis infections, we might be able to reduce deaths by 10-fold. 'And for large-scale screening - where the dongle's high sensitivity with few false negatives is critical - we might be able to scale up HIV testing at the community level with immediate antiretroviral therapy. 'This could nearly stop HIV transmissions and approach elimination of this devastating disease. 'We are really excited about the next steps in bringing this product to the market in developing countries. 'And we are equally excited about exploring how this technology can benefit patients and consumers back home.' Professor Sia's team's work is published in Science Tranlational Medicine.","Dongle that plugs into a smartphone or computer can diagnose HIV and syphilis within 15 minutes, say Columbia University scientists .

"Facebook users are being warned about a rise in so-called ‘malicious tagging’ scams designed to infect their phones, tablets and computers. Over the past week, security researchers have spotted at least two ‘tag campaigns’ that were able to infect around 55,000 users a day. The scams work by tagging no more than 20 friends of the victim in a malicious post designed to lure the friends into clicking a link or watching a video. Scroll down for video . Over the past week, security researchers have spotted at least two ‘tag campaigns’ which have infected more than 115,000 users.The scam works by tagging no more than 20 friends of the victim in a malicious post designed to lure people into clicking a link or watching a video (pictured) Romania-based threat analyst Bogdan Botezatu, from security firm Bitdefender, reported on the first scam on 26 January. In a blog post, Mr Botezatu said: ‘The scam starts with an alleged video in which a number of friends are tagged in. 'The number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different.' The scam starts with an alleged video that is posted with 20 friends tagged. The number of tagged friends is always 20 but the alleged video is always different. Typically, the so-called video shows the goo.gl host underneath. This is a URL shortening service and not a video hosting site. After a victim clicks on this particular link, they are prompted to update Adobe Flash Player, at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files and viruses designed to steal personal information. Once infected, the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own newsfeed, tagging another 20 people. Users are being warned to be wary of clicking on links they are tagged in, and are encouraged to check with friends who have posted the link to check its safety. Antivirus software will also detect malicious files and installations. The  video shows the goo.gl host underneath, which Mr Botezatu said should raise some flags with more experienced users, as it is a URL shortening service and not a video hosting site. After a victim clicks on this particular link, they are prompted to update Adobe Flash Player, at which point the hacker can take control of a device and install other malicious files and viruses designed to steal personal information. This could include accessing personal files to steal photos, or logging what keys are typed to steal login details and passwords. Once infected, the victim inadvertently posts the link to their own Facebook newsfeed, tagging another 20 people, and so on. Another scam, also spotted by Mr Botezatu targeted Spanish speakers specifically, but had the same outcome. In just one hour, this scam infected more than 5,000 users. At the weekend, security expert Mohammad Reza Faghani additionally posted details of a tagging Trojan. He wrote: ‘The trojan tags the infected user's friends in an enticing post. 'Upon opening the post, the user will get a preview of a porn video which eventually stops and asks for downloading a (fake) Flash Player to continue the preview.' During two days of monitoring, Mr Faghani found the malware infected more than 110,000 users and was rising. He said that by only tagging 20 people each time, the malware is able to keep a relatively low profile, but has the potential to reach more people because friends of friends can see tagged posts, depending on a person’s privacy settings.

"A new fossil may force anthropologists to rewrite the evolutionary history of how our early ancestors first began walking upright on two legs. For decades scientists have believed that our upright posture evolved in a common ancestor shared with the great apes including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans around 15 million years ago. This led to the broad torsos and mobile forelimbs that appear all great apes - known as the orthograde body plan. But a 12.3 million year old fossilised hipbone belonging a prehistoric ape named Sivapithecus indicus discovered in modern Pakistan, is challenging this belief. The hip bone (pictured) of an early ape ancestor called Sivapithecus indicus may lead to the evolutionary tree of apes and humans being rewritten as it suggests apes evolved to walk upright more than once in the past . This species was thought to be an ancient relative of the orangutan that emerged after the great apes split from the gibbons and lived around 12 million to 10 million years ago . Fossilised skull fragments have suggested it had the facial features similar to modern orangutans and scientists assumed it would also have an ape-like body plan. British biologist Sir Alister Hardy was among the first scientists to propose that humans are descended from aquatic apes. He wrote that apes came down from the trees to live in the food rich creeks, river and seas. He said they evolved to become upright as they tried to keep their heads above water, and lost their hair. They developed fat to keep warm in the water. Some scientists propose that humans evolved large sinuses principally to help make our heads more buoyant and keep them above water. But other anthropologists say there is little evidence to support the idea that our ape ancestors spend millions of years evolving in a watery environment. They argue that predators like crocodiles, which have been on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs, would have made rivers, lakes and swamps dangerous places. However, the new hipbone has revealed that these creatures had a narrow torso that more resembles those of monkeys. This suggests that Sivapithecus may have had both ape-like and monkey-like features, and has left researchers baffled about how it fits into the evolutionary tree. If it is indeed an ancestor of the orangutan, then it could mean that the upright ape-like body plan evolved at least twice in the past - once in orangutans and once in other great apes. Dr Michele Morgan, cruator of osteology and paleoanthropology at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, said: 'We always thought if we found this body part, that it would show some of the features we find in the living great apes. 'To find something like this was surprising. 'Today, all the living great apes—gorillas, orangutans, chimps—have very broad torsos. 'People had commonly thought that this torso shape was shared among all the great apes, meaning it must have evolved in a common ancestor. 'We initially believed that Sivapithecus was on the orangutan line, but if that is the case, then the great ape body shape would have had to evolve at least twice.' Skull fragments of Sivaptihecus indicus (above) suggest it had facial features similar to modern orangutans . Scientsts believe Sivapithecus would have moved through the trees in ancient forests like a monkey on all four limbs but would have often used branches to support its weight much like an orangutan, pictured above . The researchers, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, used the new hipbone fossil along with other pieces of fossilised skeleton discovered in the past to reconstruct how Sivapithecus may have moved. The believe that it was probably a slow-moving and deliberate creature that lived in the trees. They say it may have moved on all fours above supports but perhaps frequently used branches to help support its body in much the same way as modern orangutans do. There are a number of competing theories for how our ape ancestors first began walking on two legs. Some biologists believe it was a natural progression as ancient species of ape began using branches to help support their weight. Others say they used water to help support their weight as they began foraging for food in rivers and pools in the forests, much like gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees still do today. This bonobos, a relative of the chimpanzee, wading through water on two legs using a branch as a walking stick. Some scientists believe this may have been how upright walking first appeared in ape ancestors . However, Dr Lawrence Flynn, assistant director of the American School of Prehistoric Research at the Peabody Museum who was also involved in the research, said that the latest findings suggest that the evolutionary tree of the great apes was probably far more complicated than previously believed. He said: 'I think we sometimes take the easy route of trying to understand these fossils based on creatures we find today. 'What we're finding out time and again is these 10- or 12- or 15-million-year-old creatures were their own entities. Today is not always a very good model for the past. 'What this speaks to is a rich tree with a lot of branches. There are not just one or two branches that reach back into the Miocene. It's a very rich and complex tree.'","The fossil is from an ancestor of the orangutan called Sivapithecus indicus .
This early ape lived in what is now Pakistan around 12.3 million years ago .

"The head of Sunni Islam's top university has called for the crucifixion of Islamic State militants over the burning of a Jordanian fighter pilot - an act even Al-Qaeda condemned as 'deviant'. Responding to the murder of Moaz al-Kasasbeh, the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar university in Cairo, Ahmed al-Tayib, said those responsible must face 'killing, crucifixion and chopping of the limbs.' His judgement came as a Twitter account linked to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni branch of the terror group, denounced the killing as 'conclusive proof of Isis' deviance'. Gruesome: Moaz al-Kasasbeh stands inside the cage where he was burned to death, in a frame taken from the video circulated by Islamic State militants yesterday showing the killing of the Jordanian fighter pilot . Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . The so-called Islamic State  showed the gruesome killing of Kasasbeh in a video on Tuesday. He was captured in Syria in December when his plane went down during a bombing mission. Footage circulated online showed the 26-year-old locked in a cage, doused with fuel and torched. Jordan immediately executed two Islamic State-linked death row prisoners in revenge for the killing. Muslim clerics widely condemned Kasasbeh's burning, saying such a form of killing was considered despicable by Islam, no matter the context. The 1,000-year-old Al-Azhar university, which is revered by Sunni Muslims around the world, issued a statement expressing 'deep anger over the lowly terrorist act' by what it called a 'Satanic' group. Grand Sheikh Tayib said the act 'requires the punishment mentioned in the Koran for these corrupt oppressors who fight against God and his prophet: killing, crucifixion or chopping of the limbs.' In Qatar, the International Association of Muslim Scholars, headed by prominent cleric Youssef al-Qaradawi and linked to the Muslim Brotherhood that has influence across the region, called the burning of Kasasbeh a criminal act. 'The Association asserts that this extremist organisation does not represent Islam in any way and its actions always harm Islam,' it said. Condemnation: Responding to Kasasbeh's murder, the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar university, pictured, in Cairo, Ahmed al-Tayib, said those responsible must face 'killing, crucifixion and chopping of the limbs' An eye for an eye: Jordan executed two IS-linked prisoners including Sajida al-Rishawi (left) hours after militants released the video that showed Kasasbeh (right) being burned alive . Saudi cleric Salman al-Odah wrote on his Twitter account: 'Burning is an abominable crime rejected by Islamic law regardless of its causes.' Born as an offshoot of Al-Qaeda, Islamic State was cast out of the international terror network last year in response to its brutality. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's chief, last February issued a statement dissociating his group from Islamic State, which it accused of 'forbidden bloodshed' directed at fellow fighters. He said: 'We weren't informed about its creation, nor counselled. Nor are we satisfied with it: rather we ordered it to stop... Nor is al–Qaeda responsible for its actions and behaviour.' Islamic State is the successor of the al-Qaeda affiliate set up in Iraq in 2004 by Abu Musab Zarqawi to attack US occupation forces and Shia targets. Zarqawi was, in fact, reprimanded for his sectarian violence by Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri, who feared Muslim opinion would be alienated from al-Qaeda - advice that Zarqawi ignored. After Zarqawi was killed in 2006, his successor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, set up the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and continued his mentor's legacy of violence. It reemerged in 2011 as a jihadi fighting force in the civil war in Syria, now re-named as ISIS, and earned a reputation for its rampant and gruesome violence, including beheadings and amputations. Since then it has overrun vast swathes of both Iraq and Syria, massacring those it deems 'infidels' and controlling local Sunni populations with its brutal interpretation of Sharia law. 'It is rejected whether it falls on an individual or a group or a people. Only God tortures by fire,' he added. In reply, Islamic State posted its own religious edict on Twitter, which ruled that it is permissible in Islam to burn an infidel to death. However, senior clerics across the Islamic world argued that inflicting death by fire was always banned under Islam. 'The Prophet, peace be upon him, advised against burning people with fire,' Sheikh Hussein bin Shu'ayb, head of the religious affairs department in southern Yemen, told Reuters in Aden. And even Muslim leaders sympathetic to the jihadist cause said the act of burning a man alive and filming the killing would damage Islamic State, which controls swathes of Syria and Iraq. Abu Sayaf, a Jordanian Salafist cleric who spent almost ten years in Jordanian prisons for militant activity, including a plot to attack U.S. troops, said: 'This weakens the popularity of Islamic State because we look at Islam as a religion of mercy and tolerance. Even in the heat of battle, a prisoner of war is given good treatment.' 'Even if the Islamic State says Moaz had bombed and burned and killed us, and we punished him in the way he did to us, we say, OK but why film the video in this shocking way?' Sayaf told Reuters. 'This method has turned society against them.' SITE, a U.S.-based monitoring service, quoted Abdullah bin Muhammad al-Muhaysini, whom it described as a Saudi jihadi, as saying on Twitter it would have been better if Kasasbeh's captors had swapped him for 'Muslim captives'. The killing would make ordinary people sympathetic to Kasasbeh, he said. Of course, admirers of Islamic State cheered the killing. In a Twitter message, a user called Suhaib said: 'To any pilot participating in the crusader coalition against the holy warriors - know that your plane might fall in the next mission. Sleep well!' Inconsolable: Saif al-Kasasbeh (centre), the father of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh, is seen at the headquarters of the family's tribe in the city of Karak today as he mourns the loss of his son . Clean cut: Jordanian officials have told the devastated family of the 26-year-old (pictured) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a 'hero' in his homeland was dead . Many ordinary people across the Middle East expressed disgust. 'This a criminal, barbaric act which has no place in Islam or humanity. Islam bears no responsibility for them and their claim to be an Islamic State is ridiculous,' said Nawaf al-Dweik, 43, an engineer from Ramallah in the West Bank. 'There should be a joint Arab force to go in and destroy these killers and be rid of them once and for all,' he added. 'I have never heard of any group that claims to be Muslim and commits such atrocities,' said Shadi Abdel-Wahhab, a 22-year-old university student in Sanaa, Yemen's capital. The video circulated yesterday, titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows Kasasbeh in an orange jumpsuit doused in fuel, before militants set light to a trail of petrol leading up to the cage where he is held. Flames quickly engulf the helpless pilot - images that are far too distressing to publish. Extremists then pour debris, including broken masonry, over the cage, before it is flattened by a bulldozer.","Grand Sheikh of Sunni Islam's most important university condemns act .

"One is a Time Lord and the other the world’s biggest toy brand and together they plan to face down the evils of the galaxy – even the Daleks. Lego has signed a deal with the BBC to create a Dr Who set with mini-figures, the Tardis and representations of many of the enemies he has taken on and defeated. The partnership is a huge deal for the BBC and could – in financial terms alone – be the biggest shot in the arm for its commercial subsidiary since the success of the Teletubbies in the 1990s. Scroll down for video . How the new Dr Who lego could look after it was designed by fan of the programme Andrew Clarke. It features the Dr Who played by David Tennant, and Billie Piper as his assistant, as well as a Dalek and a Cyberman . Many a child has sat down with his Lego bricks to create his own Tardis since Dr Who first appeared on screens in 1963, however they will now get their own themed sets to create adventures. Just this week Lego was named at the top of a list of the 50 greatest toys of all time by a survey of industry executives. The Danish-owned company overtook Mattel to be the world’s largest toy maker last year, not least because of an increasingly number of commercial tie-ups with successful film franchises, such as Batman and Frozen. It posted a 12 per cent increase in half­year operating profit to £380million on sales up 11 per cent to £1.2billion. The Lego Movie also sold more tickets in the UK than any other in 2014, amassing takings of £34.3m to put it ahead of the likes of The Hobbit, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Hunger Games. Mr Clark, a professional artist and designer in the games industry, also built his own version of the Tardis from Lego bricks, which can be opened out to form part of a larger play set . The partnership between Lego and the BBC will see the toys developed and be on sale in time for Christmas . The BBC already has a vast array of toy deals around Dr Who, offering everything from voice changing Cyberman helmets to various incarnations of the all-powerful Sonic Screwdriver. However, the partnership with Lego could generate huge sales around the globe, given the BBC series has attracted a large and growing overseas audience since it returned to the screen in 2005. The concept for a Doctor Who set came from the Lego Ideas website where fans can submit suggestions, which are then put to the vote. The winning design created by Dr Who fan, Andrew Clark, featured a mock-up of various doctors, including David Tennant and Tom Baker, alongside Billie Piper, K9 the robot dog, and versions of the Daleks, Cybermen and Weeping Angels. Mr Clark, a professional artist and designer in the games industry, also built his own version of the Tardis from Lego bricks, which can be opened out to form part of a larger play set. The final line-up of the toys has not yet been decided, however, Mr Clark’s designs will serve as the inspiration for sets that are certain to include mini-figures of the current doctor, played by Peter Capaldi, and his companion Jenna Coleman. The deal is thought to be one of the biggest for the BBC's commercial arm BBC Worldwide, which also made millions through Teletubbies, pictured, merchandise . A licensing agreement between BBC Worldwide, which is the corporation’s commercial arm, and Lego will see the new set available in all company’s key markets before the end of the year. The managing director of BBC Worldwide, Marcus Arthur, said: ‘Both Doctor Who and Lego enjoy a particularly close relationship with their fans and I can’t wait to see what Lego produce.’ Lego has also decided to create sets that tie in to the children’s film WALL-E film, which featured a robot and was a big hit in 2008, following a vote among customers. Emma Owen, the UK spokesman for Lego, said: ‘We’re extremely excited to announce that a Doctor Who and a WALL-E set will be released as our next Lego Ideas fan based sets, congratulations to the designers. ‘After receiving over 10,000 votes from the online community and having gone through rigorous toy testing from our expert panel, these awesome sets are on track to be on shelves later this year’ She said the final set designs, pricing and availability are still to be decided.","Lego signs multi-million pound deal with BBC for Dr Who themed sets .

"A man sprayed liquid manure through his former neighbour's letterbox in a six-year-grudge over dog fouling. Stewart Reid, 62, squirted the foul-smelling brown liquid from a bottle through the front door of his rival's home in New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, before running away. He told police officers he was 'sorry' for the bizarre attack and on Monday at Peterhead Sheriff Court admitted threatening and abusive behaviour  and possessing a knife. A man sprayed liquid manure through his former neighbour's letterbox on this street in New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in a six-year-grudge over dog fouling . The court was told that Reid had known the home's occupants from when he used to live in the same village, and had also splashed paint over the house in the early hours of September 5. Reid, who now lives in Portknockie, around 30 miles along the coast, was caught shortly after the attack by the owner's son - who spotted him as he attempted to make his getaway. When police searched him they discovered he was carrying a knife, while his car - parked outside the village - contained bottles of manure, the liquid mixture and paint. 'At that point he said he'd pay for the damage and was sorry,' Fiscal Stephanie Ross told the court, according to The Press and Journal. Reid, who now lives in Portknockie (pictured), around 30 miles along the coast, was caught by the owner's son shortly after the attack . Peterhead Sheriff Court was told it had cost the home-owners around £200 to clean up the mess left by Reid . The court was told it had cost the home-owners around £200 to clean up the mess left by Reid, and that the attack was the culmination of a six-year grudge Reid held over a dog fouling dispute with his former neighbours. Ms Ross said: 'There had been an altercation some six years ago. Matters had been getting to him since then.' Reid's agent, solicitor Gail Wiggins, said her client was 'wholly embarrassed' by his actions. Reid is due to be sentenced on February 23 after Sheriff Andrew Miller deferred the hearing so that background reports could be prepared.","Stuart Reid, 62, squirted manure mix from a bottle through the door .

"A woman whose brother was killed by a former Power Ranger  has disputed his claims that he stabbed the man in self defense. Ricardo Medina Jr., who played the Red Ranger, was released from jail on Tuesday after authorities said there was not enough evidence to prove he murdered his roommate, Joshua Sutter. Instead, they said they believed Medina stabbed Sutter in self defense after the man forced his way into his room at their Palmdale, California home on Saturday afternoon. 'You have an individual here that was the victim of a beating in the kitchen area before he went to the bedroom and closed and locked the door,' Medina's attorney, Allen Bell, said. But Sutter's sister isn't buying it. Scroll down for videos . Proof of murder? An image of Ricardo Medina Jr.'s bedroom door shows no damage, even though he claims his roommate Joshua Sutter broke in before Medina stabbed him, Sutter's sister has said . 'I just don't feel he would go and attack someone that he knows could take him down,' Rachel Kennedy told ABC News. She said that a photograph taken by a company she employed to clean up the crime scene shows Medina's undamaged bedroom door - suggesting Sutter did not force his way inside. 'I think that Josh probably opened the door trying to talk to him and I think he probably snapped,' she said, adding that she knew Sutter, 36, and Medina, 36, had been having problems. But on Tuesday, Medina was released following three days in jail after authorities said they did not have enough evidence to prove he committed a murder. 'I want to say I'm very, very, very sorry for what occurred,' he told reporters outside the jail. 'I'm very happy to be out of jail. My heart goes out to the Sutter Family.' His lawyer said his client's story was backed up by his girlfriend's account. Freed: Medina, 36, is pictured as he left jail after authorities say there was no evidence he committed murder . Not buying it: But Sutter's sister, Rachel Kennedy, said her brother would never have taken on Medina . Together: Kennedy is pictured with her brother, Joshua Sutter, who died after he was stabbed in the abdomen . 'He was not only defending himself, but a young lady who was an independent witness, who observed the entire incident,' Allen said. Sutter was said to have been angry that Medina's girlfriend was spending too much time at their home when Medina was not there,TMZ reported. The roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm on Saturday before Medina went into his room with his girlfriend. Sutter then reportedly followed him and burst into the room. Medina grabbed a sword from behind his door and stabbed the man in the abdomen. Medina called 911 and was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, while Sutter was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

"You would think it would take a bit more than Irish charm to talk your way past security and into $25,000 seats at the Super Bowl. But that's exactly what a pair of Seattle Seahawks fans from the Emerald Isle managed to do for the main event at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday. Richard Whelan from Dublin and Paul McEvoy from Cahir had made the 5,000 mile trip hoping their team would take the title against the New England Patriots - and they'd be there to see it. Scroll down for audio . Richard Whelan (right) and Paul McEvoy couldn't believe it when they landed in prime Super Bowl seats . The pair may have wanted the Patriots to lose but at least their mascot was game for waving the Irish flag . Facing prices of up to $10,000 for a single seat, it looked as though their hopes might be dashed, until they decided to put their bluffing skills to the test. After getting interviewed by the NFL Network in an unsuccessful effort to try and land tickets, they thought they'd try just walking up to the front door and seeing what happened. Whelan gleefully documented what followed on Twitter as the pair had an evening they won't be forgetting in a hurry. He told RTE Radio One Morning Ireland: 'Our game plan was to be super confident. 'We just thought if we pretend we belong there, nobody will question us. 'Between one layer of security and another we just walked in behind these 20 first aid workers, straight up to the front door and hid in behind them. 'Paul was looking at his phone, pretending to text me, as if we had just popped out to look at an email we got or something. McEvoy (left) and Whelan even got free expert analysis from former Super Bowl champion Lawyer Malloy . 'We walked past another security guard that just wasn't paying attention. We could see the field then, the stadium and the atmosphere was insane…I remember looking at Paul's face, we just couldn't believe we got in.' To celebrate their incredible good luck, Whalen tweeted: 'I fu**ing made it!! Snook in straight through the front door! NOW LET'S GO HAWKS!.' And there was more good fortune to come after the pair spent the first half jumping from seat to seat when people had gone off to the toilet or for food and convincing the Patriots mascot to pose with an Irish flag. During halftime they stumbled across two empty seats in the fourth row worth a cool $25,000 each, next to former Patriots legend Lawyer Milloy, who finished his illustrious NFL career at the Seahawks. Whalen said: 'We spoke to this guy and told him we had sneaked in. He told us the girls beside him were in the halftime show and so wouldn't be coming back to their seats after halftime. 'So we ended up in the fourth row, sitting beside a former Super Bowl champion Lawyer Milloy who gave us a play-by-play of the game … It was pretty cool to have the Super Bowl champion sharing all the details.' Unfortunately their team fell agonizingly short, losing 28-24 to a Tom Brady-inspired Patriots. Along with a pic of him and McEvoy, Whelan tweeted: 'Getting ready for the long trip back to Dublin. Hopefully I'm allowed back home :).' But at least they managed to find their way onto a VIP bus back to their hotel. 'It was a good day of hustling,' Whalen admitted. 'What seemed impossible came true.' They tried to score tickets by doing a television interview but didn't have any joy with that approach . Unfortunately for the two Seahawks fans their team came unstuck against a Tom Brady-inspired Patriots . These are the astronomical prices they were looking at for a seat - had they been minded to pay for one .","Richard Whelan from Dublin and Paul McEvoy from Cahir sneak in to game .

"A fire chief accused of raping a woman in a pub as his wife sat yards away was cleared in less than 15 minutes today. Sean Frayne, 48, of Fixby, Huddersfield, broke down in tears in the arms of wife Helen – who has stood by him – after he was told he could leave the dock at the end of a seven-day trial. The £140,000-a-year Chief Fire Officer for Derbyshire was cleared after his lawyer had criticised the decision to prosecute the father-of-three. Chief fire officer Sean Frayne, 48, (pictured with wife Helen) denied raping a woman in 2006 and instead claimed he had a consensual sexual encounter with her  - he was today cleared of rape by a jury . In her closing speech to the jury, Laura Pitman questioned why police had failed to launch a blackmail inquiry after it emerged that a friend of the alleged victim wrote to Mr Frayne suggesting the woman may ‘avoid publicity’ for a substantial out-of-court payment. Miss Pitman said: ‘They (the police) have investigated one side of the story and they have not investigated the other. ‘If this is nothing to do with money why is there even mention of an out-of-court payment?’ Trial judge Jonathan Gosling then told the jury during his summing up of the case: ‘You may think it extraordinary that no claim of blackmail has ever been followed (up) by Derbyshire Police’. Mr Frayne had denied raping the woman – claiming they had consensual sex when she ‘came on’ to him with a ‘passionate’ kiss in an empty part of the village pub, yards from where Mrs Frayne was drinking. The December 2006 encounter in Etwall, Derbyshire, only came to light seven years later when the woman told a male friend about the alleged sex attack. Frayne's lawyer criticised the decision to prosecute Frayne instead of launching a blackmail inquiry . The friend then sent Frayne two anonymous letters accusing Mr Frayne of rape and seeking an ‘out of court settlement’ for the alleged victim. The letters threatened to report Frayne to police if he did not respond to a telephone number provided. Derby Crown Court heard Mr Frayne took his wife along with him to confront the woman after receiving the first letter, before she made a formal complaint to police in December 2013. During the trial a police officer in the case was questioned by Miss Pitman about the content of the letters received by Mr Frayne. Detective Chief Inspector Richard Parkins said the decision was made to treat the letter-writer as a witness and not a suspect because officers considered no threats had been made towards Mr Frayne. Prosecutor Martin Hurst told the jury it was the Crown’s case that the alleged victim knew nothing about her friend’s decision to attempt to ‘achieve some sort of informal justice’ for her by writing to Mr Frayne. But the trial heard the letters were not finger-printed by police because they were ‘not the focus’ of the police investigation. Miss Pitman told the jury: ‘The victim, on her account, says she has not touched them. Were her fingerprints on those letters? We will never know because the police never bothered.’ Mr Frayne, a father-of-three who has never been in trouble before, admitted he had been a ‘fool’ for cheating on his wife so brazenly. But he told the jury the allegation of rape had ‘wrecked’ his life. He denied suggestions from Mr Hurst that he had forced himself upon the woman because he thought that he and his wife were going to ‘engage in some swinging’ – the swapping of sexual partners. Mr Frayne branded the suggestion ‘absolutely ludicrous’. The jury took just 14 minutes to reach a verdict today. Mr Frayne and his wife left court without comment - on Mrs Frayne’s 54th birthday. During the trial, the jury were told the alleged victim had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012 after she failed to declare a change in circumstances. Jurors at Derby Crown Court (pictured) took just 14 minutes to find Frayne not guilty of the rape . Derbyshire Police said: ‘An allegation was made of an historical offence and we investigated it was we would do with any other. The CPS brought the case to court. ‘The letters (sent to Mr Frayne) were not judged to have passed the threshold for a prosecution for blackmail.’ A CPS spokesperson said: ‘It was determined that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of a conviction and that it was in the public interest to proceed. ‘It is the role of the jury to listen to the evidence from the prosecution and from the defence and decide on that evidence alone whether a defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt - this is a different test than the one applied in our decision making. 'In this instance, having heard arguments from the prosecution and the defence, the jury have determined that Mr Frayne is not guilty of rape and we respect that decision.’ Frayne, formerly of Etwall but now living in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has been suspended from work since his arrest last March. Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service Authority will meet on Friday to decide his future.","Sean Frayne, 48, was accused of raping the woman in a pub in 2006 .

"A single father who used to eat kebabs at bedtime every night, causing him to balloon to 30st has lost an incredible 10st in just 12 months after he feared leaving his daughter an orphan. Businessman Adam Harding-Jones, 48, from Wallasey on the Wirral, shed the pounds after his junk-food diet left him with kidney failure and on the verge of a heart attack. But Adam has swapped his gluttonous two McDonald's breakfasts and daily bedtime kebab for freshly-blended fruit and vegetables after seeing documentary Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead. Scroll down for video . Adam, left at 30 stone, lost 18in from his waist and developed passion for exercise (right) Scared his weight meant he wouldn't live to see his daughter grow up, Adam began juicing after being inspired by documentary 'Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead' Adam, who was dubbed 'big Al' by friends for his 56in waist and 5XL size, has since slimmed down and has picked up a gruelling exercise regime. Adam said: 'Over the last few years I felt horrendous and I felt older than I actually am. 'But now I feel a lot younger. I am doing a lot of things I never thought I'd get to do. I feel brilliant and when I think back to how ill I was and how bad I felt, I just never want to go back.' The former policeman began to pile on the pounds when he set-up his own Swift Sure Cars chauffeur company. Adam also suffered a blow after the breakdown of his relationship and he becoming a single parent to Amber, now 14. Adam used food as a comfort after the break down of his marriage and would often eat vast amounts of junk . Adam's healthy regime (left, blending a juice) means his old clothes now hang off him (right) The strain saw him eat two McDonald's sandwiches for breakfast, a kebab before bed and snacking on crisps and chocolate all day. And when Adam hit 30st on the scales, his mother feared he was going to die from a heart attack as he battled kidney failure and diabetes . Adam said: 'I knew I was on a slippery slope. My body was giving me a warning. I felt permanently not very well. I had an impending doom. 'It was scary but I didn't know what to do about it. If there was a competition for comfort eating then I'd win gold.' But after coming across weight loss film Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, Adam turned his life around. Breakfast: Two McDonald's breakfasts . Snack: Sandwiches . Lunch: Pasty . Dinner: Sausage and chips . Snacks: Crisps, chocolate, kebab before bed . Breakfast: Juice made from fresh fruit and vegetables . Lunch: Juice made from fresh fruit and vegetables . Dinner: Fish or meat with vegetables . Snacks: None . He ditched the fatty foods and snacks and made the life-saving switch to juicing. The new-found fitness fanatic has juice for breakfast and lunch and swapped his teatime sausage and chips for fish or meat with vegetables. The inspiration came from his teenage daughter and she has joined him on his quest to keep fit. Adam said: 'Juicing gets a lot of bad press but it lets me eat things that I wouldn't eat normally. Adam says daughter Amber, 14, (left) is proud of him and has even started juicing herself . As well as changing his diet, Adam has developed a love of exercise, especially cycling . 'I had to do it for Amber. She was embarrassed of me and wanted me to lose weight to get a girlfriend but now she's proud. 'And she's far more confident too. She has juices as well and she's far more active.' The 38in waist slimmer has done so well to shed 10st that strangers send him messages of thanks on Facebook and he has appeared in a book from juicing expert Joe Cross. Adam has since joined the gym and a cycling club in the Wirral and has already been in the saddle for a 50-mile ride in Staffordshire and completed Tough Mudder in September. He has already signed up for a 100-mile race in Wales and a series of half marathons to keep himself in shape.","At 30st suffered kidney failure, diabetes and on the verge of a heart attack .

"A 911 operator told a teenage girl to 'stop whining' as her father lay dying along a highway after being struck by a car. Rick Warrick, 38, and his fiancée, Julia Pearce, 28, had been heading to dinner in Anne Arundel County, Maryland with Warrick's two children when their car got a flat tire on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. As the couple changed the tire on the hard shoulder, the youngsters watched in horror as a vehicle struck them and then sped away. The teenage girl frantically called 911 for help. Scroll down for video . Killed: Rick Warrick, 38, died after he and his fiancee were struck by a hit-and-run driver as they changed a tire on the hard shoulder of a Maryland highway on Sunday. His two children witnessed the tragedy . 'Can y'all please hurry up!' the teen begs the male operator in a recording of the call, NBC Washington reported. The operator responds: 'Ma'am, stop yelling, I need a location.' When the girl tells him that they're on I-295, he tells her 'that's a pretty long road'. Again, she urgently tells him that two people were struck. 'OK, let's stop whining. OK, let's stop whining. It's hard to understand you... two people were struck, correct?' the operator says on the recording. When she tells him that the couple are lying on the ground not moving, he asks to talk to someone else - but she tells him that he'll be able to understand her little brother even less. Eventually emergency responders reached the couple. Scene: He had managed to switch the front tire on the front of his car when he was hit late on Sunday. When his daughter called 911 to get help, the male operator told her to stop whining . Warrick, a car salesman from Washington D.C., died at the scene.

When quizzed by NBC Washington over the incident, Russ Davis with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department admitted that the operator had not used the best choice of words and should respond differently in the future. 'However, what he was attempting to do was to get her attention, to start ascertaining information from her,' Davis said. 'It was pretty clear at that point they didn't know where they were.' Police and family members are now pleading for the driver who hit the couple to come forward. Sgt. Lelani Woods told WJLA that the couple were completely on the shoulder of the roadway when they were hit. The car then fled.

'Truly, if you have a child, or any children, how would you feel if someone just ran over your child, killed your child, and just kept going?' said Charmaine Ferrell-Anthony, Warrick's mother. 'A hit and run, there's no excuse for it, when you can just stop right there.' She added: 'I think the right thing will be to do just to turn yourself in. Accidents happen and we understand.

India pushed out Russia by adding 27 members to the club, bring its total number of billionaires to 97. China gained 72 to bring its total to 430 and the U.S. added 56 and now has 537, according to CNBC. Scroll down for video . Most billionaires ever: The world created 341 new billionaires in 2014, helping to bump the total to a record 2,089. The world's richest man remains Bill Gates (worth $85B) and his home country of the United States has the most billionaires, with 537 . Despite the worldwide net gain, not every billionaire had a good year. Some even lost the status. Last year saw a gain of 341 new billionaires, 95 became mere multi-millionaires. Perhaps hit the hardest were the billionaires in some of the developing world, most notably Russia. According to the Hurun Report, 'Wealth of 60 percent of Russian billionaires declined in the face of the stagnating economy, devalued ruble and plummeting global oil prices.' The most new billionaires were born of the tech sector in 2014, according to Hurun Report. 'Tech has been leading the way again for new billionaires,' Hurun chairman Rupert Hoogewerf said. 'It's all eyes on the new economy.' That's true not least of all for one of the original tech billionaires, and the richest man in the work, Bill Gates. The Microsoft mogul saw his fortune increase by 25 percent last year to $85 billion. Meanwhile, world's second wealthiest man Mexico's Carlos Slim saw his worth bumped up to $83 billion. In at number three was Warren Buffett, whose $76 billion fortune increased 19 percent from the previous year. Warren Buffett's $76B helped him come into the number 3 spot behind Carlos Slim of Mexico. While the three richest come from North America, burgeoning players China and India rounded off the top three countries with the most billionaires behind the U.S.","The United States tops the list with 537 billionaires while many newcomers to world's most exclusive club come from India and China .

"Forty per cent of Republicans in Iowa agree with potential presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's claims that singer Beyonce's music is 'mental poison'- according to a poll. The former host of the eponymous Fox News Channel show Huckabee had criticized the Single Ladies singer in his latest book - God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy. He described Beyonce's music as 'obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics' and her dance moves as 'best left for the privacy of her bedroom.' Republican Mike Huckabee, a potential presidential candidate (left), has written a book in which he criticizes singer Beyoncé (right) as being 'mental poison' After watching her performance of Drunk in Love with husband Jay Z on the Grammys, the potential presidential candidate added that the rapper was 'arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object'. And it appears he's not alone in his controversial views. A new poll by Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa found that 40 per cent of Iowa Republican caucus-goers - a conservative branch of the party - agreed with his characterization as 'mental poison'. While 38 per cent said Huckabee went too far and 22 per cent were unsure. There was also a gender divide in responses with Republican men  more likely to side with Huckabee as  45 per cent agreed to the statement compared with 32 per cent of  women agreed.

'I don't understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything—how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school…and yet they don't see anything that might not be suitable,' he told the magazine. But this time, the poll results suggested Huckabee, who served as the 44th Governor of Arkansas, had crossed a line by suggesting President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were bad parents. More than 60 per cent of Republican caucus-goers and a whopping 95 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers said Huckabee, 'went too far' in his comments, with just 23 percent of Republicans and 2 percent of Democrats agreeing he was 'mostly right.' The rest were unsure. Huckabee even went on criticize the Obamas for allowing their daughters to listen to the singer .","Mike Huckabee attacked the singer in his book God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy .

"A 20-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack during breast enhancement surgery says she feels grateful to be alive and she 'loves' her new chest. Amy Rickhuss went into cardiac arrest halfway through her breast augmentation at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in Western Sydney on Friday morning. Surgeons had to use a defibrillator to correct her heart rhythm and completed her cosmetic surgery before she was rushed to hospital in a serious condition.

She had her 10A breasts increased to about a D cup . Doctors are not sure what caused her heart to start beating irregularly, but they believe Ms Rickhuss may have either suffered an allergic reaction to the anaesthetic or may suffer from an underlying heart condition. She remains in hospital where she is undergoing a range of tests to work out the cause of the problem before she is released. As Ms Rickhuss recovered in hospital on Saturday, she told Daily Mail Australia  she was overwhelmed with the support she's had from family, friends and doctors from the clinic.

'It was part of our strict protocol as we did not want to send her to hospital with gaping wounds.' Ms Rickhuss added that she was 'thankful that they went through with the rest of the procedure'. 'The incident happened after they had completed one side. I was then stabilised and the paramedics and Dr Niro felt it was best to complete the surgery rather than leaving me with one implant and open wounds,' she said. 'Despite everything, I couldn't be happier. I'm so glad I've got two boobs instead of one!' Mr Segal said his staff had following protocol to call an ambulance 'as quickly as possible'. 'We've performed well over 10,000 procedures, and... with any type of procedure that you undergo, there are always going to be risks associated with it,' he said. The incident was described as an 'unforeseen event that occurred, unrelated to the surgery itself' on the clinic's Facebook page and further confirmed their patient has 'made a full recovery'.

"Whale watching is big business, with people travelling from all corners of the globe and shelling out $2.1billion in 2008 alone for the chance to head out to sea and hopefully get just a brief peek at these majestic creatures in their natural habitat. It would seem however that not all people are as excited by the chance to see a whale up close, as one man in Redondo Beach, California, was photographed by Eric J. Smith as he sat in a sailboat on a recent outing glued to his phone screen. This as just a few feet a way a humpback whale rose to the surface right next to the boat. Scroll down for video . A man in Redondo Beach, California was more interested in his phone than a humpback whale surfacing just feet away a few weeks ago . 'A small private sailboat maneuvered really close to the whales, and this guy on it was literally sitting in that position and never moved,' Smith told ABC News. 'He could have been texting his mom in the hospital for all I know, but I thought it sucked that he missed such a wonderful moment happening just two feet in front of him.' It was not just the one photo either, as Smith, who is a professional photographer, says he managed to get five snaps, and the man did not once stop looking at his phone. The man has yet to be identified, and it is not known what whale watching company Smith booked for his trip, which got him these amazing shots. Smith says the photo, which he posted Wednesday, was taken a few weeks ago. Humpbacks are one of the most impressive species of whale, migrating almost 20,000 miles a year and having been come back from the brink of extinction in the 1960s after their population declined by an astonishing 90% as they became a popular target for the whaling industry. They have been a protected species since 1966.","A photographer out on a whale watch captured the moment a humpback whale surfaced as a man sat on his sailboat oblivious to the sea mammal .

"Several major U.S. museums have banned selfie sticks - extendable smartphone devices which allow photos to be taken from up to a meter away - on the grounds of safety concerns. Despite the growing army of selfie-obsessed tourists and locals alike who trudge through the world brandishing their pole-equipped camera phones, many establishments feel they pose multiple hazards. 'I am pro-selfie, just not pro-selfie stick,' the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's chief digital officer Sree Sreenivasan tells Mashable. 'I'm worried about visitor safety and protecting our art.' Scroll down for video . Careful! Several major U.S. museums have banned selfie sticks - extendable smartphone devices which allow photos to be taken from up to a meter away (pictured) - on the grounds of safety concerns . Museums to have already banned the space-invading gadgets include New York's Museum of Modern Art and Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and 'enclosed spaces' in California's Getty Center. The Met is still pondering whether a ban might be necessary, while the MoMA claims it has 'never' permitted visitors to take photos using camera-extension devices. These safety concerns are not unfounded, even in the days before selfie sticks. Gadgets be gone: A sign displayed outside New York's Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, which has banished selfie sticks . The Met suffered a mishap in 2010 when a woman fell and slashed a six-inch tear into Pablo Picasso’s The Actor painting, for example. In 2006, a visitor at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, had a similar fall, this time 'demolishing' three Chinese Qing vases; and the same year, at the Milwaukee Art Museum, Gaston Lachaise's bronze Standing Woman statue was 'groped and vomited upon' during an after-hours museum party. Mere humans, it appears, can pose quite enough of a risk on their own, without introducing long metal poles into the equation. The selfie stick trend first emerged in Asia several years ago, before spreading worldwide and cementing its popularity over Christmas, when the gadgets became one of the bestselling gifts of the season. With all its fans, however, the selfie stick has plenty of bans, extending far beyond museum walls. Britain’s largest indoor venue, London’s O2 arena, recently banned them on health and safety grounds; as did the whole of South Korea, which has imposed steep fines for people using them due to the possible side effects of 'Bluetooth interference'.","New York's Museum of Modern Art and Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian have banned selfie sticks, along with Boston's Museum of Fine Arts .

"Fraudsters are selling fake make-up containing dangerous levels of poisonous chemicals such as arsenic and lead, consumers were warned yesterday. Fake versions of fashionable cosmetic brands including MAC and Benefit have been found to contain up to 19 times the legal level of lead. Pregnant women and their unborn babies are particularly vulnerable to some of the dangerous chemicals found in the counterfeit products, which have also been found to contain cancer-causing compounds. Scroll down for video . Counterfeit make-up containing dangerously high levels of metals is being sold across the country and in large volumes online, Trading Standards officers said as they warned about the danger of fake products . The warning came after trading standards officers swooped on a nail and beauty shop in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, reported to the authorities by a woman customer who reported having a bad skin reaction. Counterfeit versions of products by US firms MAC and Benefit and other big-name brands were seized, tested and found to contain high levels of lead, arsenic, mercury, copper and cadmium. The heavy metals have been linked to health problems ranging from allergic reactions and skin sensitivity to nerve disorders – and even death. Excessive levels of lead can cause high blood pressure, fertility problems, memory and concentration problems and increased risk of harm to the foetus during pregnancy. Dermatologists have reported a rise in the number of women with skin conditions triggered by use of the counterfeit cosmetics, and have warned the make-up can cause permanent damage. The manufacture of genuine cosmetics is strictly controlled and products are tested rigorously before they go on sale. But counterfeiters put cheap, untested substances in their concoctions, which are often packaged to look virtually identical to the genuine brand. Previously, fake versions of high-end mascara and eyeliner have been found to contain paint stripper and nail varnish remover, while a batch of counterfeit perfume seized by police was found to contain urine. Some of the fake make-up that has been found contains metals up to 200 times the safe limit for users . Trading standards officers have warned that online shoppers are also at risk, with fraudsters hiding behind internet sites to sell the fake goods. Officers have also reported finding makeup containing up to 200 times recommended safe levels of metal. The Daily Mail found several websites selling cut-price cosmetics yesterday, with prices reduced by up to 86 per cent. A MAC lipstick on the brand’s official website for £15.50 was available on a cut-price site for just £2.05. Consumers shopping online have no way of knowing if the reduced version is genuine or fake, but trading standards have warned that sites or shops offering massive reductions may be selling counterfeits. Warwickshire trading standards officers did not name the shop at the centre of their swoop, saying their investigation is still continuing. But county councillor Richard Chattaway said retailers had a legal responsibility to ensure their goods were genuine and safe to use. He added: ‘It is unusual for fake and dangerous cosmetics to appear on the high street. Warwickshire County Council's Trading Standards team recently seized fake MAC, Benefit and Naked Pallet products on sale at a store in Nuneaton. Some of the make-up found contained 19 times the limit of chemicals including deadly arsenic. A counterfeit MAC mascara looks similar to originals produced . They were alerted to the counterfeit products after a woman had an adverse skin reaction to one of the products. Results from tests on lip gloss, eye shadow, eye liner, skin powder and other facial cosmetics on sale at the nail and beauty store revealed they contained heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, copper, cadmium and lead. Warwickshire County Councillor Les Caborn, cabinet member for community safety, said: 'Exposure to heavy metals can cause a range of health problems. 'They can cause pregnant women to feel ill and damage unborn children. 'They are also associated with fertility problems, high blood pressure, and muscle pain and memory problems.' ‘However, we would advise consumers to seek medical attention if they have an adverse reaction and to report the product to trading standards.’ MAC Cosmetics is endorsed by pop star Rihanna and used by celebrities including TV cook Rachel Khoo and reality TV star Kim Kardashian. The firm said it worked with authorities in Britain and internationally to stop the illegal sale of counterfeit cosmetics and to block websites which sold them. Consumers are advised to buy from official websites or stockists and to examine packaging for batch numbers. Handley Brustad, lead officer for Intellectual Property at the Trading Standards Institute, said counterfeiters are frequently using the internet because they can escape detection and follow the latest trends to sell their fakes. He said: 'Online this is a huge problem because it's not as straightforward as finding it being sold in a high street shop or marketplace because you have got to do an awful lot of digging to find it. 'Counterfeiters are using domain names that appear like they are from the UK when they are not, and are making prices closer and closer to the genuine product to make them appear more real but make people think they are getting a bargain. 'With make-up we are finding the counterfeiters are putting in many more metals because that's what binds the make-up together. This is very strictly controlled in the UK because these metals are dangerous. 'People who buy the make-up are then putting these products near their eyes and mouths. They can cause blindness and if you ingest enough of it, even death. 'We are generally talking about high percentages of unsafe chemicals. It's usually heavy metals like lead and cadmium - the ones that are strictly regulated because of the harm they cause.' Fake MAC and Benefit make-up has also been found recently in South Wales, and Mr Brustad said examples containing dangerously high percentages had also been discovered. 'There have been incidents where we have found products containing 100 or 200 times these safe levels,' he added. 'Counterfeiters are getting better and better all the time which makes the industry all the more dangerous'","Counterfeit make-up containing dangerous levels of metals is being sold .

"Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner has come under fire for posting a racist tweet poking fun at stereotypical Chinese pronunciation during a visit to the country aimed at strengthening relations. Kirchner, who is facing questions in her own country over the death of a prosecutor who had accused her of helping to cover up a terrorist bombing, replaced the letter R with L in a tweet mocking the accent of the people she was meeting during the state visit on Wednesday. This resulted in the post, which it appears was supposed to suggest the 1,000 people at the event had only attended for the 'rice and petroleum', reading: 'are they here only for the lice and petloleum?' in an attempt to mimic the Chinese pronunciation. Hot water: Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner (left) came under fire for posting a racist tweet poking fun at stereotypical Chinese pronunciation. She is pictured here during the state visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping (right) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today . She seemed to make matters worse when she said 'sorry' and the 'ridiculous and absurd' situation should be 'digested with humour'. Despite the offensive tweet, Kirchner and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed 15 agreements covering travel visas, information technology, media, energy, space technology and financing. They also struck a deal to collaborate on two new nuclear power plants, but the finances of the agreements were not disclosed. Kirchner said two nuclear plants would be built in Argentina with transfer of technology from China, which is also helping Argentina build infrastructure such as dams and railways. Her visit came following the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who was shot  after accusing the President of helping to cover up a terrorist bombing.

Investigators probing the killing of Mr Nisman – found dead in his bathroom before he could testify about the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires – revealed they had found a draft document requesting Kirchner’s detention. Chief investigator Viviana Fein said the warrant was found in a bin at the apartment where Mr Nisman’s body was discovered on January 18. It was not included in a complaint Mr Nisman had filed in the federal court days earlier.

The 51-year-old was found slumped in his bathroom with a bullet wound in his head hours before he was to appear before congress to detail allegations that Kirchner agreed to protect those responsible for the bombing, which killed 85 and injured more than 200. The attack was believed to have been masterminded by Iran, something the country has denied. Kirchner has rejected Mr Nisman’s claims and has suggested that rogue intelligence operatives were behind the special prosecutor’s death. His allegations, she said, were based on false information given to him by the former head of the intelligence services.","Cristina Kirchner replaced the letter R with L in a tweet mocking the accent .

"Any Seahawks fans worth his blue and green was hit hard by Seattle's spectacular Super Bowl loss on Sunday, but one superfan hit back by smashing his big screen TV. Video has emerged of a man so overtaken by rage following coach Pete Carroll's already infamous call in the final moments of the game that he bum-rushes his own television set.

"New fossils of an ancient primate found in the Amazon may be the first monkey to have traveled from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to South America. The fossils suggest that monkeys first arrived in South America nearly 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the first primates traveled to South America, which was once an isolated island before it joined to North America three million years ago, from Africa on natural rafts that drifted across the Atlantic ocean. A reconstruction of  the 38 million year old Perupithecus ucayalensis (left) found in South America is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - Talahpithecus parvus, that lived in Libya 39 milion years ago . The two groups of primates then evolved separately to create distinct families of primates. However, evidence for when this epic journey occurred has been patchy and the oldest fossil of a monkey found in the New World was 26 million years old found in Bolivia. A new fossil has the potential to force anthropologists to rewrite the evolutionary history of how our early ancestors first began walking upright on two legs. For decades scientists have believed that our upright posture evolved in a common ancestor shared with the great apes including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans around 15 million years ago. This led to the broad torsos and mobile forelimbs that appear all great apes - known as the orthograde body plan. But a 12.3 million year old fossilised hipbone belonging a prehistoric ape named Sivapithecus indicus discovered in modern Pakistan, is challenging this belief. This species was thought to be an ancient relative of the orangutan that emerged after the great apes split from the gibbons and lived around 12 million to 10 million years ago . Fossilised skull fragments have suggested it had the facial features similar to modern orangutans and scientists assumed it would also have an ape-like body plan. However, the new hipbone has revealed that these creatures had a narrow torso that more resembles those of monkeys. This suggests that Sivapithecus may have had both ape-like and monkey-like features, and has left researchers baffled about how it fits into the evolutionary tree. But now fossilised teeth, found on a riverbank in a remote part of the Amazon in Peru, that have been dated at 36 million years old suggest the crossing from Africa may have occurred far earlier. The teeth bear little resemblance to those from other species found in South America, but instead are more similar to teeth from African primates at the time. This suggests that the fossils may belong to one of the first primates to make the crossing from Africa. Researchers from the Museum of Natural Sciences in La Plata, Argentina, and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles have named the new species of monkey Perupithecus ucayaliensis. Its name is derived from the country where the fossil was found - Peru - and the Greek name for monkey, pithecus. Ucaylainesis is named the area of Peru where it was sound - Santa Roasa in the Ucayali Department. Mariano Bond, the palaeontologist who led the study of the fossils at the Museum of Natural Sciences in La Plata, said the animal would have been a small monkey with a body only around 10 inches long. Writing in the journal Nature, Mr Bond said: 'Perupithecus ucayaliensis was a small primate, comparable in size to the tamarins Callimico and some species of Saguinus. 'The new specimens are important for understanding the origin and early evolution of modern platyrrhine (New World) primates because they bear little resemblance to any extinct . or living South American primate, but they do bear striking resemblances to Eocene African anthropoids, and our phylogenetic analysis suggests a relationship with African taxa.' The scientists examined fossilised teeth (above) that were found found in the Peruvian Amazon in Santa Rosa . The new species teeth more closely resemble those of monkeys in Africa such as this Vervet Monkey . This artists impression of Perupithecus ucayaliensis shows that the small primate may have looked like . The scientists believe that Perupithecus may be most closely related to an extinct primate called Talahpithecus, which lived around 38-39 million years ago in what is now Libya. They found one complete and two incomplete upper molars that were dug up from a river bed during a dry period in Santa Rosa, eastern Peru. New World monkeys are typically distinguished from their counterparts in Africa and Asia by their flat noses and relatively small size. There are around 150 species of New World monkeys - also called Platyrrhini which means ‘flat nose’ - living in Central and South America. These include capuchins, marmosets and tamarins. It is thought that they originally arrived in South America after crossing the Atlantic Ocean on natural rafts made of vegetation along with other mammals like rodents. Until the new fossils were found, rodents were thought to have arrived on the continent long before primates but the new discovery means they arrived at roughly the same time. Writing in  Nature, Mr Bond and his colleagues said: 'Numerous studies have focused on the possibility of primates crossing the Atlantic to reach South America from Africa. 'A similar means of arrival in South America has often been proposed for the hystricognath rodents, the dispersal of amphisbaenian and gekkotan lizards. 'The discovery of these new primates brings the first appearance datum of caviomorph rodents and primates in South America back into close correspondence, but raises new questions about the timing and means of arrival of these two mammalian groups.' Dr Kenneth Campbell, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, added it had taken years of searching before the new fossils had been found. He said: 'Fossils are scarce and limited to only a few exposed banks along rivers during the dry seasons. 'For much of the year high water levels make palaeontological exploration impossible.' New world monkeys like this golden lion tamarin evolved to have flatter noses than their African cousins .","Palaeontologists have named the new species Perupithecus ucayaliensis .
Its fossilised teeth were discovered on a river bank in Santa Rosa, Peru .
The teeth are unlike any New World monkey but resemble those in Africa .
The 36 million years old fossil suggests monkeys travelled from Africa to South America around 10 million years earlier than previously thought ."
"When Ebony, 33, first met  her  husband of three years, Peter Florian, 65, it was love at first sight. The fact that she was 17 and the mechanic was 48, made no difference to her - she just felt a strong attraction despite the fact they were both already spoken for. In fact, the age gap between the Norfolk pair was the least complicated thing about their new connection as Peter was in a relationship with Judy, the mother of Ebony's boyfriend. Scroll down for video . Peter, known as Flit, 65, and Ebony 33, pictured as they appear on Age Gap Love. Their relationship first began as a secret affair as he was married to Ebony's boyfriend's mother . The couple eloped to Gretna Green in 2012, pictured here on their wedding day . Ebony said: 'Age was never an issue. I just saw a man I really liked and possibly fancied. That's all I thought about, although I did feel guilty,' she revealed on Channel 5 show Age Gap Love, which airs tonight. The couple embarked on a secret affair. She said: 'The first time [we had sex] was amazing, it rocked my world. I have never been loved like that before.' But Peter (also known as Flit) was worried about the age difference and ended their affair, going on to marry Judy - leaving Ebony heartbroken. He said: 'I thought she was a bit of all right but that she was too young to handle. I thought, ""I mustn't do this, she's too young"".' Ebony admitted she felt 'used' and went off the rails, drinking and taking drugs. The pair say they are happy despite the 32 year age gap. Even Flit's ex-wife says they make a lovely couple . Flit was once step-grandfather to Ebony's two children as his ex-wife is their grandmother . She also had two children with her boyfriend, Judy's son - who she then split up with. But she lost custody of them when she was imprisoned in 2010 for committing a violent act. During her time behind bars, Peter split up with Judy and began visiting Ebony. 'People used to think I was visiting my daughter,' he said. The couple fell in love again and as soon as Ebony was released in 2012, they ran off to Gretna Green to tie the knot. Ebony said it was the happiest day of her life. 'It was everything I had hoped for, the man I had loved for so long was now my husband,' she said. The couple were able to provide a stable home for Ebony's two children so custody was restored. Her eldest son, Dominic, 15, said he doesn't mind that his new step-father (who was once his step-grandfather) is so much older than his mother. He said: 'I would rather my mum is with an older man than a younger man who doesn't treat her right.' Remarkably, Judy isn't bitter about the fact her ex-husband ran off with a younger woman - who was also the mother of her grandchildren. She said: 'Once I got my head around it, I'm fine. Flit and Ebony are a lovely couple, they are made for each other.' There are 40 years between Jo, 30, and John, 70, pictured on the Channel 5 show . Ebony and Peter aren't the only ones who have found happiness despite a huge age gap. The Channel 5 show also features married couple Jo, 30, and John, 70, from south London. Thanks to their 40-year age gap, Jo said they do provoke comments from people when they are seen out together. She said: 'People say it's nice to go out with your dad. When I say it's my husband they are shocked. If I give him a kiss, people will do a double take. 'Once we went to the cinema and asked for two tickets - we were given one for an OAP and one for a child!' The couple met when Jo was 21 and John was 61. Jo recalled: 'My initial reaction was ""he's old"" but when we started talking it became irrelevant. I could tell this guy wanted to look after me and give me advice if I asked for it.' Jo said they don't care what people think about their age gap relationship. She said John has been 'her rock' after a difficult period in her life . At the time, Jo was a single mother-of-two who was struggling with her confidence after being bullied as a child. She credits John, a natural health expert, for helping her get her life back on track. She said: 'I had a really tough time for five or six years. I almost completely lost it and the reason I haven't is John. He's been a complete rock. He's been amazing.' She added: 'It has made a difference him being older. I think if I met someone younger or closer to my age they wouldn't have been able to comprehend what I had been through. John understands how life events can change you so age makes a huge difference there.' John's son, Matthew, from a previous relationship is actually closer in age to Jo at 21. But he said he doesn't mind having a step-mother who is nine years older than him. He said: 'I don't think the age gap matters as Jo is mentally older and my dad is young at heart.'

"The scars on this young woman's legs and arms bare the pain of her five year battle with a self-harm addiction that almost claimed her life. But despite losing most of her teenage years to her mental illness, Lauren Darlington says her scars are now a source of strength as she strives to become a champion body builder. Just 18 months ago, the 21-year-old from Wollongong, south of Sydney, was lying in a hospital bed after overdosing so badly her heart stopped. Lauren Darlington, 21, battled a self-harm addiction for five years. She says the scars still visible on her arms are now a source of strength as she strives to become a champion body builder . It was there she finally found the determination to turn her life around after years of battling her demons. 'I first started when I was 15 - small cuts here and there - and I realised it helped (with the pain),' Ms Darlington told Daily Mail Australia. 'It began to take over my life. I'd sit in class and all I could think about was self-harming. 'It got to the point where I'd use anything. I used to cut with scissors, I'd break light globes - nothing was out of reach. 'There was one school excursion where my arm was already bandaged – I had the urge to hurt myself so I ripped open old wounds.' Ms Darlington was hospitalised several times due to self-harm, but every time she was released she would start again. 'I never really dealt with the problem. I suppressed it and put band-aids on, so to speak,' she said. 'I guess at the time it was the only release that showed the pain I was feeling on the inside and outside.' Ms Darlington was raised by her father from a young age and only saw her mother on the rare occasion, which she says contributed to her addiction. 'Whenever I saw her she would tell me again and again that I would have depression because she had it,' she said. 'I didn't feel worthy and it just kept getting worse.' Just 18 months ago, the 21-year-old from Wollongong, south of Sydney, was lying in a hospital bed after overdosing so badly her heart stopped . Lauren has documented her body building progress (pictured here at the start) after deciding to compete when she was released from hospital following her overdose . She ended up dropping out of school because she was spending so much time in hospital and admits her relationships suffered as a result. Her severe overdose 18 months ago was the turning point. 'It was a few days after my 20th birthday and I lived by myself. I was sitting there crying and nothing would help (with the pain). I just thought I'd had enough,' she said. Ms Darlington overdosed with sleeping tablets and said she could feel she was losing control right away. 'My best friend was the only one with a key to my place and I panicked because I didn't want her to be the one to find me. I texted her saying 'help' and ran to the bathroom to make myself sick,' she said. 'I woke up three days later to find my dad crying and begging me to stop. 'I wanted to kill myself. I know it was my intention, but deep down I knew I couldn't do it because I would never have sent the text to my friend. 'I initially stopped for everyone else, but now it's because I don't want to (self-harm).' The 21-year-old immediately turned to body building and first started competing just six months after she was released from hospital . Lauren says she overwhelmed when she looks at how far she has come in just 18 months considering she believed she was broken beyond repair . Ms Darlington immediately turned to body building and first started competing just six months after she was released from hospital. She entered three shows last year and is a few weeks out from her next competition. 'There are photos of me on stage and my scars are showing. It's empowering that my body is now a sign of strength,' Ms Darlington said. 'It blows me away. I'm finally at a point where I can look back and say I'm proud of where I am now. I'm a completely different person. I truly thought I was broken beyond repair.' 'I'm so passionate now about doing everything I can because I essentially wasted five years of my life.' The 21-year-old now uses her Instagram profile to show her transformation in the hope of inspiring others who may be in a similar situation . Lauren said there were photos of her on stage competing with her scars showing, but it was empowering that her body is now a sign of strength . Ms Darlington said people now question if she has just replaced one addiction with another in terms of her body building. 'But I assure you I've never seen competing and body building as anything but a positive change in my life,' she said. 'I am now apart of a strong, empowering team of girls which has given me a sense of belonging which I haven't had before.' She said her coach, Asher Prior, has given her the support, encouragement and guidance she has needed. Ms Darlington uses her Instagram profile to show her transformation in the hope of inspiring others who may be in a similar situation.

"An online fund to help frail pensioner Alan Barnes after he was mugged has been halted  with donations standing at more than £329,000. Beautician Katie Cutler said there will be a presentation in due course when a cheque will be handed over to the 4ft 6in visually-impaired 67-year-old. Ms Cutler, 21, wrote on the Alan Barnes Fund page: 'Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family, they have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund. 'He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so i'll keep you all updated. X' Scroll down for video . Katie Cutler set up a fund to help disabled pensioner Alan Barnes after he was attacked in the street . The fund exceeded all expectation and has now been stopped at the request of Mr Barnes and his family after it topped more than £329,526 . In all, 24,748 well-wishers donated a total of £329,526, at an average of just over £13 each. Frail Mr Barnes was pushing his bin  outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear earlier this month when he  was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed. A mugger then demanded money and searched Mr Barnes' pockets before realising his stricken victim was not carrying cash and fleeing. Mr Barnes stumbled to the house next door where his neighbour called his sister Carol, who rushed over and took her brother to hospital, where X-rays revealed the fractured collar bone. Mr Barnes, a committed Christian, said at the time: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again. Mr Barnes's broken collar-bone will take nearly two months to heal, in which time he will need special care. He is now too frightened to return to his home, and Ms Hill is helping her brother look for new accommodation. After hearing of the attack, local beautician Ms Cutler set up the fund, expecting to make £50,000 to help with Mr Barnes recovery and his potential home move. But, after the story was widely reported, money flooded in and has now reached such an amount that the family have asked for it to be stopped. Mr Barnes, pictured (left) with Ms Cutler and (right) with niece Georgi Galloway and great niece Florence Purvis . Commenting on how the money would be spent, Mr Barnes said: 'A solicitor  has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.' He later added: 'I don't know what I will do with the money yet, I think that is a question for a long time down the road. I will have to have a big think about it as it's such a huge figure. 'I can tell you one thing, it won't be wasted, I am always very careful with money and won't be spending it on flashy holidays, I just want to feel safe again.' People have called Ms Cutler a hero and there is an online campaign for her to receive an OBE. A fund was set up by well-wishers to thank her for the consideration she showed for Mr Barnes, but she will give the £1,500 away to charity. She said: 'I have had a lifetime of compliments within a few days and it really warms your heart, it is lovely. I do find it hard, people calling me a hero - I definitely don't think that is right.' The thug who attacked Mr Barnes is now one of Tyneside's most wanted criminals, a leading officer has said. Chief Inspector Mick Lillico has urged the would-be robber to hand himself in and warned that every Northumbria Police officer is now looking for the crook, as police remain determined to see him caught.","Pensioner was pushing his bin out when he was attacked by a mugger .

"An anti-drink driving group  put out a glowing report of Uber after receiving a sizable donation from the taxi app, it has been revealed. Last week Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and Uber jointly published the study which suggested the ride-sharing service had helped reduce the number of drink-driving accidents. The press release stated that Uber can be 'a powerful tool in the fight to reduce the number of drunk-driving crashes' and  found ridesharing is having a 'significant impact' on drink driving across America’s cities. Mothers Against Drunk Driving put out a glowing report of Uber- after receiving a sizable donation from the taxi app . Meanwhile, it has since been revealed that Uber started donating money to MADD last summer. Last year Uber and MADD announced a partnership in which the app would donate $1 for every ride taken and $10 for every new customer who used the service in a 24-hour period around the 4th of July, as long as customers used a promo code, UberMADD. Last weekend, Uber ran a similar deal on Super Bowl Sunday, where the service donated $1 for every passenger between 3pm and midnight who used the code ThinkandRide. Amy George, senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD, said they were not backing away from the report . It is not yet clear how much money has been passed to MADD. After the report came under scrutiny, Amy George, senior vice president of marketing and communications at MADD, said that the figures in the report - that appeared to show a drop in drink driving in cities where Uber was used - was purely correlational. 'Nobody is saying that there is a causation relationship here,' she told Pro Publica. Ms George denied distancing herself from the study and said the anti drink-driving organisation would continue to back its findings. 'MADD strongly stands behind the report and that Uber is a powerful tool to reduce drunk driving,' she told Valley Wag. 'We have consistently said the data is correlative, and those correlations are valid at showing that Uber is having an impact.' In the report, Uber claimed that 'when empowered with more transportation options, people are making safer, better choices that are helping save lives.' Among the findings, the research found that drunk-driving crashes in California fell by 6.5 per cent among drivers under 30 in the markets where Uber operates - an estimated total of 1,800 crashes prevented since July 2012. With California the app's home state, the company claims that the drop demonstrates for a possible similar reduction in other Uber markets. It appears that the Uber taxi app service had started donating money to MADD last summer .","Uber and Mothers Against Drunk Driving published a joint report last week .

"A fish and chip shop in South Australia has been threatened with a $20,000 fine, simply for having a sign in its window letting people know they are open for business. Feathers Fish And Chip Shop in Hazelwood Park - located about 15 minutes from Adelaide's city centre - was issued with a number of warnings for the sign which has been in the front window for 13 years. Owner Peter Alevizos said he is 'flabbergasted' at why his small business has been targeted over the light-up 'open' sign, when 'all we’re doing is advertising that we’re open.' Feathers Fish and Chip Shop in Hazelwood Park, South Australia, could face a $22,000 fine over a sign in their window . The 'open' sign lights are not allowed and if turned on again could cost owner Peter Alevizos a lot of money . 'There’s a lot of things around that can distract people; there are roadwork signs that flash brighter than that', he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Alevizos first received notice of the council's issue with the sign last October, when a letter arrived in the mail threatening him with a hefty fine should he continue to turn the sign on. Owner Peter Alevizos said he doesn't see how he's doing anything wrong by letting people know he's open . 'After that I spoke to the council and I said to them look I received your letter I’m flabbergasted to why we've been issued this,' he said. ‘You can’t tell me that in 13 years, 365 days in a year (and) I've never received a letter about it until now,' he continued. The second blow came when he shop owner was in hospital with family the day his mother passed away. A staff member was running the shop that day and accidentally  lit the sign up. A council member saw it on, snapped a photo of it and soon after Mr Alevizos was issued with a $750 fine. However that fine was later waived, but the issue continued to 'snowball from there'. Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon had also expressed his outrage at the 'bureaucratic madness'. He was due to hold a press conference on the issue, but the people he had hired to provide signs for the event got spooked and pulled out amid fears they would also be targeted by the council. 'This is a case of red tape madness,' Senator Xenophon told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is mindless, petty red tape that is actually killing jobs and making it very hard for small businesses to survive. Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon described the ordeal as a targeted attack on small businesses . 'Why do councils do this? ‘Because they can,' he added. Mr Xenophon urged others to come forward with similar cases, saying that such instances are 'taking our country's economy backwards.' 'Local governments deserve to be a laughing stock for trying to enforce these sorts of regulations,' he said, before adding that the whole situation is 'absurd'. Potentially facing a $20,000 fine should the Open sign be switched on again, Mr Alevizos described the ordeal as 'revenue raising' and said he had been unfairly targeted as a small business owner. Mr Alevizos described the ordeal as 'revenue raising' 'All I'm doing is letting people know I'm open', he said. 'It’s not an eyesore, you really have to look for it to see it. 'I just think that it’s not fair. 'Surely in this day and age we have better things to worry about than little signs,' Mr Alevizos added.","Feathers Fish And Chip Shop has been threatened with a $20,000 fine .

"The mental health of acne sufferers must be taken 'far more seriously', an expert has today warned, as it emerged a fifth of people with the condition have contemplated suicide. New research has revealed the impact the common skin condition has on self-esteem and confidence. More than half of sufferers (56 per cent) have been the victim of verbal abuse from friends and family, while one in five blame the condition for the breakdown of a relationship. The survey, commissioned by the British Skin Foundation, also reveals 10 per cent of people living with the condition believe they were unfairly dismissed from their job because of their acne. A new survey by the British Skin Foundation found one in five of the 2,299 respondents had contemplated suicide as a result of their condition. More than half said they had been the victim of verbal abuse at the hands of their friends and family (file picture posed by model) The condition is caused by a combination of comedones - blackheads and whiteheads - and pus-filled spots, or pustules. Those afflicted  usually notice the first signs during puberty. The severity can range from a few spots on the face, neck, back and chest to a more serious problem that can cause scarring and impact on a person's self confidence. The BSF survey revealed 20 per cent of the 2,299 respondents have have thought about or attempted suicide because of their condition. That statistics, experts say, highlights the extreme consequences the condition can have on a sufferer's mental health, confidence and self-worth. Consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokeswoman, Dr Anjali Mahto said: 'I'm not surprised to hear that acne can have such a profound effect on every aspect of someone's life. 'What is really sad about it, is that acne, for the majority of people is a treatable skin disorder, and having suffered with it myself, I really do feel that no one should just have to live with it. 'A good dermatologist can offer a large number of potential treatments that can be tailored to the individual. 'Unfortunately, the skin is such a visible organ, that it's only natural that self-esteem is so closely tied to it. 'People do underestimate acne and the impact it has on those suffering with it. 'I think these results highlight that acne should be taken far more seriously. Acne is a common skin condition caused by a combination of comedones - blackheads and whiteheads (centre) - and pus-filled spots, or pustules (right) 'It is important to seek help and advice early before scarring (be that mental or physical) develops and request referral to a dermatologist if treatments aren't working. 'We also need to investigate the psychological burden of this further.' The research, the biggest survey conducted by BSF, aimed to get an insight into what acne sufferers go through during their everyday lives. A spokesman for the charity said the condition is often 'overlooked' adding the foundation is 'here to help change that'. While most people will 'grow out' of acne by the time they reach their 20s, it is normal for a person to suffer the condition for longer. The BSF spokesman added: 'Aside from the visual symptoms of acne, it's important not to trivialise the emotional impact of the disease. 'Being a very visual condition, acne can have a huge impact on a person's self-esteem and confidence, bringing with it potential long-term effects on the sufferers' life. 'This can be anything from relationships, work or state of mind.' One anonymous responder told BSF: 'I suffer from acne, it's an awful thing to go through. 'I think we need more awareness. It's not just a spot on someone's body, it affects everything about them - well for me it does. 'I'm trying to get control of mine now, it's still all over my face, scars, spots but day by day, I'm getting there.' And another participant, added: 'I am over 60 and I do not think that it will ever go away. I have had it since I was about 10.'","20% of acne sufferers who took part in new survey had considered suicide .

"Rapist: Inmate Jacob Harvey, 20, allegedly raped his prison teacher in an empty classroom last year . An Arizona prison teacher was  stabbed in the back of the head with a pen, choked, and thrashed against the floor as an inmate tore off all off her clothing and allegedly brutally raped her in an empty classroom where no one could hear her cries for help. Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard blamed the alleged rape on the teacher saying 'should have known better' and is asking that a lawsuit be dropped against the Arizona Department of Corrections. Jacob Harvey, 20, allegedly violently raped the victim in a prison classroom after taking an exam on January 20, 2014. Harvey, a convicted rapist, remains in prison and is awaiting trial on rape, assault and related charges in the attack on the teacher. He has pleaded not guilty. 'Plaintiff is an ADOC (Arizona Department of Corrections) employee who routinely worked at the prison complex,' Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a motion to dismiss the rape case on Monday. 'By being placed in a classroom at the complex, the officers were not placing Plaintiff in any type of situation that she would not normally face. The risk of harm, including assault, always existed at a prison like Eyman, he continued in his pitch to U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton. The victim works at the ADOC as a teacher and she was scheduled to give an exam to seven convicted sex offenders on January 20 of last year. Her classes usually take place in a heavily monitored visitation room but because of a special event in the prison she was sent with her class to an unmonitored classroom and given a police radio to use if she found herself in trouble, reports AZ Central. Controversial opinion: Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard (left) is blaming the victim for her alleged rape by Jacob Harvey (right) while teaching in a prison classroom . The lawsuit claims that not once during the entire 90 minute exam did anyone check in with her over the radio if she was doing OK. When the exam was finished, six of the men walked back unescorted to their dorm except for Jacob Harvey, 20. Harvey is a convicted sex offender who less than a year before the alleged rape was sentenced to 30 years for breaking into a woman's house during the day and brutally raping her in front of her toddler. The teacher claims she yelled for help but no one was able to hear her. When she attempted to use her radio it was tuned into a channel that the guards don't even use, she claims. After she'd been allegedly battered and violated Harvey eventually allowed the teacher to call for help with a phone. Blaming the victim: An Arizona Attorney General blamed the rape on the teacher saying 'should have known better' and is asking that a lawsuit be dropped against the Arizona Department of Corrections . The civilian teacher is suing the ADOC for putting her in a room with convicted sex offenders without any security or form of reaching out for help. 'As a result of the brutal rape and assault, (the woman) suffered physical injuries, great fear for her life and well-being and severe and traumatic emotional distress with which she continues to struggle to this day,' her attorney, the victim's attorney, wrote. Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard claims that because the victim was employed at the prison she should have understood the risks and cannot prove that she was put in danger by the prison establishment. The Attorney General said the woman, alone in the room with the convicted sex offender,  'could have done something about it.' 'Plaintiff wants to create an artificial impression that the ADOC officers knew she was in danger but she did not know,' he wrote. 'It makes no sense. Of course, if Plaintiff did appreciate the danger of her situation, as an employee, she could have done something about it.' Dangerous situation: Convicted rapist Jacob Harvey, (whose hands are pictured) after an alleged rape against his prison teacher, has pleaded not guilty . 'How these defendants were chosen is a mystery at this point,' Weisbard told Bolton at Monday's hearing. He said in a written briefing that the teacher wasn't placed in an abnormal situation. Bolton appeared to disagree, although she said she'd issue a ruling later. 'This was a dangerous situation — we know that,' she said. The teacher's lawyer says there's nothing normal about his client being placed unguarded in a classroom with convicted sex offenders. Attorney Scott Zwillinger told Bolton that Warden Ron Credio, a deputy warden and other prison officials didn't protect the teacher, who was neither armed nor trained to defend herself. 'They failed in their duties, and they created the situation that led the harm to my client,' he said. The teacher also is suing prison health care provider Corizon Health Inc. The company's lawyers also are asking that the case be dismissed and deny wrongdoing. The teacher sat with her lawyer in court while her parents watched from the visitor's gallery. A claim she made against the state before filing the lawsuit sought $4 million. In a September interview with the AP, she said she primarily blamed Corrections Director Charles Ryan for putting her in danger. She said rampant understaffing meant no one checked on her while she was in the classroom. 'Safety's got to come before everything, and there's just this attitude that we have the number of staff we need because we say we do,' she said. Ryan has not responded to requests for comment, but a prison spokesman has called the rape 'a cowardly and despicable crime, for which the inmate is rightfully facing prosecution' and said safety is always paramount.","The Arizona teacher is suing the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC)

"A celebrity restaurateur is being sued by disgruntled ex-staff following a row over allegedly unpaid wages when one of his exclusive venues  suddenly closed. Riad Erraji - who was once married to Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton but is currently dating Hollyoaks actress Stephanie Waring - was taken to court after his restaurant 'House' shut in October. Staff accused him of leaving chefs, bar staff and waitresses without a month's worth of pay when the venue in Worcester closed 'without warning'. Riad Erraji was seen partying with celebrity girlfriend Stephanie Waring - who plays Cindy Cunningham in Hollyoaks - this weekend, but staff at a restaurant of his which closed say they are owed wages . The 38-year-old businessman - who also owns the Amanzi restaurant and Empire nightclub in Liverpool - opened his latest restaurant in May 2013 but it shut late last year costing workers between £9,000 and £11,000 in lost wages. Court action is now being brought against Mr Erraji and his companies Hamiltons Worcester Ltd and the Echelon Group to recoup the cash. Worcester County Court heard bailiffs visited the empty restaurant on January 16 to try and recover some of the money - but found just mouldy coffee cups and kitchen furniture. Enforcement officers have revealed they were dealing with a number of former staff who are said to be owed up to £1,335 each. The premises has now been reclaimed by Crown Estates, which owns the CrownGate Shopping Centre, where the restaurant was situated. Mr Erraji was unavailable for comment today. The actress tweeted photos of her, Mr Erraji and their friends  as they celebrated his birthday on Saturday . Mr Erraji is famous for being the ex-husband of Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton. The pair split in 2013 . House, which was opened  in 2013, was described by Mr Erraji as a 'premier Worcester venue for premier people'. His Liverpool venues are popular with celebrities including model Danielle Lloyd, X-factor singer Marcus Collins and footballer Brad Jones's fiancee Dani Lawrence. Mr Erraji is also close friends with singer Peter Andre as well as Coronation Street's Kym Marsh. Ramsay Floyd, centre manager for the shopping centre, said: 'We confirm that following the closure of the unit in October last year, House failed to reopen. The lease for the unit has now been brought to an end and the unit is vacant. 'This has allowed us to clean up the areas visible for the mall but the unit has not been let to a new tenant. 'However, we have had expressions of interest for some of the items left in the unit from local businesses.'

"The man who allegedly stabbed three soldiers outside a Jewish centre has been pictured for the first time - as his victims are honoured for their 'courage and devotion' to France. Moussa Coulibally's face was captured on Turkish CCTV at Istanbul airport, as the would-be jihadist was deported from the country last week, after border agency staff became suspicious. A source in the security service claims Coulibaly - who is no relation to Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris and gunned down a policewoman in January - was trying to reach Syria to join Isis. Moussa Coulibaly, pictured at Istanbul airport last week, is suspected of stabbing three soldiers in Nice, France, on Tuesday afternoon . The soldiers - Sergeant Jamel, Private First Class Herve and Private First Class Gabin - were guarding a Jewish centre in the city in the south of France . On Tuesday, he is alleged to have attacked three soliders, who were standing guard outside the centre, home to an Israeli association and a Jewish radio station, in Nice at about 2pm. Today, those soliders - some of the 10,000 deployed to defend sensitive locations around France in the wake of the massacres at the Charlie Hebdo offices and supermarket last month - were honoured  by the French government. Sergeant Jamel, private first class Herve and private first class Gabin were awarded the Honour Medal for Courage and Devotion during a ceremony, a day after they were attacked near the Galeries Lafayette department store. Meanwhile, Coulibaly is still being detained after the attack, near the Galeries Lafayette department store. A second man has also been arrested by police. Today, the three men were given medals to recognise their role. Pictured: Private First Class Gabin, who was hurt in the cheek, receives his medal .

The soldiers were not seriously injured in the attack - although Sergeant Jamel, pictured centre with Adolphe Colrat (left), prefect of Alpes-Maritimes, next to Eric Ciotti (right), president of Alpes-Maritimes County Council, was hurt in the forearm . Coulibaly, who is from the poor western suburbs of Paris, had been questioned by French police when he first returned from Turkey. He also came to the attention of authorities just before the attack, when he was fined for travelling on the tram without a ticket. He quickly paid the fine - then pulled an eight-inch blade out of a bag and set upon one of the soldiers, injuring him in the chin, police said. Coulibaly then swiped at two other soldiers - injuring one in the cheek, and the other in the forearm - before being apprehended by riot police stationed near the building. Today, soldiers were still out patrolling the calm streets of Nice - ready for any further attacks .

"Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Steve Ells said he was disgusted by a McDonald's Arkansas chicken farm when he visited with executives about a decade ago . Chipotle Mexican Grill Founder and CEO Steve Ells revealed that he was disgusted by a McDonald's chicken farm in Arkansas when he visited a decade ago. Ells saw the farm with McDonald's executives during the time he was partnered with the fast food chain between 1998 and 2006. He returned from the farm and told his father Bob Ells that it was 'absolutely the most disgusting thing he'd ever seen in his life', according to Bloomberg News. The family did not reveal what was so shocking about the farm, but Ells told Bloomberg News that he hadn't visited a McDonald's farm until that point. The fast food chain had fully divested from Chipotle, which is known for using locally raised vegetables, hormone-free meat and eco-friendly practices, by 2006. But the chains had different ideologies regarding their food products long before the divestment. When Chipotle was brought to Portland in 2004, the only common product that could be delivered to both fast food chains was a five-gallon bag of Coca-Cola syrup, Jeff Steiner, senior vice president for Golden State Foods told Bloomberg News. This is not the first time McDonald's has been criticized for the practices of its suppliers, according to New York Daily News. In 2011, the Humane Society of the United States filed a complaint against Smithfield Foods, the fast food chain's pork supplier, claiming it treated pigs poorly. Pictured above, McDonald's released a video in December focusing on improving public perceptions of their fast food products. They took viewers to a factory floor (pictured) which focused on the Chicken McNugget . The fast food restaurant cut ties with Sparboe Farms, its egg supplier, over animal cruelty allegations during the same year. McDonald's had to pull a Twitter campaign sharing stories of its commitment to fresh meat and produce in 2012 when people began tweeting about the company's treatment of animals. In an attempt to disprove rumors about ingredients - including one that chicken nuggets are made with 'pink slime' - McDonald's launched a behind-the-scenes transparency campaign, Our Food. Your Questions last year. Chipotle is known for using locally raised vegetables, hormone-free meat and eco-friendly practices in its fast food chains . McDonad's CEO Don Thompson conceded that his fast food chain has failed to keep up with changing tastes, with people increasingly moving toward foods they feel are fresh or wholesome. The meat industry's use of ammonium-treated beef trimmings in school lunches and fast food restaurants was little known until 2009, when The New York Times reported on the product and publicized use of the term 'pink slime'. The product, trimmed from leftover fatty parts and treated to kill bacteria, was fast becoming a staple of grocery stores, fast food joints such as McDonald's and Burger King and the US' school lunch program, which purchased 7 million pounds worth in 2012. The USDA has given it a clean bill of health, considering it almost safer than regular ground beef. However, the negative publicity has remained . This causes losses for McDonald's but growth for places like Chipotle. Thompson has announced that he will step down from his position in March and Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook will take over his position. Previously, Easterbrook served as president of McDonald's Europe and led efforts related to marketing and menus. Among the challenges British-born Easterbrook will inherit as the chief executive are: the image that fast-food is junk food; the growing number of convenience stores selling cheap, ready-to-eat food and the surging popularity of companies selling higher-quality food, such as Chipotle. Though Ells does not agree with all of McDonald's practices, Chipotle executives told Bloomberg News that they credit the company as a 'rich uncle' that made way for the Mexican fast food chain's success.

"Marion 'Suge' Knight had a long-standing 'beef' with the man he is charged with attempting to murder by mowing him down in his truck, Daily Mail Online can reveal. Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was knocked unconscious and has a 'mangled' foot after the collision last week, an incident which saw music producer Terry Carter, 55, killed. And the actor and filmmaker – who has been employed as a consultant on hit movies such as Training Day - fears his injuries could bring his career to an abrupt end. Sloan is furious that Knight allegedly 'went ballistic' after a row erupted on the set of the film 'Straight Outta Compton, a production about the rise of the rap group N.W.A. Scroll down for video . Victim: Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan suffered a 'mangled foot' when he was hit by Marion 'Suge' Knight's truck in an incident which also killed Terry Carter, another acquaintance of the hip-hop mogul . Death Row Records founder Suge Knight (pictured on Tuesday) was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill another man in a hit-and-run . Sloan had worked hard to convince rap legend and music producer Dr Dre to come to Compton to be involved in the film. But a source close to Sloan said Knight ruined the 'beautiful' moment by sparking a heated row. 'There was a long-standing beef. This guy [Sloan] grew up with Suge Knight, he grew up with Dr Dre, he grew up with all these guys, most of whom left and went to live in the gated communities. 'He's always been a big supporter of Compton, he's a shining example of a kid who was a gang guy himself but who has become an accomplished artist. 'So when they were doing this filming, Dr Dre had always been too afraid to go back, but Bone brought him back and he was signing autographs for the kids. 'It was a beautiful moment and this idiot showed up in his truck and went ballistic.' The source says Sloan is now out of the hospital and is staying at a 'secure' location through fear of reprisals. 'Cle is somewhere safe with security around him because there is some concern about retaliation,' the source said. 'He comes from that world, he knows this stuff can go down.' The source says Sloan has 'got a ways to go' before he makes a full recovery and was shocked by what happened. 'His foot was pretty mangled in the incident, it looks pretty grotesque to look at,' the source said . 'He was unconscious too, he's not up running around, he's gonna be on his back for a long time. 'He's got a ways to go, he will have to go through some rehab to get back on his feet. 'He's still in shock at what happened. Cle is not a fly by night guy, he's a serious player. The owner of Tam's Burgers in Compton, California says CCTV wasn't working the night Knight allegedly killed a man. Above, an LAPD photographer checks the scene of the incident . Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the incident. He was struck at least twice by Marion 'Suge' Knight's truck, according to police . 'This guy could be the next Spike Lee, he's talked about as a sort of Renaissance man from the hood. 'He was trying to elevate the image of Compton so . he's sad that this went down.' Knight is accused of intentionally running down two men, including a friend, outside a Compton burger bar on Thursday after an argument on the movie set. The collision killed his friend Carter, a founder and owner of Heavyweight Records who was viewed as a local father figure and tried to help mentor young men in the community, said Doug Young, a friend and hip-hop music promoter. However, Knight's attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted. On Monday, prosecutors charged Knight with killing Carter and attempting to kill Sloan. Knight also faces two charges of hit-and-run. Straight outta Compton: NWA, made up from left of MC Ren, DJ Yella, Eazy-E and Dr Dre . In addition, Knight's $2 million bail was revoked after a court commissioner agreed with authorities that he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses. The ruling came after homicide detectives told the bail commissioner that Knight could face a lengthy prison sentence because of a violent criminal past, said Los Angeles County sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida. Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case when the men were hit. Authorities said Knight visited the set for 'Straight Outta Compton' and argued with Sloan, who was working at the location on Thursday. Sheriff's deputies providing security asked Knight to leave. A short time afterward, the argument resumed in a parking lot a few miles away where Knight and Sloan exchanged punches through a window of the pickup before the two men were run down, authorities said. Blatt has said Knight was attacked by four people, including Sloan, as he pulled into the parking lot after Carter requested he show up for a meeting. Blatt said Knight hit the gas and fled in fear. After Tuesday's arraignment, Knight was rushed to the hospital with a panic attack minutes after pleading not guilty to murdering his friend and attempting to kill Sloan. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has, 49, a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Involved: Sources said Cle Solan had brought Dr Dre to Compton to sign autographs when Knight turned up and the incident which ended in Terry Carter's death happened. Dre is seen on stage in 2013 with Snoop Dogg . Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life . Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight. In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison. At Tuesday's arraignment, the initial judge assigned opted to recuse himself because he had represented both victims in the case in his years as an attorney. Knight leaves the courtroom after his arraignment - he was taken to hospital shortly after suffering chest pains . Judge Ricardo Ocampo took over the case. The District Attorney's Office said Knight was out on bail in a pending robbery case when the alleged hit-and-run occurred. A new bail hearing was set for February 9 and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 19. Knight's bail hearing was scheduled for next Monday. He is now being held in jail without bail.

After yesterday's court appearance, the 49-year-old, who glanced back into the gallery several times, was taken to hospital after suffering a panic attack, reports TMZ. Law enforcement sources said he was in the lockup area next to the courtroom when he began experiencing chest pains and he was taken to hospital via an ambulance. The former rap music mogul pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and other charges filed. However, his attorney James Blatt has said the collision was an accident that occurred as Knight was trying to flee an altercation in which he was assaulted.","Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan was left with a mangled foot when he was hit by Marion 'Suge' Knight's truck in a fast food restaurant car park .

"While there are plenty other attractions - from over 6,000 live animals to a slew of free concerts - the Florida State Fair has become notorious for its food. Or, perhaps more accurately, for what new delicious thing can be deep fried or wrapped in bacon. And 2015 will be no different. Opening Thursday, the menu for this year's fair is headlined by a Funnel Cake Burger - a beef patty with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickle served between two crunchy glazed funnel cakes, according to The Tampa Tribune. Scroll down for video . Gut-busting: The Funnel Cake burger - a bacon cheeseburger wedged between two funnel cakes - is one of three unusual (and high fattening) chosen to appear at the Florida State Fair, which opens this week . Old favorite: Funnel cakes - a known carnival and event treat - are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil and are usually served with icing sugar . Funnel cakes are essentially drizzles of batter that have been deep fried, and are usually served dusted with icing sugar. Its a fitting new item from the fair, which first became famous for its Krispy Kreme donut burger. According to Spark People, one serving of funnel cakes serves up 44 grams of fat and 88 grams of carbohydrates, giving a total 760 calories. Add to that the contents of the burger - such as the one served up by Five Guys -  and the funnel cake burger gives you an estimated total of 97 grams of fat and a whopping 1420 calories. But the greasiness doesn't stop there. Knocked out: The Deep Fried Oreo Burger was not chosen to appear at this year's fair after a public vote . Two other burgers made the official fair menu after a public vote. The Parmesan Crusted Burger is a twice fried patty coated with a potato chip and parmesan-Romano cheese mixture melted over the top. The third, the Jalapeno Crusted Burger, is a similar creation, but with a corn chip, jalapeno and Mexican cheese mix, plus guacamole, salsa and sour cream. Another strong contender, the Deep-Fried Oreo Burger, was cut during the public vote. The burger consisted of a beef patty that, after being grilled, is slathered in Oreo cookie batter and deep fried. Bacon and other toppings are then added, and it is served on a regular hamburger bun. Also cut the Holiday Express Burger -  featuring Thanksgiving dressing, sweet potato fries and a cranberry orange marmalade sauce - and the Burger of the Gods, which had  brie cheese,  bacon and a maple cinnamon apple compote. Huge: The Amish Doughnut (picutred) is described as being 'the size of a child's head' Besides burgers, there's also the popular pastry menu. Making its debut this year is the cronut, a mix between a croissant and a donut first developed by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York. Alongside the cronut is the Amish Doughnut, which is described as incredibly similar to a glazed doughnut, only topped with icing and sprinkles and is 'the size of a child’s head'. Infamous: The Florida State Fair first became known for its weird culinary creations after introducing the Krispy Kreme burger, which will return again this year . The Krispy Kreme burger, which has become something of a staple at the fair, will again return this year, The Tampa Tribune reported. The Florida State Fair will take place in Tampa from February 5 to 16. Over 500,000 people are expected to attend across the 12 days.

"A teenager has been jailed for life after he stabbed a man to death outside an off licence in a row over a cigarette. Kai Steele, 18, was found guilty of murdering 26-year-old Alex Scott after he stabbed him twice in the chest when an argument erupted in an alleyway in south-east London last year. Mr Scott had been on a night out with friends, where they had spent the early evening drinking and gambling, before making their way to the off licence at about 9.30pm on August 10, 2013. Guilty: Kai Steele (left), 18, has been jailed for life after he stabbed builder Alex Scott (right) twice in the chest . A court was told Mr Scott collapsed on the pavement some 20 seconds after he threw the first punch - when a youth asked him for a cigarette. Steele, who was just 17 at the time of the fatal attack, denied the charges at the Old Bailey but was told by Judge Timothy Pontius he would serve a minimum of 18 years in prison. He said: 'This is yet another example of an utterly needless and unjustified waste of a human life  from a senseless decision by a teenage boy to put a knife in his pocket before leaving home. 'As is so often the case, that knife was not taken out with any intention in the defendant's mind to use it to cause anyone serious injury, still less to kill. 'Violence did break out, he did take out the knife and inflicted fatal wounds with such force they penetrated the aorta of Alex Scott. 'His family lost a brother and son who was much loved for all his faults. I accept Alex Scott was not completely blameless. His attitude was aggressive and he was clearly worse for drink. 'However the evidence does not establish the defendant was provoked, rather he was too ready to see Alex Scott's behaviour as an invitation to fight. 'The use of a knife can never be described as a reasonable defensive response to a punch.' He continued: 'This murder was neither planned nor premeditated but arose, as so often the case in the context of street violence, in a matter of moments. 'That fact makes it all the more tragic that a human life was lost simply because a knife was needlessly carried and so what would have begun and ended with the trading of a few punches instead led to a murder.' Sentencing: The Old Bailey heard that Mr Scott had been on a night out with friends when a youth outside an off licence asked for a cigarette. A row erupted and resulted in Mr Scott being stabbed in the chest . He added had Steele, who wore a grey tracksuit and appeared impassive in the dock, been a month older at the time of the attack, the sentence would have been much more severe. His co-defendant Dillon Beckford, 18, was acquitted of the same offence last week on the direction of Judge Pontius. Yesterday, prosecutor Simon Denison QC told the court that Steele had a series of past convictions for violent crimes, including muggings, dating back to when he was 12 or 13 years old. An impact statement from Mr Scott's mother, Rachel Van Dyke, said: 'His death was totally unnecessary and I know nothing is ever going to bring Alex back. 'The only thing I can hope for now is the person responsible gets their just desserts. 'Nothing can ever replace Alex. He was funny, outgoing, he had a good heart and would do anything for anybody.' At the opening of the trial, Mr Denison told the court: 'Alex Scott was 26 when he was killed in August last year. His death was as sudden as it was violent and wholly unnecessary. 'Another life taken away in an instant by the use of a knife that was taken on to the street for no reason. 'At about 9.30pm that evening he was outside an off-licence in Eltham Road, south-east London, with a group of friends. 'They were all heavy drinkers and had spent the early evening drinking and gambling at the bookies nearby.' He said 'words were needlessly exchanged' between Steele, his friend Dillon Beckford and the victim and his friends which led to a fight in a nearby alleyway. Mr Denison went on: 'Alex Scott played his part by being unnecessarily confrontational and he appears to have thrown the first punch, but there was absolutely no need or justification for what happened next. 'Kai Steele took out a knife that he had in his jacket and he lunged at Alex Scott twice. He stabbed him twice in the left side of his chest. 'Either blow could have killed him. One penetrated the aorta and the other penetrated his heart. 'Twenty or so seconds after he threw the first punch, Alex Scott collapsed on the pavement, where he died.' Following the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Diane Tudway said the murder 'had its origins in a fairly minor verbal confrontation'. 'Kai Steele stabbed him in an instant with a knife that he decided to take on to the street that day for no reason or justification,' she said. 'Alex's death was wholly avoidable and came about through Kai Steele choosing to carry a knife. 'I hope that the sentence today will act as a deterrent if someone is considering taking a knife or weapon out with them. My thoughts are with Alex's family and friends.'","Kai Steele stabbed 26-year-old Alex Scott twice in the chest after argument .

"Two Illinois college students have been arrested and charged with the murder of a 20-year-old man last month, in what police say was a minor drug deal gone wrong. Vicente Mundo, 20, a University of Illinois student, was shot dead inside the garage of his own apartment complex in Champaign on the night of January 25. His body was found dumped by the side of the road about 16 miles away in Tolono. On Monday police arrested Reginald James Scott, 21, and Daniel Gonzalez, 21 - both Parkland College students - and charged them with the first-degree murder of Mundo on Tuesday, according to The News-Gazette. Charged: Reginald James Scott, 21 (left), and Daniel Gonzalez, 21 (right), were arrested Monday and charged with the first-degree murder of Vincente Mundo, 20, last month . Murdered: Vincente Mundo, 20, was shot dead in the garage of his apartment complex on January 25 . Champaign County Sheriff Dan Walsh said at a press conference that the murder was 'part of a pre-planned armed robbery involving small amounts of marijuana and cash'. The pair wanted to rob Mundo of cash and three bags of cannabis, police said. However investigators believe the young man was shot in the head as he tried to flee Gonzalez's car in the parking garage of his own apartment complex in the 300 block of East Chalmers Street. Mundo went to meet the two after receiving a call while at his friend's apartment about half a block up the road. State’s Attorney Julia Rietz said it was Scott who shot Mundo dead, with Gonzalez behind the wheel. Gonzalez and Scott then allegedly drove to dump Mundo's body. Mundo's family reported him missing two days later, on January 27. His body was then found near the intersection of county roads 1000 E and 900 N in Tolono on Saturday by a woman walking her dog. Scene: Vincente Mundo lived on this block in Champaign, where police say he was shot dead last month . 'Great guy': The murder of Mundo has devastated his family and friends, who said he was a lovely person . Gonzalez's car, a Plymouth Neon, and the gun police believe that was used to shoot Mr. Mundo have also been recovered. The death of Mundo has understandably devastated his family. 'I don’t understand,' Mundo's sister, Julieta LaMalfa, told the News-Gazette. 'My brother was such a great guy.' On Monday, family and friends remembered held a vigil outside Mundo's home in Chicago. A second vigil was also held at La Casa Cultural Latino, a center for Hispanic students on the University of Illinois campus. Tribute: Vigils for Mundo have been held in Chicago - his home - and at the University of Illinois . 'It's hard to believe,' Viviana Mundo, another sister, said. 'It's not fair what happened to him. I want justice for my brother.' If convicted, Scott faces up to natural life, while Gonzalez faces a maximum 75 years in prison .","Vincente Mundo, 20, was shot dead on January 25, in Champaign .

"A grandmother has been reunited with her French penpal 40 years after the pair lost touch – after bumping into her at an Aldi supermarket. Sue Ellis, 60, recognised her former penpal Yvette Pearson when she overheard her Parisian accent while waiting at the checkout of her local Aldi store in Hednesford, Staffordshire. Incredibly, the women, who wrote to each other for four years when they were teenagers in the late 1960s, discovered they had both moved to the same town and were living just one mile apart. Scroll down for video . Sue Ellis, 60 (left), recognised her penpal from the late 1960s, Yvette Pearson, also 60 (right), when she overheard her Parisian accent while waiting at the checkout of an Aldi store in Hednesford, Staffordshire . The women became penpals when they were teenagers (together above) and wrote to each other for years . However, after a lengthy period of letter-sending and meeting-up, the pair eventually lost touch in the 1970s . Ms Ellis, a retired police constable, first started writing to Mrs Pearson when they were both 14 and the pair met up a number of times in their late teens. However, the women - who both recently celebrated their 60th birthdays - eventually lost touch and drifted apart a few years later in the early 1970s. Mrs Pearson then moved to the UK when she finished her studies in 1976 and married Steve Pearson - a friend of Sue's ex-boyfriend. Ms Ellis had no idea her French friend was living in England, even though she had introduced her to Steve on one of her visits from Paris. In a bizarre coincidence, both of the women eventually ended moving to the Staffordshire town of Hednesford – and now live just one mile apart. However, they had no idea they were living so close to each other until they bumped into each other for the first time in 40 years at Aldi last August. They are now best friends, meeting up twice a week for coffee, and were guest of honour at each others 60th birthday party. They were reunited when Ms Ellis (right) spotted her former penpal at Aldi last year and they have since become best friends, visiting each other several times a month and even attended each others birthday party . They both unearthed their former letters, which they sent to each other in the late 1960s and early 1970s . The letters, each carefully preserved and dated, show how the pair kept up-to-date with each others news . In one heart-warming letter, which was unearthed in the attic, Ms Ellis addresses the note to 'my best friend' Ms Ellis, who lives with her partner Steve Price, 59, said: 'I was standing at the checkout and I saw a woman in front of me and just knew I'd seen her somewhere before. 'I just couldn't place her but suddenly she spoke and I recognised her slight French accent. 'It's really funny to hear Yvette speak now as she still says some phrases in a really Midlands accent. 'We were chatting for ages blocking the entrance and then we saw each other a few days later and I went around her house which was less than a mile from mine. 'We now see each other every week and met up in time for her to come to my 60th party in September and I went to hers in January. 'It really is weird, even though we have been apart for 40 years it is like no time has passed and we are best friends again.' Mrs Pearson, who works as a French teacher, added: 'Sue came over to me as she'd seen me come out of the shop on her way in and watched me for a while to make sure it was me. Ms Ellis (centre back) was surprised at her 60th birthday party by her penpal Mrs Pearson (front centre), her brother Steve (right) and sister Julia (left). The former penpals are now best friends, enjoying regular visits . Ms Ellis (pictured in front of the Eiffel tower during a visit to her friend in 1973) is delighted to be reunited . In the box of  correspondence sent to one another in the 1960s and 1970s, the pair found this photo of Mrs Pearson in her hometown of Ivry near Paris, aged 15 in 1970. It was the first she sent to Ms Ellis of herself . One letter Mrs Pearson sent to Ms Ellis describes what she will wear when she arrives off the plane from France. It was sent to her penfriend when she was just 17-years-old and has been kept hidden away until now . One letter sent from Mrs Pearson to her penpal calls her 'My dear Sue, my best friend' and is dated 1973 . 'She just said my name and I couldn't place her but knew that I knew her. 'I started looking down her face and then she smiled and I knew straight away that it was Sue. 'I knew the second that I saw that smile. It was fantastic. 'It was really nice too because we met just two weeks before her surprise 60th birthday party so her partner turned up at my door and asked me to go to that. 'Through my whole career I've told the kids I teach that if they get the chance to have a penfriend they should take it because you never know where it will lead.' The women were randomly matched as penpals when Ms Ellis was a pupil at Pool Hayes Comprehensive in Willenhall, West Midlands, and Mrs Pearson was living in Ivry-sur-Seine in Paris. They wrote to each other every few months until the early 1970s when they started to plan to meet for the first time. Mrs Pearson came to the UK to visit around seven times while Ms Ellis only managed to afford to go to France once before they drifted apart around the age of 18. Ms Ellis, who worked as a police officer and as an advanced technician in the ambulance service, stayed in the Midlands and moved to Hednesford 20 years ago. Her former penpal settled in Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire, for 30 years after marrying Steve in 1976 before moving to Hednesford in July 2013. Ms Ellis, who has three children and three grandchildren, has now found a bag in her attic crammed with 20 letters, ticket stubs and postcards from when they were penfriends. In the correspondence, the teenage schoolgirls talk about music, fashion and their families, as well as making arrangements for their first ever meeting. On one occasion, Mrs Pearson pleads with Ms Ellis to send her make-up and says she will send Parisian magazines, cigarettes and perfume in exchange. The pair have enjoyed reading back through all their letters and correspondence, which they sent as teens . Ms Ellis (standing, left) is pictured with her brother and sister at their family home in Willenhall, West Midlands, in 1970. This was the first photo she sent Mrs Pearson, who she became penpals with in the 1960s . Mrs Pearson waves a Union Jack during a visit to West Park in Wolverhampton in 1971 (left), while Ms Ellis stands in front of the Eiffel tower (right) during a trip to Paris to visit Ms Pearson two years later in 1973 . The pair reignited their friendship after bumping into each other at Aldi in Hednesford, Staffordshire (above) Speaking about her trips to visit Ms Ellis in Willenhall, Mrs Pearson - who has three children and four grandchildren - added: 'I absolutely loved going to the Mander Centre, it was brand new and the shops were so cheap compared to Paris. 'We'd go shopping and then share a banana split at the Golden Egg across from Beatties. 'I just fell in love with Wolverhampton and couldn't get enough of it.' Ms Ellis added: 'I was desperate to go and see Paris after Yvette had been here a few times. 'I swapped my job from Tesco in the Mander Centre to Sainsbury's in the Wulfrun Centre because they paid more and I needed the money for my airfare which was #26, a month's wages. 'Yvette was absolutely amazed that we ate chips in the street and straight out of last night's newspapers.'","Sue Ellis, 60, recognised former penpal Yvette Pearson at Aldi checkout .

"A persistent cough could be a sign of lung cancer . A persistent cough, a sore that refuses to heal, unexplained weight loss and changing bladder habits. They may seem innocuous, irritating facts of life. But a leading charity has warned not to dismiss them and six other key changes in your body, for fear they could be a sign of something more sinister. The 10 red flags for cancer are ingrained in the minds of doctors and healthcare workers the world over. But Cancer Research UK is urging members of the public to familiarise themselves with the key symptoms - in their bid to help save lives. A new study published today revealed one in two people born after 1960 is likely to develop cancer at some point in their lifetime. With the risk increasing so quickly, experts fear as many as two-thirds of today's children will be diagnosed with the disease. But in many cases early diagnosis can mean the difference between life and death for cancer patients. A survey by researchers on behalf of Cancer Research UK found almost half of those displaying at least one red flag for cancer did not visit their GP, thinking their symptoms 'trivial'. But experts at the charity advise if you or a member of your family is suffering at least one of these 10 red flag symptoms, book an appointment with a GP straight away: . Dr Katriina Whitaker, a senior research fellow at University College London, said many of the people interviewed as part of their study had red flag symptoms 'but felt these were trivial'. Other people decided not to go for a check up because they feared a cancer diagnosis, while some adopt a stiff upper lip. Some people surveyed revealed a lack of trust in the health service, while others put their symptoms down to the signs of ageing. Researchers in London and Hull examined how people who experience possible cancer symptoms decide whether or not to seek medical help. A new survey by Cancer Research has found many patients displaying one of the 10 red flag symptoms for cancer refrained from visiting their GP feeling their symptoms were 'trivial'. A changed mole can indicate a person has skin cancer, the charity warned (file picture posed by model) Another study released today revealed one in two people born after 1960 will develop cancer during their life . They sent out a health survey, which was completed by more than 1,700 people, aged 50 or older from three London GP practices. The questionnaire didn't specifically mention cancer, but included a list of 17 symptoms including 10 warning signs of cancer. BREAST CANCER: 96 per cent of women survive for at least one year, 87 per cent do so for five years, and 78 per cent for a decade. SKIN CANCER: 88 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women the figures are even better, with 92 per cent predicted to survive for at least five years. LUNG CANCER: Just 8 per cent of men survive for five years or more, compared with 12 per cent of women. PROSTATE CANCER: Some 85 per cent of patients survive for five years or more. BOWEL CANCER: 59 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women, the figure is 58 per cent. More than 900 people (53 per cent) reported at least one of the 10 red flag symptoms during the last three months. Researchers then interviewed around 50 of them, almost half of whom (45 per cent) had not seen their GP about their symptoms. One patient, suffering persistent abdominal pain refrained from having a recommended test. She said: 'At times I thought it was bad... but when it kinds of fades away, you know, it doesn't seem worth pursuing really.' Another respondent, who experienced a persistent change in bladder habits, added: 'You've just got to get on with it. 'And if you go to the doctor too much, it's seen as a sign of weakness or that you are not strong enough to manage things on your own.' Among the reasons people gave for refusing to seek medical help was an instinct that something wasn't right, and an awareness of fear they might have cancer. One man, with an unexplained lump in his throat, said: 'But always at the back of your mind you've always got the fear of cancer, well it's best to check just in case.' But fear was also a driving force to stop people getting checked by their GP. A persistent change in bladder habits can indicate a person is suffering bladder cancer, pictured under the microscope. In men, the symptom can also be a sign of prostate cancer . And for some people, persistent symptoms led them to think the signs were normal for them. Some waited for another reason to visit their GP, then mentioned their red flag symptom. And others said they would rather use an emergency route, going straight to A&E for example, rather than wait for a referral to see a specialist from their GP. Dr Whitaker said: 'Many of the people we interviewed had red flag symptoms but felt that these were trivial and didn't need medical attention, particularly if they were painless or intermittent. 'Others felt that they shouldn't make a fuss or waste valuable NHS resources. 'The stiff-upper-lip stoicism of some who decided not to go to their doctor was alarming because they put up with often debilitating symptoms. 'Some people made the decision to get symptoms checked out after seeing a cancer awareness campaign or being encouraged to do so by family or friends – this seemed to almost legitimise their symptoms as important.' Dr Richard Roope, Cancer Research UK's GP expert, said: 'The advice we give is: if in doubt, check it out – this would not be wasting your GP's time. Cancer Research UK is urging anyone suffering any of the 10 red flag symptoms of cancer to visit their GP immediately. A long-term cough or hoarseness can be a sign of lung cancer, pictured on an X-ray . 'Often your symptoms won't be caused by cancer, but if they are, the quicker the diagnosis, the better the outcome. 'Seeking prompt advice from your GP about symptoms, either on the phone or during an appointment, could be a life-saver, whatever your age. 'And the good news is that more than half of all patients diagnosed with cancer now survive for more than 10 years.' Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, added: 'Spotting and treating cancer early means patients have a far better chance of beating the disease – so it's important we understand why some people with potential symptoms decide not to get them checked out straightaway. 'International comparisons have already shown us that the British public are far more worried about being a burden on the health system or 'wasting the doctor's time' than in other developed countries. 'This study gives us valuable insight into the decision-making process and could help us find ways to encourage everyone with worrying symptoms to seek help as early as possible.'","A long-term cough, a sore that won't heal, a changing mole, unexplained weight loss and changing bowel habits are signs of cancer .

"A Briton who was once the world's fattest man at 70st is to marry after his American girlfriend proposed to him on a U.S. television show. Paul Mason, 53, from Ipswich, Suffolk, who has since slimmed down to a comparatively svelte 22st, immediately said 'yes' to Rebecca Mountain, 40, from Orange, Massachusetts. And the former postman vowed to get into the shape of his life for their big day, saying: 'I don’t want to go down that aisle in a wheelchair.' Scroll down for video . Engaged: Paul Mason, centre, who was once the world's fattest man, and Rebecca Mountain, right, on The View The pair are to marry after she proposed to him during their interview on the ABC show . Forty-year-old Miss Mountain, who is a slender 8st, asked for his hand in marriage as they appeared live on ABC's The View, BBC News reported. And that wasn't the only surprise Mr Mason had in store, as the show's hosts announced that as an engagement present they would donate towards the amount needed to fund surgery to remove excess skin following his dramatic weight loss. Asked if a date had been set for their wedding, Miss Mountain told The View: 'There’s so many things we need to do to take care of Paul first. 'There will be another surgery for his legs but not for another six to eight months.' The engagement comes after the pair fell in love online following Mr Mason's incredible 48st weight loss thanks to NHS surgery. Mr Mason flew to the U.S. in December to spend Christmas with Miss Mountain, and also for a consultation with a New York-based plastic surgeon who had agreed to carry out the procedure for free. Dr Jennifer Capla agreed to donate her time to perform an operation to remove the excess skin from Mr Mason's belly and arms, meaning that he and Miss Mountain only need to find the cash for his hospital stay and drugs. That's where The View stepped in for Mr Mason's second surprise, as they offered to stump up the $17,000 (£10,341) he needed to cover the medical expenses. Mr Mason said: 'I'm excited, all I've got to do is go back to the UK, get a medical visa, and then come back.' Battles to come: After losing 48st following NHS gastric band surgery, Mr Mason now needs further operations to remove the excess skin that it has left behind, which Miss Mountain has been helping him raise the cash for . Miss Mountain first got in touch with Mr Mason on Facebook after she saw a television documentary about his extreme obesity. Appearing on UK breakfast television programme last November, in the week they met in person for the first time, she said she 'just felt compelled to reach out and just try to help and that's all it was.' 'I have a lot of drive and just thought I could write letters and support,' she said. 'Things I set my sights on, I just go and do. I just knew that I should try and help. 'He's incredible, a genuine person. Incredibly honest and open about the difficulties he's been through, which helped our relationship.' Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. World's fattest man: At the height of his food . addiction, Mr Mason was eating an entire pack of bacon, four sausages . and four eggs with bread and hash browns for breakfast and . lived in a specially adapted home . Obese: The former postman would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening . As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million. At the height of his food addiction, he was eating an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast. He would then eat quadruple portions of fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening. Mr Mason finally beat the bulge after an NHS operation to fit him with a gastric band, but his life was left on hold as he waited for further surgery to remove the excess skin it left behind. Now he and Miss Mountain hope that after The View is broadcast in the U.S. on Friday, the publicity surrounding it will help them raise the rest of the cash they need for the aftercare following his surgery.","Rebecca Mountain proposed to Paul Mason as they appeared on The View .

"The United Arab Emirates pulled out of coalition airstrikes against ISIS after the capture of a Jordanian pilot who has since been murdered by the extremists, it has been reported. The key U.S. ally is said to have suspended its role in December after Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh was shot down over Syria amid fears for the fate of its own pilots. Among them is the symbolically important Major Mariam Al Mansouri, the country's first female pilot who became the poster girl for the bombing missions when they started last year. Her participation in F-16 airstrikes has been celebrated in the West and even led to her missions being dubbed 'boobs on the ground'. Scroll down for video . Top gun: The UAE pulled out of coalition strikes against ISIS after the capture of a Jordanian pilot over fears for its own crew, including Mariam Al Mansouri (above), who became the poster girl for its bombing missions . Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force after joining in 2007 and is now a squadron commander. She's pictured here in an F-16 Desert Eagle . Poster girl: Major Mansouri's participation in F-16 airstrikes since September last year has been celebrated in the West and even led to her missions being dubbed 'boobs on the ground' The UAE said it wants the U.S. to improve its search-and-rescue efforts, including the use of V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, in northern Iraq, closer to the battleground. As it stands, the U.S.-led mission is based in Kuwait, administration officials said, according to the New York Times. The paper said UAE pilots will not rejoin the fight until the Ospreys - which take off and land like helicopters but fly like planes - are deployed in northern Iraq. Lt al-Kasasbeh was captured by Islamic State militants within minutes of his plane crashing in December near Raqqa, Syria, the Times said, quoting a senior U.S. military official. But UAE officials questioned if American military rescue teams would have been able to reach the pilot even if there had been more time for a rescue effort, administration officials said.

These aircraft were part of a coalition force that was the first to strike ISIS targets in Syria . The UAE foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, asked Barbara Leaf, the new US ambassador, why the United States had not put proper resources in northern Iraq for rescuing downed pilots, a senior administration official said. The UAE declined comment. 'We cannot comment on issues discussed in private meetings,' an official source said in Abu Dhabi after the publication of the Times article. Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander. She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature. The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers. Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him . Depraved: The flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot. It is later flattened by a bulldozer . She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.' While her participation in the airstrikes was praised by the West, her family reportedly disowned her and labelled her an 'ingrate' for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria. After video was released yesterday showing Lt al-Kasasbeh being torched to death, condemnations quickly came from Gulf Arab nations, all of which are close U.S. allies. The foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, condemned the killing and reaffirmed his nation's commitment to fighting terrorism and extremism. 'This heinous and obscene act represents a brutal escalation by the terrorist group, whose evil objectives have become apparent,' he said. The UAE is one of the most visible Arab members in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State group, which also includes Jordan. Bahrain, a Gulf state that is home to the U.S. 5th Fleet, denounced the killing as 'despicable,' and Kuwait's emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, blasted the killing as 'criminal' and 'vicious.' Qatar's Foreign Ministry also condemned the 'criminal act contravening the tolerant principles of the Islamic faith, human values and international laws and norms.' The tiny but very rich Gulf nation hosts the regional command center co-ordinating coalition airstrikes. These images purportedly show the exact location where the Jordanian pilot was burned alive by the Islamic State in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Respected anti-ISIS activists Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RIBSS) claim to have pinpointed the area by cross-referencing landmarks in yesterday's execution video with aerial photographs. Using a series of annotated graphics, the group argues the barbaric murder took place in a compound in the far south of the city, a few hundred metres from the Euphrates River.

If proven correct, they could help coalition forces more accurately target bombing runs and surveillance operations in its attempt to root out the jihadist executioners. However, MailOnline has been unable to independently verify the images. The sickening video footage, released by ISIS yesterday, shows Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being torched to death after he was captured when his F-16 fighter jet crashed over the city. This third image shows the captive standing inside the courtyard in front of the cage which he is later locked into and torched to death. The picture also shows a wall in the background which, the group claims, confirms the location of the compound . Location? RIBSS argues the barbaric murder took place  in the far south of Raqqa, a few hundred metres from the Euphrates River . As with previous beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, the 20-minute-long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics. But crucially it contains an added cinematic dimension, with wider landscape shots and aerial footage, that offers much more detailed views of the landscape than before. RIBSS now claims to have exploited this to create a detail picture of where the various parts of the video were shot.","U.S. ally suspended bombing missions after Moaz al-Kasasbeh was seized .

"Arrested: Mycia Burden, 25, was arrested on Sunday as she stood naked outside of a Gentleman's Club . A Gentleman's club told police that a naked woman arrested outside of the club claiming to be a stripper there 'took her clothing off outside of the venue to get the establishment in trouble' because nude dancing is illegal in Dougherty County. Mycia Burden, 25, was discovered nude outside Club Parisians at around 1 a.m. on Sunday with her friend Maeletha Robinson. She told police that she and her friend were stripping but were kicked out by management for being rude to customers. Burden claimed that the club would not return her clothing. Club Parisians is under investigation and its owner Ulysses James has agreed to close the club until 'they come to a clear understanding of local ordinances.'

"The personal aide of one-time Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blasted Barack Obama's former top adviser on Wednesday for saying Romney once claimed the president's win in 2012 was the product of an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation tageting blacks. Garrett Jackson said political strategist David Axelrod told a 'ridiculous ... lie' about a phone call between the two politicians on Election Night. Romney, according to a new memoir by Axelrod, ticked off Obama on one of the most important nights of his life when he called to concede the race, saying, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' That's how Obama remembers it, according to Axelrod, who writes that the president concluded: 'In other words, black people. That's what he (Romney) thinks this was all about.' Garret told CBS News on Wednesday that he was in the room listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and it never happened. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama talked on the phone with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the Presidential Suite at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on Election Night 2012; Romney annoyed him with a jab about how he won by getting blacks to the polls . David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign strategist in 2012,later shaved his signature moustache but kept his notes from years of insider access to the first family . MAKING THE CALL: On Election Night 2012, Mitt Romney called Barack Obama to congratulate him – and that phoen call is the subjuct of controversy with one campaign consultant calling the other a liar . Jackson said Romney's comments were: 'Mr. President, I want to congratulate you and your team on a hard-fought race and your victory. ...There are a lot of tough issues facing the country ... and I hope you tackle those tough issues.' 'I'm happy to help in any way,' the aide recalled ROmney as saying on the phone. 'Ann and I will pray for you daily; you have a tough job ahead.' Axelrod, a longtime Obama campaign insider, made the claim that Romney linked his loss to the race of Obama's political base in a book due for a Feb. 10 release . Obama was 'unsmiling during the call, and slightly irritated when it was over,' he wrote. Jackson said neither man was on a speakerphone – something photos of the historic moment on both ends of the call confirms. So no one in Obama's Chicago hotel room, other than the president himself, could know what Romney said. The call was brief, Jackson said Wednesday, and included no specifics about turnout in any area of the country – something he said 'I know for a fact.' Mitt Romney's personal assistant Garrett Jackson (right) saw and heard everything the GOP candidate said and did during the last presidential race, and he suggests David Axelrod is lying to make the Republican look like a race-obsessed sore loser . 'I just hope this lie is the work of David Axelrod and not the president,' he told CBS. 'It's ridiculous. I was very disappointed they would make that up.' The revelation appeared timed for release when Romney would be teeing up his third attempt to win the White House. He announced on Jan. 30, however, that he won't be running. Axelrod – 'Axe' to Democratic power players – may have been playing to the political world's baser instincts by linking Romney to a race-based attack when he was expected to be building support for the 2016 election. If his account is accurate, though, it shows how frustrated the former Massachusetts governor was after late polling showed he had a reasonable chance to win. Axelrod also writes that Romney was genuinely surprised he had failed to pull it off. The New York Daily News got an advance copy of Axelrod's memoir, 'Believer: My 40 Years in Politics.' Now the founding director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, Axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the Chicago Tribune. Three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting U.S. Senator Paul Simon. Axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, He later worked for then-Senator John Edwards' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to Obama's 2008 effort. Jackson (right) shadowed Mitt Romney everywhere during the 2012 presdiential campaign, and says he heard what the Republican said when he called to concede the race to Barack Obama . JUSTICE CLINTON? The president briefly considered appointing Hillary to the SUpreme Court after he clobbered her in the 2008 Democratic primary . Ultimately he became one of the president's most senior advisers before departing the White House in 2011. His career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in Canada and Italy. This year he's consulting with Britain's Labour Party in advance of May 7 elections. Labour has said Axelrod is being paid a 'six-figure salary' for his advice, and that he is working with Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls. Other tidbits from his book include the claim that Obama briefly mulled putting Hillary Clinton on the U.S. Supreme Court as a consolation prize after he trounced her in the Democratic primary. Close Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, Axelrod writes, made Obama's first chief of staff Rahm Emanuel so uncomfortable that he tried to shunt her out of the White House by enticing her to run for Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat. 'I don't want to manage the president's best friend,' Emanuel said in Axelrod's retelling. Ultimately, Obama scotched the idea and kept Jarrett in his White House inner circle. Conservatives consider her the president's sinister, Rasputin-like policy whisperer, even casting her in the role of the president's final arbiter on key issues. Romney has decided not to run again in 2016, disappointing liberals who yearned to hammer him on income-inequality issues (again) MOVIN' ON UP? Obama joked that he would vacate the White House and let Maine's then-senator Olympis Snowe live there if she would only vote for Obamacare . And Axelrod writes that during the legislative battle over the Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – Obama was so convinced he needed a few Republican senators on hs side that he joked about letting one of them, Maine's then-senator Olympia Snowe, live in the White House. 'We'll call it the Snowe plan. Hell, she can live here in the White House! Michelle and I will get an apartment,' Obama's adviser recalls him saying. Axelrod also tells readers that the president got a sneak preview of the original iPhone from the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, that he rejected the idea of being anyone's vice president, and that Obama – not George Stephanopoulos – was President Bill Clinton's first choice to be his communications director during his initial presidential run in 1992.","David Axelrod wrote that losing Republican sniped during his concession call that the president 'did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee'

"Wannabe diplomat: Newly-released emails give more detail on how Tampa socialite Jill Kelley (pictured) wormed her way into military society . Newly-released emails shed light on the ambitious Tampa socialite who inadvertently exposed General Petraeus' affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, which ended his storied career in one of the biggest military scandals of the past decade. More than two hundred pages of emails between Jill Kelley and two senior military officials were recently obtained by the Washington Post, two years after the newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see them. The emails between Kelley, a married mother of three and medical researcher, show how she flattered former Marine General James N Mattis, then commander to all military forces in the Middle East, and his deputy, Vice Admiral Robert Harward, to win honorary titles that she treated as if they were a real-life diplomatic job. The emails show no inappropriate behavior between Kelley and the officials, though both Mattis and Harward retired from the military within a year of the scandal. The emails, strewn with exclamation marks and capitalized letters for flair, Kelley praises Mattis and Harward for their diplomatic prowess. In one email sent to Mattis after a party in 2012, Kelly wrote: 'Everyone thinks you're a RockStar! We agreed how amazing it must be that you're single-handedly re-writing history.' In a later response, Marris returned the compliment by telling Kelley: 'I wish that we could clone a couple thousand of you, but the land is likely not ready for that big an impact.' The 39-year-old is currently in the middle of a lawsuit against the FBI and Department of Defense, agencies she claims violated her privacy by revealing her identity in the midst of the embarrassing 2012 scandal involving Petraeusm, then CIA director. That year, Kelley started receiving emails from an unknown account, accusing her of having an affair with Petraeus. When the emails turned threatening towards herself and her family, she filed a complaint with the FBI. The FBI discovered that the emails had originated from Paula Broadwell, General Petraeus' biographer, and it was revealed that the two were having an extramarital affair and that Broadwell feared Kelley was some sort of romantic rival. That revelation caused Gen Petraeus to quit his position in disgrace, and for Marine General John Allen to retire early. Allen became caught up in the scandal since he was found to have exchanged an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 emails with Kelley, though some say the figure was exaggerated and closer to 300 messages. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and is currently working as Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). Kelley has consistently denied having a relationship with Petraeus, or anyone else, and no evidence has ever been revealed implicating herself of any inappropriate relationship with the former four-star general. The emails just published in the Washington Post also hold no evidence of inappropriate behavior between Kelley and her military chums. Friends: Kelley, 39, is best known for inadvertantly exposing an extramarital affair between General David Petraeus and his biographer Paula Broadwell. Kelley and Patraeus pictured attending an event above . Exposed: The affair between Petraeus and Broadwell was exposed when Kelley filed a complaint to the FBI after receiving threatening messages. They emails were ultimately traced back to Broadwell who apparently saw Kelley as a romantic rival, though both Petraeus and Kelley have fiercely denied any inappropriate relationship . They do however, paint a picture of how she set out to make a name for herself among the upper echelons of the military community in Florida, and how she grew over confident when she was awarded honorary diplomatic titles just for hosting parties. 'The latest set of e-mails made public by the government simply confirms that Jill Kelley is and was a talented, civic-minded woman doing productive work as Honorary Ambassador to Central Command in Tampa and as Honorary Consul for the Republic of Korea,' her attorney Allen C Raul said in a statement to the Post. 'Nonetheless, continued unauthorized government release of Kelley's emails exposes them to further unjustified embarrassment and injury.' Kelley and her husband Scott started to familiarize themselves with the military community in Tampa by hosting parties for officials at their mansion near MacDill Air Force Base, home to U.S. Central Command. After befriending Mattis and his deputy Vice Admiral Robert Harward, Kelley practically begged to be named the honorary ambassador to Central Command. In one email to Harward on January 12, 2012, Kelley wrote: 'Sooooooooo…..Did you and Jim finally decide to make me your ""official"" CentCom ambassador????? Please! Please! Please! I always wanted to be an Ambassador, since I was made to be a ‘catalyst’ — that helps build or facilitate Foreign relations.' Military chums: The Washington Post received more than 200 pages of emails between Kelley and former Marine Gen James Mattis (left) and his deputy Vice Adm Robert Harward (right), two years after the newspaper filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see them . 'We'll have to put you through the vetting process and interviews to ensure you have the right attributes!' Harward replied. Kelley's efforts were not in vain as she was named the United States Central Command and Coalition Honorary Ambassador in a ceremony just three months later. Gen Mattis was in Baghdad at the time, so couldn't attend the April 19 ceremony. But Kelley made sure to write him in detail about the event and how seriously she took the  responsibilities of the title. 'I gave my commitment . . . as the Ambassador, to make it my priority to advance global trust, international exchange, and camaraderie within the Command. 'But most importantly I thanked Gen Mattis for his priceless support and glorius leadership. I said, without him, this would not be a reality! 'Harward also spoke — really flattering words about ‘Madame Ambassador’ He explained how they decided to designate this new position — and why the CentCom unilaterally chose me. :) (which was very humbling to hear in front of a million guys)' During the course of her brief time in the good graces of military society, Kelley was also named Honorary Consul to South Korea. The appointment came out of the blue, since she knew little about the country, but that didn't prevent her from taking the position in stride. In an email to Gen Mattis, informing him of the position, she wrote: 'YES!!!! Honorary Consul General. I’m soooooo excited about the humbling honor. It’s ironic that I get the request from the state of Korea — which is NOT my expertise. However as a lover of International Politics/Foreign Affairs, I do find the Korean Statehood quite interesting . . . (I’m a lover of conflict problem solving, and have a keen sense of seeking opportunities in chaos.)' It has also been revealed that Kelley was invited to visit Kabul by the Afghanistan parliament, though it's unclear why they chose to honor her. In an email to an unidentified State Department official on August 27, Kelley said she was 'honored' by the invitation and 'would be humbled to serve the request to foster, promote and proliferate future relations and agreements with the Members of Parliament.' She added that  Commander John Allen supported the trip, and copied him on the email. Kelley's lawyer would not say if she actually followed through with the visit. The longer she maintained these relationships, the more confident Kelley became with her honorary titles. The emails show a darker side to the socialite, in one instance sending a dramatic message to Harward after learning that she wouldn't be the only honored guest  to attend a Bastille Day ceremony. Though thick and thin: Kelley remains married to her husband Scott, and the couple live in Tampa with their three children while pursuing a lawsuit against the U.S. government for violating their privacy . 'Bob, WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT??? You never informed me of ‘3’ other Honorary Ambassadors??????' When Adm Harward replied that he would look into the matter, Kelley responded: 'Please call . . . and make it very clear that you are NOT supporting this. These NATO guys manipulate passive behavior . . . Clearly, I’m offended, and not standing up for this . . . Please address this today, and kill this for once and for all.' When Petraeus' affair was revealed in November 2012, Kelley lost her favor in the military community and the honorary titles she worked to hard to win. But she has gained some success in her privacy lawsuit. The federal government's request to throw out the case was recently overruled by a judge and the case has been cleared to continue in U.S. District Court in Washington, DC. Meanwhile the Justice Department is still deciding whether to bring up charges against Petraeus for allegedly leaking classified material to his mistress and biographer Broadwell. He has continually denied passing secret information.","Jill Kelley inadvertently exposed an affair between Gen David Petraeus and his biographer Paula Broadwell in 2012 .

Working under the name 'Sayuki', which means 'transparent happiness', she was first introduced to Japan on a school trip when she was just 15, and was so taken with the country that she moved to continue her schooling at a Japanese High School. Scroll down for video . Melbourne-born woman Fiona Graham became the first non-Japanese geisha in 400 years . After attending the country's prestigious Keio University, Sayuki went on to study a doctorate in social anthropology at Oxford, where she developed a particular interest in the exclusive geisha world. Sayuki began work on a documentary about the culture, and said that she found herself drawn into the world completely. 'As a documentary maker, the thought of making a documentary from the inside of the geisha world was tantalising. No foreigner has ever become a geisha before so my insight is unique,' Sayuki told Daily Mail Australia. In a groundbreaking move, Sayuki was accepted into a 'okiya', a geisha training house, where she was taught the rituals, customs, and practices of living as a geisha. Despite the often tawdry reputation that the geisha world has in Western society, the women are regarded as artists, specialising in particular skills and offering entertainment, along with companionship, to their clients. Much of the focus is on providing entertainment around the dinner table, including genteel tea ceremonies, drinking rituals, musical performance, dance and calligraphy. Transformation: Miss Graham pictured before, left, and after, right, putting on her geisha regalia . Sayuki, who holds a PhD in Social Anthropology from Oxford, formally debuted as a geisha in 2007 . Sayuki began work on a documentary about the culture, and said that she found herself drawn into the world . 'The tea-houses where we entertain customers are exquisite traditional rooms, and from the paintings to the dishes, everything is perfection,' Sayuki said. 'The kimono that geisha wear are also works of art. And being able to work by performing is wonderful.' Sayuki's speciality is playing the bamboo flute, as one of the main part of being a geisha is learning an art. 'I had to begin with dance, drum and tea ceremony lessons. I had to abandon some of these later when my father got terminal cancer,' Sayuki said. 'Instead, I practiced the things I could do while helping to look after him for weeks at a time - shamisen (3 string lute) and singing, and I still do those,' she said. 'But my main specialty is Japanese bamboo flute. I take classes in four different types of music, and from four different teachers, for flute alone.' Despite Western misconceptions that link geishas with sexuality, Sayuki maintains that geishas are full time working artists. 'Misconceptions about geisha are largely foreign misconceptions. Japanese know very well that geisha are extremely dedicated dancers and musicians,' Sayuki said. Sayuki was accepted into a 'okiya', a geisha training house, where she was taught to live as a geisha . Sayuki, without traditional make-up (above), runs a geisha house and kimono business in Japan . 'The word geisha means artist literally in Japanese. Geisha are always unmarried and are able to have a love affair with whomever they choose, but, in general, it would have to be an above average man to make a geisha fall in love with him.' The numbers of geishas in Japan has shrunk from 80,000 in 1920 to just 2,000- but  Sayuki said that the women are strong and resilient businesswomen. Sayuki spent more than three years working at a geisha house in Ayakusa, Tokyo's historic pleasure district, before she distanced herself from the Ayakusa's Geisha Association in 2011. She now works independently, offering 'parties' and tours, and launching a secondhand kimono business. Sayuki also 'raises' geisha, and has trained five young geisha from different districts in Japan in her geisha house. Each kimono costs several thousands dollars, including the one that Sayuki made her debut in, which cost more than $25,000. 'My main work is being a geisha: attending banquets, traveling overseas and around Japan to do talks and events, and finding and training my new little geisha,' Sayuki said. Sayuki spent more than three years working at a geisha house in Ayakusa, Tokyo's historic pleasure district . Graceful: Miss Graham underwent basic training in the tea ceremony, dancing and music - specialising in the bamboo flute - before debuting as a geisha in 2007 under the name Sayuki . 'I also lecture in geisha studies at one of Japan's best universities. I was the first geisha to be employed by a university, and the my classes are the first time geisha culture has been taught at university in Japan,' she said. 'This is the kind of modern new development that I think is really positive for the geisha world, and my students say they love the classes. They all get to dress up as geisha, and also to attend banquets, and dance recitals.' Sayuki is passionate about providing foreigners with access to the geisha world, as tea-house generally do not allow strangers to enter without an introduction. In the case of Sayuki's geisha house, she is considered the introduction and so has created a unique way to gain an insight into the culture without breaking the rules of the geisha world. One of her future projects will be making a documentary on her geisha house, which she believes to be a fascinating subject.

"A recently-published study has found a nearly 16 percent boost in HIV cases due to Craigslist popping up in a new area. The study, 'Internet's Dirty Secret: Assessing the Impact of Online Intermediaries on HIV Transmission,' was published in MIS Quarterly in December last year. Assistant Professor of Information and Decision Sciences Jason Chan - who works at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management - and Professor Aninya Ghose - who works at New York University's Stern School of Business - were the study's authors. Outbreak: A recently-published study has found a nearly 16 percent jump in HIV cases due to Craigslist hitting a new area . A release published by the University of Minnesota said, 'When mapped at the national level, more than 6,000 HIV cases annually and treatment costs estimated between $62 million and $65.3 million can be linked to the popular website.' 'I actually think that the creators of Craigslist had no intent of harming society,' Chan said in the release. 'They came in with good intentions. At the same time, they did not anticipate that users could use the features in an unexpected way with unintended consequences.' The Star Tribune reported that Chan's inspiration stemmed from when 'he’d read about a doctor who traced sexually transmitted diseases to online chat rooms.' Chan told the newspaper 'I went to Craigslist in New York and went through the ads. To my shock, I found out almost all the ads were hookup ads. They were very explicit.' Information spanning nine years from 1998 to 2008 and in 33 different states was used, according to the University of Minnesota. Investigation: Information spanning nine years from 1998 to 2008 and in 33 different states was used for the researchers' work . Its release also revealed that 'the researchers discovered that the upward shift was influenced by ads in Craigslist’s personals sections, not the site’s escort service ads. This finding was in line with existing research that shows internet-facilitated sex workers are less likely to participate in risky sexual practices with clients.' The Star Tribune reported that 'The study found that HIV incidence began to increase about a year after Craigslist entered a market, then climbed through the study period.' The newspaper explained that the study could not separate types of personal ads available. Chan told the newspaper 'My suspicion is most of this [effect] is coming from the M for M section. We do know that anal sex is a large reason why HIV is spread. It’s also prevalent in the gay community. It makes sense that this group is the most likely to be affected.' Craigslist did not immediately return a message seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.","A recently-published study has found a nearly 16 percent boost in HIV cases due to Craigslist popping up in a new area .

"A  homeless man was found dead on the steps of a New York record store  after people stepping over him realized he wasn't moving, witnesses have claimed. Police were called to the entrance of Westsider Records on the Upper West Side where the body of a Hispanic man was found lying face down yesterday morning. Shocked witnesses claim they saw people  walking around the  man as he lay dead on the steps of the record store- next door to a funeral home. The man was discovered dead at the entrance to Westsider Records, in the Upper West Side, New York, by people who had been walking over him . The man was described as wearing worn out sneakers with no laces that were held together by several socks. Officers found no identification and are now checking to see the man is homeless. An autopsy will be carried out to confirm the cause of death but a homeless advocate warned Monday night's freezing temperatures could have been to blame. Record store manager Bruce Edar, 59, told New York Daily News said no one should have had to have been outside during the frigid weather. 'It's horrible, a night like last night,' he said. 'Anyone in that condition should had been picked up and put in a shelter.' Police were called to the body of a Hispanic man, found on the steps of Westsider Records, yesterday morning . One upset customer at the shop said she was 'shocked' people were walking around the dead man as he lay at the entrance to the shop, while another witnesses said she believed he had been there for some time. Hannibal Perez, 53, who works at the National Council of Jewish Women near the store, added that he walked by the man without realizing he was dead. 'He was laying on the steps, face down,' he said. 'He had a heavy jacket, waist length. The guy wasn't moving at all.' The Department of Homeless Services, DHS, has a 'Code Blue' protocols in place to protect the homeless on nights that fall below freezing point (0 degrees Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit). DHS has confirmed it is looking into the death and said offered a place for anyone who wanted to come in from the  cold.","The body was found at the entrance to Westsider Records on Upper West Side .

"A criminal gang renowned for wearing 'fishnet stockings and high heels' as they stole more than £75m worth of jewellery from Harry Winston appeared in a Paris court today. Eight defendants - many from the same family - face up 30 years in prison for a number of high-profile crimes across France, including two raids on the celebrity firm. One took place in December 2008 when four men - including three wearing women's clothes and wigs - entered Harry Winston's flagship store off the Champs Elysee. Heist: Four men dressed as women stole around £53million worth of watches and jewellery from the Harry Winston store in Paris (pictured) in 2008 . Mastermind: The police found some of the stolen items at home of Douadi 'DouDou' Yahiaoui (pictured), who prosecutors claim is behind the raids . One of a kind: Defence barrister Eric Dupond-Moretti (pictured) told Paris Assizes: 'It's an exceptional case with odd aspects . Described by investigators as the 'Heist of the Century', it saw the group at first elude security guards with their unusual disguises, and then swiftly produce handguns from their pockets. Defence barrister Eric Dupond-Moretti told Paris Assizes: 'It's an exceptional case with odd aspects. 'In television series on heists, they wear bullet-proof vests. Here it's fishnet stockings and high heels.' Some of the gang began herding employees and customers into a corner, threatening them at gunpoint if they did not cooperate. No shots were fired but several members of staff were assaulted, as 104 watches and 297 pieces of jewellery worth £53m disappeared in less than 20 minutes. Police later found some of the haul at the home of Douadi Yahiaoui, 50, and known as 'DouDou'. He is considered by prosecutors to be the mastermind of the raids, and faces life in prison. An earlier raid on the Avenue Montaigne store, in October 2007, saw four men wearing workers' overalls get into it when it was closed at night. With the help of a security guard, they spent the night inside and then pounced the next morning. They punched and tied up employees, and then forced the director of the store to de-activate alarms and open the safes. Haul: French police recovered some of the money and jewellery (pictured in 2009) from the raid on the Harry Winston jewelers in Paris . Daring: The 'Heist of the Century' saw the group at first elude security guards by dressing as women before eventually stealing millions worth of jewellery (pictured in 2009) Justice: Now, eight defendants  face up 30 years in prison for a number of high-profile crimes across France including the theft of watches and jewellery (pictured in 2009) from the Harry Winston store . Raid: An earlier raid on the Avenue Montaigne store in October 2007 saw four men wearing workers' overalls get into it the store at night . This time the gang made off with 120 watches and 360 pieces of jewellery worth around £25m. Frederic Trovato, for Yahiaoui, told Paris Assizes that his client 'is not innocent' but did not play as big a part in the heists as claimed. Mr Trovato said the security guard, Djennad Mouloud, 39, came to his client with the idea of the heist, but Yahiaoui was initially too scared to get involved. Yahiaoui 'collected information from the guard' and later agreed to 'hide the jewels and sell them off,' said Mr Trovato, adding: 'But he didn't take part in the robberies'. A number of Yahiaoui's family are in the dock, including his brother-in-law Patrick Chiniah, 40, his brother Mohammed Areski Yahiaoui, 59, and his nephew Faudile Yahiaoui, 28. Two members of the gang - Debaa Karim, 32, and Farid Allou, 49 - have admitted being at the robberies, while Belferroum Hassen, 32, denies it. However – like many of the defendants, Hassen is said to have left traces of his DNA on a ban left behind during the second robbery. Following a five-year investigation, some 500 of the jewels and watches have still not been recovered. Specialists in so-called 'ultra-luxe' jewellery, Harry Winston became world famous in the 1950s when the line 'Talk to me Harry Winston, tell me all about it!' appeared in the song 'Diamonds are a Girl's best friend'. Its jewels are regularly worn by Hollywood stars and other super rich celebrities. The case continues.","Four men dressed as women entered Harry Winston's Paris store in 2008 .

"A former bank adviser said she helped her fiancé allegedly steal £123,000 from a customer’s account after fraudsters threatened to published naked photos of her online, a court has heard. Aniysah Ali, 25, who was working at Halifax's North Finchley branch in north London, allegedly passed the confidential details to Salim Hussain, 29, and he could plunder Julian Masters’s bank account, along with others. But she claims she only agreed to help her 29-year-old partner after he was threatened by men about the compromising images in the weeks leading up to their wedding. Former bank adviser Aniysah Ali, 25 (pictured), from Southall, says she only helped her fiancé allegedly steal £123,000 from a customer's account to stop fraudsters publishing naked photos of her online . The photos, which Ali had sent in ‘sexts’ to a previous partner, had previously ended up on a Danish porn website, the jury was told. Ali wept in the dock at the Old Bailey as she told how she was deserted by friends and family when the pictures of her posing naked without a headscarf were also added to a fake Facebook profile. She told the jury: ‘The first time the photos were published it took me a long time to get over. Even now I’m not over it. ‘It is a very, very difficult subject. When he told me it was going to happen for a second time it made me even more scared because it would have involved Salim’s family and we would not be able to get married. They would have thought very bad of me.' She added: ‘For me to know he could have been taken away from me at any point because of that, it frightened me, it scared me, and to know that he could have been hurt at the same time.’ The prosecution say there is no evidence that any such threats were made, but Ali said she had no reason to doubt her now ex-husband’s word. Zain Hussain, 28, from Hounslow, west London, is also accused of fraud . ‘I would have believed anything Salim told me. That’s how relationships work,’ she said. Ali claimed it was only after those revelations that she agreed to check Mr Masters’s bank account. The court has previously heard how the information was used to order a new debit card and PIN number, which were used to buy items including cars and jewellery. Ali also allegedly helped to remove blocks on the account when the bank became suspicious of the unusual spending activity. By the time the customer spotted the fraud, £123,000 in spending had already been approved. The bank declined another £114,000. Ali then quit her job at the bank on May 29, 2012, one day before she was arrested at the Wembley branch. In evidence, Ali claimed that receipts for cash payments found in her bag totalling more than £1,500 came from deposits Hussain had made to pay back loans. She later told police her fiancé had been threatened by a man known as Raza Shah and co-defendant, 28-year-old Zain Hussain. Ali told the jury: ‘He told me he was under threat. These people had been violent towards him. ‘There were people that would come to his house, people he would see at cricket and he would also tell me he was getting phone calls to his house. Ali allegedly accessed Mr Masters’s account while in a private interview room at the bank on 16 April 2012, the court heard. She changed the address on the account to one in Southall, west London, and ordered a new debit card and PIN number destined to fall into the hands of the fraudsters, the jury heard. The card was blocked on a number of occasions between 21 April and 5 May 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account. The trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) previously heard how the confidential information was used to order a new debit card and PIN number, which were used to buy items including cars and jewellery . But information gleaned from the account allowed the fraudsters to phone the bank to remove the block, it is alleged. Police found receipts from a local jewellery shop when they searched her Southall home, which she shared with Salim Hussain. Checks at the shop revealed a forged utility bill had been used in conjunction with the debit card to make fraudulent purchases, the jury heard. Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900. Ali and Salim, both of Tentelow Lane, Southall, and Zain Hussain, of The Avenue, Hounslow, west London, all deny fraud by false representation. Ali also denies fraud by abuse of position between 27 March 2012 and 30 May 2012. The trial continues.

"Helen Nicholas has lost her court battle to stay in the military home she has remained living in since her airman husband left . The ex-wife of an RAF squadron leader today lost her human rights court battle to stay in a Ministry of Defence house. Helen Nicholas, 46, had appealed against a High Court ruling that she had to leave the property in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire. If she had won, it would have set a landmark precedent with serious implications for service families and the Armed Forces. But three senior judges unanimously dismissed her case, meaning she must now vacate the three-bedroom house. Lord Justice Lewison, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Pitchford, told in their judgement how Mrs Nicholas and her squadron leader husband Andrew had moved into the property together in May 2005. But when he left in 2007, she  stayed on. The MoD served notice on her and in 2010 won a court order that she had to leave the property. But she still refused to move out claiming the eviction was against her right to family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. Her legal team argued that the move was discriminatory and she would be left on the streets as she would not qualify for local authority help if evicted. But High Court judge Mr Justice Burton rejected her arguments in 2013 and said she had to go. In dismissing her appeal today, Lord Justice Lewison said the squadron leader had no more than a service tenancy, meaning that, once he had left, the MoD was entitled to take back possession. The court heard that the MoD argued that a threat to the security of tenure for service personnel would interfere with military effectiveness, especially if it prevented rapid redeployment of personnel. They claimed it would inhibit them in providing housing for service personnel and require it to rent accommodation locally from the private sector, which would be an unnecessary burden on the public purse. The judges agreed that the MoD had validly terminated her licence to remain in the property, and there was no breach of her human rights. The disputed property - where Mrs Nicholas has lived for nearly 10 years - is in this street in Bushey Heath, near Watford, Hertfordshire .","Helen Nicholas had moved into MoD property with airman husband in 2005 .

'I never expected I'd end up spending this much time in Bali,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm going to be in Bali two-thirds of the time so having a big house is a bit self-indulgent, so we just decided having a smaller place we could just lock up and leave made more sense.

The royals were familiarising themselves with how the unit, which is located some 130km north of the Arctic Circle, functions. The brigade, which trains 1,600 conscripts every year, are responsible for developing Arctic warfare tactics and working with equipment alongside the Swedish and Norwegian Arctic forces. Prince Edward, wearing a rather stylish hat, and the Countess were clearly getting into the spirit of things, despite the sub-zero temperatures.

"A rare letter written by boxing great Muhammad Ali demanding exemption from the Vietnam War draft has emerged for sale for £35,000. Ali was the reigning heavyweight champion of the world when in 1966 was called up to serve in the US army as they waged war against Vietnam. But the 24-year-old prize fighter, who had converted to Islam two years previously, repeatedly refused to enlist on the grounds that his religious beliefs forbade any killing. Heavyweight pricetag: A letter written by boxing legend Muhammad Ali is set to sell for £35,000 at auction . It was a stance that would see the young champion arrested, tried and sentenced to five years in jail in 1967. He was fined $10,000, banned from boxing, stripped of his world title and exiled from the ring for more than three years. Prior to his arrest, Ali wrote to the US army chiefs on August 23, 1966, in a last-ditch attempt to convince them he could not be made to enrol because he was 'a minister of religion'. Ali had initially been called up to serve in 1964 aged 20 but his reading and writing was so poor he failed the qualifying test. Soon after, however, the entry requirements were revised and Ali was classified as eligible for conscription but he flatly refused because war was against the teachings of Islam. In his letter Ali urged General Lewis B. Hershey and Colonel Everette S. Stevenson, directors of the conscription programme, to drop the charges against him claiming it was 'in the national interest'. Knockout blow: Muhammad Ali fighting Britain's Brian London in August 6 1966 at Earl's Court Stadium. The fight was just weeks before Ali wrote the letter saying why he would not serve in Vietnam . Costly correspondence: Ali was fined $10,000 and handed a five-year jail sentence. He was also stripped of his heavyweight title and banned from boxing . Ali wrote: 'I have filed with the Local Board a written request to reopen my classification based on accompanying written information presenting facts not considered by the Local Board or the Appeal Board when I was classified which will prima facie justify a change in my classification to that of IV-D, exempting me from all training and service as a minister of religion. 'This petition is made to you in order to avoid injustice and unnecessary litigation in the courts which would be burdensome to both me and the Selective Service System.' With his letter he submitted 36 pages of 'documentary proof' of his claim, stating the appeal was 'not made for the purpose of delay but in order that justice may be done...' Ultimately, Ali's arguments fell on deaf ears and his application to be made exempt was denied. He was tried, found guilty of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in jail and fined $10,000. Ali appealed the conviction and spent the next three-and-a-half years talking at universities and Muslim gatherings about his anti-war stance. In 1970 the Supreme Court found that Ali qualified for conscientious objector status and his conviction was quashed. Historic: Experts say the six-page letter is the 'most significant Ali document in existence' Later that year Ali returned to boxing and in 1974 he gained his second world title, beating George Foreman in infamous Rumble in the Jungle fight. The signed six-page letter has been described as the most significant document relating to Ali in existence by experts. It is expected to sell for £35,000 when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on behalf of a private collector who bought it in 1997. Prior to the sale it had been on display in the Muhammad Ali Museum in Louisville, Kentucky. A spokesman for the Heritage said: 'It's often said that time heals all wounds, and while the statement is belied by the physical toll Muhammad Ali continues to pay for a decade and a half in the professional prize ring, perhaps no figure in American history has endured such a thorough transformation from pariah to national icon. Ready to fight: Muhammad Ali training at the Territorial Army Gymnasium in White City, West London, the same year as the letter was sent to General Lewis B. Hershey and Colonel Everette S. Stevenson . 'While the brash young fighter earned more than his share of detractors for the vocal self-aggrandisement that characterised his rise from 1960 Olympic gold medallist to heavyweight champion of the world in 1964, his refusal to accept Vietnam War conscription added rocket fuel to that fire, inflaming the nationalistic ire of the Red Scare mainstream. 'At the height of the Cold War and the Civil Rights movement, Muhammad Ali suddenly found himself to be the most reviled American athlete since Jack Johnson. 'No item in the public realm speaks so directly to that transformative period in the life and career of Muhammad Ali as does the presented six-page letter. Gloves off: The famous letter cites other cases in order that 'justice may be done' and demands Ali is not sent to war . Sign off: The document is signed as both Mohammad Ali and Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. followed by the title of Special Field Minister, The Lost Found Nation of Islam . 'Ali's draft status has been reclassified earlier in the year, and his appeal denied, actions that left him eligible for immediate induction. 'The document survives in pristine condition without so much as a storage fold, the onion skin pages likely the Ali camp's personal carbon copy with the mailed copy still housed in government archives. 'As we know, this last attempt for approval of conscientious objector status would fall on deaf ears, and Ali was arrested, found guilty of draft evasion, and stripped of his Heavyweight title, the start of three and a half years of banishment from boxing. Conscientious objector: The three-times heavyweight champion has been plagued by ill health in recent times. His letter is expected to attract much interest when it goes under the hammer in Dallas later this month . 'On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court voted unanimously to reverse Ali's conviction, with this letter serving as the basis for the Court's decision. 'Three years later Ali would regain the Heavyweight title with his historic underdog victory over George Foreman in The Rumble in the Jungle, completing his long and arduous climb back to the pinnacle of the sport. 'This letter is the most significant Ali document in existence.' The auction will take place on February 21.","Ali was world heavyweight champion when he was enlisted in 1966 .

"A woman who fell ill last year during a cruise ravaged by the norovirus made a second attempt at a happy holiday on the sea - only to discover that the ship also carried the bug. Barbara Ferguson from New Jersey was one of 630 passengers who fell ill on the The Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas last January. Ms Ferguson and her husband Edward Petrasovits accepted a voucher for a new cruise as compensation, but found that their new trip was just as ill-fated. Bad luck: Barbara Ferguson was one of 630 passengers who fell ill with norovirus on the a Royal Caribbean cruise last January, and as she went again this year, the new ship was affected too . 'The only reason I went again was because my wife said, ""what are the odds?""' Mr Petrasovits told NBC New York. The couple chose to travel on Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas from Baltimore to the Bahamas last month, set to return to the U.S. yesterday. However, the cruise was cut short as one in ten on the ship fell ill with what cruise officials say is a strain of norovirus. More than 200 people, 193 passengers and nine crew members, became sick during the luxury cruise, but fortunately Ms Ferguson and her husband were spared. She told the news channel that although she did not get sick, the cruise was a 'miserable experience'. What are the odds: After their unlucky trip last year, Ms Ferguson and her husband Edward Petrasovits accepted a voucher for a new cruise as compensation, but hundreds fell ill on the new ship . Ill fated: Nearly 700 people fell ill with the Sydney strain of the norovirus on The Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas last January . 'They were cleaning with a chemical that made me have a sore throat continuously,' Ms Ferguson said. The couple's first Royal Caribbean cruise, when nearly 700 people on board fell ill, was one the largest norovirus outbreaks on a cruise ship in the past 20 years. The Sydney strain of norovirus, which has emerged within the last three years, is not considered unusually dangerous. However, it has quickly become a common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, with symptoms lasting several days. The Explorer of Seas, which was carrying 3,050 passengers, hit the headlines toward the end of January 2014, as hundreds of passengers and crew members fell victim to the stomach bug. Ms Ferguson and her husband have yet again been offered compensation from Royal Caribbean - but say they will not go on a third cruise.","Barbara Ferguson fell ill with norovirus on a cruise last year .

"Local hero: Mubarak Batambuze, 50, who slew a 25t, 1,300lb crocodile after it ate his pregnant wife while she was out fetching water at Lake Kyoga . A man whose wife was dragged away by a 1,300lb crocodile took revenge on the beast by slicing it open with a barbed spear in a fight to the death. Neighbours have hailed Mubarak Batambuze a hero since he slew the 25ft-long monster, which snatched his wife Demeteriya Nabire as she collected water from the lake with friends. The 50-year-old spent an hour and a half in mortal combat with the beast, and puts his victory down to a special weapon he had specially made for the battle. 'I had so much fear in me but what helped me to succeed was the spear,' he told the BBC World Service. Mr Batambuze, a fisherman, was left feeling devastated and powerless after the death of his wife four months ago. She was eight months pregnant when she was snatched, leaving nothing behind for him to remember her. Local media reports say the crocodile was suspected of eating six women and children who had gone to fetch water at the same spot, on the shores of Uganda's Lake Kyoga, but locals had been able to do nothing. Then last month Mr Batambuze, still aching with grief, heard the beast had returned. He decided the time had come for revenge. But first, he needed a weapon. 'I really wanted my revenge, and asked the blacksmith to make me a spear that could kill the crocodile dead,' he said. This spear was no normal weapon. The blacksmith designed it with a barb along one side, so that when plunged into the crocodile's belly it would rip the beast's flesh when pulled back out. Vengeful Mr Batambuze tied a rope to the shaft of the spear then, with a few friends from the village, he went to meet the monster that killed his wife and child. When the group arrived at the water's edge, they found the immense crocodile still there. But when Mr Batambuze's friends saw the size of it they took fright and begged him not to provoke it. Remembering his wife, Mr Batambuze would not stop. He told them: 'I'm not bothered if I die killing this beast. I'm going to take it on with this spear, and I will make sure that it dies.' After instructing his friends to throw stones to distract the crocodile, the widower charged and drove his spear deep into the crocodile's side. Enraged, it tried to bite back, but Mr Batambuze was able to dodge its deadly jaws. 'It turned violent, and then there was so much fear in the place,' he told the BBC. 'But I was so determined, and I wasn't afraid of dying. 'I just wanted it dead, so I put the spear in its side and I pulled the rope. That got the crocodile into trouble.' But even with its belly ripped open, the monster was not ready to lie down and die. Mr Batambuze and his friends spent an hour and a half battling the beast, attacking and retreating, striking and dodging. Finally, it was dead and Mr Batambuze and his victorious crew dragged the crocodile back to their village. Neighbours were shocked at its immense size, he said. Scroll down for video . Monstrous: The crocodile was so big  Mr Batambuze's friends tried to persuade him not to take it on, but remembering his wife and unborn child he charged it with his spear and fought for 90 minutes until it died . Peter Ogwang, a spokesman for Uganda’s Wildlife Authority (UWA), said human bones and clothes were found in the animal’s stomach. 'We believe this was the same animal that killed the woman,' a UWA official told the German press agency, DPA. Wycliffe Ibanda, chairman of Kaliro district, which encompasses Mr Batambuze's village of Kibuye, called on the UWA and the government to compensate Mr Batambuze for the loss of his wife. Speaking to Uganda's New Vision daily paper, he blamed the UWA for not responding to locals' calls for the area's crocodiles to be relocated. But John Opio, a UWA official, said the organisation does not compensate for people killed by crocodiles. He said the UWA was in the process of relocating the crocodiles in the area to the Muchison Falls National Park or Uganda Wildlife Education Centre, Entebbe. But those moves, and the accolades from his neighbours, have come too late for Mr Batambuze, who has never even had a chance to mourn at his wife's grave. 'Within myself I'm a very depressed man,' he said. 'I lost a wife and an unborn child.'","Mubarak Batambuze has been hailed a hero for slaying the 25ft crocodile .

"Juan Cuadrado had come to symbolise a young man with ambition and desire to succeed against the odds long before his £27million transfer to Chelsea. Cuadrado was born in 1988, days before Chelsea were relegated from the top flight, and raised in the port city of Tumaco, in Colombia's south west, which became one of the most dangerous and violent regions of the country as the drug wars forced the coca growers out of more traditional areas. His father Guillermo, who drove a fuel tanker, was shot dead by guerrillas when Juan was five-years-old. In interviews, he said he remembered little about the incident and hid under the bed. Juan Cuadrado joined Chelsea from Fiorentina in a £27million deal on transfer deadline day . The Colombian midfielder moved to Europe with Serie A side Udinese before joining Fiorentina . He was raised by his mother Marcela and they remain inseparable. She has promised to stay with him until he has a family of his own. Marcela and Juan's half-sister Maria Angel moved to Italy when he left Independiente Medellin in 2009 for Udinese, and will follow him to London, along with his girlfriend Melissa Botero. Cuadrado admits he still likes his mother's lentil and chickpea stews and she sometimes braids his hair, which can take hours. They have starred together in a tomato sauce advert in Colombia. Marcela said: 'Seeing his dreams come true has made me the happiest mum in the world.' As a football-mad boy in South America, he idolised Brazilian striker Ronaldo and started out as a striker but had reverted to right-back by the time he had broken into the Medellin team as a teenager. Cuadrado impressed in Brazil as he played a starring role for Colombia in the World Cup . The attacking midfielder playing in the group stages of the World Cup (right) and against Brazil (left) Having failed to make an impression on trial with a second tier team in Argentina, he got his break with a move to Udinese and it was during a season on loan at Lecce where he was able to refine his game and was converted into a wide midfielder or wing-back. He became a key man in the Colombia team and was signed by Fiorentina, where striker Luca Toni dubbed him 'Vespa', because of his knack of zipping through the traffic on the pitch. Fiorentina paid £4.5m for half of Cuadrado's rights, buying the other half during last year's World Cup, where he helped Colombia to the last eight. His transfer to Chelsea was completed on Monday.

"A French journalist who was held by ISIS for ten months has revealed that the British fighters would give 'the harshest' beatings to hostages. Didier Francois, 53, was released in April last year along with three other French journalists after nearly a year in captivity in Syria. Mr Francois has opened up in further detail about his ordeal, revealing that ISIS militants from Britain, known as The Beatles, were the worst of their captors. Scroll down for video . Torture: French journalist Didier Francois, 53, who spent ten months as an ISIS hostage, said British ISIS militants 'gave better food but the harshest beatings' British members of ISIS were more 'extreme', and although they gave the hostages better food than the other jihadists 'the beating was harsher,' he told Christiane Amanpour in an interview with CNN. Mr Francois also spoke of the ISIS militant known as Jihadi John, a man with a British accent who has appeared as executioner in videos showing beheading of hostages. Mr Francois, a war correspondent of Paris-based radio station Europe 1, said he believes him to be guilty of what is portrayed in the videos. 'You can see on the video - he's not somebody you'd like to have to deal with.' As well as speaking of the horrors he endured during his ten months in captivity, Mr Francois revealed that the ISIS militants 'didn't even have the Quran'. Not religious: Didier Francois, seen here with President Francois Hollande, Didier Francois after his return to France, also revealed that his captors 'didn't even have the Qur'an' Murdered: Mr Francois said British ISIS militant Jihadi John, seen here in last week's video allegedly showing the beheading of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, was 'not somebody you'd like to have to deal with' He said that there was never any discussion about the texts of the Quran in the ISIS camp, because the discussions were political, not religious. 'It was more hammering what they were believing than teaching us about the Quran. Because it has nothing to do with the Quran,' he said. Mr Francois has previously spoken about being subjected to numerous mock executions during his ten months in captivity. Speaking in September last year, Mr Francois said that prisoners were threatened with execution 'several times' and IS militants carried out macabre mock crucifixions. Commenting on why the hostages, including Briton David Haines, remained calm even seconds before their deaths, the journalist said: 'They did not realise that this time it was the real thing'. He described the conditions in which all the hostages were held in Syria, as always 'rough and sometimes violent. The French government has denied that a ransom of $18million (£11million) was paid to end their ten-month captivity of Mr Francois and the three other French journalists, but many believe the cash was paid through middlemen, including private companies and Turkish secret agents.","French journalist Didier Francois was held by ISIS for ten months .

"Alex Rodriguez is back on the market. The New York Yankees star has called it quits with wrestler girlfriend Torrie Wilson after three years of dating. This as many close to the couple point to Rodriguez's failure to commit and his close relationship with his ex-wife as a constant source of fighting for the couple. Scroll down for video . Alex Rodriguez and Torrie Wilson (above) have called it quits after three years of dating . Sources claim the couple had been fighting more, especially over Rodriguez's continued close relationship with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis (above) 'Alex and Torrie would fight over his flirtations with other women, and he wasn’t ready to settle down again,' a source told Page Six. Not making things easier for Wilson is the fact that Rodriguez has remained closed with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis ever since their divorce, and the two are often seen out with their two daughters. And while Scurtis is still very much involved in Rodriguez's personal life and business dealings , it seems like a reconciliation is not in the cards any time soon as the psychologist recently became engaged to another man. Rodriguez and Wilson began dating in late 2011,  and, as in many of his past relationships with woman such as Cameron Diaz and Madonna, they were frequently spotted working out together. Prior to Wilson, Rodriguez dated Cameron Diaz (seen above at the Super Bowl) Despite their divorce, Rodriguez and Scurtis are frequently seen with their two daughters . The timing also seems to hint that 39-year-old Rodriguez may want to devote all his time and energy to the upcoming baseball season, with the Yankees needing to fill the huge void created by the retirement of Derek Jetter. Making this season even more important however is the fact that Rodriguez has not played in almost two seasons, going out in 2013 following hip surgery and being suspended for the 2014 season for his involvement with Biogenesis, the Miami clinic that supplied performance enhancing drugs to players. Wilson, 39, is reportedly staying in Los Angeles as she hopes to pursue a career in film.","New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez has called it quits with wrestler girlfriend Torrie Wilson after three years .

'Flat Levi' was with her from her first airplane and limo rides, going through security at the airport to spending time on the beach. Through her cardboard companion, he was with her in spirit. Levi was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder on the Zellweger Spectrum two years ago, which has left him unable to talk or walk, according to WTHR.

Tearful: Maggie's father and sister, Katie, are overwhelmed with emotion as they see her respond to noise . Her mother Joanna excitedly cuts in: 'You can hear my voice? What about your sister?' As Maggie nods a 'yes', the room is filled with ecstatic cries. She was one of the first patients to receive an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) at the UH Case Medical Center. The electronic device, consisting of a microchip, microphone and electrodes, provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf. It is placed in a spot where the spinal cord and lower part the brain meet. The implant will not return hearing to normal in most instances but rather allow patients to detect broad audio cues. Maggie was born with various health complications and doctors gave her just one year to live. Along with being born without hearing, Maggie had a cleft palate, weak kidneys and collapsed lungs. While she managed to overcome many of her early illnesses, Maggie remained deaf. Her entire family learned sign language by the time she was ready to start 'talking' and she attended school with other deaf children.

Last spring, after being turned down twice for cochlear implants, her family received the news that she had been given the go-ahead for a different type of implant previously only approved for adults. She underwent surgery in November and the devices were turned on three days after Christmas. Her mother said her favorite sound was hearing her father call out her name. She returned home to soak in many other noises, including the sound of running water and her dog barking. More than one month on, doctors say Maggie is making progress and the implants have been fine-tuned. She is currently having speech and hearing therapy in a bid to train her brain. The nine-grader's hobbies include dancing and cooking. She hopes to be a pastry chef in the future.

"Pictures claiming to show Samsung's new flagship Galaxy 6 smartphone have revealed it looks a lot like Apple's iPhone 6. The images show a handset with the same curved sides and antenna 'bars' as Apple's flagship phone. The handset is set to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. Scroll down for video . The images, which appear to have been taken in a toilet, show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to Apple's iPhone 6 . The handset is expected to be revealed on March 1st in Barcelona . Super AMOLED 5inch screen . Exynos 7420 processor with eight cores . 3GB of RAM . 20 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapicxel rear camera . New  fingerprint scanner . Heart rate sensor . Loop payment system. 'Everything leads us to believe that the pictures actually reveal  the chassis of the Galaxy S6,' said French site nowhereelse.fr . The site's images, which appear to have been taken in a toilet, show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to Apple's iPhone 6. A second version of Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset, which is expected to have a 5 or 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, will come in a 'special edition' version with the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over Apple, and the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode. Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature an Exynos 7420 processor with eight cores. A 20 megapixel rear camera and 5 megapicxel rear camera have also been claimed, along with a new  fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor and Loop payment system. Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with startup LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones. Samsung has previously allowed NFC payments on certain networks and with partners including Barclaycard, but if it teamed up with LoopPay, the service would be expanded more widely. LoopPay calls itself a ‘wallet solution’ that lets customer pay with their phones and tablets ‘virtually everywhere’. It consists of an app and a device, which is either a fob or a specially-designed phone case. The casing is extremely similar to Apple's iPhone 6, with the same curved edges and antenna bands . The chassis of the phone reveals curved edges and is made of aluminium . Samsung is also believed to be set to start making its own smartphone chips in a bid to move ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars. The firm will not use Qualcomm Inc's processors for the next version of the South Korean technology giant's flagship Galaxy S smartphone, Bloomberg claims, citing unidentified sources. Samsung, the world's No.1 smartphone maker, has been one of the U.S. company's top customers. Apple's On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year’s Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured) HTC’s event begins at 4pm CET (3pm GMT and 10am ET) and its green and blue invitation says: ‘Utopia in progress. Join us to see what’s next.’ Samsung’s invitation is black and features a white line with a curve at the end, with the words ‘what’s next.’ Its event starts at 6.30pm CET (5.30pm GMT and 12.30 ET) and will be streamed live on YouTube. In terms of what will be announced. Rumours suggest HTC will use the event to unveil its next flagship phone, dubbed HTC One M9. It will be the follow up to the One M8, released at last year’s MWC, and leaked specifications suggest it will include the 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen. The leaks also claim the next-generation device will include 3GB of RAM, run the latest version of Android, and feature a 20.7MP rear-facing camera. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it . The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. Previous leaks from BGR said the SM-G925F - the codename used for the Galaxy S6 - will feature a 2560 x 1440 resolution display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16MP rear-facing camera. In December, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Earlier this week, HTC America posted this video on YouTube. It's a rap parody poking fun at Samsung and Apple. Lyrics include: 'More than a few clowns stole what we originated. We own the universe, your Galaxy is overrated', and 'It took you copycats six times to get it right/My One M8 is great, you’ll never touch this light' Meanwhile, Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset could have a curved screen that covers both its sides. The handset is also expected to have a 5.5-inch screen to rival Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge (pictured) was the first to use a curved screen when it was unveiled in Berlin last year . Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple. Apple released it first phablet-style devices in September, and it appears the gamble paid off. During the first quarter of 2015, Apple announced it sold a staggering 74.5 million iPhones in the same quarter - up from 51 million during the same period a year ago. These was the first quarter that the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were on sale. However, sales of iPads dropped by 18 per cent, which knocked Apple's revenue in that sector by 22 per cent. This was the largest year-on-year decrease released by Apple. The decline has been blamed on a dip in tablet popularity in general, as well as the rising popularity of phablets. As phones increase in size, and close the gap between the size of tablet displays, analysts predict fewer people will buy, or need, the two gadgets. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi.","Handset expected to launch on 1 March in Barcelona .

"A wrong turn on a hike led to an innocent pack of Cub Scouts learning a bit more about mother nature than perhaps their leaders intended.

Diane Lekven, who was on the hike told CBS News 8 in San Diego: 'He (the leader) said 'This is a naturalist beach, and my family and I go through here all the time. 'It's not a big deal.I got really angry. 'I was nauseated because I've never seen just a bunch of nude people walking around holding hands, strange people that I don't know,' she said.

"A couple from Texas that unsuccessfully tried to have children for five years were blessed with a set of twins - for the third time. Mark and Kristi Riggs of Prosper recently welcomed Maxim and Slate into the world. The boys already have four siblings: Tatum, Lincoln, Titan and Steel. Scroll down for video . Mark and Kristi Riggs of Prosper, Texas, were surprised to find out they were having twins Maxim and Slate (pictured). The couple already has two sets of twins . Tatum (top left) and Lincoln (top right) holding their younger siblings Titan and Steel. The two sets of twins are about five years apart . Kristi and Mark turned to in vitro fertilization after being told they would never be able to have children . After having difficulty conceiving, Mark and Kristi turned to in vitro fertilization. 'We were told we couldn't get pregnant,' Kristi told NBC 5. After using IVF treatment, they were finally able to have their first set of twins, Tatum and Lincoln. About five years later, they had Titan and Steel. The gender ratio - five boys and one girl - is a little skewed, but Mark and Kristi couldn't be happier. A sample is taken from the couple and a series of embryos are made from the samples to make sure they are healthy. Genetic markers in the embryo indicate whether the baby will be a boy or girl and, as a result, the desired sex will then be implanted into the mother. The remaining embryos are then either frozen for future pregnancies, disposed of or donated to other parents, depending on the wishes of a couple . The process is popular in the US, with one in ten IVF cycles performed now being carried out for gender selection. Kristi said: 'We know that as soon as they get older it will be a lot of fun to have all these kids close in age.' They do admit Maxim and Slate were a bit of a surprise. When Mark found out the newest set of twins, all he could say was 'Huh?' Kristi had a similar response when a nurse told her everything was going to be okay. She said: 'For who? 'All you have to do is deliver. 'I have to take home.' There is at least one drawback to having so many little ones. 'It's about $143 a month in diapers,' Kristi said. During IVF treatment, an embryo is selected (pictured) and then implanted into the mother . A 2012 study found that some couples who previously used IVF to conceive were able to have a baby naturally after the treatment. Researchers found that in some cases the couple had a baby even after an unsuccessful experience with IVF. 'Most infertile couples think that they are unable to conceive spontaneously whereas our study shows (this) remains possible,' Dr. Pénélope Troude at the French national medical research institute, INSERM, told Reuters Health. 'Our results should give hope to couples who have been unsuccessfully treated by IVF,' Troude wrote in the study.","Mark and Kristi Riggs of Prosper recently had sons Maxim and Slate .

"The former Labour mayor who lifted the lid on Ed Miliband’s chaotic campaign to become an MP has claimed his ‘questionable’ personality makes him unsuitable to be Prime Minister. Martin Winter, 52, said he welcomed Mr Miliband into his home for four months in 2005 to try and get him elected as the Labour MP for Doncaster. But he said over those nine and a half weeks he ‘started to see behaviours… which were questionable’. The former Labour mayor said Mr Miliband was not a suitable world leader. Former Labour mayor Martin Winter, 52, said Ed Miliband's ‘questionable’ personality made him unsuitable to be a Prime Minister . Mr Winter, appearing on the BBC’s Daily Politics this morning, brandished the Muslim prayer mat Mr Miliband gave him as a Christmas present to replace a carpet he had accidentally set fire to. He claimed the incident showed the Labour leader did not live in the real world, because ordinary people would know it is offensive to the Muslim community to gift a prayer mat. Mr Miliband has confirmed the former Labour mayor’s account of his chaotic time at Mr Winter’s family home. In a speech in Westminster last week, the Labour leader tried to make light of his habit of getting into scrapes. Jokingly referring to himself as ‘an Islamic arsonist’ and ‘secret Muslim’. He also implied that the former mayor of Doncaster – where Miliband is an MP – is a nonentity. Mr Winter, appearing on the BBC’s Daily Politics this morning, brandished the Muslim prayer mat Mr Miliband gave him as a Christmas present to replace a carpet he had accidentally set fire to . Mr Miliband, at Prime Minister's Questions today, allegedly told Mr Winter that Ed Balls (left) backed a snap General Election in 2007 because ‘the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance' Mr Winter claims the Labour leader’s ‘clueless and arrogant’ behaviour while he lived with his family in the run-up to the 2005 General Election made him lose faith in him. Today he said: ‘I welcomed Ed Miliband into my home. We started to see behaviours in those nine and a half weeks which were questionable.’ He said Mr Miliband confided in him that Gordon Brown should go for an early election because the economy was about to crash. Mr Miliband told Mr Winter that Ed Balls backed a snap General Election in 2007 because ‘the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance of winning an Election’. Mr Winter said: ‘In my front room Ed Miliband stood there and said it was going to happen. All I know is that is what he told me. I’m quite prepared to take a lie-detector test.’ 'Wriggling': Miliband as Labour Party Parliamentary Candidate for Doncaster North in 2005 . But Mr Miliband told a Westminster dinner last week: ‘I kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person – not the head of the World Bank, the IMF, or the governor of the Bank of England, but someone at the epicentre of global finance – the mayor of Doncaster.’ He also made light of the other revelations in Mr Winter’s book ‘Fallout, the man who made Ed Miliband’. The Labour leader said: ‘They [the Mail on Sunday] revealed how I gave Martin a Muslim prayer mat to cover up a singed carpet. ‘I just thought it was what we in the Jewish community call a nice piece of schmutter.’ He said he was going through an ‘Islamic arsonist phase’. But Mr Winter responded: ‘Mr Miliband can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house. In mocking a local political ally he mocks all his supporters and his own town.’ For in nine and half weeks between March and May 2005, when the Winter family took Mr Miliband into their home and orchestrated his election as MP for Doncaster North. In 2002, the former rugby league player stood for election as mayor on an anti-corruption manifesto – and won. He was invited to Downing Street and sat next to Blair at a Cabinet-style summit to reform local government. In March 2005, then Chancellor Gordon Brown asked him to help Ed Miliband, his chief economic adviser, win Doncaster North when the sitting MP fell ill. At a secret meeting in the Treasury, Winter promised Brown he would secure the safe Labour seat for Miliband. During the campaign, Mr Miliband moved in with the Winter family and used their home as his base for his campaign. Mr Miliband won with Winter’s help, going on to become Labour leader five years later. Having been re-elected as mayor, Winter left the Labour Party and then stepped down in 2009 due to renewed infighting and a series of social services scandals in which seven children known to the council died within three years. An Audit Commission report said Labour councillors spent more time ‘pursuing long-term political antagonisms’ than improving services. The book Winter has now written tells how he was recruited by Labour chiefs to end corruption and feuding in Doncaster – and his success in boosting the town’s economic growth with a dynamic regeneration portfolio. The second half tells the story of his falling out with Labour as Winter’s enemies ‘tried to destroy me despite all my loyalty to the party – and to Miliband’. An expert has confirmed that the ‘Christmas present’ Ed Miliband gave to Martin Winter’s partner Carolyne Hunter is a Muslim prayer mat for the elderly or infirm. Abu Atik, who sells prayer mats at the London Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, said it had extra padding to help those who need to protect their knees. Mr Atik said he believed the cotton mat may have been made in Morocco and would cost about £25. For the elderly: An expert last night confirmed that the ‘Christmas present’ Ed Miliband gave to Martin Winter’s partner Carolyne Hunter is a Muslim prayer mat for the elderly or infirm . He said: ‘It is larger and thicker than most prayer mats that I sell. This sort tends to be used by people whose knees hurt if they use thin mats and who need more protection from the ground. ‘It could be used by the elderly, someone with arthritis or someone who was praying on concrete. ‘Like many mats, it can also be used as a decoration, usually to hang on walls.’ The mat given to Mr Winter and Ms Hunter in Christmas wrapping paper measures 2ft 6in by 4ft, a typical prayer mat size. Devout Muslims use the mats to pray in the direction of Mecca five times daily. The mats are an important part of the Muslim emphasis on cleanliness while praying. It is considered very disrespectful to get a prayer mat dirty.","Martin Winter said he welcomed Mr Miliband into his home for four months .

Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez have had their share of squabbles and tantrums over the months as ratings for the show continues to plummet.The View is down 9 percent among its target audience of women ages 25 to 54 and for the first time the CBS's show The Talk outdid the veteran broadcast in the ratings. Ad revenue for the show is down a whopping 29 percent according to The Hollywood Reporter. The drastic makeover of the show did nothing to bring back viewers, says insiders. And executives are looking closely at the co-hosts to make changes. As Daily Mail Online reported exclusively last month, Perez was quietly fired from the show while Perez was busy rehearsing for her role in Larry David's new play Fish in the Dark. But the network did a speedy about-face after getting backlash not just from the public, but also co-host Rosie O'Donnell, who threw a hissy fit and went on air to deny the that Perez was a goner. He's had it: Brian Balthazar calls it quits at The View . 'What the BLEEP,' Rosie said as she was cut off from uttering what was sure to be the f-word. But Rosie Perez was indeed let go, several ABC sources have confirmed to Daily Mail Online. Now, Perez has returned to the show after a source close to ABC executives revealed that the network wanted to avoid 'an Ann Curry situation.' The firing of Ann Curry from Today by NBC executives ultimately reflected poorly on the morning news show. And no sooner did she return than she made a major gaffe on air when she blamed a recent Lifetime biopic on Whitney Houston for her daughter Bobbi's ongoing medical emergency. Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, was found unresponsive in a bathtub on Saturday at her Roswell, Georgia home nearly three years to the day after her famous mother died under similar circumstances. 'Just thought about the movie that came out, and this is no disrespect to Angela Bassett because I love Angela Bassett, but this unauthorized biography of her mom must have killed her,' Rosie said during the show's Hot Topics segment. 'That was terrible phrasing,' the 50-year-old co-host quickly said as she gathered her thoughts. Currently in its eighteenth season, The View, created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show. Party! Confetti appeared to be falling from the ceiling as Rosie made her return .

"An octogenarian  has brought smiles to her loved ones' faces from beyond the grave by joking in her obituary that she passed away while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. Norma Brewer, 83, who penned her own death notice before she passed away on January 27, wrote that she likely died from hypothermia after her dog, Mia, ate her socks and boots. 'Norma Rae Flicker Brewer, a resident of Fairfield, passed away while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro,' read the obituary, which was published in the Connecticut Post. 'One last joke with the world': Norma Brewer, 83, passed away following a stroke last week - but in her obituary she claimed she died at the base came of Mount Kilimanjaro surrounded by her daughter, her dog and cats . 'She never realized her life goal of reaching the summit, but made it to the base camp. Her daughter, Donna, her dog, Mia, and her cats, came along at the last minute. There is suspicion that Mrs. Brewer died from hypothermia, after Mia ate Mrs. Brewer's warm winter boots and socks.' Brewer, who wrote the obituary 11 years ago with a friend, actually passed away after a stroke. Her loved ones said the piece was 'typical' Norma. 'She always had stories, many of which were not true, but thought were funny,' her daughter, Donna Brewer, told the Connecticut Post. 'People who don't know my mother are bemused. People who know my mother are laughing and saying, ""Yeah, that's Norma"".' Loved: Brewer, pictured in her younger years, had a joyous outlook on life, her children said . Remembered: She penned her own obituary 11 years ago and it was printed in the Connecticut Post . The obituary also explains how Brewer, who was the daughter of local newspaper president W. Raymond Flicker, graduated from Marymount College in New York in 1953 before moving throughout the area and having children. Norma Brewers son, Raymond, added that the humorous obituary summed up the way his mother viewed the world: 'While life is serious, it shouldn't be taken all that serious.' 'It was her way of having one last joke with the world,' he said. As well as Donna and Raymond, she leaves behind a sister, three sons and six grandchildren.","Norma Brewer, 83, passed away on January 27 following a stroke .

"Two rogue trader garage bosses have been forced to pay thousands of pounds to customers who were billed for work that was never carried out. Mark Drury and Stuart Phillips, of Car and Van Grimsby Limited, gave motorists inflated invoices for repairs to their cars which were unnecessary and in some cases were not even done. The pair have now been banned from running a company for 10 years, and ordered to repay their ill-gotten gains after they admitted 'misleading commercial practices containing false information'. Prosecutor Kevin Ross told Grimsby Magistrates' Court yesterday that three customers were wrongly charged £1,550, £1,350 and £505 respectively. Banned: Stuart Phillips, left, and Mark Drury, right, ran a fraudulent garage business . In each of the cases, mechanics had told their customers that they needed to repair or replace their gearbox, but never actually did so. They also charged for repairs to brakes, oil and other car parts which were not carried out. The company was sentenced to £15,000 in fines, and told to pay nearly £2,400 in compensation for the bogus invoices. Judge Daniel Curtis told Drury and Phillips: 'Both of you conducted yourselves as company directors with a complete disregard, a blatant disregard, for the trust that hard-working, decent people put in your company to have their vehicles repaired. 'Not only did you provide invoices that were false, you took money from those people, in a way that caused them considerable distress and upset. 'If it had not been for them being sharp and noticing what had not occurred to their vehicles, you would probably have got away with this. I suspect you probably got away with a lot more than is before me.' Phillips, who apparently ran the business, claimed he was not involved in the bogus repairs and did not know what was going on. Bogus: Phillips told a pensioner she needed to spend £1,600 on her car but never carried out the repairs . John Radley, 74, was told he needed a new gearbox even though his car showed no sign of having a problem with its gears. 'He told me a needed a new gearbox and charged me for one,' he said after the case. 'I suspected it had not been done. I had a good look inside, underneath and on top. In my mind, he hadn't changed the gearbox. 'Trading standards got an automotive assessor to come and look at my car. They saw the clutch had been changed but, in their opinion, it didn't need replacing. They agreed that the gearbox had not been changed and neither had the flywheel.' A 67-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said Phillips told her after her vehicle was taken for an MOT: 'It's really bad. It's going to cost £1,600.' She added: 'My husband went grey when he heard about the bill. I thought he was going to collapse. All it failed its MOT on was a bad tyre. 'We knew then we had been done over so we went straight to trading standards. They said they had already got him in their sights. 'I can't think why he could do something like that to people. He could see we weren't young. Would he do it to his own parents?' After the hearing, a spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Council said: 'Our trading standards team investigated after receiving a number of complaints about how the pair had misled customers by charging for motor repairs that had not been carried out.' The company is no longer trading and Phillips has stopped working in the garage business.","Stuart Phillips and Mark Drury ran Car and Van Grimsby Limited .

"Paul Conibeer, who spent 300 days behind bars with the Bali Nine ringleaders, finds it unbearable to think about what his good mates are going through at the dreaded news they will be executed. Conibeer, a New Zealander who has permanent residency in Australia, developed a special bond with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran over the 10 months he spent in Bali's infamous Kerobokan jail until he was released on June 24, 2013. The 46-year-old was instantly embraced and treated like a brother by the reformed drug smugglers and can not imagine having to endure his sentence without their constant love and support. Scroll down for video . Paul Conibeer spent 300 days behind bars with the Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Conibeer developed a special bond with Chan (right) and Sukumaran (left) over the 10 months he spent in Bali's infamous Kerobokan jail until he was released on June 24, 2013 . The pair had already been calling the prison their home for seven years after plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin into Australia a decade ago when Conibeer arrived - but they received the news they had been dreading on Wednesday when the final appeal to spare their lives was rejected by the Indonesian courts. 'Hearing the footsteps at night would frighten the hell out of them - it would be a haunting feeling - how could they sleep properly at night? ' he said of living in the confined cells he knows too well. Conibeer quit his job as a car salesman in 2012 and headed off on a solo three-month overseas adventure which quickly turned into the holiday from hell. The trouble started around August 27 on a night out in Kuta, Bali's popular party district, when he had his wallet and a phone pickpocketed outside a nightclub. When Conibeer explained to the hotel staff that he could not pay his bill they took him to the police station to report the incident when found himself handcuffed. After refusing to pay a bribe, he was locked in a cell at the station where he slept on a tiled floor for 60 days. Following the two months with 13 inmates who didn't speak English, ironically, Conibeer couldn't wait to move into Bali's most notorious jail where he was met by Sukumaran and another Bali Nine member, Matthew Norman. The 46-year-old was instantly embraced and treated like a brother by the reformed drug smugglers . An improvised clothesline at the back of the block that Conibeer was confined to for 10 months . Conibeer can not imagine having to endure his sentence without their constant love and support from the pair . 'They met me at the front door because they had heard through a friend that I was coming,' he said. 'I didn't know what to expect when the big doors opened and they welcomed me straight away saying ""we'll come and get you tomorrow morning and tell you what to do and what not to do''.' It was couple of days later that Conibeer was greeted by a smiling and energetic Chan. 'He gives 100 per cent everyday - I don't know how he does it with a death sentence hanging over his head,' he said. 'He's so full of life - positive is the best way to describe him - he just has this aurora that makes you smile and feel happy.' Conibeer, who has released the book 'I Surivived Kerobokan' about his traumatic ordeal, said Sukumaran is the polar opposite to his best mate. 'Andrew only has one gear which is straight forward while Myu is idle,' Conibeer said. 'I call him The Thinker - he drifts off and can be distant which is fine because you need people to have time by themselves in a place like that.' A makeshift power point made by Conibeer in Bali's most notorious prison . Conibeer with a dried snake skin taken from one of the many reptiles that slide through the cell blocks . The inmate's daily breakfast at the prison dubbed Hotel K in Bali . Helping Sukumaran run the boxing classes was Conibeer's saving grace throughout his imprisonment . Sukumaran and Chan are known for transforming the lives of prisoners at what is dubbed 'Hotel K' including organising boxing, cooking, computer, art and bible classes. Helping Sukumaran run the boxing classes was Conibeer's saving grace throughout his imprisonment. 'I had a lot of respect from the Indonesians I was training,' he said. 'The gang members would rock up to do boxing so that way they weren't as likely to kill me - plus I didn't take drugs or owe anyone money.' He was angered that Sukumaran and Chan were now facing a death sentence despite transforming their lives and remaining sober throughout the past decade. 'How can you put someone on death row when the prison is full of drugs?,' he said. 'It's hypocritical and double standards.' 'I know they don't use (drugs) but lots of Aussies who have been in there have. 'They don't want a reduced sentence - they just want to live.' Conibeer said he was 'gutted' when he heard that their appeal for presidential clemency was denied. 'I was stopped in my tracks and thought ""don't they see what they've done for other inmates?"" he said. Conibeer says it hypocritical that his mates are facing a death sentence when the jail is 'full of drugs' Despite the harsh conditions, Conibeer was conflicted about leaving his good mates behind . It was so difficult to bid farewell to his close mates that in some way Conibeer wanted to remain living in that harsh world without freedom. 'It was the worst - I said goodbye to Myu in the morning and then Andrew walked me to the door in the afternoon,' he said. 'I will never forget the hug Andrew gave me - it was so strong and I really felt that bond between us - all of these emotions were going through me.' He sent a message to Chan about a week ago through a friend of the Bali Nine members who visits them regularly. 'I told him ""I haven't stopped thinking about you and I love you as a mate"" and he replied with ""thanks for your thoughts"".' 'The friend said he was in surprisingly good spirits - that's the type of guy he is.' Conibeer was speechless when asked what he would say if he had the opportunity to say goodbye to his dear friends in person. 'I don't think would be able to get a word out - I would just break down and cry.' Conibeer's account of his time behind bars, I Survived Kerobokan, is available through New Holland Publishers.

"Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has been pictured falling down a set of steps after addressing his adoring supporters at an airport. The 90-year-old President - who has held the position since 1987 - took a tumble as he walked down some steps from a podium where he had been addressing his adoring supporters . He had been talking to the crowd at Harare International Airport, who had gathered to welcome Mugabe back from a trip to Ethiopia - where he had been elected chairman of the 54-state African Nation. He claimed 'no African country' had opposed Zimbabwe's elevation to lead the organisation. Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe, 91, tripped as he came down some podium stairs at the airport . He had been addressing his adoring supporters on his return from an African Union meeting in Ethiopia, where he became the 54-nation organisation's chairman . However, when you are keeping quite as firm a grasp on power as Mugabe, it doesn't do to show any sign of weakness. As a result, some press photographers who captured the fall are claiming they were forced to delete their pictures by security personnel. Mugabe’s spokesman was not immediately available for comment. It is understood the President - who has overseen his once-prosperous nation's steep decline since starting to seize white-owned farms in 2000 - was helped up quickly by aides, before being whisked away in his waiting limousine. He had been welcomed to the airport by cheering supporters, who held placards aloft - one of which said 'Your greatness resonates across Africa and beyond'. But this is a far from widespread sentiment. Photographers who caught the accident claim they were asked to delete their pictures by security personnel . Mugabe, who celebrates his 91st birthday on February 21, has been accused of using widespread violence to win several disputed elections, according to human rights groups. The country suffered hyperinflation until it abandoned its currency for the US dollar in 2009, . However, Mugabe - who, along with his wife Grace, is on the EU blacklist - still has time to take annual vacations every January to Asia, including Singapore where he has visited specialists for check-ups on his eyes, according to Zimbabwean officials.","Zimbabwe's president tripped as he walked down steps at the airport .

"TV legend Valerie Harper has revealed that she's battling incurable brain cancer the only way she knows how – by talking to it. The upbeat 75-year-old tells Daily Mail Online exclusively that doctors have been amazed at how her cancer seems to be ‘going the other way’ and says she’s fighting her condition with alternative medicine and exotic teas. But the ‘Rhoda’ star insists she is not ‘cancer free’ and still has a long road ahead. In January, 2013 doctors gave Harper - beloved for her role as brash New Yorker Rhoda Morgenstern on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spin-off, Rhoda – just three months to live.

A battery of tests revealed she has leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare condition that occurs when cancer cells spread into the fluid-filled membrane surrounding the brain. When asked how she’s tackling the unusual condition, . Speaking to Daily Mail Online at the AARP The Magazine's Movies for Grown-Ups Awards Gala at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Monday night, Harper said: ‘I do imagery and I talk to my cells. And I say listen you guys: “You are killing the host, we can live together but if you keep growing you are out of here, we both are.” I know it's silly. ‘It really is confronting it and seeing why are you here, what are you doing and how can I show the door. 'It is a way of being positive.’ Harper showed no signs of slowing down at the awards ceremony.The brave Emmy Award winning actress looked healthy and happy as usual despite her prognosis. The Rhoda star said: ‘I am not cancer free. The cancer I have, there is no cure as of yet, however my doctors keep looking at the scans - every three months they scan my brain - it's in the lining of the brain and they say Valerie we cannot believe you are going the other way. ‘It is not gone it is there but it is so much less.’ TV legend: Harper starred with Mary Tyler Moore in the show by that name in the 70's and she was so popular producers developed a spin-off of her character Rhoda .

Despite the grim prognosis, her famous positivity hasn’t shifted, she told Daily Mail Online: ‘Cancer is like a bad performer. It goes on tour, no one wants to see them but they keep turning up. It's worse when they go on the road. ‘I am functioning really well. And a lot of what I am experiencing is age.’ She added that keeping the ‘kid’ in her helps a lot. ‘You don’t want to lose the kid all the way, because that is the essential you when you came on the stage of the planet. ‘Staying a kid, or at least be willing to have it be part of you.’ Harper has been married to husband Tony Cacciotti for 25 years, with who she has a daughter. Harper says ‘staying a kid’ or be willing to at least have it be part of you’ is keeping her positive. ‘It’s that I don’t want to die, it’s I want to live,’ she explains. ‘As long as I’m here, every single moment is going to be as good as I can have it be.’","Rhoda star Valerie Harper says she's battling incurable brain cancer the only way she knows how – by talking to it .

"Bruce Jenner has reportedly moved forward his rumoured interview with Diane Sawyer to discuss his planned transition to become a woman. The reality star is said to be readying the one-to-one as early as this weekend after his mother confirmed his transition news to Radar Online. The website has now reported that he is in a hurry to get his own side of the story across to the respected ABC journalist. Scroll down for video . Quick fix: Bruce Jenner has reportedly moved forward his rumoured interview with Diane Sawyer to discuss his planned transition to become a woman . Veteran jouranlist: BuzzFeed reported that Diane Sawyer and ABC News were close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision . 'Bruce will shoot an interview with Diane this weekend to discuss transitioning from male to female,' a source said. 'Bruce realised that there’s no longer any need to wait since the family knows and the public is pretty much aware of what’s going on.' BuzzFeed reported that Sawyer and ABC News were close to securing the first interview during which he will discuss his life-changing decision. Bruce made the formal announcement to his large family last month which was filmed for a docu-series recording his journey from man to woman to be broadcast later this year. The reality show will reportedly air on E!, the NBC Universal cable channel that has broadcast Kardashian-based reality shows since 2007. But not landing the Jenner interview has caused much strife in NBC's news division, reports Buzzfeed, because E!'c corporate sibling would have seemed the more obvious choice. After months of speculation, Jenner's confirmed on Tuesday that her son is undergoing the transition to become a woman. It has been a much-pondered topic in recent months, due to the Keeping Up With The Kardashian star's changing and increasingly feminine appearance. Supportive: Esther Jenner has opened up about her son's impending change . Speaking to RadarOnline, Esther Jenner said: 'I just learned about [his transition]. Bruce filled me in, and we had a very long, long, long talk about it. 'I have never been more proud of Bruce for who he is, himself as a father, as an Olympian, a wonderful public speaker. He instills enthusiasm in people. He's gifted.' She added that she was unaware of his wishes until very recently, but commented further that she is right behind him through his journey. 'I support him whole-heartedly. I just love him like I always have,' she revealed. MailOnline has contacted a representative for Bruce Jenner and is awaiting comment. This isn't the first time the 88-year-old has addressed Bruce's appearance and gender change. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline in November, following his divorce from wife Kris, she said: . 'I love him, no matter what. There's such raunchy publicity all the time. I don't know. I've brought this up to him on the phone when we've talked and he says ""mum you can't believe this stuff"", he said you can't pay any attention to this stuff and I said ""well I want to tell you one thing Bruce, I don't care if what they're putting out is true or false, it's not going to change my love for you"", and it's true that's exactly how I feel, but I don't like it.' She did hold a frank opinion on his long mane of hair though: 'I hate his hair, I tell him it's ugly. That it's ridiculous. 'I just love him like I always have': Bruce has been given the promise of support from his mother ahead of his life-changing gender change . 'I told him on the phone the other day, we were talking about it and I said ""you know Bruce, you just turned 65 and you're wearing you're hair like you're a teenage rebel"". He laughed, just cracked up, he doesn't pay any attention to me. He's always been single-minded and independent.' Previously, it was alleged that Kris Jenner 'freaked out' over his alleged plan to change his gender. TMZ reported that Kris was utterly shocked when Bruce broke the news to his family. People's insider also claimed that not all of Bruce's children knew about his plans until recently: 'There was a lot they didn't know about their dad.' However, as well as being supported by his mum, it appears that he actually has the full support of his entire family over the big change. According to a report from People magazine, all the 65-year-old former Olympian's kids and even ex wife Kris all approve of his choice to live life as a female. Support system: The 65-year-old former Olympian has the full-support of his entire family, according to a Sunday report from People magazine . Keeping his head down: Bruce was pictured making a stop at the gas station over the weekend . Caffeine fix: The reality star also treated himself to a a coffee and a frozen youghurt . A source for the weekly said: 'The number one thing is they all support Bruce. 'Kris has been great and anything that says the opposite just isn't true. It's really a hard adjustment for her and a shock but she 100% supports him – the whole family does.' The former gold medallist's big decision was confirmed by the same publication on Friday as a source claimed: 'Bruce is transitioning to a woman. 'He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he's doing. He's in such a great space. That's why it's the perfect time to do something like this.' Getting on with it: Bruce pumped gas and washed his windshield near his Malibu home . Former flame: It was previously reported that Bruce's ex wife Kris Jenner, 59, 'freaked out' over his choice to live life as a female, as they were pictured together at a boxing event in Santa Monica back in May 2011 . The reality star has been pictured in recent days with manicured nails, smooth legs, longer locks and what appeared to be fuller lips. Stepdaughter Kim hinted at Bruce's transition last week when she told Entertainment Tonight: 'I think everyone goes through things in life, and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' She added: 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him. Of course we support Bruce 100 percent.' Supportive words: Kim hinted at Bruce's transition when she recently told ET that 'he'll share whenever the time is right' 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about, I just think it's his story to talk about, not really mine.' Bruce has six children from his three marriages - daughters Kendall, 19, and Kylie, 17, with Kris Jenner; sons Brandon, 33 and Brody, 31, with ex-wife Linda Thompson; and daughter Cassandra, 34, and son Burt, 36, with ex-wife Chrystie Crownover. And he has four stepchildren from his marriage to Kris: Kourtney, 35, Kim, 34, Khloe, 30, and Rob, 27.

"David Cameron's bid to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU has been ridiculed by Poland's Foreign Secretary in explosive private recordings leaked to the country's media. Radek Sikorski, who was in the infamous Bullingdon Club with Boris Johnson at university in Oxford, accused Mr Cameron of 'incompetence' and 'stupidly' pandering to his eurosceptic backbenchers. He said the Prime Minister had 'f****d up' trying to veto the last European treaty and would fail in his bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Brussels unless they offer Poland a 'mountain of gold'. Scroll down for video . Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford with Boris Johnson. David Cameron was also a member . Mr Cameron's plan to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe has been ridiculed by Mr Sikorski in private remarks secretly recorded and leaked to the press . Radek Sikorski should be one of David Cameron's closest allies in Europe. The Polish Foreign Minister is close to a host of top Tories and has spoken of his admiration for Margaret Thatcher. After moving to Britain in 1980, he went to Oxford University and became a member of the Bullingdon Club at the same time as Boris Johnson - and just a few years before Mr Cameron. The 51 year old and his American wife Anne Applebaum, a journalist turned historian, also send their two sons to Eton. Mr Sikorski is widely admired in Westminster and is being talked up as a possible successor to Baroness Ashton as the EU’s foreign policy chief. He was granted political asylum in Britain after Poland's communist leaders launched a crackdown in 1981. The regime imposed martial law and arrested thousands from the opposition. The future Foreign Minister was even awarded British citizenship in 1987 - but was forced to renounce it in 2006 after becoming Minister of Defence in Poland. Mr Sikorski has led the Polish Foreign Ministry since 2007 and has built up a reputation as a fierce critic of Russia and has consistently led calls for stronger Nato deterrent against Vladimir Putin. He lives with his wife on a palatial farm near Bydgoszcz, one of Poland's most important industrial centers. The white mansion has columns at the front entrance and is surrounded by a park. Among the guests who attended Sikorski's 50th birthday one year ago was the actress Olivia Williams, a former girlfriend who starred in 'Ghostwriter', directed by Roman Polanski. The bombshell remarks were published in Poland after a series of covert recordings of government ministers were leaked to the magazine Wprost. The country's former finance minsiter Jacek Rostowski also predicts that Mr Cameron will lose the next election. He added that Poland will tell the UK to 'f**k off' when Mr Cameron demands an end to freedom of movement rules. In a separate conversation Pawel Gras, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's media spokesperson reveals that Mr Cameron was given a dressing down over attacks on Polish immigrants claiming benefits. Mr Gras: 'The whole thing was stupid. Donald called him at once to discuss it, he had such a go at him, I mean f*** it’s a shame we didn't record it, he had a such a proper f****** go at him. The conversations allegedly took place at some point this Spring. Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said: '[Cameron] thinks he’ll go renegotiate and come back, no Polish government could agree to it. Except in return for a mountain of gold.' The Foreign Minister Mr Sikorski replied: 'It's either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time a kind of incompetence in European affairs. Remember? He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that. 'He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system... his whole strategy of feeding [his critics] scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him. 'He should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate [the sceptics]. But he ceded the field to those that are now embarrassing him.' Mr Rostowski then said: 'For the Polish government to agree, someone will have to give us some mountain of gold. 'The Brits won’t give it to us, and the Germans, in order to keep the Brits on board, won’t give it to us either in all likelihood. 'So the answer will be: f*** off... [the impact of a Brexit] will generally be bad for us, because we would like for Great Britain to stay. 'I think it’ll be the case that [Cameron] will lose the elections. Great Britain will leave. Once they do, they’ll keep open borders. Not for [gypsy] beggars…' The revelations came after it emerged Mr . Cameron was facing a double defeat in Brussels over his bid to reform . the EU, according to leaked EU documents. The Prime Minister is expected to lose his . fight to stop the hardline pro EU candidate Jean-Claude Juncker . becoming the next European Commission president. A vote of EU leaders on . Friday is expected to rubber stamp his appointment. Mr Cameron is fighting against the appointment of  Mr Juncker (right) because of his backing for 'ever closer union' of European states . But in a second setback, it has emerged today that Mr Cameron's plan for a widespread overhaul of Britain's relationship with Brussels has not been included in a list of the EU's 'priorities' for the next five years. Mr Cameron has promised an in-out referendum in 2017 after renegotiating the UK's place in Europe. Key extracts of a conversation between Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski and former finance minister Jacek Rostowski: . Rostowski: [Cameron] thinks he’ll go renegotiate and come back, no Polish  government could agree to it. Except in return for a mountain of gold. Sikorski: It’s either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time a kind of incompetence in European affairs. He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that. He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system... his whole strategy of feeding [his critics] scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him; he should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate [the sceptics]. Rostowski: For the Polish government to agree, someone will have to give us some mountain of gold. The Brits won’t give it to us, and the Germans, in order to keep the Brits on board, won’t give it to us either. So the answer will be f*** off... [the impact of a  British exit] will generally be bad for us, because we would like for Great Britain to stay. I think it’ll be the case that [Cameron] will lose the elections. Great Britain will leave. Once they do, they’ll keep open borders. Not for [gipsy] beggars… . Sikorski: Just like Norway... Enough of this! They’ve f***** up Eastern Europe and a few other things. [Mimics a Brit] If Europe doesn’t reform, it’ll end badly! Let them worry about their economy. If they don’t reorganise themselves, they’ll have as bad an economy as  Germany. How is that so monstrous? Jacek Krawiec – head of Polish fuel giant Orlen – in  a conversation with spin doctor Pawel Gras, referred to a chat between Polish PM Donald Tusk and Cameron about benefits: . Krawiec: What the f*** are they on about with these benefits? [Cameron] seems a really sensible bloke ... when I met him in London he talked a lot of sense. Gras: Thoughtless, probably suggested by [some spin doctor] probably came from some focus group, he didn’t think through the  consequences, the whole thing was stupid, Donald called him at once to discuss it, he had such a go at him, I mean f*** it’s a shame we didn’t record it, he had a such a proper f****** go at him.” Translation: Open Europe . But the Prime Minister was presented with a confidential blueprint of the EU's plans today with no mention of the planned reforms. Mr Cameron held a 'full and frank' talks over the appointment of Mr Junker with European Council chief Herman Van Rompuy in Downing Street today. The Prime Minister spelt out that he is determined to fight 'until the end' against the appointment of Mr Junker. Mr Cameron made clear that if Mr Juncker's name is tabled on Friday, he will demand a vote on his nomination - an unprecedented move in a process which is normally agreed by consensus. Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg Prime Minister, has faced hostile briefing by opponents over his drinking habits . Following their meeting, Mr Cameron wrote on his Twitter feed: 'I had a full and frank discussion with Herman van Rompuy. I told him there must be a vote on Commission president.' Following the 40-minute meeting Number 10 said Mr Van Rompuy had agreed to work through the practicalities of holding a vote after Mr Cameron made clear that he was not prepared to back down, despite facing almost certain defeat. With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, the Prime Minister looks certain to be outvoted under the qualified majority system, and is thought unlikely to secure enough support even to form a blocking minority of four or more member states. This morning Mr Cameron said he will go to Thursday's summit in Brussels 'giving a very clear message that this is a point of principal for Britain and I believe an important point of principal for Europe'. He said: 'The head of the European Commission should be appointed by the properly elected heads of government and heads of state that sit around the European Council table. 'That is a point of principle for me, that is why it is very important that we have a vote, we have a clear expression about this.'","Radek Sikorski recorded lashing out at Cameron's renegotiation strategy .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's distraught father Bobby Brown headed to her bedside today as she continues to battle for her life. The concerned father was seen walking towards Emory University Hospital in Atlanta with his wife Alicia Etheredge and his daughter LaPrincia Brown, 24, on Wednesday morning. Hiding beneath hats, the trio stayed largely silent as they walked towards the facility, where Bobbi Kristina was moved on Monday. It comes days after the 21-year-old aspiring singer was found face-down in a bathtub in her Roswell, Georgia home by her purported husband, Nick Gordon - nearly three years after her mother, Whitney Houston, died after being found in eerily similar circumstances. Fears: Bobby Brown and wife Alicia Etheredge head towards Emory University Hospital on Wednesday morning to visit his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, who was moved to the facility on Monday . Emotional: The 45-year-old singer looked distraught as he walking towards the hospital with his wife . On Wednesday, it emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found on Saturday morning. Police said Gordon attempted to revive her while a friend called 911, and that she was alive when rushed to a hospital. Now Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported. Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website. Bobbi Kristina is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after being moved from North Fulton Hospital on Monday, WXIA reported . She remains in a medically-induced coma and is breathing with the help of a ventilator. During tests for brain activity, she briefly opened her eyes and doctors have found 'minimal' improvement in her brain function, TMZ reported earlier this week. Concerns: His daughter was rushed to hospital on Saturday morning after she was found unconscious . By his side: Brown and Etheredge were joined by Bobby's daughter LaPrincia Brown, 24, on Wednesday . Condition unknown: Bobbi Kristina remains in a medically-induced coma at Emory University Hospital . Heading to her side: The couple, who married in 2012, have remained tight-lipped about Bobbi's condition . Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Bobby Brown has had his own share of drug troubles, including how he admitted to using 'an awful lot' of cocaine after marrying Whitney Houston in 1992. 'I think I was bored,' he previously told VH1's Behind the Music. 'I had just gotten married and things weren't right. Unfortunately, I turned to alcohol and drugs.' He was also previously arrested for drug possession, including in 2002 when he was found carrying marijuana while speeding - just months after he was taken to hospital by his concerned wife and friends. In 2000, he also spent 26 days in a Florida jail for violating probation on a 1996 drunken-driving charge by not submitting to a drug test. Other, more recent troubles have included a 2012 arrest for DUI and a stint in rehab in August of that year for alcohol addiction - before being arrested for another DUI just three months later. In 2013, he served just nine hours behind bars after pleading no contest to suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Battle: Bobbi Kristina was found by her partner Nick Gordon, pictured together in October 2012 . Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . He has remained tight-lipped about Bobbi Kristina's condition, only saying on Monday that the young woman was continuing to fight for her life. But on Tuesday, Bobby Brown spoke out again through his lawyer to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon, who found her in the bathtub on Saturday. Following Houston's death three years ago, Bobbi entered into a relationship with Gordon - a sort-of step-brother after her mother welcomed him into their home when he was 12. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston. Bobby has five children; LaPrincia, 24, is his daughter with Kim Ward, from who he split in 1991. Bobbi Kristina is his only child with Whitney Houston, whom he divorced in 2007.

"A Tory MP has been ordered to repay £1,000 in expenses after claiming more than twice the distance for car journeys. The expenses watchdog found Bob Blackman's did not match up with the distances they researched using Google Maps. In one case a two-mile journey to Harrow Weald had been claimed as 10 miles. The expenses watchdog found Bob Blackman's did not match up with the distances they researched using Google Maps . An investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has found that the Harrow East MP submitted more than 700 'inaccurate' claims. The Ipsa inquiry's provisional findings said today: 'The Compliance Officer has concluded that mileage claims submitted by Mr Blackman are, in almost every instance, not accurate and greater than the distance travelled. This is disputed by Mr Blackman.' Compliance Officer Peter Davis found that Mr Blackman - who now has 15 days to appeal - wrongly submitted claims for travelling from his constituency home to his office, and for going to party political events and canvassing sessions. The report also revealed that Ipsa has been warning him about high mileage claims since 2011. Mr Blackman, pictured in his constituency with Tory party chairman Grant Shapps, faces paying back £1,000 . In October 2011 that year officials wrote to him voicing concern that he was putting in for 'around twice the average for constituency mileage across the UK and some six times higher than other suburban London area constituencies where mileage is claimed'. Ipsa bosses requested an initial investigation by the compliance officer in December 2012, saying he appeared to be hugely over-estimating distances and rounding them to the nearest five miles. 'A comparison of your claims against the distances quoted by Google Maps would suggest a pattern of over-claiming. On average, your claims are almost twice the distance shown on Google Maps and in some cases significantly more,' he was told at the time. Initially the watchdog decided against a formal investigation, choosing instead to deal with the issue through 'support and advice from Ipsa to ensure the MP improved his record-keeping'. But an audit in 2013-14 found that Mr Blackman had again racked up the highest mileage of any MP. He claimed more than 400 miles per square mile of his constituency, almost double that put in for by the next 10 highest-claiming MPs. The compliance officer this time launched a formal probe - but only looked at claims made after his meeting with the MP in January 2013. He found that Mr Blackman had merely reduced his standard claims for regular journey by a single mile - for example, saying he drove 14 miles to Stanmore rather than 15. The compliance officer has made clear that he could now revisit Mr Blackman's claims prior to January 2013 - potentially opening him up to further demands to repay money. An Ipsa statement said: 'Following the results of the provisional findings, and subject to representations received, the compliance officer is considering whether there is a need to review Mr Blackman's mileage claims from before January 2013, the start point for the current investigation.'","Expenses watchdog found Harrow East MP's claims did not match maps .

"There are thousands of public toilets around the world, but finding one - especially when you’re desperate - can prove impossible. Plus, it's increasingly difficult to find one that is in working order and free to use. The Flush Toilet Finder app was created to solve this problem. It uses your phones GPS to find nearby public conveniences around the world that are free, and those that offer disabled access. Scroll down for video . The Flush Toilet Finder app (pictured) uses a global database of 100,000 public toilets, and a phone’s GPS location, to find nearby public conveniences. Users can search for a location and pan the Google Maps to see nearby options, as well as add any public toilets that are missing from the database . It was built by Jake Ruston, 21, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets. Mr Ruston said he created the app in the hope it will be useful for people with conditions such as Crohn’s and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, as well as being popular with tourists and parents. Flush is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets. Users can search for a location and pan the Google Maps to see nearby options. Selecting a toilet provides a list of directions. Alternatively, clicking the Directions button will take a user to the nearest toilet, without the need to search. Users can add public toilets that are missing from the database, and results can be filtered to show those that charge a fee or need a key. App also shows toilets with disabled access. Within the first two weeks of launch, the free app has been downloaded more than 10,000 times. Mr Ruston, who studies at University of East Anglia’s School of Computing Sciences, said: ‘The app accesses your GPS location to locate all the public conveniences in your area. ‘[It] also provides information about whether toilets have disabled access, whether people need to obtain a key for access, and whether the facilities are free or not.’ The 21-year-old got the idea after developing an app for the London Underground. ‘A lot of people were asking me to include details of toilet facilities for London, but I decided to go bigger and design something for the whole world.’ Mr Ruston combined information from several sources in order to successfully provide the necessary data for his users. The app also allows users to add locations of toilets which may not already be listed. It was built by Jake Ruston, 21, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire (pictured). The results can be filtered to show which toilets charge a fee, need a key, or give disabled access. Within the first two weeks of launch, the free app has been downloaded more than 10,000 times on iOS and Android devices . Mr Ruston added: ‘There have been times when I’ve been in other countries such as Germany and I’ve needed to find a toilet, which has been difficult to locate due to obvious language barriers and unfamiliarity with the area. ‘I’ll be listening to user feedback about Flush Toilet Finder and will add what people suggest, so I’m grateful for all of the support users have shown to the app so far.’ The app is now available for free from iOS and Android app stores.","Flush Toilet Finder is based on a global database of 100,000 public toilets .

"Maybe they smoked too much of their own product? Two marijuana traffickers were arrested after they dialed 911 and admitted to possessing 20 pounds of marijuana because they believed they had been discovered by undercover cops - but officers said they didn't have a clue.

"A desperate pensioner who was bombarded by demands from his council to repay benefits they had overpaid him turned himself into a human fireball to end his life. Malcolm Burge, 66, wrote to Newham Borough Council after he received 10 demands for more than £800 he had been mistakenly overpaid in benefits to tell them he could not afford to pay the lump sum and did not understand why he was being asked to repay the cash. In his letters the pensioner told the council he was stressed and depressed and was just 'trying to survive.' But his pleas were ignored and the retired gardener killed himself. Malcolm Burge turned himself into a human fireball after he was received demands from Newham council for £800 he had been mistakenly overpaid in council tax, and had his pleas that he could not afford it ignored . Council officials have admitted they failed to respond to his pleas for help and their letters - sent at a rate of once a month for almost a year - were of an 'inappropriate tone'. In May last year Mr Burge drove himself to the Cheddar Gorge in Somerset and set himself alight in his Skoda Octavia. Teenagers tried to help him by tackling the flames but he died in hospital from 100 per cent second degree burns. Michael Rose, coroner for West Somerset, said: 'This is the tragic tale of a man who lived all his life in the city of London being caught up in the changes of the government benefit system. 'He is a man who clearly needed help but unfortunately Newham Borough Council were unable to give it to him. 'There was no deliberate attempt to avoid payment - he was overwhelmed by such a large sum.' At an inquest into Mr Burge's death, the court heard that the pensioner, who lived alone, had spent much of his life in receipt of state handouts after illnesses forced him to quit his job as a gardener. He had a state and work pension and was entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit but government changes in January 2013 meant his housing allowance was almost halved. Mr Burge was not informed of the changes and a backlog at Newham Borough Council meant his payments were not changed. The pensioner was belatedly informed that the mistake meant he had continued to be paid £89.39 in housing credits instead of £44.79 and as a result owed the council £809.79. Newham Borough Council has admitted the volley of 10 letters sent to Mr Burge had an 'inappropriate tone' In June 2013 he was told a mistake had been made and he would have to pay back more than £800. The pensioner received 10 letters over the next few months until May 2014. He wrote to the council to explain his confusion and that he simply could not repay the money in one go, but received no response. 'I can't remember the last time I had £800 in my possession,' he wrote. 'I'm now more stressed, depressed and suicidal than any of my previous letters. I have no savings or assets. 'I'm not trying to live. I'm trying to survive.' Mr Rose, sitting at Bridgwater, Somerset, added: 'I will be writing to Newham Borough Council to ask them to establish some kind of system to help vulnerable people, like Malcolm, get in touch. 'Unfortunately now some people don't understand that not everyone has iPods and laptops and that some old people, and other people too, just don't understand the internet. 'They're very quick to refer people to their website but not everyone can do that.' In a statement Newham Council admitted that the correspondence with the pensioner had not been handled properly but claimed there was nothing to suggest he was upset by the situation. It said: 'The authorities responded to all of his letters up until the last letter which was closed on the system without a response, this is regrettable. The responses didn't really address his issues and they were not really an appropriate tone. 'I could not find anything in the context of his letters that would have alerted of the author's state of mind.' After the inquest the council added: . A Newham Council spokesperson said: 'We will await the letter from the Coroner, review our ways of working and change how we deliver this service as a result. As the Coroner has acknowledged, Newham Council was under particular pressure in early 2013. This was at a time of huge government benefit changes while the council was also dealing with some of the harshest cuts to local government anywhere in the country. That backlog from 2013 has now been cleared to manageable levels.' Speaking after the inquest, his sister, Carol Higdon said: 'He was a very quiet and proud man. We knew nothing about this until after his death.'

"A startling new photo series by Italian photographer Stefano Schirato has revealed what life is like for Romanian 'webcam girls.' Working in Bucharest these women spend their days stripping inside ready made bed-rooms, draped in lingerie chatting to their anonymous online benefactors. It's a growing industry and little wonder as Stefano, who pictures the women going about their intimate business, reports that they can earn up to £26,000 a month. Amber Rose is a married woman, she's been working as a cam girl for two years after discussing her money options with her husband . One of the women featured, a blonde nicknamed Honey Celine is pictured lounging in one of 15 staged bedrooms operated by company Happy Studios, a keyboard rested at her finger tips. As a former secretary Honey found she could earn very little money in her office job, turning to stripping on camera in November 2013. She says she is a student who uses the money she earns each month to fund her masters. Another performer Amber Gray 24, is married. Similar to Honey she turned to cam work when money became tight for her and her family. Amber has been working for Happy Studios for two years, in the full knowledge of her husband. Honey Celine poses in her small cam room, in the background an ornament can be seen resting on the side . A gallery of the studios shows simple rooms, sparsely decorated with simple duvets, cushions and small pieces of art. In Stefano's photo series one girl, Cameron, is seen smoking during a break from performing. She is a 21-year-old model and student. Stefano reports that she is shy and seems embarrassed by her job, she's been working at the studio for eight months earning less than some of the other performers at $7,000 a month. Inside one of the bedrooms with a red leather-look head board . Stefano catches one girl named Denisa during a performance on her webcam. He notes that she performs as if her audience are in the same room as her, walking around the bed and chatting to her online fans. Denisa is currently earning $15,000 dollars per month but she hopes that one day she will be on the top percentage of earners, taking in $40,000 (£26,000) a month. During her performance Denisa is captured rolling around on a bed spread, a fluffy feather bower sits on the bed behind her as she entertains her audience. In another photograph she is seen dancing around a pole, the Romanian night sky dark outside her window. The Happy Studios performers wear a variety of different outfits in front of the web cam including this spiked pair of heels . In each of the rooms at the Happy Studios there is a camera and a television screen where the models can see themselves . The pictures offer a unique insight into the lives of these women. In one picture of their down time the performers are seen sitting in a lounge like room playing on their phones. Stefano claims that the women seem friendly with one another, they sit and chat among themselves smoking and relaxing. The Happy Studios website reports that they have over 300 women performing for them and they have amassed over 15 years of experience in the industry. Each room in the Happy Studios complex is equipped with a camera and a large screen TV so that the women can see themselves as they perform. The clients pay for each minute they spend talking to the models with the women choosing who they wish to speak to. Whilst the nature of their conversations is often erotic, Happy Studios reports that many punters with to chat about normal things such as movies and books.

"RadioShack is a step closer to closing after the New York Stock Exchange sought to follow up its recent suspension of the company's shares with a delisting from the exchange. The company that introduced the first mass-market personal computer looks set to go out of business  after years of heavy losses. Up to 27,500 jobs are at risk at the beleaguered retailer which thrived through decades of changing home electronics technology. Fading fast: The company that introduced the first mass-market personal computer, is fading after years of heavy losses and the suspension of its shares . Radio silence: This store in Dallas is one of the 5,500 under threat of closure as NYSE suspends shares . The retailer has tried to woo customers with a nostalgia drive, decking out stores with examples of early equipment it once sold. But hope of a turnaround for the Texas company is fading fast as the New York Stock Exchange seeks to delist it after suspending trade of its shares on Monday. Store managers have been instructed to ship big-ticket items to more profitable locations while some of its 5,500 stores continue to close. Half a dozen store managers told The Associated Press that they have been instructed not to talk about the company's dire financial straits. The company received rescue financing from a group of investors led by hedge fund Standard General after a bankruptcy warning in September but its CEO recently admitted it might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay afloat. Analysts say online retailers including Amazon have contributed to RadioShack's decline. 'Every year, RadioShack's core customer grew a year older and new consumers realized they would never set foot in one,' said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. Cut price: A clearance blowout sign is displayed by an entrance of one RadioShack store as the company battles to keep its 94-year history afloat . Closed for business: RadioShack edges closer to oblivion after years of heavy losses . RadioShack spokeswoman Merianne Roth declined to comment. Long known as a destination for batteries and obscure electronic parts, the company has sought to remake itself as a specialist in wireless devices and accessories. In a management shake-up, RadioShack hired Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca and former Treasury Department adviser Harry J. Wilson to help with its turnaround efforts. It worked with popular brands like Beats Audio and redesigned almost half of its U.S. locations — some 2,000 stores — in an effort to entice younger shoppers. But growth in the wireless business is slowing, as more people already have smartphones and see fewer reasons to upgrade their equipment. RadioShack, which has not turned a profit since 2011, still operates nearly 5,500 stores and employs about 27,500 people worldwide, according to its last annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, founded in Boston in 1921, began as a distributor of mail-order ship radios, ham radios and parts. In the 1950s, it entered the high-fidelity business, touting a device called the 'Audio Comparator,' a then-novel switching system that allowed the customer to mix and match components and speakers in the listening room. In 1977, RadioShack started selling the TRS-80, known affectionately by its users as the Trash 80, making the company as important in the microcomputer space as IBM or Apple. Fort Worth financial planner Jay Ellis fondly remembers setting up walkie-talkies from kits sold at RadioShack. 'I think it's a shame. They were the go-to place for electronics parts,' he said. Now, 'it seems to be a mobile phone and remote-control toy store. If they're still selling kits, they're not marketing them very well.'","Shares suspended from New York Stock Exchange after years of losses .

"Nick Gordon sent a string of threatening tweets to Bobbi Kristina Brown's family as he fought with them over Whitney Houston's wealth, they claimed to police. Bobbi Kristina's purported husband was turning her against the family of her mother as he allegedly tried to get his hands on her money, documents obtained by DailyMail.com reveal. At the start of last year, he posted a series of 'terrorist threats', which Marion 'Pat' Houston, who is married to Whitney's brother Gary, believed were directed at her, she told police. Messages that could be the ones referenced in the police report are still visible on his Twitter feed, including: 'I got guns bigger then you. Watch them react to this.' Scroll down for video . Family spat: Nick Gordon and Bobbi Kristina Brown were not happy with Whitney Houston's sister-in-law controlling the late singer's estate and were fighting for more money, according to police documents . Family fallout: Houston's sister-in-law Pat Houston (pictured in 2012) is the executor of Bobbi Kristina's trust fund - but told police she was threatened repeatedly after she refused to increase her allowance . The police report, compiled by Detective Braithwaite, details how Mrs Houston went to her local police department headquarters in Alpharetta, on 21 March, accompanied by her attorney Mark Trigg to complain about the messages. The police report describes a number of 'social network listings of guns and foul language' alleged posted on Twitter by Mr Gordon, which Mrs Houston claimed were direct threats to her. Some messages from the start of the year on his Twitter feed apparently name Pat Houston. 'Everybody got so f****** fake after Mom passed away. Specially Pat,' another read. 'F*** that pat b****' Others, which he wrote after she went to the police station, include: 'Now crawl your head in that noose' and 'It makes you sick when we are happy and I love it'. Mrs Houston, who is the executor of the trust fund Whitney Houston set up to care for her daughter, claimed she was threatened repeatedly after she refused to increase Bobbi's monthly allowance. The police statement read: 'Mr Gordon and Ms Brown are not pleased with Marion controlling Whitney Houston's estate. Fears: Pat Houston went to police just days after Gordon wrote this message on his Twitter page . 'Threats': Gordon wrote these messages around the time Pat Houston secured a protective order against him . Not letting it go: The following month he wrote another message apparently hinting at family trouble . 'Marion informed me that Mr Gordon wants Ms Brown's monthly allowance increased. Marion refused to relinquish the money. 'Marion stated that Mr Gordon has turned Krissy against the family and in the process has said threatening statements to Marion and other family members.' The police statement continued that Bobbi Kristina would be given full access to her mother's $12 million fortune only when she is 35. But the detective dismissed the allegations of 'terrorist threats' and told Bobbi Kristina's aunt that he 'did not see anything on the lines of terrorist threats'. After reviewing Gordon's Twitter posts Detective Braithwaite refused to mount a criminal investigation into Mrs Houston's allegations. His report concludes: 'It was discovered that Mr Gordon has not made any threats of violence towards Marion. Alpharetta Police Detectives will not further investigate this matter.' Still, Pat Houston obtained a court order banning Gordon, 25, from 'approaching within 200 yards' of her, her family, her home or work, calling or sending her letters and 'any other form of contact' from a Fulton County Superior Court judge on April 14th last year. Battle: Bobbi Kristina's husband has turned her against members of her late mother's family, police said. The singer is pictured with her daughter, who is currently battling for her life in hospital, in February 2011 . The 'Default Stalking Twelve-Month Protective Order' - banning Gordon from close contact with Whitney Houston's most trusted family members - is still in effect. It expires on April 13th 2015. This means Nick Gordon cannot be at Bobbi Kristina's bedside at the same time as many of her closest relatives as they visit her at Emory University Hospital. Bobbi Kristina Brown and Nick Gordon claimed they tied the knot in January last year - although her father has since come out to say the couple were never married. 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' said Bobby Brown's lawyer, Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, in a statement on Tuesday. Their reported union had raised eyebrows as they were brought up together as brother and sister in the same house after Whitney Houston took the troubled boy under her wing when he was 12. However, the pair dismissed this criticism insisting they are not blood related and that Gordon was never adopted by Whitney Houston, although he described her as his mother. Gordon has previously been accused of becoming romantically involved with Bobbi Kristina to get closer to Whitney Houston's wealth. But DailyMail.com has learned that it was Bobbi Kristina who pushed the relationship forward. Whitney Houston's troubled daughter has even been accused of 'buying' Nick Gordon's affections, by a close relative. Married? The couple claim they married last year - but Bobbi Kristina's father claims they never wed . 'I told Krissy, ""you can't buy his love"",' Ella Mae Watson, Marion 'Pat' Houston's mother, told DailyMail.com . The 82-year-old explained the troubled young woman had cried on her shoulder about her unrequited love to foster brother Nick Gordon following her mother's death in Los Angeles in 2012. Mrs Watson told DailyMail.com: 'The baby girl was crying on my shoulder about the boy. She said he told her that he loved her as a sister and that was all. 'I told her it didn't matter how many things she gave him she could not buy his love. That was after her mother died.' Mrs Watson was staying with her daughter Pat Houston in Georgia when Bobbi 'Krissy' Brown was discovered unconscious in the bath at her home in Roswell, Georgia, on Saturday morning. She added: 'My daughter (Marion 'Pat' Houston) is up at the hospital. She is with Kristy as is her husband Gary. Everyone is very worried.' Mrs Watson also cast doubt on whether the young couple had formalized their relationship. Gordon and Bobbi Kristina have refused to give details of when and where they married. Vigil: Gordon is pictured outside the Atlanta area hospital where Bobbi Kristina was being treated on Sunday. The 21-year-old was rushed to hospital after Gordon and a friend found her face-down in a bathtub . She said: 'I heard that they got married and then I heard that they had not after all.' The revelations come as it has emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday. Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported. Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website. Bobbi Kristina is now being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after being moved from North Fulton Hospital earlier this week. She remains in a coma.","Nick Gordon threatened Bobbi Kristina's close family members as he tried to get a greater share of Whitney Houston's wealth, they claimed last year .

"China’s first budget airline is poised to lobby industry regulators for permission to install standing-only ‘seats’ on its planes so it can cram more people on board. Shanghai-based Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat, according to China National Radio. It’s not the first time the idea has been floated – Dublin-based Ryanair famously proposed selling standing-only tickets in 2009 to increase passenger traffic and cut costs. China's Spring Airlines wants to install 'vertical seats' on its planes so it can cram more passengers on board . Spring Airlines chairman Wang Zhenghua confirmed to China National Radio that he wants standing-only cabins on his planes and is seeking government approval. The 70-year-old billionaire told the broadcaster that he began exploring the idea in 2008 after a chaotic Chinese New Year travel rush. Customers told China National Radio that they would be hesitant to buy a ticket for a vertical seat out of safety concerns. One told the broadcaster that she fears passengers would be injured when the plane flies through bad weather or is rocked by turbulence. Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares to those who are willing to stand at a vertical seat . Spring Airlines plans to work with manufacturers on a design that would include a safety belt. The low-cost carrier, founded in 2004, offers flights as cheap as £1 ($1.50) and flies to destinations in China, Japan, Thailand and other Asian countries. Even though designs have been proposed and no-frills airlines have expressed interest, the vertical seat concept has not taken off because it hasn’t received approval from authorities. Ryanair abandoned its proposal in 2012 after it was thwarted by an unnamed regulator. The Irish carrier planned to install ten rows of vertical seats on its planes – increasing capacity by about 40 passengers – and charge less than £5 to travellers who were willing to stand. Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use . Italian firm Aviointeriors designed the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys . Last year, Airbus filed a patent for a new seat that is similar to a bicycle saddle that flips up when it is not in use. The design, intended for short-haul flights, would increase capacity for airlines and leave passengers with even less space. In 2010, Italian firm Aviointeriors unveiled its design for the ‘Skyrider’ seat, which was inspired by saddles used by cowboys. In that seat passengers would sit at an angle with just 23in of legroom between them and the seat in front of them – about seven inches less than the average seat pitch on most planes.","Spring Airlines said it would offer cheaper fares for those willing to stand .

"Shock: Harper Collins announced on Tuesday that Harper Lee, pictured here in 2007 at the White House, is publishing a book she set aside some 50 years ago . Harper Lee is blind, deaf and largely confined to a wheelchair, so how did the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird author suddenly okay a new book for publication over 55 years after she wrote it? That's the question on the minds of her neighbors in tiny Monroeville, Alabama and fans alike now that Lee's publisher has revealed they've had zero conversations with her about the mysterious new book Go Set a Watchman. The undoubtedly massive deal was revealed just three months after the death of Lee's fiercely protective attorney sister by her literary agent and sister's successor. That sister, Alice Lee, who died in November at 103, told a reporter before her death that her sister--who had a stroke in 2007--'can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.' Harper publisher Jonathan Burnham acknowledged Tuesday that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with Harper Lee, but communicated through her Monroeville attorney, Tonja Carter, and literary agent Andrew Nurnburg. The publisher says Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird. Burnham said during a telephone interview that he had known both Carter and Nurnburg for years and was 'completely confident' Lee was fully involved in the decision to release the book. 'We've had a great deal of communication with Andrew and Tonja,' said Burnham, adding that Nurnburg had met with her recently and found her 'feisty and in very fine spirits.' But, per the New York Times, Nurnburg also described Lee as 'a bit diffident at first and said, Is this really worth publishing right now?' as she voiced to him her reservations about the new book. In the small Alabama town  Lee made famous with To Kill a Mockingbird, the Southern classic novel can be seen and felt everywhere. Signs in Monroeville are decorated with mockingbirds. The old courthouse, a model for the movie version of the book, is now a museum that sells souvenirs including coffee cups, aprons and Christmas ornaments. A statue in the town square and a mural decorating the side of a building depict characters who inhabited a fictional version of the town Lee called 'Maycomb, Alabama.' Scroll down for videos . After the shock announcement of Lee's new book, her publisher at Harper (headquarter at right) revealed they'd had no direct contact with the author about the deal. The publisher dealt only with the disabled 88-year-old's literary agent Andrew Nurnberg (left with Camilla Duchess of Cornwall) and new attorney Tonja Carter . Harper Lee spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel To Kill a Mockingbird. So, less than three months since the death of her sharp-as-a-tack lifelong confidante sister Alice, should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s? The 88-year-old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007, when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair-bound, nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own. Protector: Harper Lee's older sister Alice ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100, having remained all that time her sister's staunch defender and protector . Lee is now represented by Tonja Carter, who succeeded Alice in the family firm. According to Gawker, 'Lee has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her, apparently sometimes with Carter's advice.' Carter has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by Lee, even once going after a business owner in Lee's beloved hometown of Monroeville, Alabama who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel. Alice Lee, who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight, died last year at the age of 103. With a new Harper Lee book being released just months after her attorney sister  (pictured) Alice's death, some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of Harper Lee--who's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair-bound in 2007--or of someone else . So when it was announced she had another book to be released this summer, Monroeville residents and visitors alike were pleased and excited — but they were also perplexed. The first book centered on small-town attorney Atticus Finch, his children Scout and Jem, and racial injustice in the Jim Crow South. The new book, 'Go Set a Watchman,' is described as a sequel that Lee actually wrote in the 1950s before 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' One of the most beloved novels in history, Lee's original novel has sold over 40 million copies. But it was written after the upcoming book . 'I was really surprised,' said Jillian Schultz, 28, who owns a business in the town square. 'You know there's a lot of controversy about whether Harper Lee actually wrote the (first) book. There's been so many years in between, and you have to wonder, 'How did somebody forget about a book?'' Located halfway between Montgomery and Mobile, Monroeville calls itself the 'Literary Capital of Alabama,' a designation bestowed by the state Legislature in the late 1990s. Besides Lee, the city was home to novelist Truman Capote and Pulitzer Prize-winning editorialist Cynthia Tucker. For years, the town of 6,300 was known as the home of a huge Vanity Fair mill and outlet, but the factory shut down nearly 20 years ago. That left Monroeville with 'Mockingbird' and its literary heritage to attract visitors off the nearest highway, Interstate 65, about 25 miles away. The nonprofit Monroe County Heritage Museum opens the old courthouse to visitors and features a display about Lee's life in her own words. Fans can sit in the courtroom balcony depicted in the Academy Award-winning screen version of the book. Area residents put on a play based on the book each spring, holding the first act of sold-out performances on the courthouse lawn, then taking patrons inside for the climactic courtroom scenes. While visitors are few in shops right now, they'll return once winter is over. 'It will be busy again during the play,' Schultz said. Visitors likely won't see the 88-year-old Lee, who lived in New York for years but now resides in an assisted living center not far from where she grew up. A longtime friend said she is deaf, blind and in poor health, spending much of her time in a wheelchair. She was last seen publicly in November at the funeral of her older sister, Alice Lee, who long represented the author and was known for being protective of her. Mystery: The sudden announcement of a new book from Harper Lee (left in 2007 and right circa 1960) has fans thrilled but confused. The reclusive writer fiercely avoided the spotlight for 55 years but now, aged 88 and in poor health, has signed off on publishing the book from which Mockingbird originally spun off . Some 'Mockingbird' fans encountered in Monroeville on Tuesday said they are excited by the news of a new book. 'I bet it's going to be great. The first one was,' said Judy Turberville, of nearby Frisco City. Turberville said she can't wait to read 'Go Set a Watchman,' which publisher Harper said will be released July 14. Ginger Brookover, who lives in West Virginia, is among the tourists who have been lured to Monroeville by 'Mockingbird.' In the middle of her second trip to town when the publisher announced Lee's new novel, Brookover got goose bumps. 'I'm just absolutely shaking,' she said. Worldwide sales of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' have topped 40 million copies since its release in July 1960. Although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has become a standard for reading clubs and middle and high schools. The movie version of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is the rare adaptation as beloved as its source material. So when Harper Lee and her publisher announced Tuesday that this summer they'll release the 88-year-old author's second book, 'Go Set the Watchmen,' a kind of sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' the shockwaves were felt almost as much in Hollywood as they were in the book world. The movies, after all, love a sequel. And rare is the chance to follow up one of the most iconic American films, half a century later. A new instant classic? Gregory Peck is shown as attorney Atticus Finch, a small-town Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of rape, in a scene from To Kill a Mockingbird . If Lee agrees to sell the movie rights of her new book, it can be expected to be one of the most eagerly sought novels for optioning to the big screen. Particularly since Lee said Tuesday that 'Go Set the Watchman' follows her young heroine, Scout, into adulthood, it's sure to be feverishly pursued by producers. It's likely to spark a bidding war well before it lands on book shelves July 14. Such an opportunity could draw in a host of high-profile producers. Oprah Winfrey, for one, has called 'To Kill a Mockingbird' her favorite book. (In a statement Tuesday, she said: 'I couldn't be happier if my name was Scout.') Starring Gregory Peck and featuring a young Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has regularly been ranked among the greatest American movies. It won three Oscars, including best actor for Peck and best-adapted screenplay for Horton Foote. In 1995, it was added to the National Film Registry, and in 2003 the American Film Institute listed Peck's Atticus Finch as the greatest movie hero of the 20th century. 'Congratulations to Harper Lee,' Duvall staid in a statement Tuesday. 'I am looking forward to reading the book. The film was a pivotal point in my career and we all have been waiting for the second book.' Mary Badham, who was Oscar nominated at age 10 for her performance as Scout, only acted in a handful of films and TV shows after 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' Almost 40 years after her last film, she came out of retirement to appear in the 2005 indie drama 'Our Very Own.' Badham didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday.","New York-based Harper Publishing said they've dealt only with the 88-year-old To Kill a Mockingbird legend's attorney and book agent .

"The tell-all autobiography of Little House On The Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder has emerged as a surprise publishing hit, with readers rushing to snap up the gritty account of pioneer life. First published in November by the tiny South Dakota Historical Society Press, Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography, offers an unvarnished view of life in the Midwest in the 19th century, a marked departure from the bucolic imagery of the beloved Little House series. The not-safe-for-children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey. Scroll down for video . Runaway hit: Readers have been rushing to snap up copies of Laura Ingalls Wilder's no-holds-barred autobiography Pioneer Girl, which hit the shelves in November . Real pioneer girl: A handout photograph shows Little House On The Praire author Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose autobiography depicts an unvarnished view of the 19th century Midwest . Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder . Lane, herself a well-known author, tried and failed to get an edited . version of the autobiography published throughout the early 1930s. The . original rough draft has been preserved at the Laura Ingalls Wilder . Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, for decades but hadn't . been published. The children's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 never presented an entirely romanticized version of life on the prairie - in Little House In The Big Woods, Laura and her sister Mary gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard. But the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that Wilder deemed unsuitable for kids, including much of the time the family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, and Walnut Grove, Minnesota, according to Pamela Smith Hill, a Wilder biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography. 'So you can read Pioneer Girl as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical Ingalls family really lived, what their relationships were and how they experienced the American West,' she said. TV hit: Wilder's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 were adapted for TV in the 1970s. The show ran for nine seasons . Wilder details a scene from her childhood in Burr Oak, in which a neighbor of the Ingalls' pours kerosene throughout his bedroom, sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before Wilder's father - Pa in the children's books - intervenes. Scenes like that make Wilder's memoir sound like it's filled with scandal and mature themes, 'which isn't exactly true either,' according to Amy Lauters, an associate professor of mass media at Minnesota State University-Mankato. 'It's just that that first version was blunt, it was honest. It was full of the everyday sorts of things that we don't care to think about when we think about history,' Lauters said last August. 'And it's certainly not the fantasized version we saw on Little House on the Prairie the television show.' The autobiography preserves Wilder's original rough draft - misspellings, idiosyncrasies and all - but adds extensive annotations. Little House lovers can learn about the three girls that Wilder combined to create the Nellie Olson character, or how extensive the damage was in Minnesota during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s, which forced Pa in On The Banks Of Plum Creek to set out in search of work. 'In some ways, I came to think of the annotations in Pioneer Girl as almost an encyclopedia about Laura Ingalls Wilder's life and work,' Hill said. Hard knock life: Caroline and Charles Ingalls, known as Ma and Pa in the series, had financial problems and bounced from one apartment to the next . Speaking to AFP this week, Nancy Tystad Koupal, the director of the publishing house, said they decided to release Wilder's first draft because it painted an honest picture of American pioneers' hardscrabble life, warts and all. In the TV show, the character of Laura Ingalls Wilder was played by Melissa Gilbert . 'At the time, life was hard. Violence was typical. It was part of the pioneers' life,' Koupal said. The author's large family struggled financially and could not afford to buy a house of their own, forcing them to bounce from one apartment to the next. 'They had to flee in the middle of the night to avoid paying rent,' Koupal said. In another episode from her adventures in the Midwest, Wilder tells about  a sick woman whose drunk husband tried to rape her. The author only escaped by fighting back. Wilder's books were adapted for TV in 1974 by Michael Landon who also starred on the show. It ran for nine seasons, comprising more than 200 episodes. The 'Little House' books and TV show were enjoyed by several generations of Americans readers and viewers, which could explain the unexpected success of the new memoir. With sales being bolstered by news stories and radio segments about the new book, it has climbed up the Amazon bestseller list, and even briefly overtook Chris Kyle's American Sniper for the top spot last week. As of Wednesday afternoon, Wilder's memoir remained at the top of the US History books list and in fifth spot on the overall list of best sellers. Since its publication two months ago, orders for the autobiography have exploded. Manuscript: The original manuscript of Pioneer Girl was written on tablet paper with lead pencil . An initial print-run of 15,000 was sold out within a few weeks. The historical society then placed orders for another 15,000 followed by another 45,000 books. The editor of the book, Pamela Smith Hill, took it upon herself research the events and dates mentioned in Wilder's original manuscript to make sure all of the information was accurate. 'We had to check if her memory was correct,' Koupal said.'It is her autobiography, but she wrote it when she was 60, and sometimes, memory fails.'","Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography is original version of author Laura Ingalls Wilder's memoir .

"She was known as a sex symbol of the 1950s and 1960s. And the home once rented by Brigitte Bardot oozes similar appeal, with 14 bedrooms, landscaped gardens and a sleek pool area. The property in the pretty hilltop town of Peymeinade, on France's exclusive Cote d'Azur, is on the market for a cool £6million. Scroll down for video . The villa once rented by Brigitte Bardot is up for sale for around £6 million, and has 14 suite bedrooms and a jacuzzi with room for 16 . Brigitte Bardot once lived in the luxurious villa located just outside Cannes . Situated just 30 minutes from Cannes, the building is situated in an area steeped in history, and with famous visitors choosing this home as their preferred holiday escape. Offering panoramic vistas and complete privacy, the  stone-built villa, which is divided into two separate buildings, was constructed on a prestigious estate dating back hundreds of years. Draped in foliage, the villa has been carefully and loving restored and renovated. The 450 square-metre property is certainly a good option for a film star. It's location near Cannes, perfect for the annual Film Festival, and its 14 bedrooms - meaning plenty of stars can come and visit - make it an entertainer's dream. The two houses on the property also come with two heated swimming pools, an al-fresco 'summer kitchen', and mature fruit trees. There are even wine-producing vineyards and impressive ancient olive trees for those who are inclined to create their own produce. Estate agents Fine & Country describe the villa as 'paradise found for the discerning modern buyer'. As expected, there is multiple spacious living and entertaining areas, magnificent gardens with panoramic views and plenty of garage space for a fleet of cars. There is also a 16 seater Jacuzzi - perfect for relaxing with a glass of Champagne with friends, and landscaped gardens, complete with ponds, for relaxing in the sunshine in summer. Bardot was born in Paris on September 28, 1934, and after originally starting out with ballet as a child, she soon caught the eye of fashion photographers. The villa has an enchanting feel about it, and gives you an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of a true screen star . The serene swimming pool is perfect for those early morning lengths, or maybe just to relax with a nice glass of fizz . Despite a fairly minimalist look, the bedroom of Brigitte Bardot's old home oozes style and class with a well-matched decor . After success appearing in the likes of Elle Magazine, she was cast in a number of films, but despite her beautiful looks and sex appeal, she rejected overtures to turn her hand to the US film scene, instead starring in French cinema. Just before her 39th birthday, Bardot's career took a very different turn as she announced her retirement from film and became an animal rights activist. In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals and has campaigned for animal rights for many years. The 80-year-old is with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, former adviser of Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the far right party Front National; they have been married since August 16, 1992. She has one son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in 1960 with second husband Jacques Charrier. The dining area looks like it has been plucked straight from a dolls house, the candle chandelier add a real buzz of romanticism to the area . Estate agents describe the villa as 'paradise found for the discerning modern buyer', and it is certainly fit for star treatment . The views from the property are stunning, and with neighbours visible, but not near enough to take away from the privacy of the residence .","The beautiful villa, comprised of two buildings, situated in Peymeinade, Cote d'Azur, 30 minutes from Cannes .

"Despite a grand total of 88 years on the planet, Sir David Attenborough is showing no desire to slow down. Ever passionate and curious about the natural world, it seems there's always more to explore. 'I'm moving much slower than I used to,' the 88-year-old admits, with a smile, speaking exclusively to Mail Online, 'but I've still got a lot to give, and 2015 is as big a year as I can remember.' As 2015 begins, Attenborough is, at first, in reflective mood. The last 12 months have seen him wrap up the BBC's landmark series, Life Story, which engaged the nation in a storytelling version of relationships in the wild. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The 88-year-old is still as curious as ever about the natural world and is showing no sign of slowing down. Here he holds a tiny midwife toad, native to Europe and northwestern Africa, in the palm of his hand . He's also shot specials for the BBC – Attenborough's Birds of Paradise and Attenborough's Big Birds – attracting new audiences by embracing 3D technology. The documentaries mark the latest contribution in a six-decade career that taken him from the British Isles to the depths of the rainforest and beyond. It was in 1954, as BBC2 controller filling in on Zoo Quest, that he stepped onto his first international flight, acting as no more than a stand-in for regular presenter Jack Lester. And the rest, as they say, is history. This year has started with a flutter of press engagements. He has the promotion for two new series, associated DVD releases, charity and ambassadorial commitments, not to mention the sketching out of research plans and narratives for the next burst of natural world programming at the end of 2015. Sir David started presenting in 1954 as a stand-in for the regular presenter of Zoo Quest. This image was taken in the Natural History Museum, while he was promoting the 2014 3D film Natural History Museum Alive . The nature enthusiast is currently filming a series about dinosaurs and fossils in Patagonia, South America. He is posing with the fossil of an invertebrate ammonite, which would have lived 240-65 million years ago . But Attenborough explains that when you get to his age, you're inclined to turn away from any drawn-out plans. 'You simply take it day by day,' he admits. 'Right now, we've got a series in Patagonia that is taking up much of my attention. 'That will keep me going until the summer. It's all about dinosaurs and fossils – that's subject matter you can research until you go mad, should you wish to. It's endless. 'For me it's about enjoying each challenge. I love being busy and love feeling as though I've still got a part to play. I'd never want to stand in the way of someone else coming in and suggesting they take on a few of these projects if they think they can do them better. 'But I keep getting asked to do them, so how would I ever turn such opportunities down? I love the excitement that travel provides – every trip feels like a new adventure… I think that's why we all love travel.' Attenborough is in good shape for his age. His health is the end result of a professional career spent in the great outdoors. He's challenged himself physically over the years – no more so than recently after undergoing heart and knee surgery – yet still comes across as largely invincible. But it turns out he's as flappable as the rest of us. 'I'm terrified of so many things. I'm more likely to get vertigo than in my teens when I was a very enthusiastic and silly rock climber.' Attenborough loves being busy and hates to turn down an opportunity to go on another adventure, but he is concerned that human population growth is having a detrimental effect on animal species . You'd think imbalance and a fear of heights is illogical for a man who has clambered his fair share of mountains. He agrees: 'I ought to be used to it, but when you're hanging 300ft up for an hour or so it's nice to come down.' Sir David gets to see the majesty of the natural world from dizzying heights, but also takes a microscopic look at intricate ecosystems and their inhabitants. In his years, he's seen species decline and come back, ecosystems rejuvenate and destroy themselves, opening up viewers' awareness to conservation issues they never knew existed. Through all this, his views on climate change have solidified. 'The facts are indisputable that the climate is changing,' he says once again. 'And human beings are the cause of it? Of course. It is an undisputable fact. Population growth is detrimental to the planet. End of. 'Having just come back from the Great Barrier Reef, in that place there exists the perfect example of the damage. All the statistics are there. The temperature of the sea is changing, as is its acidity. 'You can see the sea grass visibly changing and the coral are unable to live in these higher temperatures. They won't be able to form coral limestone anymore. You don't need to be a genius to see that.' In his career Attenborough has seen ecosystems rise and fall, and animal species decline then resurface. In his Natural Curiosities series, Attenborough looked at the platypus, which was discovered in the 19th century just before Darwin published his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection . As well as looking at ecosystems from great heights, Sir David has always enjoyed taking a close-up look at their inhabitants. Why certain species have the patterns they do  has intrigued him for years, and in Natural Curiosities he looks into the similarities between the striped markings of the zebra and the morpho butterfly . Sir David predicts that this year travellers will start to appreciate places they find closer to home . ONE: We'll keep on travelling, but we're beginning to appreciate places closer to home that perhaps we may have ignored 10 years ago. TWO: Eco-tourism is set for a big year. Despite conservation challenges there is clearly a growing trend towards green travel experiences. THREE: Technology is going to take travel to another level. My fear though is we're so obsessed with tour guide apps we actually miss what's in front of us! FOUR: If operator margins are being squeezed, the travel experience is in danger of becoming a sales operation. If you are on safari, you should be allowed to be on safari, not sold to at every turn. FIVE: People will continue to want to explore more off the beaten track. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing for our wildlife, to be honest. And on dry land the challenges come just as frequently. 'My job always come back to the animals - I go where they are, not where they aren't. 'But even there the situation is changing. I went to see the deforestation in Borneo recently and, honestly, it hit me hard. 'Because of the need for grazing and land required for the production of palm oil, the natural landscape is being ripped apart. And all this demand is coming from the needs of the global population.' So if mankind's degradation of rainforest environments continues despite huge campaigns of awareness over the past generation, what is the answer? 'The only way we can implement any change to the damage caused to the natural world is by controlling the continued explosion of the human population,' says the broadcaster. 'The Chinese population has benefited from their 'one child' policy - they would be in even greater trouble than they are at the moment if they hadn't been doing that for the past 20 years. 'But the answer is much greater than that, and actually, the right to have children is a fundamental right as a human being. 'The reality is, if we cannot control our yearning to reproduce, eco-tourism might be the only answer we have left in trying to, even partially, arrest this slump in green thinking. 'There are some fantastic initiatives in this area – India, Kenya, Uganda, and even in the UK with some awe-inspiring walking holidays in Scotland and Ireland. 'People needn't think eco-tourism means travelling to far-off lands or protecting obscure species we've never previously heard of. 'The reality is protecting the environment can begin from the moment we leave the house.'

"A former beauty queen fell to her death from a luxury Caribbean hotel after her fiance postponed their lavish wedding. Shakara Taylor, 31, was left ‘distraught’ when her marriage was delayed by ‘the love of her life’ and a few weeks later she plunged from the roof of the eight-storey hotel. She was buried in a white coffin in the wedding dress she had bought for the ceremony she would never attend. Tragedy: Beauty queen Shakara Taylor, 31, fell to her death after her fiance David Ravencroft postponed their wedding . Miss Taylor met her millionaire fiance David Ravenscroft, 52, in her home town of Blackpool, when she worked as a call handler at his telephone sales company. She had been a gala queen in Blackpool and also performed in a Spice Girls tribute act the Naughty But Nice Girls. After a ‘whirlwind romance’, the couple moved to the Cayman Islands where they enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with helicopter flights and expensive meals. They had been together for more than three years when they began planning their wedding. They set the date for July 6, 2013 with an ‘ecstatic’ Miss Taylor flying home to tell her father, Neil, in person. Mr Taylor, 62, said: ‘She was over the moon. I have never seen her that happy. She loved all that girly stuff and had been planning her wedding since she was a little girl. All her friends had started booking flights and everyone was really happy for her.’ The couple were planning a ‘big white wedding’ in an Italian cathedral and Miss Taylor was looking forward to being a ‘princess for the day’. But Mr Ravenscroft told an inquest on the Cayman Islands that in March 2013 he decided to postpone the marriage, saying they should ‘wait and see where we are in six months’ time’. He said she was upset by his decision and although she later calmed down ‘she seemed to be down in the dumps and struggling to deal with it’. Talented: Miss Taylor was also an accomplished dancer - a morris dancing world championship runner up and also a member of a successful Spice Girls tribute band . A few weeks later, in May, she dropped him off at a health club and gave him a hug and kiss goodbye, promising to pick him up later. CCTV footage from the Caribbean Club, which is on the seafront on Grand Cayman, the island where they lived, showed Miss Taylor arriving at the hotel and getting a lift to the seventh floor. Footage taken shortly afterwards showed her body on the ground outside the building. A post-mortem examination found that Miss Taylor died from serious injuries to her head and body sustained in the fall. Queen’s Coroner Eileen Nervik said no one witnessed her fall, with no evidence of anyone else present when she died. Fall: CCTV showed Miss Taylor, who had a history of depression, taking a lift to the top of the five-star Caribbean Club hotel on Grand Cayman . A laptop and iPad belonging to Miss Taylor did not show a suicide note. Medical records confirmed she had a history of mental illness including a period of residential psychiatric care. The inquest heard Mr Ravenscroft only found out after her death that she was bipolar and had twice attempted suicide. Miss Taylor’s records showed clinical depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, an eating disorder and alcohol and drug abuse. A jury delivered an open verdict. Another inquest is to be held in Britain later this year. Miss Taylor spent 15 years with the Crusaders Morris Dancing Club in Blackpool and was runner up at the world championships. More than 400 mourners packed into her local church in Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, in 2013 for her funeral.","Shakara Taylor was upset after David Ravenscroft delayed their wedding .

"A woman was asked to leave a McDonald's in Wisconsin after bringing her pet baby kangaroo into the restaurant. Diana Moyer carried 'Jimmy', who was wrapped in a blanket and tucked in an infant car seat, into the fast food chain last Friday morning. Police Chief John Kreuziger  said a patron phoned citing safety concerns because the animal was inside the hamburger chain. Diana Moyer (above with one of her five kangaroos) from Wisconsin brought her pet, Jimmy, into a McDonald's in Beaver Dam . Jimmy was wrapped in a blanket and tucked in an infant car seat as he was carried into McDonald's last Friday morning, according to police (one of the Moyers' pet kangaroos above) Beaver Dam police officer Rich Dahl said a patron called police citing safety concerns because the animal was inside of the hamburger chain (above) When Beaver Dam police officer Rich Dahl arrived at the scene following the anonymous 11.41am call, Diana explained Jimmy was a service animal to help her cope with emotional distress, and she produced a letter from a doctor. She eventually agreed to leave the restaurant and was not given a ticket, but she did receive a warning. Chief Kreuziger said the caller felt it was not appropriate or safe for the kangaroo to be in the restaurant, according to Wisc News. Diana's husband, Larry, (above) said that Jimmy serves as a therapy pet to his wife while she battles cancer . The Beaver Dam Police Department said it has previously had calls about the Moyers and the exotic animals that they own (above the Moyers' pets at their farm in Columbus) Wanda Haltek, said: 'We are aware a customer called the authorities regarding this incident who then investigated and took the steps to resolve the situation.

Jimmy is the youngest of five kangaroos they have owned for nearly five years, and he is often brought out in public, according to WISN. Larry said that Jimmy serves as a therapy pet for his wife while she battles cancer. They also said their pets do not pose a threat to anyone. The Beaver Dam Police Department said it has previously had calls about the Moyers and the exotic animals that they own, but the animals have been relocated out of the city to avoid problems.

"Colorado has generated so much money from recreational pot taxes that the state is bound by law to pass some of the tax money directly on to residents. Voters legalized marijuana in 2012 on the understanding that revenue raised would go to schools, but a 1992 voter-approved constitutional amendment means some of the $50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate. The amendment requires Colorado to pay back taxpayers when the state collects more than what's permitted by a formula based on inflation and population growth. Over the years, Colorado has issued refunds six times, totaling more than $3.3 billion. Colorado has generated so much money from recreational pot taxes that the state is bound by law to pass some of the tax money directly on to residents . For once Republicans and Democrats are united and say there's no good reason to put pot taxes back into people's pockets, and now state officials are scrambling to figure out how to avoid doling out the money. It may have to be settled by asking Colorado voters, for a third time, to cast a ballot on the issue and exempt pot taxes from the refund requirement. Republicans concede that marijuana is throwing them off their usual position of wanting tax dollars returned to taxpayers. But they also tend to say that marijuana should pay for itself — that general taxes shouldn't pay for things like increased drug education and better training for police officers to identify stoned drivers. 'I think it's appropriate that we keep the money for marijuana that the voters said that we should,' said Republican Senate President Bill Cadman. His party opposes keeping other refunds based on the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights but favors a special ballot question on pot taxes. 'This is a little bit of a different animal. There's a struggle on this one,' said Sen. Kevin Grantham, one of the Republican budget writers. A 1992 voter-approved constitutional amendment means some of the $50 million gathered in taxes in the first year of legalized pot must be given to taxpayers as a rebate . After legalizing marijuana in 2012, Colorado voters returned to the polls the following year and approved a 15 percent excise tax on pot for the schools and an additional 10 percent sales tax for lawmakers to spend. Voters were told those taxes would generate about $70 million in the first year. The state now believes it will rake in about $50 million. But because the economy is improving and other tax collections are growing faster, Colorado is obligated to give back much of what it has collected. Final numbers aren't ready, but the governor's budget writers predict the pot refunds could amount to $30.5 million, or about $7.63 per adult in Colorado. 'It's just absurd,' said Democratic state Sen. Pat Steadman, one of the Legislature's budget writers. The head-scratching extends to Colorado's marijuana industry. Several industry groups actively campaigned for the pot taxes but aren't taking a position on whether to refund them. Refunds could amount to $30.5 million, or about $7.63 per adult in the state, but Republicans and Democrats are united and say there's no good reason to put pot taxes back into people's pockets . Mike Elliott of the Denver-based Marijuana Industry Group said it isn't pushing for lower taxes, but that's an option lawmakers don't seem to be considering. State law doesn't bar lawmakers from cutting taxes without a vote. Lawmakers have a little time to figure out how to proceed. They'll consider pot refunds and a separate refund to taxpayers of about $137 million after receiving final tax estimates that are due in March. When they talk about pot refunds, they'll have to figure out if the money would go to all taxpayers, or just those who bought pot. Previous refunds have generally been paid through income tax returns, but Colorado also has reduced motor vehicle fees or even reduced sales taxes on trucks. Lawmakers seem confident that the refund mechanism won't matter because voters would approve pot taxes a third time if asked. 'This is what the voters want, and if we're going to have (pot), and the constitution says it's legal, we damn well better tax it,' Steadman said.","The legalization of pot generated $50 million in taxes in its first year .

"Standing in Ploshtad Sveta Nedelya – the large square which spreads out at the heart of Sofia – I am momentarily unsure what year it is. Behind me, the Holy Sunday Church is a swarthy slice of the 19th century – an Orthodox temple competing for souls with the 16th century Banya Bashi Mosque, which sits a few doors down. In front, the broad facade of the TZUM department store is an austere reminder of the grim communist Fifties – even as it towers over the archaeological remains of the Roman settlement of Serdica, which are framed beyond glass at my feet. Only when the adjacent metro station bursts into life, disgorging a crowd of commuters, does the 21st century seem to feel present and correct. A church to haunt a million postcards: The magnificent Aleksandar Nevski Cathedral is Sofia's landmark . Bulgaria's capital is rarely anybody's first suggestion for a mini-break. But, easily reached via a three-hour (direct) flight from London, it is deserving of closer attention – not least because few cities wear their past quite as openly as this fascinating little corner of eastern Europe. Just about every dominant power that ever thrived on our home continent – ancient Greeks, road-building Romans, Ottoman Turks, the heavy hand of the Soviet Union – has had its say here at some point. The result is an intriguing cocktail of architectural styles and overlapping eras that is certain to delight more intrepid travellers. Exploring the centre, I soon encounter the Aleksandar Nevski Cathedral. Indeed, it is hard to miss Sofia’s keynote building. It is the sort of dreaming wonder of a church that, were it located in Paris, Rome or Barcelona, would gaze out from a million postcards. In truth, it looks like it has escaped from Moscow – an epic, domed creation that was built between 1878 and 1912, at a time when Bulgaria was in thrall to Tsarist Russia. Its flanks are adorned with mosaics – while its interior, where the aroma of incense hangs thick in the air, is a feast of space. It has a neighbour too, the smaller St Sophia – a humble red-brick pile that, remarkably, has occupied its site since the sixth century. Inside, medieval frescoes supply colour and beauty, saints peering piously at the observer. Unknown quantity: Sofia is one of Europe's most historic cities, but is rarely on the tourist map . Sofia loves its churches – but it also revels in culture. The Sofia City Art Gallery, with its 3500-strong cluster of contemporary works, is a treasure trove. Yet the motherlode is the National Art Gallery. Pitched inside a former royal palace, this is a pleasing place to spend an afternoon, its many paintings hung in high-ceilinged chambers where the affairs of court once played out. The names of the painters whose pieces decorate the walls will not, perhaps, be familiar – but the striking landscapes and rural scenes crafted by Bulgarian luminaries like Anton Mitov and Vera Nedkova are eye-catching nonetheless. Somewhat bizarrely, the National Museum of History is hidden four miles south-west of the centre, in the suburb of Boyana. You need to take a taxi to reach it – but the inconvenience is offset by the collection that awaits. Bulgaria’s full tale is revealed here. The priceless Panagyurishte Treasure – a clutch of gold goblets from the fourth century BC – recalls the days when the area was part of the ancient Greek region of Thrace. Crusader swords and World War weaponry tell military stories of different vintages. And the building regales you with the most dramatic yarn of all. This sturdy block of concrete, with its sweeping staircases and enormous rooms, was used for state events in the Iron Curtain epoch. There is still a distinct whiff of Bond villain’s lair to its angular bulkiness. However, it would be wholly incorrect to say that Sofia exists in some sepia yesteryear. And you do not have to look too closely to see a vibrant, modern city of quiet confidence. Trundling along: A tram rolls past the Tsentralni Halite market hall - where you can find quality wines . There are flashes of the now in the broad Tsentralni Halite. Sofia's main market hall may be a happy relic, dating to 1911, but the picture inside is decidedly up to date – a host of stalls selling organic olive oils and fruity bottles of Bulgaria's increasingly quaffable wines; a small bar where locals discuss the issues of the day over discreet glasses of beer. This image blossoms on Vitosha Bulevard. Sofia's key drag is largely pedestrianised, and when I amble along it in late afternoon, a merry crowd is in evidence – families milling around the shops, worker bees heading for the hive of bars and cafes. It is not quite the Champs Elysées, but it hints at something that Paris cannot match. At the south end, the mountain which gives the avenue its name can be glimpsed between the townhouses – Vitosha, wearing a cap of snow. The ski season at its two resorts – Konjarnika-Vetrovala and Aleko, both roughly half an hour away – usually runs between December and March. Wandering further, I find myself in the leafy lanes to the rear of the National Art Gallery – where the ghosts of the communist decades are firmly exorcised by two splendid options for a night out. With a menu heavy on cocktails and high-end bottles of whisky, Dada Cultural Bar is the sort of trendy watering hole that could comfortably exist in any great global metropolis, a wave of elegant conversation washing over the clientele within. Another piece of the past and present: Sofia's Banya Bashi Mosque is a doughty remnant of Ottoman times . Moskovska 15, meanwhile, is one of the city's undoubted culinary kingpins – a softly lit restaurant of crisp linen, gourmet flair and wine-list expertise. The menu entices with its talk of beef with herb-and-potato purée, and meatballs with pancetta. I choose the former, pairing it with a half-bottle of Bulgarian merlot that is warm and rich – and wonder again why more people do not flit east to sample what is one of Europe's intriguing last secrets. For all the grand visibility of its past, Sofia is a place that is increasingly facing forwards. British Airways (0844 493 0787; www.ba.com) flies to Sofia daily from London Heathrow. Return fares from £136. A three-night break at the five-star Grand Hotel Sofia costs from £495 per person (based on two people sharing), including flights from Heathrow, private transfers and breakfast – through Cox & Kings (020 7873 5000; www.coxandkings.co.uk).","Bulgaria's intriguing capital is one of Europe's less known major cities .

"A former well-respected University of Pittsburgh Medical Center researcher on Wednesday was sentenced to a mandatory life term without possibility of parole in the cyanide killing of his neurologist wife. Robert Ferrante, 66, was convicted in November of first-degree murder in the April 2013 death of 41-year-old Dr. Autumn Klein. Prosecutors said he laced her energy drink with deadly poison. The victim's mother, Lois Klein, said in a statement read in court during sentencing by an assistant prosecutor that the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child. Scroll down for video . Locked away: Dr Robert Ferrante, 66, on Wednesday was sentenced to a mandatory life term without possibility of parole in the cyanide killing of his neurologist wife . Guilty: Ferrante (left) was convicted in November of first-degree murder in the April 2013 death of 41-year-old Dr. Autumn Klein (right) She said, 'The light of our lives has now been extinguished.' The statement went on to say: 'I certainly don't want to give him any credit but he has certainly ruined our lives. All she ever wanted to do was to be able to help people. People all over the world are now losers.' The station WPXI reported Lois Klein and her husband, William, are now caring for their 8-year-old granddaughter, Cianna, in Maryland. Ferrante, who has steadfastly denied poisoning his wife, is expected to file an appeal asking for a new trial. He declined an opportunity to speak in court after learning his fate. Heartbroken: Klein's mother, Lois (pictured in court February 4) said in a statement read during sentencing the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child . Claims of innocence: Ferrante has steadfastly denied poisoning Klein and disputed whether that cyanide caused her death at all . On November 7, 2013, it took jurors 15 hours of deliberations spread over the course of two days to find the medical researcher guilty of first-degree murder. Klein and Ferrante's 8-year-old daughter is now being raised by her maternal grandparents . Allegheny County prosecutors successfully argued during Ferrante's high-profile trial that he deliberately laced his wife's creatine energy drink with cyanide he bought through his lab using a university-issued charge card two days before she fell suddenly ill in late April 2013. Dr Klein died three days later at University of Pittsburg Medical Center, despite doctors' efforts to save her. His lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all, citing three defense experts who said that couldn't be conclusively proved. Ferrante said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on Lou Gehrig's disease, because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab. But prosecutors said Ferrante was a ""master manipulator"" who concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him. Ferrante did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments Klein received or detected by a coroner after her death.","A jury in November found former University of Pittsburgh researcher Robert Ferrante, 66, guilty of killing his wife, Autumn Klein .

"It could be the bedroom of any toddler, with a pink cot in the corner, strewn with teddy bears and a cosy quilt. Elsewhere stacked on shelves are nappies, wet wipes, Sudocrem and baby powder while frilly princess dresses and baby-grows hang in the wardrobe. Yet this is no child's room, it's a pay-per-hour retreat for fully grown adults who love to pretend to be babies. Scroll down for video . Clients of Nursery Thymes can pay £350 for a 12-hour stay sometimes overnight in this oversized cot . Derek Ventham, who dresses up as an adult baby and runs Nursery Thymes with his wife Maxine, was featured in a 2012 Channel 4 documentary called The 15-Stone Babies . Nursery Thymes is run by so-called adult baby Derek Ventham and his wife 'Mummy Maxine', who charge grown adults to regress back to an infant-like state in which they wear nappies, have books read to them and even experience a 'nappy change'. But the pair - who recently moved to Bootle, Liverpool, from Portsmouth where they were attacked and branded 'perverts' by neighbours - insist there's nothing weird about their business. Maxine said: 'It's not portrayed very well normally. We want to get the message out that we are not freaks and perverts and it is just an alternative lifestyle that we really enjoy. That's it. 'It's for people who want to be cared for and it takes them back to a more innocent time when they didn't have to worry about paying bills or mortgages. 'We have people coming from cold countries and hot countries and all over the UK.' Derek and Maxine have catered to those with paraphilic infantilism or adult baby fetishes for 14 years and featured on a Channel 4 documentary called The 15-Stone babies in 2012. People from around the world travel to the adult baby nursery to wear nappies and have them changed . Maxine insisted  many adult babies found their passion after difficult childhoods, like  Derek who made the discovery at the age of seven. Men who share Derek's fetish yearn to be absolved of any of the responsibilities of modern life, and say that the swapping of taxes for toys and commuting for cuddles simply helps them relax. Adult babies can play with soft toys and colourful building blocks or sit in nappies and watch television or eat in specially-sized high chairs. Customers are charged £75 and hour to play with toys, have nap time in adult-size cribs and dress up in nappies. There is also a £25 surplus charge for a nappy change, which can be 'messy'. Staying overnight costs £350 with extra charges for night-time nappy changes. The Nursery Thymes website also offers 'breast suckling' for a £25 charge. 'Mummy' Maxine will care for clients, changing their nappies, reading them stories and conducting bath time . Derek told the Liverpool Echo that the controversial fetish is nothing to do with sex. He said: 'As soon as you mention adult babies, they say ""you're a paedophile"". But it couldn't be further from the truth. We don't want to be with children, we want to be the child. This is my relaxant. Half an hour in a nappy, and my stress is gone.' In fact, Maxine - who says a client once told her she was an 'English geisha' - compares her business to a spa day. 'You go somewhere and someone wraps you in a nice, cosy towel and you have everything done for you. You just relax, you don't have to think about anything, or do anything for that afternoon. She added: 'Yes, I'm changing their nappies and touching an intimate area - but that's where it stops.' She reads her clients stories and oversees bath time, making sure there are lots of bubbles. 'It brings so much happiness to me and them,' she said. But she can't explain what causes adults to get a thrill from pretending to be a small child again. She said: 'It's like any fetish, it's just a part of you and you have a feeling for something and don't know why. Sometimes it relates to things when the client was young and it takes them back to childhood. Childish scawls on a blackboard include phrases like 'Hugs mummy' and  Pooh Bear STINKS . Adult babies can play with soft toys or dress up in frilly pink and white children's outfits . The Nursery Thymes website says, 'Nurserythymes is a safe place. So let your baby side go free and be good or naughty! 'I taylor [sic] your stay to what you want. Play in the nursery or sit and watch Television in the . living room. Wait for your meals sitting in the bright coloured high chair. 'Sleep soundly in the cot with as many soft toy.' The website also says that for Maxine and Daddy: 'Looking after babies is the one thing we enjoy doing most, be it feeding hungry mouths or reading a bedtime story to send our little ones off to sleep. Our goal is to ensure you get the most out of your stay. The pair say 'all kinds of people' use their service including same-sex couples, male and female couples and one client has his personal assistant make the appointments for him. They cater to electricians, doctors and students and have seen a recent growth in clients under 25 as the use of the internet and mobile phones changes the way people can find out about them and get in touch. Derek even offers to pick clients up from the train station for a £5 fee or from the airport for £10. They offer to take British adult babies on trips to Disneyland in Florida to meet other adult babies in America. They have just returned from a trip with an adult baby girl from Liverpool. 'It's just about people who enjoy being cared for and looked after. It's a lovely lifestyle,' said Maxine. Guests can sit in nappies and watch television or eat in adult-sized high chairs . Adults who want to forget the cares of modern life can pay to wear nappies, lie in a cot and play with toys .","Nursery Thymes, Liverpool, is run by Derek and Maxine Ventham .

"The great British public has voted Hull the the least romantic destination in the UK, while the capital city takes the number one spot as the most romantic destination. Nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation chose London as the top location to take a loved one this year, ahead of the Lake District which slipped to second place with 15 per cent of the vote. Taking the crown for most romantic destination, London, beat last year's reigning champion, the Lake District, and other popular locations including Cornwall, the Cotswolds and Edinburgh which also featured in the top 10. London 1, Hull nil: Hull has been voted the UK's least romantic place in a new survey by Hotels.com . The annual Destination Romance Report from Hotels.com reveals that   while London takes the top spot as most romantic UK city, it also comes in third place in the 'least romantic' list. Both the Scottish and Welsh capitals also featured in the top 10 with Edinburgh in fourth place and Cardiff in ninth place. At the other end of the scale Hull was voted by a fifth (19 per cent) of Brits to be the least romantic destination in 2015, rising three spaces from its third position in last year's report and knocking last year's champion, Slough - which no longer features in this year's list at all - from the top spot. I heart St James' Park: London is given the thumbs up as the top place to spend time with loved ones . Second placed: Traditional favourite the Lake District is knocked off the top spot by London this year . Birmingham came in second for the second year in a row with 11 per cent of the vote, while both London and the ballroom capital Blackpool  came in at joint third place. It seems the capital divides opinion, with 18 per cent declaring it the most romantic destination, while 7 per cent send it into the list of the least romantic hotspots. Other new entries in this year's least romantic report included Leicester, Glasgow and Coventry who all featured in fifth place with 4 per cent of the nation's vote. Birmingham is voted the second least romantic place - again - by those who took part in the annual study . 1 London                                                18% . 2 Lake District                                        15% . 3 Cornwall                                                7% . 4= Cotswolds                                            6% . 4= Edinburgh                                            6% . 6 Stratford-Upon-Avon                             5% . 7= York (new entry)                                  4% . 7= Devon (new entry)                               3% . 9= Bristol (new entry)                                2% . 9= Cardiff (new entry)                               2% . 1 Hull                                                        19% . 2 Birmingham                                           11% . 3= London                                                  7% . 3= Blackpool                                              7% . 5= Leicester (new entry)                             4% . 5= Glasgow (new entry)                             4% . 5= Coventry (new entry)                             4% . 8= Swansea (new entry)                            3% . 8= Liverpool (new entry)                            3% . 8= Sheffield (new entry)                             3% . 'With numerous new cities now featuring in both our lists, it is clear that those who previously held the top spot are working hard to prove they can be romantic too,' said Caroline Annand of Hotels.com. 'Last year's number one least romantic city, Slough, has been able to avoid the top ten list altogether this year - other locations need to show that romance can be found in the most unlikely of places as well.'","Almost a fifth of those who voted picked Hull as least romantic place .
