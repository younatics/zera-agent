"All 20 Premier League clubs have banded together for the first time to support the Tickets for Troops campaign which provides free match day passes to members of the Armed Forces. Free tickets have been offered to some soldiers to all of the November 8 and 9 top flight fixtures to mark Remembrance Weekend. Matches include Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunderland v Everton, Liverpool v Chelsea, Tottenham v Stoke and Swansea v Arsenal. While Premier League clubs have backed the initiative since Tickets for Troops launched in 2009, this is the first time all jumped on board in support. John Terry (second left) and Gary Cahill (right) stand with soldiers in support of Tickets for Troops . Premier League clubs held a minute's silence a week early at the weekend ahead of Remembrance Weekend . This year marks a particularly special landmark with the centenary of the First World War being  commemorated. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'This is a very significant year in the history of our nation and football has had a prominent part in wartime, whether it was supporters and players volunteering to fight for their country or the famous football matches played in the trenches by soldiers from both sides during the Christmas Truce in 1914.' Tickets For Troops forms part of the Premier League's Football Remembers celebrations, which also include an Under 12s Christmas Truce tournament in Ypres, a permanent memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum and other events bringing together football fans to honour the history of 1914. Chelsea captain John Terry is a longtime supporter of Tickets For Troops and commended all clubs for getting involved. Military personnel carry giant poppies on The King Power Stadium on November 1 - Remembrance Sunday this year is this weekend and every Premier League club has given tickets to Armed Forces members . 'At Chelsea we have been providing 50 tickets for every home game at the Bridge for five years and although it's a very simple gesture it goes some way to showing our admiration and respect for these incredibly brave men and women,' Terry said. 'These amazing people serve our country and give us the opportunity to live our lives the way we do today, they are true heroes.' Lord Marland, Chairman of Tickets For Troops, was delighted to see all clubs joining the initiative in 'this very special year'. 'Their generosity recognises the sacrifices and courage of all those men and women who work on our behalf and make us so proud,' Lord Marland said. Premier League clubs will have combined to give away more than 5,000 tickets this season by the end of the weekend, about a quarter of the 20,000 Tickets For Troops given out since 2009. The charity has given out more than 600,000 tickets to its 140,000 registered members of the military to a range of sports.","Premier League clubs have supported Tickets for Troops since 2009 .

"A Muslim woman is suing an Ohio jail for forcing her to attend a Christian prayer service while behind bars. Sakeena Majeed, 24, was locked up in Cuyahoga County Corrections Center for 60 days in April after having an altercation with a police officer in Cleveland. She claims that corrections officers made her go to the prayer meets every Friday that were held by a baptist minister. They threatened to put her in solitary confinement if she didn't go, The L.A. Times reported. Violated: Sakeena Majeed, 24, claims an officer at Cuyahoga County Corrections Center threatened her with solitary confinement when she refused to attend the jail's weekly Christian prayer service, which were led by a Baptist minister . Majeed says she told the officers numerous times that she was a practicing Muslim. She also claims that they 'openly chastised and mocked' her beliefs. The jail holds about 50 inmates, who are kept in 'pods', not cells. The inmates are free to travel through certain parts of the jail. Majeed's lawyer, Matthew Besser, said he is investigating the jail's policies, what acitivites are considered mandatory, and why. 'At this point, it’s too early to know exactly how widespread the practice is, and has been, and whether it had occurred in other portions of the jail,' Besser told the Los Angeles Times. 'The only evidence I have here is that it occurred in the trustee pod. 'Our understanding is all the inmates in the pod were forced to go, some were willing and happy to go, and others less so.' Scene: Majeed was held in Cuyahoga County Corrections Center for 60 days in April after having an altercation with a police officer in Cleveland . Majeed is seeking unspecified damages. The lawsuit says her constitutional rights were violated. Majeed had pleaded pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after having an argument with a police officer.

Beautiful baby: Bathtime takes hours to make sure she is comfortable . 'A clothing tag or rough fabric or even me picking her up under her arm can cause blisters,' Kristi told KCRA. 'I can't hold her hand because it's constantly bandaged. There is no skin-to-skin contact.' Not only that, but Kristi also has to use a blanket just to lift her young daughter. What's worse, there is still no known cure for this condition. 'It's so rare there's not a whole lot of awareness and therefore not a whole lot of money,' explained Jason. Loving parents: Jason and Kristi Kinkle (above) spend hours wrapping Kiira's feet and hands every day . Educating: Now, the family is trying to raise awareness about Kiira's condition .

"The Royal Family are famed for their love of horses – and it’s never too early to give the latest arrival his first taste of life in the saddle. So Santa is bringing two-year-old Prince George his own special mount for Christmas – a rocking horse. The gift is believed to be from the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents Carole and Michael Middleton – and is thought to come with an unusual twist... zebra stripes. Scroll down for video . Riding high: Santa is bringing two-year-old Prince George, above, his own rocking horse for Christmas . Hand-carved: This rocking zebra comes with a price tag of £4,650 - but the Middletons couldn't resist . The hand-carved toy is sure to earn the approval of George’s father, who campaigns to protect wildlife. And though the price tag of £4,650 might make some bridle, Mrs Middleton couldn’t resist. ‘A rocking horse has been on the Christmas list for some time,’ a source close to William and Kate said. Mrs Middleton is said to have spotted the unusual toy at a country fair. ‘Carole saw it, absolutely loved it and called up to make some enquiries,’ a source said. The eye-catching toy is made by a family firm Stevenson Brothers, of Ashford in Kent. It can be purchased through a number of select London stores including Harrods and Dragons of Walton Street. A spokesman for Stevenson Brothers said that they did not know whether an order had been placed by the Middletons. Christmas treat: It is understood William and Kate have bought George a Brio Deluxe Railway Set, pictured . Retro: The Prince's parents are also understood to be considering buying him this ride-on car by Oskar&Catie . It’s understood that William and Kate have bought George a Brio Deluxe Railway Set, which includes trains, a track, figures and some scenery. Sets start from about £40 and can cost up to £200. Bedtime story: Prince George is expected to receive Happy Hooves Oh! Oh! Oh! by Anna Bogie . ‘William and Kate love traditional toys and George loves toy trains, he is mad about them, so he is getting one of those too,’ said the source. The Prince’s parents are also understood to be considering buying George a retro-style ride-on car by Oskar&Catie costing £85. And he is also expected to receive Happy Hooves Oh! Oh! Oh! by Anna Bogie, a charming illustrated book about animals preparing for Christmas. William and Kate read to Prince George at bedtime and one of their favourite stories is said to be the first in this series, called Happy Hooves, Ta Dah! Other gifts for the young Prince include a bespoke tree house for the grounds of the Cambridges’ new home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk. They will be celebrating their first Christmas there, and Kate is said to have put a huge effort into decorating George’s nursery. Those hoping to see Prince George when the Royals go to church at Sandringham on Christmas Day will be disappointed, as William and Kate plan to leave him at home.

"Many are blaming the murder of two New York City cops on Saturday afternoon on Mayor Bill de Blasio following his recent support for protesters in the city marching in opposition to a grand jury's decision to not indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner. Hundreds have taken to social media to say that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' and should 'be charged with murder' after the two men were killed 'execution style' in Brooklyn. What's more, many feel that de Blasio should not attend the officers' funerals, this after many members of the NYPD signed a petition asking that the Mayor not attend their service should they be killed in the line of duty in light of his recent actions. This as hundreds of NYPD members turned their backs on de Blasio as he entered a news conference Saturday afternoon. These same officers later lined the streets outside the Woodhull medical Center and silently saluted as the bodies of the two slain officers were taken away. Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said in a statement; 'That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the Mayor.' Mayor de Blasio responded to this, saying in a statement; 'It's unfortunate that in a time of great tragedy, some would resort to the irresponsible, overheated rhetoric that angers and divides people.' Scroll down for video . Attacked: many are blaming the murder of two police officers in new York City on Saturday on Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) Playing a role: Many are also attacking President Obama (above) for what happened in Brooklyn as well . Strong words: A former NYPD detective attacked Al Sharpton (above) saying, 'I guess Al Sharpton got what he wanted' Turn around: Hundreds of members of NYPD turned their back on Mayor de Blasio as he entered a news conference on Saturday . Harry Houck, a retired NYPD detective, went on CNN to attack both de Blasio and Al Sharpton. 'I guess Al Sharpton got what he wanted,' said Houck of the civil rights leader. Houck then attacked the Mayor for not supporting the leadership in the police department, saying that he should not show up at the funeral or these two officers. Furthermore, he said Saturday's killings were inevitable as the protesters wanted to 'take out a cop for Eric Garner.' He then added, 'I've been waiting for something like this to happen.' Houck later said that he believed police morale was the lowest he had ever seen it in 30 years. Tragedy: Rafael Ramos (left) and Wenjian Liu (right) were murdered in the line of duty . Twitter was even more brutal, with one man, Cole Phelps, writing; 'Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Barack Obama, Bill De Blasio & Eric Holder should be CHARGED with the MURDER of both #NYPD Officer's.' Twitter user Day of the Eagle wrote; 'I think one could rightfully say that #DeBlasio has blood on his hands now. 2 Cops shot.' Some have even gone as far as to say that members of NYPD should not report to work until Mayor de Blasio resigns. Many are also saying that the 'protesters got what they wanted.' Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik told Newsmax; 'De Blasio, Sharpton and all those who encouraged this anti-cop, racist mentality all have blood on their hands.' He later said; 'The lawless have been encouraged by the Mayor.' Former New York Governor George Pataki also came out against de Blasio and Holder, saying; 'Sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio. #NYPD' Difficult day: A police officer pauses as he listens to New York City Police Commissioner William J. Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio at a news conference at Woodhull Hospital . 28-year-old shooter Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley from Baltimore, shot his girlfriend on Saturday morning before targeting the two cops, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, in Brooklyn. A Move On petition demanding that Mayor de Blasio resign already has thousands of signatures. 'Today, Saturday December 20th 2014, 5 days before Christmas, 2 NYPD officers were shot and killed in their cruiser for no apparent reason.With the recent news surrounding the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies around the country, our mayor blasted his own police department by throwing them under the bus,' reads the petition. 'His words and actions on the subject matter of late have to be held accountable. He is unfit to lead this city. He is unfit to have a relationship with his police department for his remaining tenure and he should be taken out of office IMMEDIATELY, with proper protocol to be followed to name a replacement before a special election.' Stand and salute: New York Fire Department personnel salute as an ambulance and motorcade carrying one of the two New York Police officers who were shot dead passes by a New York Fire Department honor guard . Sharpton released a statement shortly after the murders, writing; 'I have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today. 'Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases. 'We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown. 'We have been criticized at National Action Network for not allowing rhetoric or chanting of violence and would abruptly denounce it at all of our gatherings. 'The Garner family and I have always stressed that we do not believe that all police are bad, In fact we have stressed that most police are not bad. 'We plan to hold a press conference in the morning to express our outrage and our condolences to the families and the police department.' Emotional: A police officer wipes tears away from his face as he walks away from the scene of Saturday's shooting . This all comes just one week after police union president Pat Lynch called out Mayor de Blasio at a private meeting. The New York Post reports that Lynch said; 'He is not running the City of New York. He thinks he’s running a f**king revolution.' He then added; 'If we won’t get support when we do our jobs . . . then we’re going to do it the way they want it.' New York State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis also called out Mayor de Blasio following Saturday's shooting, saying in a statement; 'It is well past the time for our mayor and citywide leaders to call for a return to order in our streets, and take a hard stance that that lawlessness and aggression towards police officers will not be tolerated.'","Hundreds are attacking Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Barack Obama and Al Sharpton after the murder of two police officers in Brooklyn on Saturday .

"Luis Suarez finally broke his La Liga duck as Barcelona routed Cordoba, closing the gap on leaders Real Madrid to just one point. Although the Uruguayan was delighted to end his eight-game goalless streak in the competition, it was strike partner Pedro that took the plaudits, bagging the first and then playing in Suarez for his goal. Lionel Messi was having a quiet game but had the final say with two late goals to add gloss to the scoreline, after Gerard Pique had nodded in the third, providing a sweet end to what had been a bitterly disappointing year for his club. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportmail's Big Match Stats for Barcelona vs Cordoba . Luis Suarez (left) celebrates with Pedro after scoring his first-ever La Liga goal for Barcelona against Cordoba at the Nou Camp . The Uruguayan (centre) bundles the ball home against Cordoba during Barcelona's victory at the Nou Camp on Satuday . Barcelona have been battered to the canvas in 2014, at least to the extent that a side as big as Barcelona can be. They lost in the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid, they threw away La Liga on the final day against Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp, and were booted out of the Champions League by Diego Simeone's side as well. Then there were off-field problems, with Neymar's contract controversy forcing the resignation of Sandro Rosell and the tragic death of former coach Tito Vilanova. The start to life under Luis Enrique has been rocky, with a good start crumbling away after defeats in the Clasico and then at home against Celta Vigo. But slowly they are picking themselves up and dusting themselves down. This was the fourth home game in two weeks, and they have scored a total of 21 goals in that time. Suarez hugs Pedro enthusiastically, almost looking like he is nibbling him, after scoring his first La Liga goal at the Nou Camp on Saturday . The ex-Liverpool striker performs his trademark celebration by kissing his wrist following his goal at the Nou Camp on Saturday . BARCELONA (4-3-3): Bravo; Montoya, Pique, Mascherano, Alba; Rakitic (Xavi 65), Busquets, Iniesta (Rafinha 76); Pedro, Messi, Suarez . Subs not used: Stegen, Neymar, Adriano, Mathieu, Munir . Goals: Pedro (2), Suarez (53), Pique (80), Messi (82, 90) Booking: Busquets . CORDOBA (4-2-3-1): Carlos; Campabadal, Lopez (Pinillos 60), Pantic, Crespo; Deivid, Luso (Rossi 72); Ekeng, Cartabia, Borja (Silva 76), Ghilas. Subs not used: Abel, Saizar, Fidel, Andone . In between, there was last weekend’s weak performance away at Getafe, when without Neymar they lacked the skill and incision to destabilise the Madrid minnows and suffered a goalless draw. The Brazilian had an ankle injury, which saw him left on the bench for this game, but he was not needed. Pedro, who now has six goals in six games after netting only one in the previous 16 games, opened the scoring after just a minute. Ivan Rakitic played a crafty through ball towards the six-yard box and Pedro took one touch to control it and another to ram it into the top right corner, with Juan Carlos helpless. The forward, always patient despite his reserve status at the club, turned provider for the second goal. Andres Iniesta played the ball into the area and Pedro took control, weighed up his options and rolled the ball back for Suarez in the middle. Since signing from Liverpool, he has fluffed his lines a few times in La Liga. He had a chance after 10 minutes when Jordi Alba charged up the left and cut it back, but Suarez volleyed into the side netting. But receiving Pedro’s pass, he took his 17th shot of the league campaign, in his eighth appearance, and finally got the goal he cherished. From just a couple of yards out he prodded the ball through Juan Carlos’ legs and turned the Nou Camp into a cauldron of camera flashes. Rakitic, who has been in and out of the team since signing from Sevilla, nearly added a third two minutes later, cracking a fierce drive off the outside of the post.

Jordi Alba (right) of Barcelona runs across to Pedro and jumps on him in celebration of the former's goal . Gerard Pique celebrates scoring Barcelona's third goal against Cordoba at the Nou Camp on Saturday . Cordoba, who only had one win in their previous 15 La Liga games, never looked like getting something here. The closest they came was a rambling break by Nabil Ghilas, who skinned Javier Mascherano but then fired into the side netting of Claudio Bravo’s goal. While many thought Marc Andre-ter Stegen would be the replacement for Victor Valdes, the Chilean has been faultless in his stead. There was more to come from Barcelona, even if the game had already been won. Substitute Xavi Hernandez whipped in a free kick which Pique planted into the net with a firm header, before Messi smashed one home himself, despite putting in a subdued performance, overall. His second goal, right at the death, was even better. Messi pulled off a phenomenal, elastic piece of control to bring a cross in, swivelled and then fired home inside Juan Carlos’ near post. Barcelona are now breathing down Real Madrid’s neck at La Liga’s summit, although Los Blancos have a game in hand because of their Club World Cup participation. There is still plenty for Enrique to work on. He selected a 24th different line up in his 24th game in charge, which suggests he has worked out neither his best eleven nor the optimal system. But Barcelona can head into 2015 with the wind in their sails, given Suarez has finally broken his duck in domestic competition and Pedro looks close to rediscovering his form.

"Ed Richards alleged at a party that a media mogul had threatened him. Mr Richards did not identify the person but guests said they believed he was referring to Rupert Murdoch’s son James, pictured . The boss of Britain’s broadcasting regulator was at the centre of an explosive row with media mogul James Murdoch last night. The dispute erupted after outgoing Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards claimed he had been threatened during his eight years in the £393,000-a-year post. He alleged that one media mogul had shouted at him in his office: ‘We know who you are, we know who your friends are and we know where you live.’ The comments, made at a leaving party at Ofcom’s London HQ on Monday, drew gasps of astonishment from guests. Mr Richards did not identify the person but guests said they believed he was referring to Rupert Murdoch’s son James. Ofcom last night confirmed that Mr Richards made the ‘we know where you live’ claim. A spokesman refused to say if Mr Richards was referring to James Murdoch. However, given several opportunities to deny that it was him, the spokesman declined to comment. Reports of clashes between the pair have been in wide circulation among senior media and political figures for several years. They were in a long-running power struggle triggered by an attempted £8 billion bid to take full control of BSkyB, where James Murdoch was chairman, by his father Rupert’s News Corp, BSkyB’s parent organisation. Ofcom opposed the takeover – despite support for James Murdoch from David Cameron and Tory Culture Secretary and friend Jeremy Hunt. But the Murdochs had to abandon the plan as a result of the phone hacking scandal involving the News of the World, part of News International, also owned by News Corp and where James Murdoch was chairman. Humiliatingly, he was forced to quit as chairman of BSkyB after Mr Richards questioned whether the company was ‘fit and proper’ to broadcast in the UK. Respected media analyst Claire Enders, who was at the leaving party for Mr Richards, said: ‘Ed talked of the tough challenges he had faced at Ofcom and how difficult it could be keeping some people happy. He said a major media owner had shouted at him in his office and told him, “We know who you are, we know who your friends are and we know where you live.” ‘Everyone was completely shocked. Many of those present knew of shouting matches between Ed and James Murdoch. But it was a brave thing to say in public in front of so many prominent people.’ Ms Enders said that while Mr Richards did not mention James Murdoch by name, she and fellow guests believed they knew the identity of his target. Shock: Claire Enders (left) was at the leaving party for outgoing Ofcom boss Mr Richards (right), where the claims were made. The respected media analyst said that guests had been left 'shocked' by his comments . ‘No, he didn’t name James Murdoch but 99.9 per cent of people in the room had heard of Murdoch’s temper. Ed said we would have to wait for his memoirs to find out who he was referring to. ‘I am a great admirer of the way Ed did his job. He showed great courage at a very difficult time for the media and its proper place in democracy.’ James Murdoch was forced to step down at News International – which owned The Sun, The Times and News of the World – by the phone hacking scandal that brought the Murdoch empire close to ruin. Ofcom later ruled that BskyB was ‘fit and proper’ to hold a broadcasting licence. But it issued a damning verdict on James Murdoch, saying his behaviour in the phone hacking scandal was ‘difficult to comprehend and ill-judged and he repeatedly fell short of his duty as chairman’. Softly-spoken Mr Richards, 49, is a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He is stepping down as Ofcom boss to avoid a conflict of interest when his partner Delyth Edwards stands as a Labour candidate in next year’s General Election. He applied unsuccessfully to lead the BBC in 2012. When he announced his resignation as Ofcom boss he said: ‘It is never easy leaving a job that you enjoy greatly but I have always felt that once I had completed eight years as chief executive this would be the right time to move on.’ During his tenure, Ofcom has been accused of being too lenient on broadcasters who upset viewers with lewd or violent programmes. Last year, campaigners said the regulator was ‘out of touch’ after it failed to take action over a string of controversies. Mr Richards was praised by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey at the leaving party. Mr Vaizey told the assembled guests: ‘There have been a few bumps in the road in the Government’s relations with Ofcom but by and large they do a good job.’ A spokesman for James Murdoch declined to comment. A spokesperson for News Corp said: 'The allegation is false and ridiculous. James Murdoch never said anything of the sort.' James Murdoch, pictured, quit as BSkyB chairman in April 2012. He was later condemned by Ofcom for his 'failure to take action' over hacking . JUNE 2010 News Corp announces £8 billion full takeover plan for BSkyB. Business Secretary Vince Cable is in charge of overseeing bid. NOVEMBER 2010 Cable asks Ofcom to investigate the deal on grounds of ‘media plurality’, to report by December 31. James Murdoch and his wife lunch at Chequers with David Cameron, while Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt drafts a letter to the PM supporting the bid, which says: ‘Murdoch is pretty furious at Vince’s referral to Ofcom. He doesn’t think he will get a fair hearing.’ DECEMBER 2010 Ofcom says ‘plurality’ issues need addressing, and invites News Corp to comment. Cable is replaced by Hunt, after the Lib Dem revealed to undercover reporters that he had declared ‘war’ on Murdoch. European Commission approves bid. Hunt texts Murdoch: ‘Congrats on Brussels, just Ofcom to go!’ Ofcom says bid should be referred to the Competition Commission. JANUARY 2011 Hunt tells Murdoch that he will accept Ofcom’s advice unless the company can allay the regulator’s concerns. FEBRUARY 2011 According to messages published by the Leveson Inquiry, Murdoch’s adviser tells him Hunt thinks it is ‘the last throw of the dice’ for Ofcom’s Ed Richards to block the deal, but that ‘[Hunt] said he couldn’t ignore Ofcom… in public debate he would get killed if he did such a thing’. JULY 2011 Government ready to give clearance to the deal, but phone hacking scandal erupts amid reports that News of the World hacked Milly Dowler’s phone. Ed Richards intervenes, saying Ofcom had ‘a duty to be satisfied that the holder of a broadcasting licence is “fit and proper”’. News of the World is closed. BSkyB takeover bid is withdrawn. APRIL 2012 James Murdoch quits as BSkyB chairman. MAY 2012 Select Committee investigation into phone hacking finds Rupert Murdoch was ‘not fit to lead major international company’ and James ‘showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone hacking’. SEPTEMBER 2012 Ofcom rules BSkyB is ‘fit and proper’ but condemns James Murdoch for his ‘failure to take action’ over hacking. OCTOBER 2014 Ed Richards announces he will step down at Ofcom after eight years.","Row erupted after outgoing Ofcom boss claimed he had been threatened .

"A Florida man proved that you're never quite too old to play golf on Wednesday. 103-year-old Gus Andreone made a hole-in-one at Palm Aire Country Club in Sarasota, Florida perhaps making him the oldest ever man to make a hole-in-one. Andreone used a driver from the green tees on the 113-yard No. 14 hole of the Lakes Course. 'I hit it solid and the ball then hit the ground about 30 yards from the green and kept rolling, rolling and rolling,' Andreone said, according to PGA.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oldest man to make a hole-in-one: Gus Andreone of Sarasota, Florida, the oldest member of the PGA of America, said he counts himself among the most blessed golfers . Still has it: Even though Gus Andreone is 103, he constantly has the young players wanting to join him in the game and some even say they feel 'like a teenager' when they play with him . 'It fell into the hole, which was cut on the right middle part of the green. Miracles do happen once in a while.' Andreone is currently the longest serving PGA member at 75.6 years and was lucky enough to win the Pennsylvania Lottery in the 1970s where he was given $1,000 for the rest of his life. A seasoned golf player, his first hole in one was made in 1939. This is his eighth ever hole-in-one. His most recent hole-in-one before Wednesday's win was in the 1990s on the No.17 hole at the Lakes Course. 'Each day is a blessing and you never know what it will bring,' said Andreon to WFLA. Feeling blessed: 'Each day is a blessing and you never know what it will bring,' said Andreone .

You didn't bring out a wood back in those days in the rough I played in. You just were lucky if you found a golf ball.' Despite the competitive nature of golf Andreone says it's important to find the fun in it. 'Don't forget, golf's a game. You enjoy that. Good or bad, you're doing it.' He has said his success comes from his positive outlook on life. 'Golf has been good to me all these years and outside three years in the service, that's been my life.'

"Churchgoers won't face any charges in the death of an armed man they restrained after he caused a violent disturbance during an upstate New York service, according to prosecutors. Jason's Berg's death, 'although tragic, was not the result of criminal behavior,' Hamilton County District Attorney Marsha Purdue said in a statement Friday. Berg, 44, was drunk and carrying a loaded handgun in his pants waistband on June 28 when he burst into St. Mary's Church in Indian Lake near the end of an afternoon Mass, with 35 people worshipping, prosecutors said. The Rev. Philip Allen later recalled he had just risen and said, 'Let us pray.' 'And the shout back was, 'Pray for me!'' Allen told WRGB-TV last summer. Scene: Jason Berg, 44, drunkenly burst into St Mary's Church in Indian Lake, New York, on June 28, screaming and with a handgun in his waistband. He died while being restrained by parishioners . Berg then threw candles and other items into the congregation, cursed at the priest and advanced menacingly down the aisle toward him, according to prosecutors. A teenage altar server tried to tackle Berg, and then several parishioners in their 60s and 70s wrestled Berg to the floor. Berg struggled with them, and a churchgoer got his gun away from him, prosecutors said. 'He was resisting very strongly and yelling, ''Kill me'',' Allen later told the Adirondack Daily Enterprise. Then Berg abruptly became unresponsive. Parishioners and paramedics tried unsuccessfully to revive him, and he died at the church. 'Any force utilized by those who intervened to prevent Mr. Berg from injuring others clearly was within the standards' allowing the use of force to prevent harm, Purdue wrote, saying she saw no basis for bringing the case to a grand jury. Two churchgoers suffered cuts from objects Berg threw. An autopsy concluded that Berg's cause of death was heart arrhythmia brought on by an acute stress reaction, with 'acute alcohol intoxication' as a factor — his blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit for driving. Police found three empty, 23.5-ounce cans of a caffeine-and-alcohol drink at his home, drinks he was seen on security video buying about three hours before the church outburst, prosecutors said.","Jason Berg, 44, burst into St Mary's Church in Indian Lake on June 28 .

"Sunday will give us an opportunity to take a look at Alexis Sanchez and Raheem Sterling when Arsenal play Liverpool at Anfield. Sanchez has clearly become one of the stars of the Premier League in the five months he has been here and with Theo Walcott on the verge of returning, Arsene Wenger will soon be able to field a front three of Walcott, Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. That is a forward line with as much pace and which will inspire almost as much fear as Liverpool’s front three from last season: Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge and Sterling. Alexis Sanchez has had huge impact at Arsenal since his £30m arrival from Barcelona . Young Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling could learn a lot from Sanchez . What I love about Sanchez is his hunger. Hard work isn’t a dirty word for him; he puts in a shift. He shares that attribute with Suarez and Carlos Tevez. It is as though the South American players, who have come from relatively tough backgrounds, are grateful for opportunities they have and haven’t forgotten the hard work it took to get them to where they are. But Sanchez’s best quality is his calmness in the penalty area to finish chances off — and if Sterling can learn from that, he can become a truly great player. The Liverpool flyer is still young — he was 20 earlier this month — but there are similarities with Sanchez in that he can get into the same positions, whether he plays down the middle or down the side. Sanchez puts in a shift for Arsenal and he can also find the back of the net . Sterling scored twice for Liverpool in Wednesday's League Cup victory at Bournemouth . The next step for him is to become a finisher — do that and in two or three years’ time he could end up at Barcelona or Real Madrid. He’s not ready for that now, but he could be. Suarez managed to work on his finishing during his time at Liverpool and Walcott has improved over the past few years, so it can be done. Sterling gets in there time and time again, which is evidence enough of his quality. When he becomes a clinical finisher, he will be a frightening prospect.","Alexis Sanchez will go head-to-head with Raheem Sterling on SundaySanchez's best quality is his calmness to finish chances off .

"Amir Khan's importance as a boxer and fighter goes way beyond the Olympic medals or world titles he has won. As Britain’s best-known and most popular Muslim, adored by millions of fans of all denominations, the 28-year-old’s words carry particular weight in these troubled times when the world has been revolted by the slaying of 132 children in an attack on a school in Pakistan. Since he won Olympic silver in 2004 at the age of 17, Bolton-born Khan has tried to be a healing figure with his fights attended by everyone from working-class white fight fans to imams from the mosque. VIDEO Scroll down to see what Khan has donated to the massacred Peshawar school . Amir Khan recently beat American Devon Alexander in their welterweight clash  in Las Vegas . Comparisons with Muhammad Ali, the black Muslim who was loved by white America, are obvious. In Pakistan, where his grandparents came from, his fame is possibly even greater, with virtually the entire population of 180 million knowing who he is. The Taliban attack on Peshawar has affected Khan hard, particularly as he is now married with a baby daughter. While everyone else contemplates a turkey hangover, the welterweight will head east to Pakistan between Christmas and New Year’s Day, to visit extended family and help rebuild the country’s shattered morale. But Khan was brought back down to earth by the news of the massacre of schoolchildren in Pakistan . Many in his position — with a young family and the hope of a summer superfight with Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao or British rival Kell Brook — would not want to be dragged into the religious or political sphere but Khan cannot hold back about his feelings on hearing that gunmen had taken so many lives at the army school. He has donated the £30,000 pair of shorts he wore in last weekend’s victory in Las Vegas against Devon Alexander to help rebuild the school and ignores the potential personal danger in speaking out. ‘They were innocent kids, they had nothing to do with anything and the Taliban killed them. They are killing their own people,’ he says without hiding his emotions. ‘Setting the teachers on fire in front of these kids, these people are ruthless and have no brains, and I can’t believe they would do something like this. It upsets me and it’s disgusting to see. ‘You never think people would be so sick to do something like that. Khan announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during in his last fight to charity . ‘I am definitely going to go there. There are not many role models in Pakistan; I want people to see Amir Khan as a good person, a good Muslim, a good Pakistani and that they should be like me. ‘Some people won’t even talk about the Taliban because they don’t want to get into the politics of it but I’m open, I just want to speak the truth. ‘I’ll be going to Pakistan in the next couple of weeks and this could be threatening for me to even talk about it. But I just want to speak the truth. ‘I have a little girl. Imagine me sending her off to school and then finding out she had been killed.’ Khan’s grandparents moved from Rawalpindi to England in 1963 but he still feels a special affinity with the country. He visited Pakistan in 2005 to hand out food parcels following a devastating earthquake in Kashmir and donated and raised money to rebuild schools and hospitals. The 28-year-old's shorts will be donated to the school attacked by the Taliban in Peshawar, Pakistan . In addition to his pride in Bolton and Britain, he is a practising Muslim, praying at the mosque every week, observing Ramadan and has visited Mecca for the Hajj. ‘These attacks set Pakistan back,’ he says. ‘Pakistan is a really nice, good country. I want the people there to see my personality and try to get kids to follow in my footsteps. ‘I’m a nice person, I meet people, I’m respectful. These people [the terrorists] are doing the opposite.’ Khan is aware of his unique role during a period of history where religion often seems a battleground rather than a force for good. His daughter Lamysa is seven-months-old and it might be wiser for Khan to ignore what is going on and concentrate on family and career, but he feels he cannot ignore the opportunities his position brings. Relatives weep over a 15-year-old student who was killed during the massacre at the school in Peshawar . ‘It’s tough, but boxing has educated me and made me smarter,’ he says. ‘I can say things. I am the way I am, I’m not fake. I have a heart, I have a good family around me and I’ll speak the truth.’ Of a potential backlash, he says: ‘You can’t hide away from life, and anyway everything is in God’s hands. I do a lot of charity work there and I want to rebuild the school that has been affected. ‘It’s important to go there now and send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going and he’s going there to make a difference.’ In the ring, Khan — who has won 30 of his 33 fights — dreams of fighting Mayweather, renowned as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. So far, Mayweather has been dismissive of the challenge. A policeman stands beside empty coffins at the hospital after the school was stormed by  terrorists . If he continues to do so, a summer fight in London against Pacquiao or Brook is likeliest. Promoter Eddie Hearn says he has already booked Wembley Stadium on June 13 in anticipation of putting on Khan-Brook. ‘He’s wasting his money,’ says Khan, who does not like Brook — though bookmakers are not so sure. Pacquiao, 38, is also an option. ‘I believe he would come to England to fight me,’ says Khan. However, boxing can be put on the backburner for now. Khan has an important trip to Pakistan to attend to that transcends sport.","The Taliban killed 132 schoolchildren in Peshawar, Pakistan .

Sterling has already played 58 games for club and country in 2014 and Rodgers is devising a plan to give him a rest before he burns out. The forward has been in good form recently and scored twice against Bournemouth as a central striker in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night. Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he will be giving Raheem Sterling a break during the busy Christmas period . The Reds starlet has played 58 games for club and country in 2014 and Rodgers is keen to protect him . ‘Raheem will have a rest,’ confirmed Rodgers. ‘There will be a period that is already mapped out for him of when he will come out and have that breather and that recovery after Christmas. ‘There is a set period we will look at, it doesn’t have to wait until Daniel Sturridge comes back from injury.’ After Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, Liverpool play at Burnley on Boxing Day, Swansea on December 29, Leicester on New Year’s Day and then AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on January 5. They will then face five further fixtures before the end of January including the important two-legged Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea towards the end of the month. Sterling was at the centre of a controversy known as “Tiredgate” when England manager Roy Hodgson said the player had complained of being tired before England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia.

"Arsenal are ready to make a £20million January move for Germany international Christoph Kramer, even though his selling club Bayer Leverkusen are determined not to let him depart this winter. The defensive midfielder, who is currently on loan at Borussia Mönchengladbach, is high on Arsenal’s list to shore up their midfield. Sunday's fixture against Liverpool at Anfield, which they lost 5-1 last season, is an uncomfortable reminder of the defensive deficiencies of the team. VIDEO Scroll down to see Kramer's recent spectacular 45-yard own goal . Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer is being targeted by Premier League side Arsenal . And with Wenger reluctant to buy a stop-gap player in the January window, he would clearly rather pursue a leading target and see if there is a possibility of concluding a deal now, even though getting the midfielder out of Mönchengladbach is extremely complicated. A two-season loan to Mönchengladbach was agreed with Leverkusen in 2013 and so stunning has his progress been that Kramer not only made the German World Cup squad but started the final, although he had to go off after 31 minutes with concussion. Having spent two years on loan at Vfl Bochum, the 23-year-old has yet to make a first-team appearance for his parent club. Leverkusen will not sell for less than £25m and want him back in the summer. Lars Bender is also a target but it is just as difficult to prise him from Leverkusen, having signed a new contract last season. Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin is also being monitored, although the club show little inclination to sell during January. The Gunners have been impressed by the performances of IIkay Gundogan (left) and Lars Bender (right) Ilkay Gundogan, Borussia Dortmund’s Germany international, is another holding midfielder who has impressed Arsenal but Wenger would want to be sure the player has fully recovered after he spent most of last year out with injury. Nevertheless, Arsenal are ready to inquire about Kramer, with Wenger insisting he is ready to spend in January and that the widely-held view of him as a frugal manager is misconceived. ‘If we find the right player we will do it,’ said Wenger. ‘I said that many times, without any doubt. I’m not scared to spend money and if you go out with me at night, you will understand. ‘I don’t like to spend your money but I like to spend my money. 'There were periods where we didn’t have the money. What I don’t like is to spend the money I don’t have. 'What I did fight against was to spend money that would put the future of the club in danger.’ Wenger is also searching for a centre half, although the club ideally want a younger player who can develop, rather than a multi-million pound star. Although Calum Chambers is already providing back-up in central defence, Arsenal have concluded that they need a fourth central defender, with Laurent Koscielny having struggled with injury this season. Calum Chambers (left) has impressed while Norwegian wonder kid Martin Odegaard (right) is a target . Norwegian teenage star Martin Odegaard, who spent part of last week training at the club, is a possible signing although Bayern Munich are confident that he will choose them. Odegaard is now training at Barcelona, with Real Madrid, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool also interested in signing him. Much will depend on which club his father, former player and current coach Hans Erik, decides will be best for his son’s development. Odegaard is an attacking midfield, however, and defence is the area in which Arsenal will look to improve in January. Shortly after last season’s thrashing at Liverpool, they fell 3-0 down inside 17 minutes to Chelsea in a game they lost 6-0. Going 3-0 down to Stoke in the first half two weeks ago is an indication that the tactical and defensive problems are far from resolved. Arsene Wenger believes the Gunners are starting to show signs of improvement . Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) could be fit to start against Liverpool on Sunday . ‘I think we are getting better,’ said Wenger. ‘We have to show that in the final part of the season. We go now in the Premier League, we need to win games. ‘After that we have the FA Cup, the Champions League. Without defensive solidity you have no future. ‘The defeat at Stoke was significant because we got a big disappointment and we got a lot of criticism and I think we responded well, because we scored eight goals in the next two games. ‘It shows two things: first that the group is healthy because it can respond and has a unity. ‘And also, even in the game against Stoke when you look again, we were poor defending but going forward we were not disastrous at all.’","Arsenal are looking to shore up their midfield in the transfer window .

"Lindsey Vonn's stunning revival continued when she clinched her second victory in four races in a women's downhill on Saturday to move within sight of the all-time record of World Cup wins. Back in action two weeks ago in Lake Louise after a one-year break and two knee operations, the four-times World Cup winner won her second race, a downhill in Lake Louise, before finishing second in a Super-G. Her rivals were warned but could hardly do a thing when the former Olympic and world champion skied an almost immaculate run in Val D'Isere to clinch her 61st World Cup victory in one minute 44.47 seconds.

""Sixty-one is a difficult number and I'm looking forward to another chance tomorrow,"" the 30-year-old American told reporters. The podium was a prestigious one with 2011 downhill and Super-G world champion Elizabeth Goergl of Austria and 2010 Olympic giant slalom champion Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany tied for second place, 0.19 seconds behind Vonn. Her victorious return in Lake Louise was spectacular but was undermined by the fact that the Canadian course is considered Vonn's backyard after she won 15 World Cup races there. Vonn even had time to take a selfie with a beautifully groomed calf as she stood on the podium after her win .

I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the season and have more opportunities to feel more comfortable with the speed and keep pushing myself,"" Vonn added. The day was also a special one for Goergl, who had two up-and-down seasons since her double world title in 2011, and for Rebensburg, who had never made it on to a downhill podium before.","Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn won her 61st World Cup downhill on Saturday .

"Jose Mourinho has hit out at an anti-Chelsea bias after once again jumping to the defence of Gary Cahill and Willian over accusations of diving. Mourinho was angry last week that Cahill, Diego Costa and Willian were singled out in the win over Hull for alleged diving, and insisted on Saturday that a new system of video replays to clamp down on the offence would simply favour Chelsea’s rivals. The Chelsea manager said the focus should instead be on the reckless challenge made by Tom Huddlestone on Filipe Luis, which earned the Hull midfielder a red card. Jose Mourinho has turned the heat up on the referee ahead of Chelsea's clash with Stoke . Midfielder WIllian was one of Chelsea's players accused of diving during their game against Hull . Chelsea defender Gary Cahill was another who was singled out for diving during their 3-0 victory . Mourinho said: ‘You speak one week about a dive that was not even a dive and you don’t speak about Filipe Luis who could be this moment in hospital with big surgery on his knee or leg.’ Ahead of Monday night’s trip to Stoke, Mourinho has again risked incurring the Premier League’s wrath by demanding referee Neil Swarbrick ‘does his job’ at the Britannia Stadium. Under Premier League rules, managers are not allowed to discuss referees or anything to do with officiating ahead of a game, a move designed to stop the top bosses from piling pressure on officials. But Mourinho has placed Swarbrick firmly in the spotlight after he was chosen to take charge of the match  against a Stoke side who are regularly criticised for being overly physical. Mourinho said: ‘I like these matches. It’s no problem — with a good referee that can understand what is aggressivity, or when aggressivity finishes and when the rules of the game start. ‘We need a good, experienced referee who can understand exactly that, because what happens in both boxes in this kind of matches and we need important decisions: what is aggressivity and what goes beyond the rules of the game. But I like it. ‘I know that it is difficult for every team to play this kind of match but again I’m not worried. The referee is there exactly to judge what is aggressivity. And aggressivity I always welcome — it makes the game much more beautiful and difficult. ‘But one thing is aggressivity and one thing is to go beyond the rules.’ Diego Costa was another who was singled out for diving during Chelsea's win at Stamford Bridge . Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone was sent off for a challenge on Chelsea defender Filipe Luis . Mourinho has placed referee Neil Swarbrick firmly in the spotlight ahead of their clash with Stoke . Chelsea lost 3-2 at Stoke last season but Mourinho had no issues with the referee in that game or with Stoke’s approach. But he will prepare Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for the physical strength Stoke are likely to show in challenging him in the box, as well as Diego Costa for the battle he will have with Ryan Shawcross, both of whom are travelling to the Britannia for the first time. Mourinho said: ‘I will speak with Courtois and we prepare him but the referee is there and the referee has to know what is allowed and what is not allowed according to the rules of the game and the rules of the game are the same everywhere so it should be no problem.’ On Costa’s duel with Shawcross, Mourinho said: ‘One is trying to score goals and one is trying to stop. It depends on the way he tries to stop. ‘If he stops in clean way and is successful, maybe I will be waiting in the tunnel to congratulate him. If he goes beyond what the rules allow, I hope the referee does his job. ‘We are physical, too, so it should be no problem for us. But we want to play football — and I hope the referee does his job. ‘We have our identity. We want to play football, we play beautiful football and that’s what we want to do — but we can cope with physicality, that’s no problem for us. But the referee is there and I’m not worried because he is there.’ Mourinho says he will prepare Thibaut Courtois ahead of their visit to Stoke City . Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross (left) will be the man tasked with stopping Diego Costa on Monday . Mourinho, though, is still nursing a grievance over the FA’s application of rules, which the Chelsea manager thinks is biased and disproportionate. There is a panel of former referees who decide on which players to punish after matches on the basis of video evidence. Last season Manchester City’s Yaya Toure appeared to kick out at Ricky van Wolfswinkel while the Norwich player was on the ground, but the panel ruled he did not have a case to answer. Asked whether video analysis could cut out diving, Mourinho said: ‘The independent panels don’t do that job well in any case. When you go through to analyse and suspend players by video evidence, it’s a disaster. A disaster. I remember last season — and I don’t want to say the names of the clubs or the name of the players — you had players and clubs punished by panels and you had players and clubs protected by panels. ‘I saw someone kick someone on the floor in the back — no suspension. I saw others with minor things — suspended. ‘Players are punished for silly comments on Facebook and Instagram and players are not punished for other things. ‘So independent panels are the same ones that last season analysed my situation against Aston Villa and I was punished and suspended.’ An FA disciplinary panel fined Mourinho £8,000 last season for improper conduct for going on the pitch at Aston Villa after Ramires was sent off and a melee ensued.","Jose Mourinho hits out at anti-Chelsea bias ahead of Stoke clash .

"Steven Gerrard insists Brendan Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool into next season’s Champions League. After going so close to winning the Premier League title last term, Gerrard concedes another title tilt is beyond his side. The Reds skipper says the club must now focus their attentions on retaining their top-four status as they look to secure another campaign in Europe’s premier club competition. Steven Gerrard has backed Brendan Rodgers to turn things around at Liverpool . Rodgers is under pressure after Liverpool's poor start to the season . Rodgers talks to Kolo Toure (left) during a training session at Melwood last week . But that task looks easier said that done with the Merseysiders way off the pace in the race for a Champions League position. Liverpool’s turbulent campaign has seen Rodgers’ position as manager come under growing scrutiny in recent weeks. But Gerrard insists Rodgers is still the right man to lead Liverpool’s future, saying: ‘We’re still moving forward, I really believe that. I’m the first to admit it’s been tough this season, it’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. ‘But no-one in the dressing room has lost confidence in the manager. We are all behind him, we all believe in him. It will take time. ‘But I have that belief. We are a strong dressing room with a good manager - it will only be a matter of time before we turn it around. I’ve got confidence it will happen.’ Rodgers makes his point to his Liverpool players as they prepare to face Arsenal . Gerrard and Liverpool host Arsenal on Sunday in hope of kick-starting their disappointing league campaign. And the Reds captain added: ‘We want top four. That’s always our bread and butter. ‘After the start we’ve had I think it will be a fantastic achievement if we can get in that top four. ‘We’re not happy with our position in the table at the moment. But if we can come through a big game against Arsenal and get a win then that could be the catalyst for us to go on a run of results. ‘There are a lot of league games over the Christmas period. If you can string three or wins togther it can get you up there knocking on the door. ‘We’ve got to keep fighting for that because it’s so important to this club. That’s the main aim, no doubt about it. ‘And on top of that if we can try and get a cup along the way that would be a very welcome bonus because this club is about winning trophies.’","Steven Gerrard says the Anfield dressing room is behind Brendan Rodgers .

"Liverpool are seriously considering a January move for Fernando Torres. However, they could face competition from Atletico Madrid, the club where the Spaniard started his career. Torres is currently on a two-year loan from Chelsea to AC Milan, but it has been widely reported in Italy that the Serie A side want to end the deal due to the striker’s lack of form and goals. He has scored just once in 10 games. VIDEO Scroll down to see a Fernando Torres howler during Chelsea's pre-season . Liverpool would consider bringing Fernando Torres back to Anfield if AC Milan cut short his loan deal . Mario Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal for the Reds and could be moved out on loan . Given the injury problems Diego Costa has suffered Jose Mourinho might consider taking Torres back to add depth to his squad. But that would seem unlikely. Liverpool, who seem to be giving up on the gamble that saw them sign Mario Balotelli for £16million from Milan last summer, need to bolster their strike force. And Torres, who was outstanding for the Reds (65 goals in 102 Premier League games) before being sold to Chelsea for £50million in 2010 could fit the bill. Liverpool may take the 30-year-old on loan with a view to a permanent move. Meanwhile, Balotelli could be moved on loan to Napoli in Janaury. Brendan Rodgers is looking to improve his strike force in January due to Daniel Sturridge's injury problems . Liverpool could face competition for Torres from another of his former clubs, La Liga side Atletico Madrid . Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has made it clear he wants to bolster his strike force. West Ham’s Carlton Cole is a possibility and so is Watford poacher Troy Deeney. Crystal Palace hope to sign a striker in January and Carlton Cole (left) and Troy Deeney (right) are options . QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes striker Charlie Austin will sign a new £60,000-a-week contract ahead of the transfer window. Newcastle have been considering a move for the in-form striker. QPR hope in-form marksman Charlie Austin will stay at the club but Newcastle are considering a swoop . Winston Reid also wants £60,000 a week to commit his future to West Ham. The defender is out of contract in the summer. Last week Hammers boss Sam Allardyce said it would take an offer of £20m to prise Reid away in January. That’s a rather optimistic evaluation. Liverpool and Arsenal remain interested. So far the West Ham board have offered Reid a new deal in the region of £45,000 a week. But if they raise it by around £15,000 the New Zealand international is likely to sign. Winston Reid wants a £60,000-a-week deal at West Ham with Arsenal and Liverpool interested in the defender . World Cup final official Howard Webb, now technical advisor to the Premier League referees, has been in Holland to assess a trial of using in-game TV replays. Former England and Spurs player Gary Mabbutt has become an ambassador for IPRO, the new sports drink company who sponsor Derby and now supply many Championship clubs. Their 'health drink rivals' include Gatorade, Powerade and Lucozade. I AM HEARING . West Ham will still not be rushed into talks with Sam Allardyce over a new contract. In turn, Allardyce, whose contract expires in the summer, has not been banging on the chairman’s door. Even if the club finish the season in the form they have shown so far there could still be a parting of ways in the summer. Sam Allardyce may leave at West Ham at the end of the season despite their fine form so far . I AM ALSO HEARING . As it stands Ally McCoist will work out his notice with Rangers over the next 12 months. But if the situation becomes impossible and there is parting of ways former England, Ipswich and Rangers legend Terry Butcher could be in line for the Rangers hot seat. Terry Butcher could be in line for the Rangers job if Ally McCoist's situation becomes impossible . Last season Liverpool crushed Arsenal 5-1. Can’t see that happening again. And should Arsenal win (6-4 with Coral) the pressure on Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers really will intensify. As it stands Rodgers is the third most likely PL boss to be axed at 5-1 behind West Brom’s Alan Irvine (11-10) and Leicester’s Nigel Pearson (11-4). BTW . Raheem Sterling was 20 last week. Ahead of Sunday’s game against Arsenal he has made 75 appearances for Liverpool and scored 14 goals since his debut in 2012. He has made 13 appearances for England but hasn’t scored. He has played at World Cup finals. He is an exciting talent. He could even become a world-class player. But in the grand scheme of things his top-level career is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, Liverpool are keen to secure his services have offered him another new deal worth £70,000 a week. It seems right on the money in terms of the Premier League wage band due to Sterling’s age, experience and achievement. Raheem Sterling is a superb talent and has already played 75 times for Liverpool . Sterling has potential but has a long way to go before hitting the level of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . But Sterling, or perhaps more to the point his advisers, have thus far turned it down. It is understood the Sterling camp want more than £100,000. And suddenly there are stories leaking out that Real Madrid or Bayern Munich want him. It has become a poker game. I understand players wanting to get the best deal they can. But before you can expect to pick up the wages of ‘platinum players’, prove you really are one over a period of time. At this stage of his career Sterling’s focus should on making the step up to the next level, where he would be doing it week in week out like the Ronaldo’s or Messi’s of this world, not haggling over more money. Sterling's camp should not be haggling over more money at Liverpool with him at such a young age . I SAY . It’s boring and often embarrassing when managers use most of their ‘air time’ at post-match TV interviews to complain about referees. Usually it’s a device after a defeat to offer sufficient soundbites to divert attention from the other reasons why the team lost. It’s easy to ridicule referees who don’t have a right of reply. And once the manager has set the agenda, the fans and often naive headline writers do the rest. Sometimes when managers go a bit too far in the criticism they get fined. You get the impression, though, that managers think the fine is worth paying if it deflects criticism from them. Refereeing decisions have been criticised this season but the stats prove they're at the top of their game . Of course referees and linesman make mistakes. Occasionally howlers. And yes there are times when a bad big call on a foul, offside or a red card changes the course of a game. But it’s all too easy to slaughter officials after the countless replays. And consider this statistic: Ahead of this Saturday’s Premier League fixtures there had been, collectively, 38,718 decision moments for referees. Of those, according to the analysis of match evaluators, 98.4 per cent have been made correctly. It’s often said that all managers and players want from referees is consistency. Well according to those figures that’s exactly what they are getting.","Fernando Torres has scored just once in 10 games for AC Milan .

"In the space of one frantic fortnight, Jak Alnwick has been exposed to the brilliance and brutality of life as a professional footballer. On Sunday afternoon, as the rookie goalkeeper makes his full home debut in a Tyne-Wear derby, you get the feeling his experience will swing across the perilous pendulum which divides those two extremes. To recap, the 21-year-old was an unknown without a Wikipedia page two weeks ago when he emerged from the backbenches of the dugout at St James’ Park to first flatten Diego Costa and then perform heroics as Newcastle became the first team to beat Chelsea since April. Young Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick will experience the intensity of Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday . Then, at Arsenal, he shipped four on live television and suffered the humiliation of Santi Cazorla’s ‘Panenka’ penalty, a cheeky chip straight down the middle which does little for the confidence of any goalkeeper, let alone one making his first Premier League start. And so to Spurs at the other end of the Seven Sisters Road where his fortunes fared even worse. Again, four were conceded, only this time he was at fault for two and picked up a shoulder injury. He has been on the back pages of national newspapers for reasons which span good and bad. That, after all, is the existence of a professional footballer. Today, however, represents an entirely different proposition. Eight goals at Arsenal and Spurs will be forgotten with the passage of time. Tyne-Wear derbies, however, are etched in North-East folklore for eternity – just ask Liam O’Brien, he scored a winning free-kick for Newcastle at Roker Park in 1992 and hasn’t had to buy a drink on Tyneside since. Alnwick, then, would be forgiven for carrying a few nerves with him as he journeys along the River Tyne from his Prudhoe home and across the water to St James’. Alnwick has been passed fit despite injurying his shoulder during the 4-0 defeat against Tottenham . Alan Pardew is well aware of the exposure and expectancy surrounding the young custodian, who has been passed fit following his shoulder scare. ‘I have certainly had a chat with him,’ admits the man who is bidding to avoid becoming the first Newcastle manager in derby history to suffer four straight defeats. ‘I would have done that if he hadn't made a mistake (at Spurs) because I think it's important to talk to young players when they are going into the first team. ‘I think he was unlucky with his mistake (dropped his catch from a corner and Spurs scored) because he got punished severely with it. ‘You can get away with that sometimes, and I have played with much better goalies than Jak, without being disrespectful to him, who have got away with it. ‘They have dropped it and someone has cleared it, or it was blocked on the line or something, so I explained that to him. I think he realised that. ‘He was apologetic about the mistake, as you would imagine, but I said to him it's important not to be too apologetic, that's it's gone. ‘We make mistakes in other areas and there are all forgotten; you make a mistake there and it isn't, so he grasped that. ‘He's a local boy, he wants to make amends today in terms of a real performance, and all my squad and my staff, because we like him, will be wishing that happens.’ Alnwick is out of contract in the summer and, with Tim Krul and Rob Elliot sidelined until the middle of January, he has a chance to win a new deal. Stand-in keeper Alnwick injured his shoulder in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup defeat at Tottenham . Either way, Pardew says the experience will serve the former Sunderland youth keeper well. ‘Whatever line his career takes, this is going to be a massive period for him,’ says the boss. ‘He did brilliantly against Chelsea, everyone was raving about him. Now he has had a down-turn against Spurs and now he has got the other side of the coin, all in the space of eight or nine days, and that is football. ‘In a minuscule way, he's had the experience of what it’s like to play football at the highest level, and now he needs to respond.’ Alnwick, of course, is one half of a goalkeeping family. His brother, Ben, played for Sunderland and Spurs and now resides between the posts for Peterborough. He has every faith in his little brother and was thrilled – if a little panicked – when the call came that Jak was coming on at half-time against Chelsea. Newcastle lost 4-0 against Tottenham as Alnwick had a game to forget, gifting two of the goals on Wednesday . ‘I knew one of our local pubs had BT so I sprinted down and got there just in time to see Jak flatten Diego Costa with his first contribution,’ laughs the 27-year-old. ‘I was shaking just watching him play and all my Peterborough team-mates started texting me and this made me worse. But Jak was okay. Goalkeepers like a good first touch and Jak seemed to grow a couple of inches at the way he took care of Costa.’ Ben, then, is proud of his sibling, if a little envious at the same time. ‘On Sunday he will be doing something I have dreamed about all my life - playing in a derby match for Newcastle with Sunderland,’ he says. ‘I was actually on the bench for Sunderland at St James' Park in the derby match Newcastle won with that goal from Emre in 2005. ‘But like all Northumberland lads I would have loved to have played for Newcastle United. It's been my life-time dream. Now Jak is living my dream.’ Young Jak will certainly be hoping his first derby is more dream than nightmare.","Newcastle United face Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday .

"A message claiming to be from the Guardians of Peace, the group taking responsibility for the massive hack of Sony Pictures, taunted the FBI after it pinned the blame on North Korea. 'The result of investigation by FBI is so excellent that you might have seen what we were doing with your own eyes,' read a message posted to Pastebin, a site popular for text dumps from hackers. 'We congratulate you success,' continued the message. 'FBI is the BEST in the world.' Taunting: A message posted on Pastebin claiming to be from the Guardians of Peace taunted the FBI after it pinned the blame on North Korea. Pictured is allegedly screen of hacked Sony employee's computer. 'You will find the gift for FBI at the following address,' read the message, including a link to a YouTube video titled 'you are an idiot!' According to the Hollywood Reporter, the link to the message was sent to journalists by the group early Saturday morning in an email titled 'The data you are interested in.' However it is impossible to be certain that the message was originated by the GOP as there were no links to any leaked information. However the group has used Pastebin for other messsage and the subject line in the email is similar to that used in other messages from the hackers. Ars Technica reported Monday the group claimed to be 'preparing for you a Christmas gift' of 'larger quantities of data' in another message on Pastebin. 'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state,' the message continued. The message also asked individuals to send emails to addresses posted 'to tell us what you want in our Christmas gift.' The message followed an FBI announcement into the hack, which was revealed by Sony in late November, stating the North Korean government was behind the hack. Canceled: Sony canceled the release of The Interview, which was to feature the killing of North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un following the hack and the posting of an anonymous demand on Github . The investigation found the hackers used malware similar to that used previously by North Korean actors. It also concluded that infrastructure utilized during the attack, including IP addresses, has previously been linked directly to North Korea. Other tools bore a resemblance to those used in an attack in March against South Korean banks that was determined to have been carried out by North Korea. Wired, which published an article calling the North Korea link 'flimsy' shortly before the FBI announcement, noted there were security professionals still doubting Pyongyang's involvement. The ability of hackers to use proxy computers or make traffic appear to be routed through various IP addresses makes positive attribution of hacking culprits especially fraught.","A message posted under GOP, or Guardians of Peace, seemed to snarkily congratulate the FBI for its investigation of the Sony hack .

The comedian, 38, said he disapproved of disclosing the ‘painful and personal’ information, which has been kept secret for more than 20 years. McIntyre was brought up believing his father Cameron had died of a heart attack, and only discovered that he had killed himself four years ago. Michael McIntyre, aged 17, and his father Ray Cameron in London in 1993, six months before his  suicide . His father, who was also a comedian and worked for four years on the Kenny Everett Show, suffered from depression after a downturn in his career. He shot himself in the head in the utility room of a Hollywood apartment block in 1993, aged 55. His widow Holly, now 58, decided to shield the truth from McIntyre, who was only 17 at the time, and his 15-year-old sister Lucy. But yesterday, she revealed that she was forced to tell her two step-children the truth in 2010 after McIntyre was invited to take part in a BBC series probing his background. She feared his death certificate would be found, revealing the real cause of death. The comedian was brought up believing his father had died of a heart attack, and only discovered that he had killed himself four years ago, pictured with his sister,  Lucy . Mr Cameron's wife Holly (both pics), now 58, decided to shield the truth from McIntyre, who was only 17 at the time of his father's suicide . She said: ‘That was the hardest phone call of my life. I was shaking when I told him. For years I kept this terrible secret and finally I was sharing it. ‘I said, “Michael, your father didn’t have a heart attack. He killed himself.” ‘There was a paralysed silence on the other end of the line. He was crushed. How are you supposed to react to news like that? ‘He just said, “Oh my God, Oh my God… are you sure?”’ His father, who was also a comedian and worked for a while on the Kenny Everett Show, suffered from depression after a downturn in his career . Mrs McIntyre said she had found a suicide note from her husband apologising for what he had done and asking her to protect the children. In the years after his death, her stepson Michael left Edinburgh University to become a stand-up comedian and found worldwide success. In his autobiography, Life And Laughing published in 2010, he detailed his father’s heart attack and said that his death was his inspiration to succeed. But that year he was approached by the BBC’s genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, and she realised she would have to tell him the truth. McIntyre said: ‘I’m heartbroken my stepmother has chosen to share painful and personal information publicly’ Cameron McIntyre’s death certificate is freely available in US public records, and clearly states he died of a ‘self-inflicted gunshot wound to head’. His widow told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Michael grew up believing his dad went out for his morning walk and suffered a heart attack at the side of the road. ‘I didn’t think the children needed the burden of growing up under the shadow of a parent committing suicide. ‘If Michael hadn’t become famous the truth would never have come out because I wouldn’t have told anyone. ‘But he emailed me and said he would be doing this show and could I help the BBC with information about his daddy. ‘I knew the researchers would find the death certificate because it is a matter of public record. I had to come clean.’ Cameron killed himself after work began to dry up and the family had to give up their lifestyle of lavish homes, nice cars and private school for the children. He had been pinning his hopes on getting a commission for a series with the BBC, but after making a pilot episode the corporation decided not to run with it. He wrote in his suicide note: ‘I cannot tell you what to say to the children, but I know you will make the right decision. My instinct is to shield them if you can. I’m guessing that will be yours, too.’ In the wide-ranging interview, she also told how much her step-son values money after watching his father lose all of his. She also revealed she has recently been on bad terms with the comedian, after several rows involving her two children with McIntyre’s father, Georgina, now 22, and son Billy, 28. Georgina told the newspaper: ‘I only found out the truth about the suicide last year. I thought with me being the youngest, he might care to comfort me and build a bond. ‘But he’s not interested. I feel abandoned by him.’ Yesterday, Michael McIntyre said: ‘I’m heartbroken my stepmother has chosen to share painful and personal information publicly.’","McIntyre grew up believing his father, Ray Cameron, died of heart attack .

"Mysterious death: Researchers identified a new tick-borne illness called the Bourbon Virus believed to be the cause of John Seested, 68, this summer . Researchers have identified a new tick-borne illness believed to be the cause of a Kansas man's death this summer. The Centers for Disease Control are investigating a new disease being named the Bourbon Virus that doctors struggled to identify for months. WPTV reports that a patient entered the University of Kansas Medical Center with symptoms like those of other diseases carried by ticks. In spite of the symptoms, John Seested, 68, tested negative for known tick-borne illnesses, according to the Fort Scott Tribune. 'It was very frustrating,' Dr Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease physician at the hospital told WPTV about the uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis. 'That's one of the biggest problems with my job, which I love, when we can't answer those questions, when we can't help the patients or their families.' The man did not respond to treatment, according to Dr Hawkinson, and soon went into multiple organ failure and died. Seested's death certificate listed three causes of death, with tick-borne illness as the third, Seested's wife, Jan, told the Tribune. An obituary for Seested stated he was a member of the Stanley Buccaneers 4-H Club and president of the Junior Hereford Association, and noted he had a passion for raising show calves. Six months passed before researchers from the CDC and the University of Kansas discovered that Bourbon Virus, named after the county where Seested lived, was to blame for his death. Diseases: Though he was bitten by a tick and experienced symptoms similar to other tick-borne diseases, tests of John Seested came back negative . There is still no vaccine for this newly discovered illness, though researchers say they're pressing ahead to look at how to fight the disease. 'This may be a cause of other people's illness as well and those will be steps we're going to be looking at with the CDC too,' Hawkinson said.","John Seested, 68, was admitted to University of Kansas hospital in June with symptoms similar to those of tick-borne diseases .

Faulty background checks: The District Attorneys of Los Angeles and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against Uber for 'flagrant and unlawful business practices,' which include not issuing proper background checks . 'Uber has zero tolerance for this behavior, and we apologize to Ms. Williams for this terrible experience. We immediately deactivated the driver, and have begun an investigation,' Kaitlin Durkosh, a spokesperson for Uber, told Mashable. Nikki Williams has been living in the United States ever since she was 16-years-old when her family left their town in South Africa, ravaged by post-apartheid crime, to move to Nashville, says the singer's Facebook Page. Williams made the move to Los Angeles when she was 21, and shortly after signed with Breyon Prescott of Chameleon Entertainment.

Williams is currently performing on the road, and hopefully she won't encounter any more shady characters . The District Attorneys of Los Angeles and San Francisco filed a lawsuit against Uber for 'flagrant and unlawful business practices,' which include not issuing proper background checks for drivers in response to several criminal acts reported by passengers. Williams' claim comes at a poor time for Uber who is fighting off a string of sexual assault allegations in Boston and India earlier this month. A Massachusetts Uber driver is accused of sexually assaulting a woman who had summoned the ride-sharing service. Authorities say 46-year-old Alejandro Done was arraigned on Wednesday in Cambridge District Court. The Boston man pleaded not guilty to charges including rape and kidnapping. Investigators say Done picked up the woman in Boston on December 6. She had summoned an Uber driver to take her to her Cambridge home. The pick-up spot: 46-year-old Alejandro Done allegedly picked up a woman from Tremont Street (pictured) then allegedly drove her to a secluded area where he sexually assaulted her . Uber customers use a smartphone application to arrange and pay for rides with nearby drivers. The driver allegedly told the woman that he would need a cash payment, so he took her to an ATM. Authorities say he then drove her to a secluded location and sexually assaulted her. The Wicked Local reports that Done drove to a location that she was not familiar with then her pulled over in a secluded area and jumped in the backseat where she was sitting. He allegedly hit her and strangled her and locked the car doors so that she could not escape and covered her mouth so she could not scream. He then allegedly sexually assaulted the woman. Uber says it's working closely with law enforcement to assist in the investigation. 'This alleged predator took advantage of a young woman who trusted that he was who he portrayed himself to be and exploited her vulnerability once he had her in his car,' said District Attorney Marian Ryan. 'Every day people are engaging car services for their transportation needs, and placing their trust in them for their personal safety and security. While these services are a convenience, and often a necessity of modern urban living, we urge everyone to take precautions to ensure they are as safe as possible,' said Ryan. In hauntingly similar case's, three different women told Boston police that they were sexually assaulted over the weekend after getting into to cars they believed they ordered via ride sharing apps such as Uber and Lyft. At least two of three women who police said were indecently assaulted Sunday while using ride-sharing services in Boston had ordered vehicles through Uber, according to authorities. Police said on Monday night that all three incidents occurred early Sunday morning between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. in Dorchester, the Allston-Brighton area, and an unspecified location between Faneuil Hall and Dorchester. First incident: The first incident occurred just before 1 a.m. last Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately . The Boston Globe reports that the first incident occurred just before 1 a.m.last Sunday when a woman was picked up at Dorchester Avenue and Columbia Road and a driver allegedly proceeded to touch her inappropriately. She says she later got a text from her ride-share service saying her actual driver had arrived. She ordered the car to stop and she ran out but police were not able to find the car she described being assaulted in. At around 2:30 a.m. a second incident occurred when a woman called for a car to pick her up at 1030 commonwealth Avenue and take her home. She got into a vehicle and was 'assaulted by an individual she believed to be employed by a rideshare service,' police said. She was able to resist the driver's advances and get out of the car. In a third incident in the same night a woman arranged for a ride from app from Faneuil Hall to Dorchester and 'fell asleep [during the trip] and woke to the driver indecently assaulting her,' police said. Second incident: At around 2:30 a.m. a second incident occurred when a woman called for a car to pick her up at 1030 commonwealth Avenue and take her home and she was later 'sexually assaulted by the driver' Police have not yet commented on whether or not the cases are connected. Taylor Bennett, a spokesperson for the ride-sharing service Uber, sent a statement to CBS saying, 'no one should hail or get into any vehicle on the street that is not a clearly identifiable pre-arranged transportation provider or licensed taxi. There are strong reasons why doing so is unsafe, and therefore illegal, in the city of Boston.' Meghan Joyce, who works as the general manager for Uber Boston, said the service has measures in place to guard against such incidents. 'Our technology has brought an unprecedented degree of accountability and transparency to the transportation industry — with driver and vehicle information provided in-app, detailed email receipts sent after each ride, a 24/7 feedback loop, and the ability to share your journey in real time,' the statement said. Indian police also arrested an Uber taxi driver late on Sunday December 7 over the alleged rape of a 25-year-old passenger, an officer said, with the incident a blow to the company's safety-conscious image. Police said they tracked down the driver who had abandoned the taxi and fled to his native Uttar Pradesh state after attacking the woman on December 5 in a secluded part of the Indian capital. Another officer, Delhi special commissioner Deepak Mishra, criticised Uber over the attack, saying early investigations showed GPS had not been installed in the taxi and mandatory police background checks were not conducted on the driver. 'Our initial investigations have revealed the shortcomings of the private cab company which didn't have GPS installed in its cabs and the staff wasn't verified,' he told AFP. The incident comes as US-based Uber, which emphasises safety and high-end technology, is making inroads in the Indian market including by appealing to young urban professionals.

"Search-and-rescue pilot Flight Lieutenant Ayla Holdom flashed her ID badge at the security gate of RAF Valley in Anglesey. It showed her as she had appeared just a few weeks earlier… as a man. ‘In you go, Ma’am,’ said the guard. ‘Don’t worry, you aren’t the first and you won’t be the last,’ his words acknowledging the fact that Ayla was returning to work as a woman. Flt Lieut Holdom, 34, is a decorated RAF officer who is Britain’s first and only openly transgender military pilot. She has been, she says, ‘one of the boys as both a man and a woman’. Among the colleagues she told in a series of emotionally gruelling one-on-one meetings was Prince William, who was at the time a fellow co-pilot within the tight-knit team of 20 at RAF Valley. Flt Lieut Ayla Holdom with her Sea King helicopter during a training exercise in the Atlantic in 2012 . He showed support and understanding. The Royal Wedding in 2011 was one of Flt Lieut Holdom’s first work-related outings after transition. She attended as a woman, accompanied by her wife Wren, a doctor with whom she now lives in a lesbian relationship. ‘All my RAF colleagues were brilliant,’ she says. ‘I think they were surprised because I was pretty adept at pretending to be a man. I walked macho, I sat macho, I worked out hard and I like a bit of banter. ‘But when I came back as a woman there was complete acceptance and empathy. Even old and bold warrant officers who had grown up in the days when people like me would have been taken behind the bike sheds for a kicking, came to congratulate me. ‘I can see why someone might think it’s been difficult. Men go to war, women stay at home and mind the children – that’s the traditional military narrative. But being transgender in the RAF has been, in some ways, easier than in civilian life. ‘The military has a policy and there are rules and what we do is adhere to them. It keeps things simple. Even this,’ she says with a smile. The most striking thing about Flt Lieut Holdom is how far her androgynous elegance is removed from the cruel stereotype of a transgender woman. As a woman she’s neither confusing nor cartoonish; she is unmistakably feminine even if she was assigned a male gender at birth. Among Flt Lieut Holdom's first work-related outings as a woman was the Royal Wedding in 2011 which she attended with her partner Wren (pictured left) Today she’s sitting in the quarters she shares with Wren at RAF Chivenor in North Devon. With their cats, their aquarium, piles of books and a roast cooking in the kitchen, the couple’s home life is a picture of ordinary domestic contentment. It’s one they hope to complete with a baby of their own, born using sperm frozen before Ayla underwent transition. Yet life was not always so stable. In her first newspaper interview, Flt Lieut Holdom reveals how she came close to killing herself due to social pressure to be a fit and handsome ‘silver-backed gorilla’. She says: ‘It wasn’t me, it wasn’t honest. From being a teenager I felt a void inside me. It drove me to achieve, to join the military, to fly, to qualify as a search-and-rescue pilot, but it was never, ever enough, because my essential self didn’t correspond to my external image and who could live that kind of lie? ‘I knew I wasn’t a gay man, I couldn’t tick that box. But it is a huge step to ask yourself if you might be transgender because of the stigma attached to it. 'You know you risk being ostracised, ridiculed, belittled and made to feel somehow less human. You are the punchline in a big joke, or worse, still deemed to have a psychological condition. ‘You are considered a freak and you put your career, your family ties and your friendships on the line. That’s why you deny it, why you deny it even to yourself until the need to do something about it is so overwhelming it makes life impossible – truly impossible.’ By impossible the officer means killing herself. She declines to go into detail but she admits she contemplated suicide. ‘My whole life felt empty and worthless and in the end it came down to simple mathematics – either I could transition or I could kill myself.’ That she survived is down to two things: a marriage that was ultimately defined by love and not gender, and the support of the RAF. She cannot stress enough that a military environment in which she is judged on her professional skills and not by her sexuality or gender has been an unexpectedly comfortable place to be. ‘It’s not unfair to say that women in the military are often one of the boys. Being gay, being trans, being a woman in a man’s world – they are all easier because this work is very task-focused. ‘People worry first and foremost about your ability to do the job. ‘I was worried I would have to surrender my flying career but I was wrong, just as my fears about losing the love of my family and friends were unfounded. I was quietly confident I would keep my marriage but I couldn’t know: Wren married a man.’ The couple, who say they were both bisexual, met in a ju jitsu class during their first year of university at Plymouth where the future Flt Lieut Holdom was reading ecology. ‘It was love at first throw,’ she jokes. They were together for eight years before marrying six years ago in a civil ceremony at a Somerset stately home. By then Ayla was, with Wren’s support, already living as a woman outside of work and family events. The 34-year-old said being part of the RAF had made the transition surprisingly more comfortable . She was born in Somerset, the youngest of three siblings. Her parents, Colin and Olive, ran a smallholding and let holiday cottages. The rural environment made it easier for their son to ignore the fact that he did not relate to the world as a boy. ‘I knew I was different from the age of four but I had no words of explanation. ‘The fact that I had a loving family made it easy not to press the question. But going to university meant leaving home and I spent all my time looking for the next thing, the thing which would complete me.’ At Plymouth she joined the university air squadron and from there she signed up for a short-term commission in the RAF. She completed her officer training at Cranwell in Lincolnshire, and then volunteered for search-and-rescue. ‘I am not a blue-light chaser,’ she says. ‘It sounds grandiose but I wanted to do a job that involved helping others.’ She joined RAF Valley in 2007 and was fully operational by the end of 2009, co-piloting a Sea King – the same role as Prince William – along with a pilot, a winchman and a radar operator. Today she works 24-hour shifts responding to calls from the coastguard, mountain rescue teams and the three emergency services. The process of transition is over now, although it took two years, three major operations and several other procedures to achieve. ‘I did as little as possible because I wanted to stay operationally fit and healthy, to remain a fully functioning military pilot throughout, she says. ‘But if you are cursed with testosterone and a Y chromosome then you have to do what you need to to get yourself out of the door every morning and be accepted as a woman.’ To that end Flt Lieut Holdom has had laser treatment on facial and body hair, a hair transplant into her thinning hairline and breast implants. Like all women she worries about hair, make-up and clothes. ‘It makes it easier,’ she says, ‘for the world to accept you as a woman if you look like one, even though that shouldn’t need to be the case.’ She has had to jump through a series of legal hoops, including changing her name by deed poll to Ayla Zoe Louise. She and Wren chose the first name together, the middle names were given by her parents. ‘They’re my parents – of course they had to choose my names,’ she says. It’s only now, four years after she began transition, that she is willing to tell her story. ‘Why hide it?’ she asks. ‘Why reinforce the taboo? Being transgender is one of the last areas of prejudice. ‘It’s like race or homosexuality a generation ago and I hope that transgender people can elicit the same change in society today.’ The transgender community believes that 40 per cent of people attempt suicide in the years before or during transition. Flt Lieut Holdom was almost one of them. Like all those in the military, her currency is courage. But no matter how many more search-and-rescue ‘shouts’ she answers, she will never do anything braver than discarding the man’s body into which she was born in order to live as the woman she knows herself to be.","Flight Lieutenant Ayla Holdom is Britain's first transgender military pilot .

"If the spy drama Homeland, which finishes its fourth season tonight, seems a little too realistic, perhaps that's because it is rooted in a series of incidents that actually happened. The programme focuses on the so-called 'drone war' and the conflict between the CIA and the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), which has been the source of much of the real tension between the two countries. Here, security journalist Duncan Gardham, who specialises in terrorism and espionage, looks at the comparisons between the popular television series and real life events. Parallels: Numan Acar plays Haissam Haqqani, the villain in the fourth series of Homeland (left) and (right) in real life, Jalaluddin Haqqani, is leader of a major faction of the Taliban, known as the Haqqani network .

'Haqqani' is the villain of the fourth series of Homeland, a member of the Taliban who lives a secret life in the tribal areas of Pakistan, moving from place to place, targeted by American drones, but covertly supported by the Pakistani ISI. In real life, Jalaluddin Haqqani is the leader of a major faction of the Taliban, known as the Haqqani network, that straddles the border in Khost, Afghanistan and North Waziristan in Pakistan. Once funded by the Americans in the fight against Soviet Russia, they have remained a Pakistani asset but regularly launch attacks against coalition troops in Afghanistan. Haqqani and his son Sirujuddin, have been the subject of a number of CIA drone strikes, including one in September 2008 which hit a house in the village Dandi Darpa Khail in North Waziristan, killing between 10 and 23 people. Haqqani had already left the area.

In real life, CIA contractor Ray Davis shot two men on a motorbike on the streets of Lahore in January 2011, thinking they were about to rob him at gunpoint but this scene is more reminiscent of a harrowing incident in March 1988 during the Troubles in Northern Ireland when two plain clothed British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, were dragged from their car and killed after getting caught in an IRA funeral procession.

Carrie Mathieson (pictured) is able to retrieve the situation and the exchange goes ahead . This scene is also reminiscent of a double cross at Camp Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan in which an agent run by the Pakistani Taliban blew up Jennifer Lynne Matthews (pictured), the female CIA station chief, and six members of her staff using a suicide vest . At one stage he apparently escaped but was recaptured after five days, and during his captivity he was forced to make three videos pleading for his release. A prisoner exchange for five men held by the Americans went ahead in May 2014, filmed by the Haqqanis.

"Thousands of bladder cancer patients face an uncertain future because stocks of a drug that prevents the disease progressing are running perilously low. The crisis means patients may be soon given a stark choice: surgical removal of the entire organ, or risk the cancer returning. Up to 12,000 people are to be left without the crucial medication, called BCG, as British hospitals run out of supplies. One sufferer, Peter Massera, 48, who was diagnosed with bladder cancer six months ago, said his treatment with BCG had been ‘postponed indefinitely’ because of the shortage. Recovery: Model Patti Hansen, with husband Keith Richards, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2007 . The marketing manager from Leek, Staffordshire, said: ‘When you’re put on a cancer treatment plan you don’t want to change anything in case your cancer returns. ‘So when you’re told you can’t have the treatment you were promised, it’s very worrying. My hospital told me they can’t get any BCG supplies, regardless of the quantity. ‘I’ve been told that I’ll be monitored closely and any tumours that develop will be “whipped out” but obviously that’s not ideal – you don’t want tumours returning at all. ‘I know people are being diagnosed with the same level of cancer I had and have been offered bladder removal as an alternative because of the shortage.’ BCG is a modified, safe form of the bacteria Bacillus Calmette-Guerin that stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies to tuberculosis. The drug is usually thought of as a vaccine given to children to protect against TB, yet it is also a key treatment for one of the most aggressive forms of bladder cancer. A different strain is given to cancer patients, and in these cases the antibodies have been found to target tumour cells. Bladder cancer is the second most frequently occurring disease of the urinary system after prostate. It is also the fourth most common cancer in men and the tenth in women in the UK, with more than 10,000 cases a year, and 5,000 deaths. The most high-profile patient in recent years is Dame Mary Archer, 70, the wife of author and politician Jeffrey. She was diagnosed with the disease in 2010 and underwent BCG treatment to try to halt the cancer’s progression before having her bladder removed. The most high-profile patient in recent years is Dame Mary Archer, 70, the wife of author and politician Jeffrey, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2010 . Patti Hansen, 58, the model and actress wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, also suffered bladder cancer in 2007. She has since made a full recovery. The shortage of the drug is the second such occurrence in two years. A flood at a factory owned by pharmaceutical company Sanofi, which manufactures BCG, led to supply problems in 2012. This left production limited to rival company MSD, but it is now struggling to cope with increased global demand. Some doctors have advised patients to have their bladder removed completely because it is not known when stocks of the drug will be replenished. Bladder cancer has one of the highest recurrence rates of any type of cancer, and BCG is the only drug used to protect against it. BCG is piped into the bladder via a catheter. It is given to patients with an aggressive form of bladder cancer which has not yet penetrated the bladder wall, following surgery to remove tumours. The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) is now calling on officials at NHS England and the drugs regulator to fast-track the licensing of other BCG strains from abroad in order to boost the UK’s supply and protect patients. Dame Archer, pictured running the Chariots of Fire relay race in Cambridge in 2012 . Unlicensed BCG strains can be imported and used with the patients’ consent, but it is up to individual hospitals to decide whether this is a route they want to take. Urologist Mark Speakman, president of BAUS, said: ‘There is an Indian product out there and that is where the Government could make a difference. ‘We have appropriately strict licensing regulations in this country but the Government could make it easier by expediting the approval of some of these other strains. At the moment, one or two hospitals are ordering these strains anyway, but at their own risk. ‘Patients are rightly worried about what’s going on and although there are no scare stories yet about things going badly wrong without BCG, the longer this shortage goes on the greater the risk there will be.’ Last month, Labour health spokeswoman Luciana Berger asked Whitehall officials what it was doing to address the shortage. In reply, Life Sciences Minister George Freeman said the Government did not know how many patients were affected but officials were monitoring the situation and were ‘in close contact with BAUS’. But Mr Speakman said this was not the case. ‘At what level they’re in contact with us is slightly passing me by at the moment,’ he said. MSD issued a warning earlier this year that it expected there to be a shortage of BCG for a couple of months, but this has now been extended and is expected to last well into 2015. Andrew Winterbottom, founder of the charity Fight Bladder Cancer, said: ‘Treatments for bladder cancer haven’t changed for over 35 years because so little research is done in this area. BCG is one of the few treatments available. ‘Two years ago when a shortage happened, the Government should have set up a system whereby we could import supplies, if only temporarily. Demand is growing every year and this problem is a combination of bad planning and bad luck.’ A spokesman for MSD said: ‘We are doing everything we can to meet this demand and have increased production by 100 per cent over the past two years. ‘But given that we are the only source of BCG in the UK and many other countries, and that BCG requires stringent and rigorous quality testing to ensure high-quality product for patients, fully meeting UK demand will take some time. Quantities may remain limited throughout 2014 and 2015 while we work hard to meet this demand.’ The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said it would consider fast-tracking licensing applications in the event of a shortfall of medicines. A spokesman added: ‘We are providing advice on the requirements for obtaining a licence to manufacturers of BCG products who do not currently have licences for their products in the UK, and for importing medicines into the UK.’","Stocks of drug BCG that prevents disease from progressing running out .

"Mel B has delayed a crucial eye operation to restore her sight . Mel B delayed a crucial eye operation to restore her sight yesterday, just a week after claims she is splitting from her husband amid rumours of physical abuse. The X Factor judge, right, was left blind in one eye after laser surgery 15 years ago to correct her vision went wrong. After waiting two years for a corrective procedure, the singer was due to have a corneal transplant at a Los Angeles hospital. It has now emerged the surgery has been postponed. The singer had to undergo tests to check the transplant would work and book the specific eye surgeon she wanted. But it has now emerged the planned surgery - which she talked about in an interview with Hello! Magazine last week – has been postponed. The postponement comes just seven days after Mel pulled out of the X-Factor final as speculation broke out online that she had been beaten up by her husband Stephen Belafonte, 39. The following night she appeared on the ITV show with viewers taking to the social networking site Twitter saying the singer had a ‘bruised and swollen face’ and was not wearing her wedding ring. Belafonte denied the claims, when contacted later in the States, saying: ‘I did not hit her, this isn’t going on, that’s not going on.’ But on Thursday the controversy over Mel B’s marriage was re-ignited when her mother Andrea Brown attacked Belafonte on Twitter. ‘Little good news 4 me lost half a stone in 1 week+ will never suffer a vile abusive 3am call from stephan Belafonti again!!’ [sic] she wrote. She later added another message, writing: ‘On average It takes 30 beatings 4 a woman to leave abusive man how sad more should b done 4 these victims!!’ In an interview with Hello! magazine this week, Mel B explained: ‘I can’t see at all out of my left eye. The lasering went wrong so this (operation) will be totally life-changing. ‘I had laser treatment done to correct (my eyes), but it started to reverse in one eye. It’s scary. ‘I’m going blind again. I had a bit of a nightmare. I was reading the autocue and then suddenly I realised that I couldn’t see properly.’ Mel, 39, pulled out of the X Factor final amid speculation she had been beaten up by husband Stephen Belafonte, which he denies . The transplant would involve doctors replacing the transparent front part of her left eye with donor tissue, under general anaesthetic. Mel B’s publicist said yesterday: ‘She was due to have it (the operation) in LA this week. ‘Mel talked about it in the Hello! interview and said she would have the operation as soon as she got back. ‘But she hasn’t returned to LA, she’s still in the UK and she’s had to postpone the surgery for now.’ The film producer Belafonte flew back ahead of Mel B with the couple’s nanny and Mel’s daughter by Jimmy Gulzar, Phoenix, 15, last weekend.","Mel B has delayed a crucial eye operation to restore her sight yesterday .

"Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accuses Ukip of failing to stand up for Britain in Brussels . Ukip politicians in Brussels are failing to stand up for Britain, Nick Clegg will claim today in an attack on the party’s MEPs for being lazy and ineffective. The Lib Dem leader will accuse Ukip MEPs of being ‘happy’ to claim generous taxpayer-funded salaries without bothering to turn up to vote. But Ukip leader Nigel Farage branded the Deputy Prime Minister a ‘hypocrite’, because he has missed four out of five votes in the Commons. Tensions between the Lib Dems and Ukip have grown as elections to the European Parliament loom in May. Mr Farage has accepted a challenge from Mr Clegg to go head-to-head in a debate on Europe in the next few weeks. But in a speech today, Mr Clegg will step up his attack on Ukip MEPs, claiming they pocket their salaries without bothering to vote on the key issues facing Britain. Mr Clegg will say: ‘Nigel Farage and deputy leader Paul Nuttall rarely turn up to vote in the European Parliament, despite being happy to take their tax-payer-funded salaries. ‘Ukip MEPs refuse to roll up their sleeves and get down to work. Nigel Farage hasn't tabled a single amendment to EU legislation since July 2009. ‘And when they’re there, UKIP MEPs don’t stand up for British interests. ‘They regularly vote against EU laws that will create British jobs, put money back in the pocket of British consumers and protect the UK from cross-border crime and terrorism.’ Ukip abstained on an EU-US trade agreement which could benefit Britain’s economy by up to £10 billion a year, voted against moves to cut mobile phone roaming charges when travelling across Europe and opposed the European Arrest Warrant, Mr Clegg will say. Ukip leader Nigel Farage accused Mr Clegg of being a 'hypocrite' because he also misses most votes in the House of Commons . Nick Clegg is to go head to head with Ukip's Nigel Farage in two broadcast debates on the European Union in the run-up to the May 22 elections to the European Parliament. Following negotiations between the parties and broadcasters, a radio debate will take place on LBC on March 26, hosted by Nick Ferrari, and a televised debate on BBC2 on April 2, hosted by David Dimbleby. The fiercely pro-European Deputy Prime Minister challenged Mr Farage to a debate a fortnight ago. The Deputy Prime Minister will also hit out at the ‘myths’ being peddled by ‘isolationists’ about the EU. He . will argue that seeing the benefits of the EU does not mean you have to . be blind to its faults - calling for the ‘wasteful’ second parliament . in Strasbourg to be scrapped. But . Mr Farage hit back, insisting Ukip's policy of engaging ‘sufficiently’ with the EU to provoke debate had proved successful - and claimed his . voting record was more than twice as good as Mr Clegg's at Westminster. ‘Our . objective as MEPs is not to keep voting endlessly for more EU . legislation and to take power away from Westminster,’ he told BBC Radio . 4's Today. Mr Farage went on: ‘Our view in 15 years has been that we engage sufficiently here and we use that information to get a debate going back in the United Kingdom. ‘It seems to me, given the debate we are now having on the European Union, that the Ukip policy has been pretty successful.’ Defending his and Mr Nuttall's record, he said: ‘Both our voting records are about 50% but we are leader and deputy leader of a national party in the United Kingdom. ‘Nick Clegg himself, who actually lives in London, has only himself voted in 22% of votes in this Parliament. ‘I am the president of a group in the European Parliament. We have put down hundreds of amendments since 2009 so factually Nick Clegg is quite wrong.’ He said: ‘I am sorry Mr Clegg, but I don't think more legislation, more power to the institutions of Brussels, is good for British jobs or good for the British economy. I think we would be far better off making our own laws.’","Lib Dem leader steps up his attack on Ukip ahead of Brussels elections .

"Ryanair's loose-cannon boss Michael O'Leary is looking for a 'brave soul' to become his new spin doctor and take on what he calls the 'worst job in PR'. The outspoken Irishman is well known for using madcap schemes to chase publicity and his current Director of Communications Stephen McNamara is leaving after 'four years of being battered and abused'. There is an upside, however, as Mr O'Leary says the successful candidate will be 'high profile and incredibly overpaid'. 'Brave soul': Michael O'Leary is looking for a new Ryanair spin doctor after admitting he 'battered' the last one for four years . But the new man or woman faces an uphill struggle as consumer champions Which? have just named Ryanair the least-popular short-haul airline based on baggage allowance, boarding, seating allocation and food and drink. And anyone who wants to take the challenge hasn't got long as applications will not be accepted after today. In a statement announcing Mr McNamara's departure to the Irish Rugby Union, Mr O’Leary said: 'We look forward to recruiting another brave soul to take on the worst job in Irish PR and look forward to grooming the next candidate to take over the high profile and incredibly overpaid position.' The statement said his spin doctor had been ‘battered and abused by Michael O'Leary on one side and the European media on the other' and ‘has decided to pursue an easier life’. Ryanair's campaigns and sometime gaffes have become legendary. In the past it has floated many controversial cost-saving ideas and decisions that have infuriated passengers. But it will still fly 79.4million passengers this year. Disliked: Ryanair is the least popular short-haul airline, according to a survey by Which? magazine released this week . The budget airline announced this year it . is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds. The latest policy will see the airline's . in-flight magazine 'Let's Go with Ryanair' being reduced from an A4 to . an A5 format and it will also double as a menu, which could save . thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used. The low-cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £400,000 in printing costs. Other . measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a . flight, and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats. Money-raising schemes have included removing conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room. The airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and replace them with extra seats. Ryanair has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two.","Stephen McNamara is leaving after 'four years of being battered and abused' by the budget airline boss .

"Saturday Night Live got a visit from a very special guest star during their holiday episode. Former cast member Mike Myers returned to the show for the cold open, and revisited one of his greatest characters of all time - Dr. Evil. Keeping things topical, Dr. Evil offered his perspective on the recent Sony hack, saying how 'pathetic' it was to see Sony and North Korea 'fight over a stupid comedy.' He then adds, 'Why pick on Sony? They haven't had a hit since the Walkman.' He's back: Mike Myers (above) returned to Saturday Night Live on Saturday, playing Dr. Evil . Pathetic: Meyers as Dr. Evil labeled Kim Jong-un as 'pathetic' for getting angry over a 'silly comedy' 'It's like watching two bald men fight over a comb,' the follicularly challenged villain then added. The comedy her was referring to was The Interview, the James Franco and Seth Rogen film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un that the studio has decided not to release. Then, after noting how close he was to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un following a recent Viking River cruise the two men took together, he took aim at the name of the hacking group - Guardians of Peace. 'There's already a G.O.P.,' said Dr. Evil, referring to the Grand Old Party. 'And thy're already an evil organization.' For more videos, please go to NBC . Having a laugh: Myers also took some time to acknowledge one of his box office failures, The Love Guru . Myers then took a moment to poke fun at himself at the end of the skit, saying; 'If you really want to put a bomb in a theater, do what I did - put in The Love Guru.' This is a reference to the actor's 2008 box office flop. Myers was not the only former cast member to stop be either, with Kristen Wiig joining Amy Adams during her opening monologue.","Mike Myers made his return to Saturday Night Live in a surprise appearance on Saturday .

"The desperation of a mother who killed her severely autistic 14-year-old son after doctors could not figure out why he was in pain has been revealed in a heart-breaking handwritten note. Dorothy Spourdalakis and her relative Jolanta Agat Skordzka, both of Chicago, were charged with first-degree murder in June after investigators said the women stabbed Spourdalakis’ son, Alex, to death in a failed murder-suicide plot. In a note that the mother wrote before trying to end her life, Spourdalakis accused the medical community of neglecting her son, keeping him restrained 'like an animal,' and treating him with psychiatric drugs that made his condition worse. Scroll down for videos . Out of options: The teen (right) required constant care, and his mother and godmother were growing desperate . Stabbed: 14-year-old Alex Spourdalakis was found dead in his bed Sunday afternoon, with several stab wounds to his chest. Above, a recent picture of Alex restrained at a hospital where he was being treated for gastrointestinal problems . Suicide pact: Dorothy Spourdalakis, 50,  and Jolanta Skrodzka, 40, planned to commit suicide after killing 14-year-old Alex. They took sleeping pills, but did not die . Special bond: Alex (right) had lived with his mother and godmother between April and June after she petitioned to remove him from a hospital . Spourdalakis removed Alex from Loyola . Gottlieb Memorial Hospital this past spring and brought him to live . with her in River Grove, Illinois, after claiming that her son was . neglected and abused at the hospital. Weeks . later, Spourdalakis and Skrodzka found themselves unable to handle the . responsibilities of providing Alex with the 24/7 care he required. Convinced . that no one could help the boy, whose condition had deteriorated since . he came to live with them, the two desperate women allegedly made a . suicide pact and decided to kill him to spare the boy further suffering. Investigators . say Spourdalakis stabbed her son in the chest several times, then . slashed his wrist, nearly severing his hand, and then took a large . quantity of sleeping pills along with Skordzka. The women, however, survived the suicide attempt and were charged with murder. A . new documentary produced by the Autism Media Channel has shed light on . the months leading up to the autistic teenager's death – a time which . his mother and godmother spent struggling to care for him around the . clock and figure out what was ailing him. While staying . at home with his caretakers, Alex , a 200-pound non-verbal autistic boy, . developed uncontrollable fits of violence, during which he would kick, . thrash about and bite those who approached him. River Grove Police Chief . Roger Loni told CBS News that it took six to eight paramedics to subdue . him. Alex's mother . believed that her son's violent behavior was caused be severe stomach . pains, but according to the woman, doctors did not provide a diagnosis. Instead, the 44-year-old mother said that her severely disabled son was . left in four-point restrains in the emergency room for 12 days. During . his confinement, the 14-year-old would often writhe in pain on the . gurney while his mother washed his feet, fed him and slept on the floor . by his side. CBS . reported that three months before Alex's death, Loyola Gottlieb Memorial . Hospital was cited for wrongly keeping the teenager restrained without . doctor's orders. Finally, . help came from a gastric specialist in New York who confirmed Dorothy . Spourdalakis’ fears when he discovered that Alex's stomach was studded . with a myriad of tiny ulcers that caused him severe pain. While . the family pursued treatment, Alex's caretakers were growing . increasingly desperate. His mother said that no hospital would keep her . son, and her insurance company refused to cover the cost of his medical . care. In one email, the . anguished woman wrote in part: 'Alex has been forgotten... I don't have . a safety net so I could help him recover.' Dorothy's attorney, Michael Botti, said of his client that she was out of options and had nowhere to go for help. Before . the woman and Alex's godmother ingested sleeping pills in a failed . attempt to end their lives, Spourdalakis left a handwritten suicide note . explaining why, in her opinion, her son was better off dead. Worst fear confirmed: The mother later found out that her son's stomach was covered in lesions that were causing him great pain . Heartbreak: The mother said that no hospital would keep her son, and her insurance company refused to cover the cost of his medical care . List of complaints: Before Spourdalakis' attempted suicide, she left this handwritten note explaining why in her opinion Alex  was better off dead . 'Alex will no longer be treated like and animal,' she wrote, 'or subjected to restraints.' The . letter noted that 'Alex will not suffer under the system 'and 'will not . be neglected and abused by the medical community any more.' The . woman also claimed that her son was being treated as 'retarded or less . than human' just because he was disabled, and that as a way of . treatment, he was being stuffed with psychiatric drugs 'that made him . crazy.' This week, . Spourdalakis was ordered held without bond. Her attorney is considering . going the route of an insanity defense in the case. Dorothy . Spourdalakis had pleaded for financial help this spring to remove her . son Alex from hospitals in Chicago, where she claimed he was neglected . and abused. Controversial British autism researcher Andrew Wakefield . personally recorded a YouTube request for help last month to find Alex a . home and said that he would be taken away from his mother if supporters . didn't act. After Wakefield's appeal, Alex left the hospital and was taken into Spourdalakis' care. Weeks . later, police say, Spourdalakis and his godmother and caretaker Skrodzka could no longer handle round-the-clock care for Alex . because they believed the 200-pound teen's 'emotional condition had . worsened' since he was removed from the hospital. Andrew Wakefield, a controversial British autism researcher, recorded a personal appeal for donations or help to have Alex removed from the hospital where he was committed in May . The Chicago Tribune reports that Spourdalakis and Skrodzka planned a suicide pact in their cramped apartment above a plumber in River Grove, Illinois. They first allegedly tried to kill Alex with sleeping pills. When that didn't work, police say, Alex's mother grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed the teenage boy multiple times in the chest as he lay in bed, according to authorities. She then allegedly slashed the boy's wrist, nearly cutting off his hand. Once Alex was dead, she handed the knife to Skrodzka, who used it to kill the family cat. A suicide note said the women killed the cat because they did not want it to go to a shelter. The pair wiped off the knife and returned it to the butcher's block in the kitchen. The detailed their actions in a suicide note, according to authorities. They then took sleeping pills with the intention of killing themselves and laid down in Alex's bedroom and locked the door, according to authorities. The boy's father, who is separated from Spourdalakis, found Alex dead and the two women barely conscious after he went to the apartment when no one answered his repeated phone calls. Round-the-clock: Skrodzka is seen feeding Alex through a straw. She also provided care for the teen around the clock . Spourdalakis, 50, and Skrodzka, 44, were taken to the hospital, where they were treated and then charged with first degree murder. 'The murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,' Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Maureen O’Brien told the Tribune. The two women had been publicly campaigning for Alex to receive better care since March, when Spourdalakis alleged in the autism activism site Age of Autism, that her son was mistreated at Loyola University Medical Center. Days later, Spourdalakis . wrote on Age of Autism that a donor had come forward and given her the . money to let her take Alex away from the hospital. She said that the . money allowed her to take Alex to get the care needed. 'We know no one will help us unless we help ourselves,' she wrote. By May, he was back in the hospital and was facing long term psychiatric commitment. Controversial British surgeon Andrew Wakefield also became involved, asking the 'autism community' to help find Alex a place to stay before he was put in 'long term psychiatric care.' He said Alex needed someone to provide a place where he could 'be on the necessary diet' and 'complete the treatment' for his autism. Wakefield has been stricken from the . British medical register. He is an autism researcher who claims to have . found a link between the measles vaccine and autism - though his . research was later discredited. 'He . needs something simple in the country where he can run around and get . the treatment that he needs so he can get better,' a beleaguered Spourdalakis said in a May interview with Autism Media Channel. No answer: When no one answered the phone, the boy's father and uncle went over to the apartment and discovered Alex dead . Interviewed: The boy's mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, was interviewed this past March when he was being kept in restraints at a local hospital. Dorothy has already issued a statement to the police but the caregiver is not cooperating . Wakefield responded to the MailOnline's story with the following statement: . 'On Sunday May 26, members of the Autism Media Channel (AMC) went to the Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois. There we visited the late Alex Spourdalakis, his mother Dorothy, and his Godmother. Alex was in four-point restraint and apparently refusing to eat or drink. His mother was beyond exhaustion and despair. The main reason for her despair was the prospect of Alex being sent to a long-stay psychiatric hospital and heavily medicated with behavior-altering drugs drugs without any treatment of his underlying medical problems. AMC issued an appeal on Alex’s behalf to protect him from this fate. We did not, at any stage, advocate for his release from the Lutheran General Hospital. The following day Dorothy informed us that the hospital could find nowhere that would take Alex and that his insurance carrier had refused to pay for any further inpatient care at the Lutheran General Hospital. It appears that, as a consequence, he was discharged from that hospital despite his precarious position and that of his carers. It is our opinion that Alex’s tragic death reflects the abject failings of a medical system that has no effective answer to the autism crisis.'","Mother Dorothy Spourdalakis campaigned for Alex to be removed from the hospital so he could receive better care .

"Hillary Clinton's once-stratospheric presidential poll numbers have begun their inevitable slide down to earth, and the leader of the 'Ready for Hillary' draft movement conceded Thursday that she's not as inspiring a candidate as President Barack Obama once was. Former Obama 2012 Battleground States Director Mitch Stewart hinted Thursday that he'll have trouble getting as excited about a Hillary 2016 effort. 'Well, you fall in love once, right?' he said Thursday in a videotaped interview. '2008 was a magical time.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mitch Stewart, who heads the Ready For Hillary PAC, suggested that Obama inspired him in ways Hillary Clinton can't . Signing books and losing ground: Hillary Clinton has slid in national polls since her memoir, 'Hard Choices' was released in June . But Hillary now has Democrats' 'best shot at winning,' he added during his interview with Politico, so the Ready for Hillary PAC's infrastructure – and, presumably, its millions of dollars – would be transferable to whoever wins the nomination. Stewart still refers to a Hillary run for the White House as a 'potential' campaign, even though his group has raised more than $6 million from 55,000-plus contributors since its January 2013 launch. There has been no public discussion about whether the donors would feel baited-and-switched if their campaign cash ended up supporting Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or any of the other Democratic hopefuls who have tested the waters in public or behind the scenes with fundraisers. 'I'm not in love, no no,' a mocking Tim Miller, executive director of the right-leaning America Rising PAC, taunted Stewart on Thursday.\ . '""I'm supporting her just because"" isn't exactly an inspiring campaign anthem.' 'Her strategists' quote encapsulates a summer where the promise of Hillary's campaign has been met with the cold, hard reality of what is sure to be a dreary slog to 2016,' Miller said. His quick-punching message group ridiculed Democrats on its website after Stewart's remarks hit the Internet, saying that while their 2008 slogans were 'Change You Can Believe In' and 'Yes We Can,' the 2016 equivalent would be 'Meh, I guess she’s our best shot.' Clinton's sense of inevitability has taken a tumble since she claimed, while promoting her slow-selling memoir, that she and former President Bill Clinton were 'dead broke' when they left the White House in 2001. Pundits contrasted that claim with the Clintons' wealth, massive speaking fees and high-flying lifestyle, turning an offhand comment into a national gaffe story. The perception that the former Secretary of State is tone-deaf has taken its toll. A McClachy-Marist poll released on Thursday shows her once robust edge against likely Republican front-runners is thinning. 'You only fall in love once': Stewart was a fixture in Obama's two presidential campaigns but now finds himself promoting a less charismatic candidate . Against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, she had a 55-39 lead in April polling, a margin of 16 points. That has shrunk just seven at 48-41. The 21-point chasm between Clinton and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, measured in February, is now just 6 points, a 47-41 edge that shows how soft her support has become. For the first time, in fact, Clinton fails to crack the 50 per cent threshold in hypothetical contests against any Republican challenger. Her 'misstatements, starting with ""we left the White House broke,"" aren't headline grabbers, but they're noticeable,' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in New York. 'With Hillary Clinton, there's no preseason,' he added. 'She needs a Super Bowl-like performance from start to finish.' No one in the GOP has emerged as a pack-leader. The Marist poll shows Bush and Christie tied at the top of a 10-person field with 13 per cent support. The 'undecided' category still beats all comers, with 24 per cent.","Former senior Obama campaign aide who runs the draft-Hillary movement suggested the former first lady lacks Obama's inspiring qualities .

"A mass of demonstrators chanting, 'Black lives matter,' converged in the Mall of America rotunda on Saturday as part of a protest against police brutality that caused part of the mall to shut down on a busy day for holiday shopping. The group Black Lives Matter Minneapolis had more than 3,000 people confirm on Facebook that they would attend. Official crowd estimates weren't immediately available, but pictures posted to social media by local news organizations showed the rotunda was full. Organizer Mica Grimm estimated about 3,000 people participated.

During the rally, protesters shouted 'While you're on your shopping spree, black people cannot breathe' - a reference to the chokehold police placed on Eric Garner, who died in New York. As they were dispersing, they walked down the hall with their arms raised, shouting 'Hands up, don't shoot!' That saying has been used in Ferguson, Missouri, in protests against the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, and in demonstrations elsewhere. Bloomington police said 25 people were arrested, mainly for reasons such as trespassing. Commander Mark Stehlik said he was not aware of any injuries or property damage. Mall representatives had warned protesters in advance that they could be removed, arrested and banned. The mall's management issued a statement Saturday saying it was ""extremely disappointed"" that protest organizers ignored the policy banning political protests. 'It's clear from their actions that these political activists were more concerned about making a political statement and creating a media event than they were about the safety of others, who came to Mall of America for an afternoon of shopping and family entertainment,' the statement said. About 30 minutes after the planned protest began, a final warning to disperse was given, and police in riot gear began clearing the rotunda, the Star Tribune reported.

The Mall of America had increased security, and certain parts of the mall were closed for some time.

The mall's statement said the east side was shut down for the safety of shoppers and retailers while police were clearing the mall. All stores had reopened by Saturday evening.

"Jose Mourinho slammed the first-half display from his Chelsea players in Maribor but ultimately blamed the Italian officials for two dropped points. Click HERE to read Matt Barlow's match report from the Stadio Judski . The Chelsea boss hauled off misfiring strikers Willian and Andre Schurrle at half-time and Luis Filipe soon after half-time, when his team were trailing to a wonderful goal from Agim Ibraimi.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was not happy with the performance of Italian official Daniele Orsato . Blues playmaker Eden Hazard missed an 85th minute penalty against the Slovenian outfit . 'In the first half we were not good,' said Mourinho. 'Very slow; no intensity, no creativity. It was easy for Maribor to control the game and reach what they wanted to reach, a 0-0. 'I tried to improve my team. When you try to improve your team, sometimes it's for tactical reasons. Other times it's for individual performances. I think I was successful with the changes I did. 'In the second half the team were much better than in the first half. I thought we played magnificently: creative, fast, good dynamic, a lot of chances to score. Only when Maribor scored did the players realise the game was in danger. 'After that, a fantastic reaction.

"Up to 60 SAS fighters are heading to Iraq to hunt down Islamic State leaders after militants started learning how to avoid airstrikes, it has been reported. The full squadron of troopers had initially been dispatched to Afghanistan for a separate operation, but have been diverted to battle Isis fanatics. There have been reports this morning that one of their primary targets will be Jihadi John, the Briton believed to have killed British and American hostages in a series of gruesome executions. Scroll down for video . There have been reports this morning that a primary target for the SAS will be Jihadi John (pictured) Up to 60 SAS fighters are heading to Iraq to fight Islamic State extremists, it has been reported (file picture) The Sun quotes a senior Whitehall source as saying: 'We made some good early progress against IS but they know how to avoid the jets now. The only way to defeat them is to get up close to them on the ground. Initially, the squadron, from Hereford, had been due to travel to Afghanistan to hunt Taliban leaders before they were ordered to turn their attentions to Isis, the newspaper reports. While hunting for top Islamic State leaders on the ground, they will also help to pinpoint targets for air strikes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman has said it does not comment on special forces operations. It comes a month after the Mail on Sunday revealed how SAS troops with sniper rifles and heavy machine guns had killed hundreds of Islamic State extremists in a series of deadly quad-bike ambushes inside Iraq. At the time, defence sources indicated that soldiers from the elite fighting unit had eliminated ‘up to eight terrorists per day’ in the daring raids, carried out during the past four weeks. The squadron, from Hereford, had been due to travel to Afghanistan to hunt Taliban leaders before they were ordered to turn their attentions on Isis (file picture) Until then it had been acknowledged only that the SAS was operating in a reconnaissance role in Iraq and was not involved in combat. But The Mail on Sunday was told that small groups of soldiers were being dropped into IS territory in RAF Chinook helicopters – to take on the enemy. Targets were said to have been identified by drones operated either from an SAS base or by the soldiers themselves on the ground, who were using smaller devices. The troops were said to be equipped with quad bikes – four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles that can have machine guns bolted on to a frame. They then hunted out IS units and were said to be attacking the terrorists using the element of surprise and under the cover of darkness. The missions were reported to have taken place on a near daily basis in the previous four weeks and the SAS soldiers had expended so much ammunition that regimental quartermasters had been forced to order a full replenishment of stocks of machine-gun rounds and sniper bullets. Isis forced to tighten its grip on foreign fighters trying to flee as morale plunges in grim reality of conflict . Islamic State extremists have executed a hundred of its own foreign fighters for trying to flee from the regime, it has been reported. Isis has set up its own military police as part of a brutal crackdown on its soldiers amid reports morale has plummeted among fighters. Dozens of militants have seen their homes raided after failing to report for duty with hundreds dragged away under arrest. Islamic State extremists have executed a hundred of its own foreign fighters for trying to flee from the regime, it has been reported (file picture) Isis bosses have even ordered militants to carry an identification document containing a strict list of regulations outlining how they must behave and setting out what mission they are assigned to. The Financial Times reports a source  as verifying that 100 foreign Isis fighters have been executed after trying to flee the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. It quotes another source as saying: 'Morale isn't falling - it's hit the ground. 'Local fighters are frustrated - they feel they're doing most of the work and dying... foreign fighters who thought they were on an adventure are now exhausted.' Many fighters are said to have been angered about being sent to the Syrian town of Kobani, which has been at the centre of a major bombing campaign by coalition forces. The jihadist group proclaimed a 'caliphate' over parts of Iraq and Syria nearly six months ago after sweeping through Iraq's Sunni heartland and throwing the country into chaos.

A wave of attacks by Isis in August against Sinjar and towards the borders of Kurdistan triggered a US intervention that has now grown into a 60-nation anti-IS coalition. The strikes were extended into Syria on September 23.

"For many, the main family holiday comes after a year of saving and anticipation. If you’re Coleen Rooney, however, almost every month seems to include its own exotic getaway. In the year from September 2013, Wayne Rooney’s 28-year-old wife enjoyed nine holidays – approximately one every 40 days – including trips to Portugal, Dubai, Barbados and the US. Scroll down for video . Escape to the sun: Holiday number one saw Coleen visiting their 5-star Algarve hotel with Wayne in September (left) and a month later she was away on an October break to Barbados with her sons (right) The fashion designer is believed to have covered around 60,000 miles travelling from the family’s £1.2million home in Macclesfield, Cheshire. Mrs Rooney, who has a personal wealth of £14million on top of her footballer husband’s £60million fortune, has not been shy about sharing her exploits with her 1.19million Twitter followers. Her jet-setting year started in Portugal last September when she and her husband stayed at the five-star Conrad Hotel in Quinta do Lago, Algarve, where a suite can cost up to £1,200 a night. The couple enjoyed the beach with sons Kai, four, and Klay, one, as Rooney recovered from a head injury that ruled him out of playing for Manchester United or England. Topping up the tan: At the family's £5million villa in Barbados this February (left), but Wayne's work keeps him in the UK. And the footballer missed out again as his wife took the boys to Dubai for a break in April (right) Family time: With the football season over, Wayne was able to join Coleen, four-year-old Kai and Klay in Portugal for holiday number five. The couple celebrated their youngest son's first birthday on the trip . Mrs Rooney tweeted: ‘Just what I’ve needed ... Some quality time with my family after a hectic summer!!! Lovely few days.’ Less than a month later she and the children were on the beach again, this time in Barbados, where the Rooneys have a £5million six-bedroom villa with an infinity pool. This time Mrs Rooney was joined by her parents, but her husband was busy elsewhere, helping England qualify for the World Cup. A relatively long break from travelling saw Mrs Rooney stay closer to home, but by February the lure of the Caribbean had taken her back to Barbados. While Rooney was busy training, Mrs Rooney and her parents took Kai and Klay to the island during the half-term break. Sightseeing: While Wayne plays in the World Cup, Coleen poses by Christ the Redeemer in June. After England's early exit from the tournament, Mrs Rooney whisked the family to Las Vegas - her friends went too . April saw her take the children on a brief trip to Dubai although, with the Premier League season still in full flow, Rooney missed out again. The following month Portugal was again the destination of choice and this time Rooney was there too as the family celebrated Klay’s first birthday on the trip. With the World Cup held in Brazil this year and her husband at the heart of Roy Hodgson’s team, Mrs Rooney was always destined to make the trip to South America. While most fans were in the country for the football, she also made sure she took in the sights, posting pictures of herself on the beach and at the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Getaway: Holiday number eight for Mrs Rooney saw her having fun with Klay in Cyprus in August. Last week, Coleen left her husband and children at home as she shopped and saw a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert in Paris . After England’s early exit from the tournament, Mrs Rooney whisked the family off to Las Vegas. Although she was dismayed to find her luggage had been ransacked, she was later spotted partying with friends at the Encore Beach Club in their own VIP bungalow with private Jacuzzi, sofas and sun loungers. The following month, and again leaving her husband at home, she took Kai and Klay to Cyprus for some quality time, tweeting: ‘Me and the kids love a holiday haha!!’ Her most recent holiday was a trip to Paris last weekend for a Jay-Z and Beyonce concert with friends.","In the year from September 2013, Mrs Rooney, 28, enjoyed nine holidays .

"The 'inconsolable' family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in a park have today spoken of their sadness that they will not see him opening his presents on Christmas Day. The family of Ashley Woolley said that his father was at home wrapping his son's Christmas presents when the 18-year-old was attacked in a park in Chelmsford, Essex, on Thursday. The statement came as a 17-year-old boy  was charged with murder and also threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place. Scroll down for video . Ashley Woolley, pictured,  was stabbed to death near his home in Chelmsford, Essex on Thursday afternoon . Mr Woolley, right,  was rushed to hospital in Chelmsford after the stabbing where he later died . Friends and family of Mr Woolley, left, have paid tribute to the 18-year-old man on Facebook . Mr Woolley died in hospital shortly after he was stabbed at Oaklands Park at 3.15pm on Thursday - just weeks before his 19th birthday. Speaking today, his family said: 'Ashley's amazing smile would light up any room that he came into and he leaves behind a loving family who have lost a part of them that can never be filled. 'At 3pm on that tragic day Ashley's dad Trevor was wrapping Ashley's presents ready for Christmas but now sadly we will never see the pleasure of him opening these presents as well as the presents he would have received from his family. 'Ashley would not want any of us to be sad but at this time it's impossible not to be.' The family said he 'lived life to the full', and enjoyed, amongst other things, free running, which they say 'would fill us with fear in case he broke something'. They added: 'Ashley's ambition in life was to finish college and to go on to university along with his loving girlfriend Charlotte who was always there to help and support him and she is devastated by the loss of Ashley. Friends and family of Mr Woolley left floral tributes to him near the scene where he was murdered . The family said it was 'very humbling' to see all the people lay flowers and pay tribute to their son. The statement continued: 'Ashley would have been 19 years old on December 30 and this is a birthday that we will never see. 'It was planned on his birthday that Ashley's dad was going to give him the gift of driving lessons. 'Ashley leaves a brother Paul who we know he loved very much and who was a major part in Ashley's life. Mr Woolley's family praised his friends for he emotional tributes they have left the murdered man . 'Paul, as are we, will be inconsolable at this very sad time especially considering that it is also coming up to Christmas and we would ask that the media respect our privacy and allow us to mourn our son in peace.' The youth charged with his murder made an appearance at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court earlier today where he was remanded in youth custody. He will reappear at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday. Essex police were called to Oaklands Park, Moulsham Street in Chelmsford at 3.15pm on Thursday, shortly after Mr Woolley had been stabbed. A 19-year-old man was arrested and later released without charge in connection with the murder . He was taken by ambulance to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital where he later died. A murder investigation was begun by detectives from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate and two arrests were made in the early hours of Friday. A 19-year-old man from Maldon who was also arrested in connection with the investigation has now been released from custody without charge. Friends and family of Mr Woolley held a vigil last night at the gates of the park where he was killed. A Facebook tribute page has been opened to remember the teenager. Paul Woolley wrote on Facebook: 'Thank you all for your kind words and support, Ashley would have been overwhelmed, it was nice to see how many hearts he touched in such a short space of time.' A family member added: 'Ash's memorial looked so good at night, thank you for all of the support that everyone has shown to his dearest family and friends. 'It has helped make today a more positive day of remembering the life that Ash lived.' Ashley Woolley was stabbed in Oaklands Park, Chelmsford, Essex, pictured, on Thursday afternoon .

"Homicide detectives have joined the investigation into the disappearance of toddler William Tyrell, the three-year-old  who disappeared from his grandmother's front yard more than three months ago. In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. Police and distraught family members hold grave fears for little William, who was dressed in his favourite Spiderman costume when he was last seen in Kendall on the mid-north cost of NSW on September 12. Scroll down for videos . William Tyrell was last seen wearing his favourite Spiderman costume when he disappeared on September 12 . More than 12 weeks on, Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that there have been no firm leads to suggest little William has been murdered but confirmed the investigation had taken a new direction. 'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now involved in the investigation. 'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister. The investigation into William's disappearance has passed the three months mark, as followers of a Facebook page set up to help find the little boy who loved fire engines topped 23,000. As Christmas is fast approaching, members of the Kendall community have set up a Christmas tree at Kendall Services and Citizens Club, decked with his most-loved superhero, devoted to William. The idea was set up by a local woman, who also runs the Facebook page called Bring Little Spiderman William Tyrell Home. As Christmas is fast approaching, Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of William Tyrell . Members of the Kendell community have set up a Christmas tree at Kendall Services and Citizens Club . Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of  William Tyrell who disappeared on September 12 . Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'. A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. State Emergency Service volunteers were among hundreds of searchers who spent nine days looking in bushland surroundings near the home . William was last seen in the front yard of his grandmother's house at Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast . Missing toddler William Tyrell did not have a tendency to wander off from his grandmother's front yard . Earlier in October, Strike Force Rosann commander Acting Superintendent Tony Joice said police wanted to interview every person who was in Kendall on September 12 to determine what they were doing and why they were there. 'If you were in the Kendall area, we need to know what you were doing, who you were visiting, what car you were driving, what you were doing there,' Acting Superintendent Joice told the Daily Telegraph. 'It's about putting the pieces together.' The search for William included police from the dog squad, officers on horseback and on trail bikes, divers, Forensic Services Group members and a helicopter. Volunteers from the State Emergency Service, Rural Fire Service, Surf Life Saving, and local citizens scoured the main search area for nine days without finding any trace of the boy. Searches combed bushland surrounding the home of missing toddler William Tyrell's grandmother . Police have spoken to everyone they could locate who was in Kendall on the day little William disappeared . After five days police conceded the boy could not have survived in bushland alone. Some ground was searched more than 10 times. Police interviewed William's sister but she was unable to provide any information about his disappearance. William's family have remained out of public view but a friend, Nicole, has made several appeals for help. She said while William enjoyed being outdoors he had no tendency to wander off. 'He is a happy, cheeky, adventurous little boy who doesn't wander off,' Nicole said. 'William is pretty much always happy. He was happy to play in the garden and be with his family.' Family friend Nicole (left) has made several appeals for help from the public to find little William Tyrell . Little William has been missing 'without a trace' for more than three months since he was last seen in Kendell . Mid-North Coast local area commander Superintendent Paul Fehon has said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about William's disappearance. William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.' Anyone with any information about William's disappearance is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.","Homicide detectives have taken over the investigation of missing toddler .

"The Mail on Sunday has uncovered a secret plan to double the time ambulances can take to reach critically ill patients. The current target is for an emergency vehicle to reach those in life-threatening situations within eight minutes. But a document seen by this newspaper reveals that the target time to get to those suffering a range of serious problems including strokes and seizures is to be increased to 19 minutes. Last night leading doctors said the scheme – designed to make it easier for ambulance services to hit targets they have missed for months – risked lives. Scroll down for video . A memo obtained by the Mail on Sunday revealed ambulance waiting times across England and Wales could be increased under a new scheme (file image) The astonishing memo – leaked by a whistleblower – reveals that the changes have been approved by NHS England, but bosses wanted implementation delayed until after the General Election in May. However, they discussed bringing the plan forward at a series of secret high-level meetings, because of ‘unprecedented pressure’ on emergency services. The revelations come as the NHS faces a wider winter crisis with top medics warning: ‘Don’t get ill this Christmas.’ This newspaper has found that: . According to the leaked document, drawn up by the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE), NHS England has agreed ‘in principle’ to relax the maximum ambulance wait for what are known as ‘Red 2’ incidents. It stated the organisation ‘had a firm position that any changes would be made after the General Election’. But earlier this month, Professor Keith Willett of NHS England called a series of tele-conferences to ‘scope the feasibility’ of relaxing the targets sooner, due to what the memo described as ‘unprecedented demand’. Each year, ambulance services deal with almost three million Red 2 incidents, deemed to be ‘serious but not the most life-threatening’. They include conditions such as strokes, seizures and many car crash situations. The document - given to the Mail on Sunday by a whistleblower - revealed plans to lengthen waiting times . The only higher category is Red 1 ‘immediately life threatening’ incidents – such as cardiac arrest, choking, and major bleeding – of which there are about 150,000 incidents a year. Doctors say it is often very hard to tell if a situation is immediately life threatening or not over the phone. Red 1 incidents are up 25 per cent compared to this time last year. Eight of England’s regional ambulance services are at a ‘severe pressure’ alert level and the other two – London and Yorkshire’ – are ‘critical’. The only higher level is ‘service failure’. As a result of the closed-door tele-conferences, at which it was ‘explicitly stressed’ that discussions should remain secret, ambulance services will get more time to assess Red 2 calls. They will get three minutes before the ‘clock starts’ on target times, rather than one minute as they do now. This change could be brought in during January. This proposal and others ‘received approval’ from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last Monday, the memo states. It means from January ambulances will have a total of 11 minutes to reach a Red 2 patient before breaching the Government target, rather than nine. The plan to change target times to 19 minutes has yet to be agreed. Last night, former NHS heart ‘tsar’ Professor Sir Roger Boyle, who helped halve deaths from heart attacks, said he believed the moves would ‘risk lives’. ‘The way to deal with the crisis is not to take longer to deal with the calls,’ he said. The AACE argues relaxing waiting times will enable more fully equipped ambulances to be sent out first time, rather than ‘fast responder’ cars, which are sometimes sent out just to meet targets. And it says giving more assessment time will also lead to ‘better decisions’ about what to send. But a senior NHS clinician said: ‘This is a degradation of the response times standard for political purposes to get everybody out of a jam.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham accused Mr Hunt of ‘moving the goalposts’ on ambulance waiting time targets. The Red 1 target – of reaching 75 per cent of such patients in eight minutes – has not been met since April. The Red 2 target has not been met since January. Mr Burnham said: ‘Rather than getting ambulance response times back up to established standards, it looks like he is running up the white flag. ‘Mr Hunt’s decision risks leaving thousands of seriously ill people waiting longer for ambulances this winter.’ Meanwhile, leading medics warned people to try to avoid ending up in hospital over Christmas if they could possibly help it. Prof Boyle said: ‘Don’t get ill over the next couple of weeks.’ He said that hospitals became ‘log-jammed’ over the extended break because it was even harder than normal to move elderly patients out of hospital, as social care workers were on holiday. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The people who are really going to feel it are older people – the frail elderly, perhaps with chest infections. These are the people who end up on trolleys for hours on end.’ Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association, said the NHS gave ‘good service to the people of this country’. But he added: ‘The fact that we can only do so, by running many hospitals on a continuous sense of crisis shows how close to the wire we are at all times.’ Amid the growing problems, virologists fear flu could soon worsen matters further, with pre-Christmas flu levels now at a three-year high, according to official figures. Last night a Department of Health spokesman said that Mr Hunt had made ‘no decisions’ yet and that the ambulance service had been given an extra £50 million to cope with this winter. Professor Willett, head of acute care for NHS England, said last night: ‘Any operational changes would need to be proposed by the senior doctors running ambulance services and agreed by the NHS nationally. 'No such decisions have been taken on their proposals, nor will they be until next year.’ My little Evie could have died if ambulance was delayed, by Prof Sir Roger Boyle . Prof Sir Roger Boyle warned the country needs more ambulances and paramedics on the road . In May, just before her first birthday, my granddaughter Evie had a fit. Then she had a respiratory arrest. South West Ambulance Service responded very, very promptly. They were there within four minutes. Evie had to be fully resuscitated by paramedics, and they saved her life. Had they taken longer to get to us, it is likely she would not have survived. Her case could have been classed as an immediately life-threatening ‘Red 1’ call, or it might not have been. It would probably have been classed as a lower priority ‘Red 2’ call, because Evie had a fit and the reason for her collapse was unspecified. The 999 call handlers would not have been able to make the distinction with an extra two minutes of conversation on the phone. ‘Red 2’ incidents like fits and stroke are still life-threatening situations, and those few minutes can mean the difference between life and death. The whole point of the National Stroke Strategy is that we should be treating stroke as an emergency. The time it takes to get treatment is as critical for stroke as it is for heart attack. So I think loosening ambulance response times is going down a very dangerous path, and will risk lives. Furthermore, it’s an admission of defeat. I have full sympathy with the ambulance services – they are under major pressure. But the way to deal with the crisis is not to take longer to deal with calls. Just as we need more beds and staff in hospitals, so we need more ambulances and paramedics on the road. This problem gets straight to the nub of where we are with the NHS at the moment. Historically, international comparisons show that – in terms of national health care institutions – the NHS is the best in the world. But it’s running into serious trouble. Not enough money is being pumped in to keep pace with ever-rising demand. Disastrous reforms brought in by former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley have not helped. We need to invest more in the health service to get the show back on the road. But is the Government prepared to do that? Evie is now 19 months old and a beautiful, healthy toddler. Yesterday, she and her parents came over for tea. As a family we cannot thank the ambulance service enough for being there, the very minute we needed them.","Ambulance crews are to be given more time to respond to incidents .

"The NSW government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy and may even consider growing its own supply. The government will work with a panel to create a a Centre for Cannabinoid Research, and with their help will decide whether medical cannabis can be sourced from overseas. If the cannabis cannot be imported, the Premier has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry in Australia. Scroll down for video . The NSW government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy . Premier Mike Baird said almost $9 million will be invested in clinical trials to see how the drug could possibly provide relief to sufferers of epilepsy and from the effects of chemotherapy. The breakthrough comes just days after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews spoke about his plans to legalise the drug. Mr Baird said the government aims to establish a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel which will include NSW Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kerry Chant, and employees from the University of Sydney. Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Baird said something needs to be done about the use of medical cannabis in Australia, if there is proof it helps sufferers. If the cannabis cannot be imported, the Premier has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry . 'Once we have the clinical evidence that medical cannabis can reduce suffering then the government will consider a range of supply measures, including importation. But if that does not prove successful then the government will assume responsibility for supply itself,' Mr Baird said. However, Dr John Lawson from Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick, told the paper that only a small number of children will benefit from this research, as some might not respond well to the drug. 'The entry criteria will be those who have failed standard treatments who continue to seize on a daily basis and mostly focused on the younger children,' he said. In August, an Australian mother, who was treating her two-year-old daughter with medicinal cannabis, was left distressed after police raided her supplier who was dobbed in to authorities by ACT. Mr Baird said the government aims to establish a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel which will include NSW Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kerry Chant (pictured), and employees from the University of Sydney. Doctors told Cherie last year that her daughter Abbey would live only a few months as a result of CDKL5, a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes, as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities. After months of failed treatment, and on the verge of admitting Abbey to a palliative care unit, Cherie bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in Canberra and snuck it into the hospital and put it into Abbey's feeding tube. The results on Abbey were astonishing, . Doctors told Cherie last year that her daughter Abbey would live only a few months as a result of CDKL5, a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes, as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities .

'The seizures were less intense, they weren't as long and she wasn't having as many of them,' Cherie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital… They were quite surprised because they didn't know what was going on. The paediatrician commented on how well she was looking.' But Cherie says it was likely Abbey would die in the next few months, after her supply of medicinal cannabis dried up. Cherie has enough medicinal cannabis to last Abbey for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in February. 'Once [the cannabis] is gone the seizures will return, there's no if and buts about it, there's a big risk of death,' she said.","Premier Mike Baird announced the government's plans to legalise medical cannabis .

"A group of MPs believe the delay in publishing the Chilcot Inquiry report into the Iraq War is part of a plot by allies of Tony Blair . A powerful cross-party move to end the ‘intolerable’ delay in the publication of the Chilcot Inquiry report into the Iraq War is being mounted by MPs who suspect it is part of a plot by allies of Tony Blair. The group of MPs, led by Tory David Davis and former Lib Dem Minister Norman Baker, are planning to table a Commons debate early in the New Year calling for Sir John Chilcot’s incendiary £10million report to be released before the General Election. Intense behind-the-scenes arguments over many of the sensitive Government documents seen by Sir John – including letters written by Tony Blair to George W. Bush – have held up the report’s publication, with many of the key players arguing that they should remain classified. But Mr Blair’s critics suspect that the objections are a ‘blocking device’ designed to delay the report until after the May poll to limit the expected political damage to Labour. The inquiry was established six years ago to provide the definitive verdict on the UK’s role in the 2003 war, covering critical questions over whether Mr Blair had legitimate grounds to go to war and the extent of post-conflict planning. It is now more than three years since Sir John held his last hearings. Mr Baker, who has written to Sir John to demand that he publishes his report, said last night: ‘Unless I can get a clear assurance from Sir John Chilcot that he is able to get his report published before the Election, I and others intend to try to force a debate and vote in the Commons early in the New Year on this important matter.’ Mr Baker and Mr Davis, the former Conservative leadership contender, are also expected to approach Labour MPs to support the motion. Last week, it was revealed that draft extracts shown to the key individuals in advance had ‘sent shockwaves’ through Whitehall, with strenuous efforts being made by those concerned to tone down criticism.

One source said: ‘It’s much more punchy than people thought it was going to be.’ If the report is not released by the end of February, Election rules will prevent its publication until after polling on May 7. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has tried to tackle the delay over the Blair/Bush letters by ruling that the ‘gist’, and not the detail, of their correspondence should be published.","MPs plan to table Commons debate calling for Iraq War report release .

"It has to be the ultimate package holiday for ambitious parents – a luxury trip abroad, complete with exam revision courses for the kids. For the first time, youngsters who once happily left their school books behind at the end of term are facing rigorous week-long courses – some complete with mock exams – during family holidays in top resorts. In the fashionable French ski resort of Val d’Isere, up to 100 GCSE and A-level students will face special Ski And Revise classes for the first time this Easter, costing parents an extra £850 a week per pupil. For the first time, youngsters who once happily left their school books behind at the end of term are facing rigorous week-long courses – some complete with mock exams – during family holidays in top resorts . Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of independent school Wellington College in Berkshire criticised the holiday programs saying children would ‘get better results in their exams if they have had a good holiday' And, elsewhere in the Alps, one high-end ski operator now offers ‘tailored tuition in the comfort of your own chalet’ as an addition to their regular ski packages. Now, other leading holiday companies are considering offering tutoring as part of their tours. But the holiday tutorials are proving controversial among educationalists, with one leading headmaster branding them ‘a waste of money’. Under the scheme in Val d’Isere – a celebrity haunt favoured by Prince Harry and Jamie Oliver – ten experienced tutors will lead 25 hours of formal revision classes over a week in a conference centre in the heart of the resort, booked through London-based company Tutor House. Hot-housed students will start three hours of classes at eight in the morning already dressed for skiing, and local ski schools will delay lessons so they do not miss time on the slopes. In the fashionable French ski resort of Val d’Isere, above, up to 100 GCSE and A-level students will face special Ski And Revise classes for the first time this Easter, costing parents an extra £850 a week per pupil. After six hours’ skiing, pupils will return to academic matters at 5pm for another two hours of revision. The courses, which will be offered for three weeks over Easter, will culminate with mock exams, followed by a feedback session with parents to assess pupils’ progress. The courses will add £850 per student to the cost of skiing at the famous resort, which can set back a family of four by as much as £8,000 a week. Parents also have the option of signing their offspring up for a single day’s tutorials at £200 each, with discounts available for siblings. GCSE core subjects such as the sciences, English and maths are catered for, as well as popular A-level topics such as economics, psychology and Spanish. Hot-housed students will start three hours of classes at eight in the morning already dressed for skiing, and local ski schools will delay lessons so they do not miss time on the slopes;  after six hours’ skiing, pupils will return to academic matters at 5pm for another two hours of revision . Meanwhile, specialist tour operator Ski Famille has been praised for its innovation after introducing private tuition from Tutor House for families staying in their chalets in 2015. Managing director Chris Thompson said their chalet-based tuition at the Les Gets resort – which costs £649 for ten hours – could reassure parents worried their children would not have enough time to study because they spent too long on the slopes, ‘even though the children might not always appreciate the service’. But Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of independent school Wellington College in Berkshire, has criticised the holiday tutorials initiative, saying: ‘It is an incredible waste of money to go on holiday and zap kids with lots of work. ‘They will get better results in their exams if they have had a good holiday. All the research suggests children are increasingly tired and stressed and they won’t work well unless they have a proper rest.’ Tutor House managing director Alex Dyer said his firm already ran holiday revision courses in London and the Val d’Isere initiative was a response to parental demand. ‘This idea has come from parents saying we want to go away as a family but we don’t want our son to mess up his GCSEs or A levels, so either he stays behind for the revision course or he comes with us and can’t do the course,’ said Mr Dyer. ‘So we thought we would provide the course where they are.’ He said he was planning to extend the courses to other resorts and had been in preliminary conversations with several companies. Mr Dyer, who expects more than a third of students on the Easter course to be from state grammars or comprehensives, admitted that some teenagers would be ‘groaning and moaning’ at the prospect of studying on holiday. ‘But once they improve their grades and get into the college or university they want, they will see why it was worth it,’ he added. A quarter of UK pupils now get some form of coaching, up from 18 per cent five years ago, says education charity the Sutton Trust.","Parents to pay £850 a week per pupil for lessons at French ski resort .

"According to popular myth, the price of Christmas gets more expensive every year - but this is not necessarily the case. A glance through a copy of the 1982 Boots Christmas catalogue shows that a video recorder cost a month's average wage, while today, a decent quality DVD recorder, will set you back, approximately half-a-week's. Figures compiled by the Office for National Statistics show that although prices are now more than three times higher than at the end of the 1980s, the cost of technology has either stayed relatively stable, or in many cases, fallen dramatically. Scroll down for video . A Ferguson video recorder similar to this cost £599 in 1982 which was the equivalent to a month's wages . In the 1980s a Braun hand blender, left, cost £9.95 (£30 in today's money) while its modern equivalent, right, costs £18.99 on the Argos website, and unlike 1982, it is possible to get it delivered home with one click . A Braun hand blender, which would have seemed exotic, in time before the television schedules were packed with cookery shows, cost £9.95 - which when inflation is taken into account - would be worth in the region of £30 today. An equivalent version today costs about £18.99 on the Argos website, although shoppers in 1982 did not get the option of Click and Collect. In 1982 a Ferguson VHS video recorder  was a highly desirable piece of equipment as it allowed people the flexibility to record live television and return to it at a later date. What made it inaccessible to many, was the price of £599. In today's money, that would be around £1,830. Workers earned on average £136.50, which meant that you would have to work for more than four weeks to afford the video recorder. Today, the VHS recorder is no longer available following the increase in popularity of DVD systems. A Sony DVD recorder with a hard drive can be bought for less than £200. As the average wage is around £480, the new DVD machine can cost a few days' pay - although for the true bargain hunter, simple DVD players can be purchased for just £30. For children waking up on Christmas morning there was rarely a better sight than a £95 Atari (£300 today) Over the years, the basic shape may be similar, and at around £350, is broadly similar in price to the Atari . A generous parent who paid almost £100 for an Atari soon realised that if they did not want to miss the next thrilling episode of The Professionals, they often had to spend a further £180 for a 14-inch portable television . Paul O'Donnell, of the Manufacturing and Technologies Association told The Guardian: 'The big trend over the last 30 years has been the globalisation of manufacturing. Production that would have been done in the UK, Europe or North America has moved to the far east. That started taking prices down and it really got turbo-charged in the 90s.' The early 1980s led to the production of a range of electronic educational gifts for children, with gadgets such as Texas Instruments' Speak and Spell, worth £33.95 - around £100 today. Now any parent can download an emulator app for their smart phone. However, the most envied children were those who returned to school in January 1983 with tales of a new Atari video games system. Their parents had to pay £95 - almost £300 today. No games system was complete without a few cartridges such as these which cost around £25 (£77 today) Meanwhile, today's high-tech video games cost in the region of £50-60, which is slightly cheaper than 1982 . While people may remember the Atari, the gold standard machine of the time was the Mattel Intellivision video computer which cost £150 - almost £470 today. The children would quite happily plug their games system into the back of the £260 20-inch colour television in the living room (£800 today) but that could cause discord. Parents who treated their children to a video games system were often forced to buy a second television, because unless they had their rather expensive video recorder, they would miss out on the latest episode of The Professionals. Instead, many parents decided the simpler option was to pay £180 for a 14-inch portable (£560 today), which they could set up in their bedroom. Today a Playstation 4 or XBox One cost between £350-£400, while an 50-inch LG Smart TV costs £499, while a 40-inch JVC LED tv costs £199. In 1982, educational toys such as Speak and Maths were very popular, but are now free mobile phone apps .","A Ferguson VHS video recorder would set you back £599 at Christmas 1982 .

"Just days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation, an anonymous caller rang the Australian National Security hotline to alert authorities to the website of Man Haron Monis. Australia's Intelligence Organisation has revealed they received a call around two days before the deadly siege, advising them to 'take a look at this man's website'. The caller did not suggest Monis was planning a terrorist attack, had a weapon or that he planned to take any hostages. The call to the security hotline will be a key component of the review ordered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott to establish more clarity about the terrifying incident, reports the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Just days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation, an anonymous caller rang the Australian National Security hotline to alert authorities about Man Haron Monis . It was reported that ASIO examined Monis's website, which features rambling posts about terrorism fuelled protests in Martin Place, as a result of the call. Monis had numerous social media websites, including a Twitter and Facebook account-the latter of which had 14,000 'likes'-which he used to preach extremist jihadist views. It comes after the revelation that Monis may have initially planned to attack the offices of Channel Seven in a terrorist attack. In 2009, Channel Seven's Today Tonight show exposed Monis for sending abusive 'condolence' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. The program, which labelled Monis a 'Fake Sheik', led to the conviction of he and wife Amirah Droudis in the High Court over the letters. On several occasions after the program aired, Monis protested on the steps outside the Seven Studio with pro-Islamic leaflets. In the early hours of Monday morning, it's understood the gunman walked around Martin Place before entering the Lindt Cafe and sitting for up to an hour before taking customers and staff hostage. Australia's Intelligence Organisation has revealed they received a call within 48 hours of the deadly siege, advising them to 'take a look at this man's website' One of Monis' former lawyers encountered the man in the cafe by chance on Monday morning and described his behaviour as distinctively calm. 'He was cool as a cucumber, not agitated, not scoping the place out, not looking over his shoulder,' said the lawyer. 'He kept asking, 'Why are you here?'. I think he was genuinely surprised to see me there.' The evidence comes after reports that the siege gunman told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week. Man Haron Monis also wrote letters to Qantas's chief executive in 2009 suggesting he had information about sabotage at the airline that would lead to mass casualties. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has launched a major investigation into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list  despite numerous examples of extremist views and behaviour, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Man Haron Monis told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week . The scenes after the shootout that resulted from a 17 hour siege that saw Monis seize control of a busy café in Martin Place and hold staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours . In one post on his website, Monis writes about a meeting alleges he had with New South Wales police in 2008 in which he said one of the detectives asked him about a protest outside the Seven Network studios in Martin Place against the way the network's program Sunrise had reported a terrorist attack overseas. The protest was carried out by Monis' wife, Amirah Doudis. According to the post, Monis was asked by police if he planned further protests in Martin Place, to which he replied: 'Well, it depends if the Australian government condemns the terrorist comment which was broadcast by Sunrise (then) I don't have to continue but if the Attorney-General doesn't condemn Channel 7 for its terrorist act I believe it is my religious duty to continue.' Siege victim Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the shootout that resulted from the 17 hour incident . The revelations comes as a major investigation called by Prime Minister Tony Abbott gets underway into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list in 2009 . He wrote that he also told police during the discussion: 'If our fair defence against your unfair attack is called terrorism we are proud to be called terrorists.' The Seven studio is immediately opposite the Lindt café on Martin Place that Monis raided this week. A separate post in August 2008 revealed Monis writings to then-Qantas chief executive office Geoff Dixon. Monis wrote to Mr Dixon: 'I have sent you a letter warning dated July 28 about upcoming technical problems which will be caused deliberately by some people within Qantas. '.. if you do not take my warning seriously Qantas will witness similar technical problems. .. if you keep ignoring my offer for sharing information you will be responsible for the death or injury of people..' Qantas reportedly referred Monis' letters to Australian Federal Police at the time. Monis was also on bail for a long list of charges, including sexual offences, conspiracy to murder his ex-wife and a series of abhorrent letters. In September 2013, Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service for a series of letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009. In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell. Amirah Droudis, the wife of the café gunman, is pictured in these photographs with her former partner. Monis was on bail on a charge of conspiring Ms Droudis to murder Noleen Hayson Pal . Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis (pictured) Monis was also on bail on a charge of conspiring with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, who is allegedly a Muslim convert, to murder Noleen Hayson Pal. Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis. Monis and Amirah Droudis were arrested on November 15 last year and charged. Monis also had outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'. He was due in court due in court in February next year for the sexual assault charges, which included 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault against seven women, including one 27-year-old who answered his ads placed in ethnic Sydney newspapers. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has questioned that why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists . Speaking to ABC, Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned  why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists. 'These are the questions that we'll be having our officials ponder because he was a person who had been of interest to our security agencies,' Mr Abbott said. 'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism.' The Prime Minister said Monis was inadequately dealt with, and that the events of the siege should serve as a grave learning lesson. He announced an urgent review to examine why  Monis had access to firearms and why he was granted citizenship in Australia.","Anonymous caller rang National Security hotline about Man Haron Monis .

"Young Britons are heading straight to overextended Accident & Emergency departments because they are unable to get suitable appointments with GPs, according to a new report. It comes as waiting times in A&E departments hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours. A report by Citizens Advice found people aged 18 to 34 are more than twice as likely to visit A&E departments or walk-in centres than those aged 55 and over. Scroll down for video . Young Britons are heading straight to overextended Accident & Emergency departments because they are unable to get suitable appointments with GPs . The report revealed that one in eight people (12 per cent) aged between 18 and 34 has gone to A&E or an NHS walk-in centre when they have not been able to get a GP appointment - but the number was only one in 17 among people aged 55 or over. The charity’s analysis of NHS GP Patient Survey data found young adults are also much less likely than older people to be able to see a GP when they need to. Based on answers from 900,000 people across England, the report found younger adults were more than twice as likely to not be able to secure an appointment with their GP at a convenient time as those aged 65 and over. It also found levels of satisfaction and trust in their family doctors were radically lower than among elderly people, with less than a third rating them as 'very good'. In contrast, people aged 75 are twice as likely to rate their service as 'very good'. Citizens Advice said the findings showed that access to GPs 'isn't meeting the needs of younger adults'. It comes after figures released earlier this week showed hospital waiting time targets were being missed as they struggle to cope with a record number of admissions. One in eight people aged between 18 and 34 has gone to A&E or an NHS walk-in centre when they have not been able to get a GP appointment - but the number was only one in 17 among people aged 55 or over . NHS England said just 89.8 per cent of patients were seen within four hours last week, compared with the target of 95 per cent. More than 10,000 patients were forced to wait longer than four hours for a bed once a decision was made to admit them into hospital from A&E. Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'GP services need to keep up with 21st century lifestyles. 'Long working hours means it can be difficult for younger adults to get an appointment with a GP, let alone one at a convenient time. 'As a result some people are struggling to access the medical advice they need. 'It is in the NHS' interest to get primary healthcare for younger adults right and ensure services fit around busy working lives. 'A failure to meet their needs piles more pressure on budgets and is an inefficient use of scarce NHS resources. Dr Barbara Hakin, of NHS England, has urged the public not to go to A&E or call an ambulance unless it is a genuinely urgent case . 'Many GPs are already transforming the way they provide services and embracing new technologies. It is vital that they keep up with how people of all ages want to engage with public services including healthcare.' Citizens Advice said almost 4,500 people contacted the charity last year with issues about GP services. It found that 30 per cent of young adults surveyed had found their experience of GPs to be 'very good', compared with 64 per cent of those aged 75 and over. One in seven people (14 per cent) aged 18 to 34 could not see a GP last time they tried to make an appointment. One in eight (13 per cent) of younger adults did not get any professional help for a health problem after being unable to see their GP. Dr Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Operations for NHS England, said: 'Pressures on our A&E services continue to increase significantly. 'We have admitted more people to hospital this week to take care of them than in any previous week on record. I want to pay tribute to the staff dealing with that – they are doing a brilliant job. 'While we are now below the extremely high waiting time standards that we set ourselves, the service we provide remains robust. 'The NHS’s waiting times for urgent treatment are among the best for any major country that measures them. 'Looking ahead, we need to transform the NHS so it is better able to cope with demand, as set out in the NHS Five Year Forward View. 'We have today set out how we plan to drive this forward next year, allocating additional NHS funding to every part of the country. 'As we come into the holiday period, it is important people continue to look after themselves and nip problems in the bud. They should ensure they have proper medication, get their flu jab if they have not done so, and get advice from their pharmacist.' The study suggests the NHS is still unable to cater for a working population that wants family doctors to be available at times to fit in with the lives of busy working people. Fifty walk-in centres have shut down since 2010, and there are now only 185 left in England. From January 2015, GPs will be allowed to move away from the catchment area approach to registering patients. This means that GPs can choose to register patients near their place of work rather than near their homes, though they won’t have to offer this option. And as of March next year, all surgeries must have an online booking system, instead of the specific times at which to call to make appointments that many GP surgeries have.","People aged 18 to 34 twice as likely to visit A&E than those aged over 55 .

"It was the very definition of event TV, holding the nation rapt until its jaw-dropping climax when Olivia Colman’s police detective learned her husband was the killer. And now the second series of Broadchurch is set to grip us all over again. The feverishly anticipated drama is surrounded by an unprecedented wall of secrecy – no one in the Press is being shown episodes beforehand, and even stars Colman and David Tennant are in the dark. But after an exclusive interview with creator Chris Chibnall, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the show starting on Monday, January 5, has even more heart-stopping twists than series one, which kept ten million viewers on tenterhooks as DS Ellie Miller (Colman) and DI Alec Hardy (Tennant) hunted the killer of 11-year-old Danny Latimer. Scroll down for video . The second series of Broadchurch will hit the nation's screens on January 5 and is set to grip us all over again . The feverishly anticipated drama is surrounded by an unprecedented wall of secrecy and even stars Olivia Colman and David Tennant are in the dark . Fans know Miller and Hardy will return and that Danny’s death still casts a shadow over the Dorset town. But ITV refuses to reveal more and trailers declaring, ‘Same town, new secrets’ only add to the mystery. Chibnall said: ‘Brace yourself for upset and shock. My 11-year-old son has been begging me but I won’t let him watch series two. It’s too upsetting. It features the cheekiest cliffhanger yet – a real shocker. ‘I want people on the edge of their seats, gripped, and they will be. If you love these characters you will really, really want to watch every second.’ Here The Mail on Sunday presents an exclusive glimpse into the characters, locations and plots set to get us hooked a second time. Chibnall cast Charlotte Rampling after seeing her in a video installation by Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen. ‘She was so lively and mischievous but also tough and steely and I thought, that’s such a match for how I see this character.’ She plays Jocelyn Knight, who may have seen Danny arguing prior to his death. In one scene, she stands pensively near where he was found. Rising star Phoebe Waller-Bridge (left) plays Abby Thompson, while Eve Myles (right), of Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, is cast as Claire Ripley . Oscar-nominated Marianne Jean-Baptiste (left) plays the pivotal role of Sharon Bishop, while Charlotte Rampling (right) plays Jocelyn Knight . Marianne Jean-Baptiste sprang to fame in 1996 drama Secrets & Lies, winning an Oscar nomination. Her casting is a coup, and her character, Sharon Bishop, is certain to have a pivotal role. Eve Myles, of Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, is cast as Claire Ripley, and rising star Phoebe Waller-Bridge is Abby Thompson. But the greatest mystery surrounds Meera Syal, who is making a dramatic departure from the comedies for which she is best known – such as Goodness Gracious Me and The Kumars At No 42. ITV is refusing to release any details about her. A blue clapperboard chalet plays a key part in series two. Chibnall said: ‘That house holds lots – if not all – of the secrets . . . You will first see it in the first minute of episode one.’ The home is 200 yards from the beach where Danny’s body was found. But who owns it? And just what dark deeds took place there? A mysterious blue clapperboard chalet, 200 yards from the beach where Danny's body was found, plays a key part in series two . In the trailer, a tearful DS Miller (Colman) struggles to cope with her husband’s guilt. To make matters worse, she and Hardy are facing another abduction case, involving two girls. A desperate Hardy tells Miller: ‘I can’t do it on my own.’ And Miller demands of two unseen characters: ‘Where were you both the night those girls disappeared?’ Chibnall commented: ‘I wouldn’t have made Broadchurch 2 without David or Olivia.’ Danny's mother Beth (Jodie Whittaker) is expecting another child but Joe Miller’s trial forces her to relive her son’s death amid a media frenzy. Chibnall said: ‘Jodie asked me around episode six of series one, “Am I a grieving mother or a secret killer crying crocodile tears?” I told her it wasn’t her, but only then.’ Chris Chibnall filmed several endings and the cast signed gagging clauses to stop them giving anything away . Fans know Miller and Hardy will return and that Danny’s death still casts a shadow over the Dorset town . A distraught DI Hardy watches events in a graveyard – fuelling speculation that Danny’s body is exhumed for the trial. Chibnall said: ‘What I didn’t want to do is start with another dead body beneath the cliffs and two detectives going, “Oh my god it’s happened again. What are the chances?” But equally it’s a thriller, it needs to have twists, it has a propulsive engine of a plot.’ DS Miller is seen clutching a card with bluebells on it, while in the trailer, a man stands in a field of the flowers. But what lies behind – or beneath – the superficially beautiful tableau? Devotees of Broadchurch know to expect the worst. Chibnall filmed several endings and the cast signed gagging clauses to stop them giving anything away. He said: ‘Even David Tennant is in the dark... He was both offended and pleased. That’s how I like to keep them. You make a show and keep the secrets as long as you can. It’s like releasing an animal into the wild.’","Broadchurch is set to return the nation's screens from January 5 .

"PC Neil Doyle, 36, died after an early morning assault on a group of three officers near a city centre nightclub - just weeks before his honeymoon . The wife of murdered off-duty police constable Neil Doyle has described his death as 'a great loss' as it emerged a second man has been arrested on suspicion of his murder. Pc Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was attacked in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of yesterday morning during a Christmas night out with colleagues. Last night a 28-year-old man from Huyton was arrested on suspicion of murder after he handed himself in, Merseyside Police said. This evening a second man, from the same area, was also arrested on suspicion of murdering the police officer. The 30-year-old man was taken to a police station to be interviewed by detectives. The 28-year-old is still being questioned. The officer's wife, Sarah, 37, said: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all. 'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' The couple got married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month. A post-mortem examination concluded that Pc Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain. This was caused by damage to major blood vessels supplying the brain and is consistent with an assault. Pc Doyle was with two other off-duty officers when they were attacked by three men in Colquitt Street at around 3.15am. The attackers vanished when it became clear that Mr Doyle was seriously hurt. Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived. His colleagues were both treated in hospital for facial injuries - one for a fractured cheekbone and the other for a less serious facial injury. Pc Doyle was attacked in Liverpool city centre near Aloha club during a Christmas night out with colleagues . Two other off-duty policemen, who were with the victim and were also assaulted, were taken to hospital but have since been discharged . A Merseyside Police spokesman said detectives were investigating the possibility that the officers were recognised from their work. 'It's one line of inquiry that we are looking at but it's by no means the set-in-stone motive,' he said. Pc Doyle, who joined the force in May 2004, was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital after the attack, but died a short time later. The officer was previously awarded a commendation for his actions in arresting three men after a violent robbery. He was based at Eaton Road police station in West Derby. Peter Singleton, chairman of Merseyside Police Federation, said the police community was 'devastated' by Pc Doyle's death. 'Devastated is the nearest word I can think of,' he said. 'His family, friends and colleagues are absolutely devastated. I spoke to the colleagues who were out with him and they were in absolute bits. 'He exemplified the British bobby. He was a solid, good, hard-working, honest copper. Losing a colleague like Neil in such a tragic way is absolutely devastating.' He added: 'He had commendations from the force for his good work. Sometimes it seems hollow and false to say these words but he really was a good, skilled, dependable cop, who would always do his best for the public. 'If you're a sergeant, police constables like Mr Doyle are exactly what you want. He will be sorely missed.'

"Tributes and condolences are flowing through social media in the wake of the tragedy of eight children after they were found stabbed to death in their home on Friday morning. The tight-knit community of Cairns has set up a Facebook group called Children of Murray Street, which has more than 7,000 followers since it was created less than 24 hours ago.

A woman, 37, believed to be the mother of seven of the children, was also rushed to hospital in a critical condition  but was assisting police. Grieving residents of Manoora, which has been described as a 'tight-knit community', gathered to pay their respects at the park, while friends and relatives visited Cairns City Church.

'To say this has been a dreadful week is almost an obscene understatement: the Sydney siege; an 18 year old taken by a shark off Pt. Douglas; the Pakistan school massacre; and on Friday’s 1pm radio news the headline that eight children had been stabbed at a Cairns suburb - Manoora. And all this in the week before Christmas,' the statement said. 'Yet, as we saw in the aftermath of the Sydney siege, the very worst some people can do - may bring out the very best in so many more.'

"NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has revealed his wife and daughter were inside Sydney's Lindt cafe just an hour before gunman Man Haron Monis began his deadly siege last Monday. Mr Scipione said his wife Joy and daughter Emma were with him in central Sydney that morning 'to do a little bit of Christmas shopping'.

He said his wife and daughter left the cafe 'about an hour before' Monis, a self-styled Iranian cleric, entered the cafe in Martin Place around 10am, taking 18 people hostage. Monis was killed in the ensuing gun battle with police 16 hours later. Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, also died in the siege. 'The irony is that they were shown through the shop - all of the chocolates, all of the things you would go there for - by Tori Johnson,' he said. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has revealed his wife and daughter were in the Lindt Cafe an hour before the gunman began his siege. They were shown through the shop by Tori Johnson . He said his wife Joy had been 'reflecting' on Mr Johnson since his death. 'He was so open and so caring, he was very, very warm (and) friendly, and he's no longer with us,' Mr Scipione said. 'That still causes many a tear to flow, and she (Joy) has been emotional.' The commissioner said he didn't think Monis, who was on conditional bail at the time of the attack, should have been at large in the community.

She was a mother-of three and was a highly regarded Barrister . 'Was I frustrated? Yes. Was it something that we would have preferred not be the case? Absolutely. The police refused bail on two occasions previously,' he said. Commissioner Scipione also defended how officers brought the siege to an end. He said if police could have used a sniper to end the siege, 'they probably would have done it I would think, rather than risk going through the door, not knowing what they were confronting'.

He said the tactical operations officers stormed into that cafe just after 2am on Tuesday, not knowing if there were explosives in the gunman's backpack. 'I'm sure that when this story does unfold through the coronial process Australia will be proud of what these young men did,' Mr Scipione told 2GB. 'That day they did more than save 16 people, they actually drove a stake into the footpath in Martin Place that says we stand for what's right, we stand for freedom and we are going to do all we can to ensure this nation remains a free nation.'

"Catholic churches across the country are being forced to abandon their traditional midnight Mass on Christmas Eve because of drunken louts disrupting the popular services. The services start on the stroke of midnight and are popular among mass goers as they are the first services of the Christmas festival. According to a survey of 50 priests across England and Wales, many are reporting that fewer parishes will be offering midnight Mass this year, while others have been forced bring forward the service several hours. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis, pictured, will be saying Midnight Mass at St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican which is traditionally the first service of Christmas and is popular among Catholics across the world . The Tablet, a Catholic newspaper, conducted a survey of 50 groups of parishes across England and Wales over they would be holding a traditional service at midnight on Christmas Eve. The services, which date back more than 1,500 years, normally begin with carols before the Mass begins. During the Mass, the priest will complete the nativity scene in the church by placing the baby Jesus in a crib, representing his birth. However, according to the survey many priests complain that the services are being interrupted by drunken louts, with one reporting that he witnessed a streaker during Mass. Monsignor David Hogan, parish priest of St Bernadette’s, in Nunthorpe, Middlesbrough, claimed that only one quarter of all churches offer the traditional service. Westminster Cathedral, pictured, continues to have its incredibly popular midnight Mass although some parishes have been forced to abandon theirs because of drunk people interrupting the service . He said: 'Last time we had it, we ended up with a drunk trying to get the doors off the church. So we’ve made the decision not to have Mass when people are pouring out of the pubs sloshed.' Canon Alan Sheridan of St George's parish in York admitted that he moved his midnight service to 8pm after a streaker ran through the church. He said: 'We are on the main drag into town so people are coming straight from the pub and it can make Mass very difficult.' Some of the priests complained that parishioners were seeking an earlier Christmas service so they could 'get on with Christmas' and get the religion bit out of the way. Fr Michael Marsden of Our Lady of Lourdes in Middlesbrough diocese added: 'Going to Midnight Mass at Christmas used to be one of the hallmarks of being a Catholic; it is sad if that is changing.'","Midnight Mass has been a tradition for Catholics in Britain for 1,500 years .

"Schools Minister David Laws became the first high-profile member of the Coalition to support the move . Every child could leave school with essential lifesaving skills after Ministers backed a Mail on Sunday campaign to add first aid to the curriculum. Schools Minister David Laws became the first high-profile member of the Coalition to support the move, piling pressure on Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to introduce mandatory training for first aid in schools. Mr Laws said the crucial skills should be taught as a compulsory part of Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) lessons, which also cover sex education, anti-bullying and careers advice. The newspaper is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first aid techniques – simple acts that could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. Our campaign now has cross-party support and is also backed by teachers and a number of leading charities. Mr Laws said: ‘Parents expect to see some basic standards laid out on what their children will learn in school. All children should leave school with the essential skills and knowledge that prepares them for life. ‘Liberal Democrats are clear that all schools should teach Personal, Social and Health Education, and that we would expect that to include first aid.’ Mr Laws’s statement comes after Lib Dems voted in October to include mandatory first aid training in schools in their latest manifesto. Tory Health Minister Earl Howe has also voiced his support, saying: ‘First aid is a highly valuable, potentially lifesaving skill and I encourage schools to teach pupils first aid through their PSHE lessons.’ Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on first aid, said he hoped the other two main parties would also add the proposals to their pre-Election manifestos. ‘Mr Laws is considering these proposals,’ he said. ‘Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he sees this as part of the preventative agenda.’ Other politicians backing the plans include Labour’s Julie Hilling and Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris. Ms Hilling said: ‘This is as essential as learning to read or write. Learning to save a life is precious.’ Charities including St John Ambulance and the British Heart Foundation are also behind the scheme. BHF chief executive Simon Gillespie said: ‘A future government will need to play its part by making CPR part of the curriculum – a move that already has the support of the public, teachers and doctors.’","Every child could leave school with essential lifesaving skills after Ministers backed campaign to add first aid to curriculum .

"The memory of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson will be immortalised through a charity set up by her family to encourage education opportunities for women. The family confirmed today that the Katrina Dawson Foundation had been registered, honouring the achievements of Ms Dawson, 38, who was described as one of the 'best and brightest barristers' at the NSW Bar before her untimely death. Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege on Tuesday would not prevent her legacy from living on. Scroll down for video . The family of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson have confirmed that a charity has been set up in her name . 'As the city's poignant and continuing tribute to her and Tori Johnson shows, even people who did not know her do not wish the end of her life to be the end of her good work,' Mr Dawson, a well-known Sydney barrister, said today. The Foundation was established to 'preserve and honour the memory of Katrina Dawson and all she achieved'. Former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce has been reported to be the founding member of the charity, with the move coming on the heels of a memorial fund for Mr Johnson. 'The foundation's focus is particularly appropriate because education, and particularly women's education, was something incredibly important to Katrina and in which she achieved true excellence,' said Mr Dawson. Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege on Tuesday would not prevent her legacy from living on . During her school career, Ms Dawson scored a perfect 100 in her HSC, attending Ascham Girls School in Edgecliff, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. The school is planning to plant a tree in her memory, with the principal of the school revealing that her Details of the devoted mother-of-three have emerged in the wake of the week's tragic events, which claimed the lives of three people, including Ms Dawson, Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson, and gunman Man Monis.

Ms Dawson was killed after hostages staged an escape attempt around 2am on Tuesday morning. 'Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met,' Ms Taylor said. 'She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant. 'Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me. he invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her.

'My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love.' Ms Taylor said she had also taken comfort from the huge outpouring of public support - particularly from the huge flower memorial that has been established in Martin Place.

Among the messages was a note written by Ms Dawson's youngest daughter, Sasha, which said simply: 'I love you mum. Love Sasha'. The coroner released Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson's bodies to their families on Thursday night, who are beginning the process of planning memorial services for the dead.

"Keith Vaz said Britain's immigration system had entered 'intensive care' A backlog of more than 390,000 immigration cases has been built up by the Home Office – equivalent to the population of Cardiff. The figure is revealed in a report from MPs that describes Britain’s immigration system as being in ‘intensive care’. Earlier this week, chief inspector of immigration John Vine said that the number of missing migrants in the UK was 89,000. But the Home Affairs Select Committee said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system – including asylum seekers and foreign criminals. Chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘This brings the total number of unresolved immigration cases to 393,222, which is more than the population of Cardiff.’ The revelation comes as separate figures show a record 3,000 immigrants a month being caught trying to sneak into the country illegally. The Home Office disclosed that 11,920 entry attempts were detected at Calais and British ports in April to July of this year alone – equivalent to almost 100 a day. And last night it emerged that rather than deporting the stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to make new attempts at breaching Britain’s borders. On the backlog, Labour MP Mr Vaz added: ‘Our immigration system has left A&E and has entered intensive care.’ In its latest report on the work of the Home Office’s immigration directorates, the committee also hit out at the Government’s use of a single immigration target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000. The target – which the Government now has no chance of achieving, with net migration running at 260,000 – is labelled ‘too blunt’ and ‘arbitrary’. Scroll down for video . Chief inspector of immigration John Vine said the number of missing migrants in the UK was 89,000, but the Home Affairs Select Committee said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system . The Home Office disclosed that 11,920 entry attempts were detected at Calais (pictured) and British ports in April to July of this year alone . The report states: ‘An arbitrary target set by ministers, however well-intentioned, only serves to reduce public confidence in the ability of any government to deliver a future pledge on immigration.’ The MPs also hit out at the Home Office and Theresa May for sitting on Mr Vine’s reports. A string of explosive investigations by the inspector have been delayed for months. Ministers have been accused of slipping them out on busy days in order to try to bury bad news. The committee said: ‘It is unacceptable for the Home Office to withhold from public view reports produced by the independent chief inspector of immigration and borders for longer than one month without providing a good reason.’ The Home Office was facing accusations of pandering to political correctness after saying foreigners sneaking into Britain should not be referred to as illegal immigrants. Instead they should be called ‘clandestine entrants’. The term emerged after borders chief John Vine described them as ‘irregular migrants’ in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme. Referring to inspection reports on the immigration system, he said: ‘These people … very often succeed in getting into the UK as irregular migrants, the authorities in Britain have no record of who they are.’ The Home Office later said the preferred term was ‘clandestine entrants’. A spokesman said: ‘If you say “illegal immigrants” there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong. There are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods, for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups.’","Backlog of more than 390,000 immigration cases built up by Home Office .

"It was, perhaps, Britain’s greatest military victory – the ferocious confrontation that finally ended the tyrannical reign of Napoleon Bonaparte. Yet 200 years after the Battle of Waterloo, astonishingly there is still no memorial on the site to commemorate the remarkable bravery of the British troops who fought and died there – although there is a memorial to the defeated French. Now that injustice is finally about to be righted. A monument designed by sculptress Vivien Mallock will be opened on the battlefield in Belgium next year. Victory: The memorial depicts British soldiers struggling to close the gates at Hougoumont . The work will feature two British soldiers and quotes from the Duke of Wellington, who led the British forces, one reading, ‘Next to a battle lost the greatest misery is a battle gained’, the other saying, ‘Never was a place more fiercely assaulted nor better defended’. Standing just over 6ft high, the memorial commemorates the moment when a predominantly British contingent of 4,000 soldiers defended the pivotal location of Hougoumont Farm and its surroundings from a vastly superior French force. The lack of an official memorial for British troops has been a sore point for decades and has fuelled speculation that successive British governments and the Belgium authorities have been reluctant to push the issue for fear of upsetting the French. By contrast, the French have had a memorial on the site – called The Wounded Eagle – since 1904. A political impasse that had long delayed the construction of a British memorial was recently solved when the Belgian authorities agreed on condition that Project Hougoumont, the charity behind the memorial, raised the funds necessary to restore the farmhouse that was at the centre of the Hougoumont fighting and turn it into a state-of-the-art visitor centre. The property had fallen into a state of disrepair, despite being protected under Belgian law. It was perhaps Britain’s greatest military victory – the ferocious confrontation that finally ended the tyrannical reign of Napoleon Bonaparte. Pictured, a painting of the action . The fundraising, which is now complete, included a £1 million donation from the British Government. Both the farmhouse and the memorial will open to visitors from June. Barry Van Danzig, chief executive officer for Project Hougoumont, said the memorial was to commemorate every British soldier who had fought and died at Waterloo. ‘It is now 200 years since the Battle of Waterloo and there are monuments on the field to the Prussians, the French, the Dutch and the Hanoverians,’ he said. ‘In fact, every nation that was there is commemorated except the British. ‘It is absolutely right that these magnificent men are commemorated and we have been very proud to have played our part.’ Hougoumont Farm was pivotal in the Battle of Waterloo, which took place in June 1815. It was almost captured by Napoleon’s forces when a French lieutenant smashed through its North gate with an axe. Forty French troops made it on to the site but the enemy advance was halted when a handful of British troops rushed headlong into the group to repair and close the gate. All the Frenchmen who made it into the farm were eventually killed, with the exception of a drummer boy. The farmhouse’s restoration includes a new North gate made of timber supplied from Petworth, the Sussex home of Lord Egremont, who is a descendant of Henry Wyndham, a lieutenant involved in the brave struggle to close the breached gate at the farm.","200 years on, there is still no memorial on the site to commemorate the bravery of British troops who fought and died there .

"Lost battle with cancer: Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn died last night aged 63 . David Cameron has led tributes to Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn, who died last night aged 63 after losing his battle with bowel cancer. The Prime Minister said the West Midlands MEP had a 'truly admirable' dedication to public service and was a 'well-respected' politician. Mr Bradbourn, who had served in the European Parliament since 1999, was diagnosed with bowel cancer shortly after being re-elected in May and died last night. Mr Cameron said: 'Philip's dedication to public service was truly admirable - he was a well-respected and effective MEP. 'In a political career which spanned over four decades, he showed great passion in serving both the party and his constituents. My thoughts are with Philip's family at this sad time.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Philip was a loyal and dedicated member of the party since he was a teenager, holding a vast variety of local and national positions over many years. 'Born and bred in the Black Country, he took immense pride in championing the West Midlands in his role as member of the European Parliament. 'He will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues in the party.' Mr Bradbourn, who was awarded the OBE in 1994 for his public and political service, had been a town planning officer in local government for more than 20 years before becoming political adviser to the Conservative group on the Wolverhampton City Council. Ashley Fox, leader of the Conservative MEPs, said Mr Bradbourn was a 'one-off' adding that he was 'a much loved character who could always be relied on for a robust intervention and a succinct summary of a political point'. He added: 'His no-nonsense approach to politics made him a powerful voice for the West Midlands as well as a resolute defender of the British taxpayers' interests in Brussels and Strasbourg.'

"Shocking new figures show that rape and sexual attacks are commonplace in the British armed forces - with one soldier reporting an 'assault by penetration' at the hands of seven colleagues. The appalling incident, which reportedly took place last February, involved a 20-year-old soldier being targeted by a gang of troops aged 21 to 33. According to data obtained by The Times, there were at least three reported rapes and 22 sexual assaults between men across the armed forces over a two-year period to October. Scroll down for video . Shocking: According to data obtained by The Times, there were at least three reported rapes and 22 sexual assaults between men across the armed forces over a two-year period to October . One former officer admits troops have been known to use sexual assaults as a method of intimidation. Major Ross McLeod said servicemen use penetration of fellow soldiers with an object such as a broom handle as a way of bullying - and claimed he was not surprised by the figures. Speaking to The Times, he said: 'Sexual assault and male rape are, unfortunately, pretty routine Army bullying tactics. The former officer believes the way in which the military investigates matters internally is to blame - as this breeds fear and mistrust among those wronged. In turn, he says, the crimes continue to take place with the offenders rarely being brought to justice. He added: 'The military culture, which has been perpetuated and protected since time immemorial... is one in which these attacks are neither surprising or appalling, but rather entirely predictable.' Bullying tactic: One former officer admits troops have been known to use sexual assault to intimidate . In another shameful incident alleged to have taken place in May, a serviceman, aged 28, was attacked and again assaulted by penetration by a gang of seven colleagues, aged 20 to 26. Last year, three soldiers, one as young as 18, were targeted and degraded by smaller gangs in the same way. The figures were obtained by a a freedom of information request and only include data collected by the service's police forces - meaning the real figures could be much higher. 'Cover-up': Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement hanged herself two years after telling her superiors that she had been raped by colleagues . The Ministry of Defence (MOD) says it needs more time to find out whether anyone was prosecuted for the the 25 alleged assaults. A spokesman added that there was nothing to suggest these types of incidents were any more common in the military than they are in wider society. Earlier this year the family of a Royal Military policewoman who committed suicide after allegedly being raped by two soldiers accused the MOD of a ‘cover up’. Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement hanged herself two years after telling her superiors that she had been raped by colleagues during a drunken night out in Germany. Her sister, Sharon Hardy said she was 'disgusted' by the latest figures and believes the military has failed to live up to the apology they offered following the second inquest into the servicewoman's death. The coroner found that she had been bullied by colleagues and not properly supported after making the rape claim. Afterwards Brigadier John Donnelly, director of Army personnel services, said: ‘Our priority is to study the conclusions and then identify what further steps can be taken to help prevent a recurrence of this kind of tragedy.’ Since the case, the government have set out plans to reform the way in which the military deals with accusations of sexual assault and bullying.","One case saw troop targeted by seven others in 'assault by penetration'

"Three men who served long U.S. prison terms for spying received a standing ovation in Cuba's parliament Saturday, shaking their fists in victory as President Raul Castro declared that detente with Washington won't change the communist system he leads. The last imprisoned members of the 'Cuban Five' spy ring were freed this week in a sweeping deal that included the liberation of American contractor Alan Gross and a Cuban who had spied for the U.S. from their jail cells in Cuba as a first step toward the restoration of full diplomatic ties and a loosening of U.S. trade and travel restrictions. U.S. President Barack Obama said efforts at engagement rather than isolation should encourage reform in Cuba's one-party system and centrally planned economy. Cuban raft survivor Elian Gonzalez (top, L), his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez (top, R), and Cuban Five Five spies Fernando Gonzalez (bottom, L) and Rene Gonzalez (bottom, R) attend the Annual Session of the Parliament in Havana . Elian Gonzalez, the young Cuban rafter who was at the center of a bitter custody battle in 2000 between relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba, attends the closing ceremony of the legislative session at the National Assembly in Havana . Castro rejected that idea in his address to the twice-annual meeting of the National Assembly, saying 'we must not expect that in order for relations with the United States to improve, Cuba will abandon the ideas that it has struggled for.' Also digging in their heels Saturday were some Cuban exiles in Miami who had called for a mass protest against plans to normalize relations with the Castro government. About 200 people showed up before the speeches began, most of them older Cuban-Americans, and some expressed deep disappointment at the turnout. At the parliament in Havana, Castro expressed gratitude to Obama for the 'just decision' to release the men who spied on anti-Castro exile groups in South Florida in the 1990s and have long been regarded as heroes in Cuba. Seated behind the three and their families was Elian Gonzalez, the young Cuban rafter at the center of a bitter custody battle in 2000 between relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba. Cuban president Raul Castro delivered an speech, in which he said that the fight to end the embargo by the US will be 'long and difficult' Cuba's President Raul Castro, right, gestures for National Assembly President Esteban Lazo to take his place for the closing of the twice-annual legislative session at the National Assembly in Havana . The president closed his speech with 'Viva Fidel!' in reference to his older brother, who has not been seen nor heard from since the historic development was announced on Wednesday, provoking speculation about his health and whereabouts. The executive orders Obama announced Wednesday can clear the way for limited exports to Cuba and freer travel by specific categories of Americans such as academics and artists, but he acknowledged his need to work with Congress to end the decades-old embargo Cuba blames for the dire condition of its infrastructure and economy. Castro reminded Cubans that the embargo remains in place, particularly limits on international financial transactions that Cuba accuses of blocking its access to credit and international investment. 'An important step has been taken, but the essential thing remains, the end of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba, which has grown in recent years particularly in terms of financial transactions,' he said. Castro confirmed he would attend the Summit of Americas in Panama in April, where he is expected to have further discussions with Obama. Cuban raft survivor Elian Gonzalez (L) attends the Annual Session of the Parliament in Havana next to Cuban Five spie Ramon Labanino (R) His address to the National Assembly follows surprise announcements by both presidents Wednesday that Cuba and the U.S. will reopen embassies and exchange ambassadors for the first time in more than 50 years. The agreement included the exchange of the three prisoners, convicted in 2001, for a Cuban who had been imprisoned on the island for nearly 20 years for spying on behalf of the CIA. Gross had been held in Cuba for five years for illegally importing restricted communications equipment. Two members of the Cuban Five, Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez, already had been released by the U.S. As part of the exchange, Cuba also released 53 other prisoners. Late Friday, Cuban state television showed four of the Cuban Five celebrating their reunion by singing together during a private party in Havana. Their release angered the protesters in Miami. Two women held up a sign saying 'Imprison Americans and get three spies and an embassy.' Most of the estimated 2 million Cubans living in the United States are in Florida, and they closely follow developments on the island. Thousands marched and more than 350 were arrested in 2000 after U.S. agents seized Gonzalez and returned him to Cuba to resolve an international custody dispute.

And Cuban-born singer Gloria Estefan led tens of thousands in support of Ladies in White dissidents in Havana. By comparison, Wednesday's spontaneous protests and Saturday's planned demonstration were sparsely attended. 'I think there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines, tired,' said Andy Gomez, a Cuba expert and retired University of Miami professor.","Three men who served long U.S. prison terms for spying received a standing ovation in Cuba's parliament Saturday .

"Oxfam was reprimanded by a watchdog yesterday over a poster apparently attacking the Coalition’s austerity programme. Against a backdrop of dark clouds and stormy seas, the poster claimed the Government was creating a ‘perfect storm’ with zero-hours contracts, high prices, benefit cuts, unemployment and childcare costs. It was posted on Twitter under the heading: ‘Lifting the lid on austerity Britain reveals a perfect storm – and it’s forcing more and more people into poverty’. Bias: The Oxfam poster, pictured above, seemed to claim the Government was creating a ‘perfect storm’ with zero-hours contracts, high prices, benefit cuts, unemployment and childcare costs . The advert was reported by Conservative MP Conor Burns, pictured, who accused Oxfam of using for political ends money the public had donated in good faith to relieve poverty and famine overseas . After a six-month investigation into whether laws had been broken, the Charity Commission concluded that the advert ‘could be misconstrued as party political campaigning’. It called on Oxfam to avoid giving the public the impression of political bias. The advert was reported by Conservative MP Conor Burns who accused Oxfam of using for political ends money the public had donated in good faith to relieve poverty and famine overseas. Mr Burns said yesterday: ‘The fact that the Commission have published this conclusion after a very long period of deliberation shows how seriously they took what was very clearly a breach by Oxfam. ‘I hope Oxfam and other charities will reflect very carefully on it, and make sure donations made in good faith to good causes are not spent on overtly partisan campaigning.’ Under charity law, charities have to refrain from political campaigning and remain neutral. In a three-page report published yesterday, the Charity Commission said: ‘We considered that the text of the tweet and the embedded picture, gave rise to speculation and varying perceptions about the tweet’s purpose, leading to complaints. ‘We consequently considered that the tweet could have affected the view of those who received it and could be misconstrued by some as party political campaigning.’ Mark Goldring, Oxfam’s chief executive, said: ‘We have reviewed our social media procedures to reduce the risk of tweets being misconstrued in future.’","Poster apparently claimed high prices and benefit cuts were creating 'perfect storm'

'Certainly overnight Christmas Day into Boxing Day we've got widespread frosts so minus twos, minus threes, and minus fours. 'You could see maximum three degrees in the northern parts, working its way up to six degrees south of the country.' Mr MacColl added: 'The area of low pressure over Greenland is associated with a front that will affect the country over the coming days. Following that there will be some polar air starting to flow in behind.' Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook warned it was 'a polar express arriving in time for Christmas, and will be felt most in the north'.

"Robert Lyn, pictured, was jailed for life after he murdered Daniel Campbell who was allegedly sleeping with his girlfriend Stephanie Slade . A man who brutally stabbed to death a love rival after discovering he was having an affair with his girlfriend through Facebook has been jailed for life. Robert Lyn, 45, from Huddersfield  travelled to victim Daniel Campbell's flat and stabbed him repeatedly after learning of the infidelity. Bradford Crown Court that Lynn had stopped off at Aldi to purchase three knives before breaking into the flat on July 18 and launching the attack. Lynn stabbed Mr Campbell seven times in the neck and a further 13 times in the stomach. The court heard that he had not suffered any defensive wounds and was probably asleep at the time of the attack. Earlier that evening Victoria Sugden received a mistaken phone call from Stephanie Slade's mobile where she overheard her friend discussing with Mr Campbell what they had been doing the previous evening. After listening to details of the alleged infidelity, Miss Sugden messaged Lyn over Facebook just after 5.30pm on July 18. She wrote: 'I'm really upset. I can't sleep, but her and Dan slept with each other last night at his. I heard them discussing it when Steph's phone rang me but she didn't know. So sorry Rob.' Minutes later Lyn asked Miss Sugden for Mr Campbell's address and after she told him he bought half a bottle of brandy before getting a lift to Elland. In a phone call to Miss Slade's daughter he asked: 'Why has she done this... we are supposed to be in love."" Lyn bought a set of three knives from the Aldi store and took one of them with him when he went to Mr Campbell's flat at about 7pm that night. A neighbour described him as looking 'possessed' and as he kicked at the flat door he shouted: 'I know you're in there, let me show you what a real man is.' Lyn discovered the allegation after he received a message from Mr Campbell's own girlfriend Victoria Sugden, who later gave Lyn her boyfriend's address. Lyn then travelled to Elizabeth Street, Elland, pictured. Justice Coulson sitting at Bradford Crown Court, pictured, said the case highlighted 'the pernicious effect of Facebook' and criticised Miss Sugden for messaging Lyn before speaking to those involved first . After getting no response Lyn emptied the soil from a concrete planter and then used it to break down the door before climbing onto the bed to attack Mr Campbell as he slept. The court heard that Miss Slade had been in the bathroom while Lyn 'butchered' Mr Campbell, while he was asleep. As he left the flat on Elizabeth Street, Elland, Lyn asked Miss Slade: 'How do you like your boyfriend now?' Lyn was arrested soon after the murder by a police constable and an off-duty colleague and said: ""Is he dead yet? What would you ******* do if you caught your girlfriend cheating on you?"" The Honourable Mr Justice Coulson sentenced Lyn, to life imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to the murder and said he would have to serve a minimum of 26 years in jail before being considered for release by the Parole Board. Lyn almost collapsed in the dock as the judge passed sentence on him and his barrister Richard Wright QC conceded that his client could die in prison or be a very old man when he was released. Mr Wright described the death of Mr Campbell as 'wholly needless and pointless' and suggested that circumstances had combined with Lyn's personality traits to cause the 'terrible explosion of violence'. Mr Justice Coulson said a letter he had received from Lyn did now express genuine remorse and he suggested that the case highlighted the 'pernicious effect of Facebook'. He said Miss Sugden's decision to tell the world before speaking to those involved seemed particularly thoughtless and her misjudgment was to have fatal consequences. The judge told Lyn that he had inflicted severe injuries upon Mr Campbell and added: 'Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that you butchered him.' Family and friends of Mr Campbell packed the public gallery and he was described in victim impact statements as a man who was loved by his family, made friends easily and had everything to live for.","Robert Lyn stabbed Daniel Campbell repeatedly at his home on July 18 .

"She stormed to victory in this year’s The Great British Bake Off with her spectacular edible creations. Now Nancy Birtwhistle has designed a Christmas showstopper bake — and shares the recipe exclusively with the Mail so you can make it at home. This stunning Angel Cake comes complete with a caramel halo and wings, a piped-icing skirt, hands clasped in prayer and long blonde hair. On Bake Off, the 60-year-old was dubbed Gadget Gran because she used a series of homemade implements to construct her bakes, each one lovingly crafted by her husband Tim. Scroll down for video . Nancy Birtwhistle (pictured), 60, who won this year’s The Great British Bake Off, has designed a Christmas showstopper bake - and shares the festive recipe exclusively with the Mail so you can make it at home . And true to form, he has devised an ingenious wooden tool to help affix the angel’s caramel wings. For those who fear that assembling the ingenious cake may be beyond them, Mrs Birtwhistle has friendly words of advice. She said: ‘I hope people will improvise and use their own creativity. It doesn’t matter if you cheat a bit, or do things a different way. You might come up with a better solution than me. The main thing is to have fun while you are making it. Ready, steady, cook: Gather all the ingredients you need to start baking the spectacular Angel Cake recipe . ‘I don’t like the Heston Blumenthal school of cookery, where everything is complicated and takes ages. Food should be enjoyable to make and eat.’ The grandmother-of-eight, from Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, said her Angel Cake has been designed to appeal to all the family. The head is made from a ball of Rice Krispies, chocolate and marshmallows, which will keep sweet-toothed children happy on Christmas Day. Finishing touches: Ms Birtwhistle uses a piping bag filled with royal icing to create the angel's lacy skirt . Now, on with the head: Stick a dowel into the angel's head and then attach it to the body section of the cake . The body is a traditional Christmas cake baked in a 4 in tin. And the skirt is a homemade panettone stuffed with Christmas spices and fruit, which can be toasted and eaten long after New Year. Mrs Birtwhistle said: ‘All the components of the cake will keep for ages, and they are easy to make. ‘But if people want to use a ready-made panettone instead of making their own, that’s fine by me. They are cheap and readily available.’ Call in Gadget Grandad: Create a wooden frame - and use it to fix two dowels to the molten caramel wings . If bought from scratch, all of the ingredients for the Angel Cake should cost about £60, although many people will already have most of the staple ingredients in their cupboards. Home bakers should start making the cake the day before so the panettone can rise overnight. The Christmas cake can also be made at this stage as it takes between five and six hours to bake. The following day, the skirt, body and head should be decorated with runny icing, shop-bought coloured fondant icing, ready-to-roll marzipan and edible lace. The parts are then stacked one on top of the other using wooden rods on the inside to hold them together — although knitting needles would do equally well. The wings and halo are made from caramel mixed with edible gold glitter to catch the light. Be precise: Make another tool with two dowels the right width apart and angle in order to create two holes . Mr Birtwhistle, 63, devised an ingenious method for attaching the wings to the angel’s back with two wooden dowels. The rods should be fixed into the caramel while it is still molten, using a wooden frame to hold them at a 30 degree angle until it cools. Meanwhile, a corresponding pair of holes must be made in the angel’s back, also at 30 degrees. Then, with a bit of luck and a steady hand, the wings can be slotted in place to give the cake a special lift. Mrs Birtwhistle said her creation is meant to be a ‘fallen angel’, adding: ‘Her halo has slipped over one eye, and although she is doing her best to pray you can tell she is the naughty child in angel school.’ Heavenly: Attach the wings to the angel's back using the holes you have created - now you're nearly finished . She and her husband have five children and eight grandchildren between them and will host the entire family on Christmas Day. She said: ‘I enjoy all the traditions, so we will have roast turkey that we have reared in our back garden, pigs in blankets, sprouts, stuffing and all the rest. ‘We go to midnight mass the night before, then have a big lunch on Christmas Day before opening our presents by the tree. ‘I always prepare most of it well in advance so there is a minimum of fuss, and I don’t get stuck in the kitchen while everyone else is having a drink.’ Final adjustments: Make sure the angel's wings are secure and - now stand back to admire your work! In the Bake Off final in October, Mrs Birtwhistle made a spectacular windmill cake designed to look like the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris. To mould the caramel roof, she used a gadget made by her husband — a retired GP — from an old drainpipe. But he refused to take any credit for her victory, saying: ‘I don’t get involved in the kitchen, but I like making things in my workshop. So if I can invent something that helps her construct her showstopper cakes, I will. She is the brains of the operation.’ My angel showstopper cake comprises a panettone which forms the skirt. The body is my traditional Christmas cake and the head is made of a Rice Krispie mix — the children love it! PANETTONE SKIRT . Mix flour, salt, sugar, yeast, milk and eggs for 10 minutes on low setting until dough is smooth. Add butter and mix for further 10 minutes until soft. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover and leave in the fridge overnight. Stir in the fruits, zests, spices and Cointreau, cover and leave overnight. Next morning, mix contents together. Grease the Bundt tin then dust with flour. Shape the dough into a sausage then place in tin, and leave at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours. Preheat oven to 180 c and bake for 20 minutes; then 150 c for 25 minutes. Invert tin on to a cooling rack. CHRISTMAS CAKE . Soak fruit in the Cointreau for several hours. Cream butter and sugar together then beat in eggs. Then fold in the flour and spices and add soaked fruit. Spoon into greased and lined 4 in tin. Bake at 100 c for 5 to 6 hours. FOR THE ANGEL'S HEAD . Melt butter in saucepan then add marshmallows. As they melt, add Rice Krispies and chocolate and mix. Spoon into two small greased sphere tins. Leave to go cold, then push the two halves together to make a ball. TO ASSEMBLE THE ANGEL . Mix egg white and 300 g icing sugar to make a smooth, stiff piping icing. Mix a quantity of runny icing, using lemon juice and 300 g icing sugar and drizzle over the panettone. Leave to set. Using 125 g marzipan, cover the cake and place on a 6 in board. Cover with ready-to-roll fondant. Using pink ready-to-roll fondant, cover the head. Other colours for hair, eyes etc. Use edible lace for the angel’s sleeve and collar. I then used cake dowels to fix the head on to the body and the body to the skirt. The finishing piped icing to the skirt and sleeve edges etc was done with the royal icing. Wings and halo made with edible gold glitter and a caramel made from 300 g sugar and water. To make the caramel, put the sugar into a pan with just enough water to dampen it. Gently stir the sugar, without boiling, until the grains have all disappeared. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to get rid of any crystals of sugar clinging to the sides of the pan. Once clear, add the edible glitter and bring to a boil until the syrup begins to thicken and turn golden brown. Shape it into wings and a halo on some greaseproof paper and allow to cool. Fix dowels to wings with hot caramel then insert to back of cake.","Nancy Birtwhistle's creations won this year’s The Great British Bake Off .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury today recalls a 'grim' childhood Christmas when he was shunned by his alcoholic father and forced to 'scrounge' around in the fridge for food. In a candid and emotional interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Justin Welby reveals how he was forced to wander the streets alone while his father was in bed. The Archbishop, whose parents divorced when he was three, said: 'I did think this was a pretty bad day. In a candid and emotional interview on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs with presenter Kirsty Young (pictured), Justin Welby reveals how he was forced to wander the streets alone while his father was in bed . 'I think I went out once or twice but, you know, everything was closed. I didn't know really what to do with myself. I suspect I watched telly a bit and sort of scrounged around the fridge for something to eat. A sandwich? I can't remember. But it was a grim day.' He told the programme he was 'around 12' when he realised his father had a drink problem. A Lambeth Palace spokesman last night said the Archbishop would have been the same age at the time of the Christmas he was speaking of. During the interview, the Archbishop contrasts the happy summers he spent with his mother and her family in Norfolk with the 'rather more complicated times' with his businessman father who had custody of him in London. He said: 'As I grew up he was always unpredictable. Sometimes very full of rage and anger and expressing that very loudly. 'It [childhood] felt very painful at times. But I didn't know anything else. So it felt that that's what happens in life. It's one of the bad bits.' Justin Welby (left) shown off by parents Gavin and Jane at his christening and (right) leaving Eton College . Almost lost for words, the Archbishop recalls the death of his seven-month-old daughter Johanna in a car crash in France in 1983, revealing he and his wife Caroline always celebrate key moments, including the anniversary of her death, her birthday and Christmas. He said: 'Whether there is a faith or not is irrelevant. I think the most helpful thing is to celebrate the person to remember them with love, to remember what they gave, what you gave them. Attack the day so it doesn't attack you.' Welby's mother Jane worked as Sir Winston Churchill's secretary for six years.The Archbishop recalls a meeting with an 87-year-old Sir Winston, at the age of five, in 1961. At the time, Churchill was battling with depression and his health had deteriorated following a series of strokes. The Archbishop said: 'I remember a very, very old man and he cried. I don't know why and because he cried, I cried, and we sat and had tea. I have talked to my mother about it since and she said, 'Well he cried quite a lot.' ' Explaining his Christian beliefs took root during his second year at Cambridge University, the Archbishop said: 'I prayed and something changed. There was a presence and Christ came into my life.' Welby revealed he sometimes wondered if he was up to the job of Archbishop of Canterbury and admitted he often worried about the future of the Anglican Communion. He said: 'I still do [have doubts] most of the time. Imposter syndrome is a constant companion.' Justin Welby's song selections included You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry And The Pacemakers (pictured) The Archbishop declined to talk about his opposition to same-sex marriage but he defended the right of the Church to speak out on issues even when it comes a 'cropper' by doing so, citing the revelation the Church had a £75,000 holding in payday loan company Wonga as an example. And, speaking of the horrific massacre of 148 schoolchildren and teachers at a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, the Archbishop said the inhumanity of man was 'mindboggling' but it was important not to blame religion for all the evils of the world. He said: 'My experience is that in many conflicts, religion is a very good and very simple hook to hang extremely complex conflicts on.' On a lighter note the Archbishop said that ironing was a good time for contemplation and prayer, and when asked if he is a competitive person, admitted: 'I try not to let it get out of hand – unsuccessfully.' On the show, his song selections include The Lion Sleeps Tonight by The Tokens, because he often performs it when his family are playing the 'noisy' card game Racing Demon, and You'll Never Walk Alone by Gerry And The Pacemakers. He chooses The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon as his book and the complete box set of the West Wing as his luxury item.

"In the first glimpse inside the Cairns  'house of horrors', where eight children  were stabbed to death, neighbours have described the kids as pranksters who made everyone smile. Among the children who were brutally murdered there was a shy, grade-A student who loved rugby league, a teenage tomboy whose favourite colour was pink and a beautiful baby girl, who was the apple of the family's eye. The children, who lived with their mother at 34 Murray St, Manoora, were brutally murdered on Friday in a horrific massacre, which has devastated the small community. Scroll down for video . Malili (standing left) and Daniel (standing right), along with (sitting, from left) Rayden, Petronella, Rodney and (far right) Azariah were allegedly killed by their mother. A cousin (second from right) is not a victim . Their mother, Mersane Warria, was taken to hospital and has since been charged with their murder after allegedly stabbing and suffocating seven of her children to death, along with her niece. The 37-year-old local woman was charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital this morning. The woman was remanded in police custody, and currently remains in hospital. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Jade, a neighbour of the family, gushed about the little kids while struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. Angelina Thaiday (right) was also killed in the brutal massacre on Friday. She was the niece of Mersane Warria who has been arrested for the murders . 'They were such pranksters those boys. In a good way - they were funny. They made everyone smile,' she said. 'They'd hide in this tree and get me with a super soaker - they'd spray me with the water gun and laugh and laugh.' Speaking about the youngest four boys, Daniel, Rodney, Rayden and 'Az' she explains how they often came to her door alone, asking 'can we see your dogs?' 'They'd ride my big dog around like it was a horse - they were sweet little boys.' She couldn't find words to explain the little child, Petronella, who was just two years old when she was killed. 'She was so little... Just a little baby,' she said. Cristal Atkinson, who babysat for the family for two years, has fond memories of the children, remembering their love for playing in the local park and watching Disney movies. Speaking to the Courier Mail Ms Atkinson spoke about two-year-old Petronella, who was doted on by her older siblings. She said they found it hard to pronounce her long name, so they called her 'Baby Girl'. 'Everybody doted on her because she was the baby,' she said. The eight children who were stabbed to death in the Cairns 'house of horrors' have been described as loving kids who were full of laughter and were always dancing and singing . Among the children who were brutally murdered there was a shy, grade-A student who loved rugby league, a teenage tomboy whose favourite colour was pink and a beautiful baby girl, who was the apple of the family's eye . A woman, believed to be a member of the family, is visibly upset as she visits the scene of the stabbing in Manoora in Cairns . 7-year-old Rayden was the academic one of the bunch, receiving A-grades in every class. However he was 'very quiet' and shy, preferring to stay in the background and let his siblings take the limelight. Younger brother Daniel, was the complete opposite to Rayden and was the joker of the group. 'He'd spray whipped cream on my hand when I was asleep and push it towards my nose. He was a really happy, fun-loving kid,' she said. Ms Atkinson was closest to 14-year-old Malili, who went to Trinity Bay State High. The teenager has been described as a tough girl who loved pink and AFL. 'She was a solid girl – you wouldn't want to mess with her – who played rugby league and loved AFL. But her favourite colour was floral pink and I bought her a bright pink shirt for Christmas.' Neighbour, Jade, told Daily Mail Australia that she couldn't understand why the 37-year-old mother didn't ask for help before her stabbing rampage. 'I would have tea with her and say 'I don't know how you do it, looking after nine kids with all those little ones,' she said. 'And Raina would say 'you just do it. You love them so you do it. There is not other option.' 'How did this happen? How didn't I see the signs? Why didn't she ask for help? She had so many friends. She has such a big family. The help was there.' Family members mourn at the scene of a memorial which is located in the park next to the home of the multiple stabbing . A family member fell to the ground as he visited the makeshift shrine to the eight children who were brutally murdered in the house . A floral tribute has been set up in the park across the street from the children's house . Sitting at the base of the willow tree where an incredible display of flowers, teddy bears, paintings and heartfelt tributes have been left, Jade said she couldn't bring herself to be angry with the mother of nine. Less than 15 metres away, there are constant flashes as criminal/forensic investigators photograph the evidence in the room where the children were brutally murdered. 'They keep dying, I can't do it,' she says while trying to light candles for the children. 'It's just stupid meaningless candles but I have to do something. I can't stop thinking about it, I don't know what to do.' Jade said she could not bring herself to be angry at the mother. Instead, she is troubled and worried that she hadn't noticed a problem with Raina. 'She never complained. Never complained about anything. She took such good care of those kids. 'There were parties but no more than other people here. 'The kids were always sleeping at friends and neighbours and family's houses - why couldn't she ask them for help instead of this? How could she do this? A police forensic officer can be seen entering the house in which eight children were stabbed to death in the Cairns suburb of Manoora . This is the house in Manoora where the eight children, ranging from 18-months-old to 14-years-old were stabbed to death . Residents of Manoora have been left devastated by the tragic incident, as police continue their investigations at the 'house of horrors' The whole community of Manoora have been shocked by the multiple stabbings. Many mourners have a laid flowers, toys and even food at a floral tribute set up in the park across of the road from the children's house. Neighbours revealed the erratic behaviour of Mersane Warria hours before they were found dead in their house by their 20-year-old brother Lewis Warria. Ms Warria, 37 was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found. She approached a group of children and 'had a go at them', according to one community member. After her confrontation with the youngsters she wandered back towards her home. Only hours before her outburst, neighbours recalled seeing Ms Warria clearing out her home with her children. The mother was heard telling neighbours that she wanted a 'fresh start'.

"Trevor Gibbon, 48, of Harrow, north west London, was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court today charged with the murder of his neighbour Alison Morrison (pictured) A man has appeared in court today charged with the murder of his neighbour who was stabbed to death on her way to work. Trevor Gibbon, 48, of Harrow, north west London, was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court this morning. He is accused of killing his neighbour, Alison Morrison, who died half a mile from her Harrow home as she made her way to work on Thursday morning. Residents reported hearing piercing screams and police were called to the attack in Alexandra Avenue at 7.47am. Mrs Morrison was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died from her injuries. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as multiple stab wounds. Gibbon, satellite TV engineer, held on to glass at the front of the dock and looked around the court during today's brief hearing. Magistrate Caroline Whycer told him he was being remanded in custody to stand trial at the Old Bailey, where there will be a bail hearing on Tuesday, followed by a preliminary hearing on January 12. Tributes have been pouring in for Mrs Morrision, who has been described as a 'wonderful and caring' mother and wife who worked hard to reduce crime in her community. Her three sisters, Julie, Paula and Lorraine, have left from their homes in Waterlooville, Hampshire, to comfort her grieving husband Cedric and their 16-year-old son Kori in Harrow. Her sister Julie had been due to stay at their £410,000 end-of-terrace house after visiting the Olympia Horse Show in London this weekend. Mrs Morrison, a mother of one, grew up in Bedhampton, Hampshire, before moving to the capital after finishing university. She was planning to return home to see her family to celebrate Christmas next week. Her brother-in-law, Lee Richards, said her 46-year-old husband called the family to tell them the tragic news. He said: 'We are in shock. It couldn't have happened to a nicer lady. 'You know what sisters are like - you can't separate them. 'They received a phone call from Cedric to say there had been a situation. 'They left what they were doing and went straight up there.' The much-loved mother died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked in Harrow, London, on Thursday . Gibbon, 48,  was remanded in custody when he appeared at Hendon Magistrates' Court (pictured) this morning . Mrs Morrison's sister Paula received the news after stepping off the plane at London Heathrow airport following a 10-day holiday in Cuba. Mr Richards said his wife Julie Brathwaite, a 52-year-old mother-of-two who runs a cleaning business, was inconsolable. He said: 'She's in a mess. I have left the sisters together - that's the best way. 'Alison was here a couple of weeks ago. My family were due to go up this weekend to the Olympia horse show. 'They were going to stay at Alison's home. 'A couple of years ago they lost their dad. 'It's taken them this long to get over that and now this has happened.' Her mother, Valerie Brathwaite, who still lives in the family home in Hampshire was too upset to speak yesterday. But Mr Richards described Mrs Morrison as a 'wonderful, caring mother' to her teenage son Kori. He said she died a lot of voluntary work for her community, and was the vice-chairwoman of her local Neighbourhood Watch scheme. Tributes for the 'wonderful and caring' mother of one have been left at the scene of her death in Harrow . One tribute left at the scene, from one of her sisters, said: 'I'm so sorry you've been taken away from us all' Her full-time job was as a senior manager at consumer organisation Which?, a position she moved to London for after studying a degree. He said: 'She was fun-loving and happy. She was sensible and responsible - this is a disaster.' Bianca Brathwaite, 24, Mrs Morrison's niece, added: 'She was everything you could ask for in a woman, she was strong and always stood up for herself and her family and is loved dearly.' David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, described her as a 'key member of the board'. He said: 'Alison Morrison was passionately committed to creating a safer Harrow through her work with the Harrow Safer Neighbourhood Board and as a community champion, and it is terrible news that she has lost her life in this violent way in a borough she cared so much about. 'Alison's colleagues on the Safer Neighbourhood Board are absolutely shattered by this news, as are the staff of Harrow Council. Alison was a key member of the board and a tireless advocate of its work. 'We will do whatever we can to help the police. In the meantime, our thoughts are with Alison's family.' Chief Superintendent Simon Ovens, borough commander for Harrow, said: 'I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Alison in her role as the vice-chair of our borough's Safer Neighbourhood Board. 'She was held in high regard locally, and truly cared about the borough. Her friends within the local community will be devastated by her loss.'

Chief of Joint Operations Vice Admiral David Johnston says IS is coming under immense pressure. 'The militants' momentum has been checked since the air campaign commenced,' he said in a statement on Saturday. Last month, an Australian F-18 Super Hornet military plane discovered a clandestine network of  bunkers occupied by the Islamic State in northern Iraq, giving rise to an enormous airstrike and the death of over 100 militants. The plane, fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras, located the concealed bunkers and tunnels in a hillside at Kirkuk, before groundforces and 20 aircraft lashed the area.

"Jason Britcher (pictured) outside Hull Crown Court, where he was found guilty of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault . A senior legal clerk has been jailed for nine years for attempting to rape a 'lovely, sweet' female barrister at a Christmas party. Jason Britcher, 40, sexually assaulted the sleeping lawyer by creeping into her hotel room after a night spent drinking whisky and snorting cocaine. The brazen attack occurred five years after he had raped a barmaid following a wedding reception. On each occasion Britcher, who was responsible for bringing in work for 50 barristers, was either high on drink or cocaine and looking for sex. A jury of six women and five men took just two hours after an eight-day trial at Hull Crown Court to find him guilty of rape, attempted rape and once sexual assault. They found him not guilty of one act of sexual touching on the barmaid. Britcher, who has a 13-year-old daughter and wife, put his head in his hands and turned pale before crying. His barrister David Osborne said Britcher's mother was terminally ill and would not survive his sentence. The prosecution claimed Britcher's clean-cut image as a charming gentleman masked a hard-drinking sexual predator. Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, told Britcher: 'I have no doubt you are a man prepared to take risks and you unquestionably did that. You raped and attempted to rape two women when you were affected by alcohol and both women were asleep. 'You even perpetrated the two crimes by lifting their dresses in a very similar fashion whilst they lay asleep. 'This has been a catastrophe for everyone concerned. In many respects you deserve a more severe sentence, but I am mindful of the appalling affect this will have upon you and your family.' His victim, a female barrister in her 30s in the room opposite his, was described by Britcher as a 'gentle, lovely, sweet girl - almost timid.' The main attraction at the party was an ice sculpture, called a vodka luge, which allowed guests to take shots of Snaps poured down two luge runs from the top of an ice mountain into their open mouths. There was a DJ, karaoke, dancing and 'quite a lot of drinking.' Britcher said he had taken cocaine, given to him by a barrister friend, while solicitors and barristers enjoyed wine, spirits and nibbles and let their hair down. During the evening he had also shared a bottle of whisky with a CPS lawyer before leaving around 3am. He claimed his mind went blank after crashing on his bed and could not remember sending what he claimed were 'welfare' texts to two female barristers at 3.40am: 'Are you guys in the main room or Pleb X' and ' Make sure you are ok..I'm sleeping on the floor, u can have bed if struggling. X.' The junior barrister told the jury she had enjoyed a 'really lovely, fun evening in a nice atmosphere' before offering to share a room with a female friend. She had left the party for the hotel leaving her room door unlocked. She texted her husband saying she 'loved him' before falling asleep in her party dress because she had forgotten her pyjamas and did not want her room-mate to see her naked. She said: 'The next thing I remember was someone next to me cuddling up. I thought it was my husband. There was no initial alarm. I was fast asleep. 'But I felt that person touching me. I was asleep at the time and put my hand down and touched him. I think I became more aware at that point.' She said she was sexually assaulted twice and could feel his weight on her as she slept face down. 'I opened my eyes and looked and saw it was Jason. I think I said: ""F*** Jason."" He looked at me. I wanted to put my hands on my face. I said: ""F*** off!"" and kept repeating it.' Britcher left the woman in a state of distress and went back to sleep in his hotel room. The junior barrister called her sister in tears, saying she had woken up to find a man 'on top of her.' She could barely breathe and talk and initially did not want to report it. A jury at Hull Crown Court (pictured) yesterday found Britcher guilty on charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and rape . However, a solicitor doing an 'all-nighter' at the party was informed by a colleague and called the police. Police, equipped with body cameras, were called to the hotel at 6am and Britcher was filmed snoring in his room, being woken and arrested on suspicion of rape. He set about destroying forensic evidence by licking his fingers and dipping them in coffee provided in the police cell. He told the jury he had sleep walked through three doorways looking for a toilet. He claimed he had got in the junior barrister's bed by mistake and reacted on 'autopilot' when the woman touched his manhood. He admitted to the jury: 'When the realisation hit home, my whole world came crashing down. I panicked. I did not believe anyone would believe my story.' In a victim impact statement, the barrister said she felt betrayed and the first week after the attack she felt sick and guilty for reporting it to the police. Britcher (pictured) was described by the prosecution as an 'opportunistic sex offender' capable of being charming and considerate . She had to move chambers, lost out financially and had to be supported by family. She felt utterly defeated in August last year and went to the doctors to be described anti-depressants. She had difficulty explaining what had happened to her mother and it had affected her relationship with her husband. Britcher told the jury he worked his way up from being a humble listing officer to a senior clerk responsible for a criminal chambers, sitting on management committees. He agreed to resign his job after being told he was to be charged. Meanwhile, the police found a second complainant, a woman in her 50s who he had raped after a wedding reception. She told the jury: 'I thought everything was a dream. I could feel him inside me. I must have gone back to a deep sleep and the next thing I remember was his wife shouting at me.' She was bleeding and a friend of the woman telephoned Britcher's wife telling her: 'This is rape. This is not right.' She did not report it after being begged not to do so because of the affect on his family. Crown barrister John Thackray told the jury: 'We do not say he is a prolific sex attacker dragging women of the street with a mask on. He is an opportunist sex offender who takes his chance when it arises. He is capable of being polite, considerate, business like, perhaps even a gentleman. However, when a female is vulnerable, perhaps in drink, he will take his opportunity. He can be charming, but he can also be sinister.'","Jason Britcher, 40, sexually assaulted a sleeping junior barrister at a hotel .

"Conjoined twins Knatalye and Adeline Mata, who were born in Texas back in April sharing a number of vital organs, are now one step closer towards a normal childhood. Earlier this week, the 8-month-old siblings who share a liver, intestines, chest wall, diaphragm, lungs, pelvis and heart lining, underwent a complicated five-hour surgery to stretch their skin in preparation for their separation. During the procedure, a team of specialists embedded custom-made tissue expanders into the girls' chest and abdomen. Anxious and excited: The Mata Family prepare for their conjoined twins to depart for surgery to implant skin expanders . Rough start: Knatalye and Adeline Mata were born in Texas back in April sharing a number of vital organs . State of the art: A team of specialists at Texas Children's Hospital embedded custom-made tissue expanders into the girls' chest and abdomen . Over the course of the next few weeks, fluid will be added to the balloon-like expanders to allow for the gradual stretching of the patients' skin. Pictured on the right are the twins after the five-hour surgery . Breathing a sigh of relief: The operation performed by surgeons at Texas Children’s Hospital Tuesday was declared a success, setting the stage for the next step in the process . Over the course of the next few weeks, fluid will be added to the balloon-like expanders to allow for the gradual stretching of the patients' skin, reported Houston Chronicle. The operation performed by surgeons at Texas Children’s Hospital Tuesday was declared a success, setting the stage for the next step in the process of pulling the children apart. ‘We are so thankful for the support and thoughts and prayers for our girls as they continue to grow, recover and prepare for the next step in their journey,’ Elyssa Mata, the girls’ mother, said in a statement. The Mata twins will spend the next six-eight weeks recovering from the surgery. Their ultimate separation has been scheduled for early next year. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston at 31 weeks on April 11. Adorable: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, pictured with their mother Elysse, weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston on April 11 . Conjoined twins: The adorable sisters, who remain in the hospital's Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, are joined at the abdomen. They share a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and the lining of the heart . In October, Knatalye and Adeline's mother, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous procedure. 'When I think about December I get that sick feeling in my stomach. I want to know how much pain they are going to feel after. What is it going to be like for them?' she told Reuters at the time. 'They are where they should be developmentally. They reach up for toys, they reach out for us when we get close and talk to them.' After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. In 1992, surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital successfully separated one-year-old twins Tiesha and Iesha Turner, who  shared a sternum, liver, entwined intestines and fused organs. Cared for: The girls (pictured in hospital with their mother) will undergo six-to-eight weeks of tissue expansion to stretch skin that will be used to cover patches of their bodies when they are separated . Twins: Knatalye and Adeline's mother, Elysse, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said in October she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous separation procedure . Together: After the procedure, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk . Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births. Around 40 to 60 per cent  arrive stillborn, while 35 per cent live only one day, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Mortality rates for twins who do live and then undergo separation vary, depending on their type of connection and the organs they share, it said. The Mata family's life was turned upside down in January when a routine ultrasound revealed that Mrs Mata was carrying conjoined twins. The family was referred to the hospital's Fetal Center. The expectant mother, her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah relocated from Lubbock to Houston, where the girls were born. Loving family: Mrs Mata, pictured with her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah, spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school . On a YouCaring page, Mrs Mata said the twin's 20 per cent chance of survival at birth inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope. While the mother spends most of her daily life at the hospital, leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school, full-time worker Mr Mata spends every weekend with his daughters. Mr Cass said he expects both Knatalye and Adelie to be able to experience independent, happy lives following the surgery. But he added: 'It is likely further reconstructive surgeries may be needed in the future. Perhaps the biggest challenges may be orthopedic and in helping them walk and have normal gait.'","Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, aged six months, born April 11 .

"Two Downing Street police officers have been sacked after obscene images were found on their mobile phones during the Plebgate investigation. The officers were members of the Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6), who were tasked with providing armed protection at Downing Street, foreign diplomats and visiting heads of states. The men, aged 34 and 36 faced a misconduct hearing on Thursday before the Directorate of Professional Standards, and were dismissed. The Met has sacked two members of the Diplomatic Protection Group, whose tasks include protecting Downing Street, after a colleagues sent them extreme pornography, (police officers involved not pictured) Operation Agnes was launched after pornography was found on several officers' mobile phones during the Plebgate probe involving former Government Chief Whip, Andrew Mitchell, (pictured leaving Downing Street) An investigation into members of SO6 as a result of the Plebgate scandal involving former Government chief whip Andrew Mitchell discovered obscene material on several officers' phones. One officer, James Addison was sacked in June 2014 after he admitted sharing extreme pornography with fellow officers using his mobile phone. After the pornography was discovered, the Met launched Operation Agnes and investigated the conduct of 14 officers, including Addison. Officer B, who is 34 had been arrested on December 19, 2013 but was not charged with any criminal office. It was determined in February 2014 that he would not face criminal action. Officer D, who is 36, was arrested in January and questioned under caution, but faced no criminal charges. Instead, the Metropolitan Police decided that both men should face a professional standards investigation where they were accused with discreditable conduct and authority. Both officers admitted gross misconduct at the disciplinary hearing on Thursday. The hearing's chair accepted the pleas and they were dismissed without notice. A third officer, Officer C, resigned from the Metropolitan Police in August and a misconduct matter against him has been kept on file. Ten further officers were later investigated by the DPS for receiving obscene images and failing to report the matter to a superior officer. The Metropolitan Police investigated 14 officers over the pornography allegations, with three sacked . The officers, eight of whom were with the DPG and two from Territorial Policing, have been cleared of any misconduct allegations and are no longer on restricted duties. The Metropolitan Police said that the dismissals of James Addison and Officers B and D conclude the investigation. Detective Chief Superintendent Alaric Bonthron, said: 'The sharing of these images is completely unacceptable. Officers are expected to uphold the standards of the Met Police and when they fail to do so - they will be investigated. 'Where officers fail to act within the law it undermines the trust and confidence the public have in the service as a whole.' Earlier this year, Addison pleaded guilty to 11 charges of distributing extreme pornography from his mobile phone. He was fined £6,000 at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Addison sent the images to his colleagues between February and June 2013 while he was on duty.","The Met has sacked two elite Diplomatic Protection Group officers .

"A British horticulturalist has created the world's first black and white tomato plant by blending two rare strains together. Tomato experts at Sutton Seeds have a history for pioneering plants, having previously created the first ever black strain which they named Indigo Rose. For their latest creation, the green-fingered gardeners blended Indigo Rose with a white-cherry tomato type to produce the ground-breaking black and white plant. Scroll down for video . What's black and white but usually red all over? This ground-breaking tomato plant made by British experts is the world's first black and white blend . While the black tomatoes have a more savoury taste, the white ones pack a sweet and fruity punch, the growers say. A spokesman for Sutton Seeds, which is based in Paignton, Devon, said: 'This year we have upped the ante by grafting Indigo Rose to a creamy-white cherry variety to produce the first black and white tomato plant. 'We promise amazement from your friends, neighbours and family, not to mention rather groovy salads and sandwiches.' The hybrid plants are best planted in May for a July to October harvest and cost £12.99 for three. Indigo Rose was originally created earlier this year by mixing red and purple tomato strains and is heralded as a 'superfood'. The American-bred purple tomatoes contained anthocyanin, an antioxidant said to help fight diabetes and obesity. Sutton Seeds have a history for pioneering plants, having previously created the first ever black tomato strain (pictured) which they named Indigo Rose . Speaking of the black tomatoes, Alfie Jackson, assistant product manager at Suttons Seeds, said: ‘They are not as sweet as normal tomatoes and have a more savoury flavour, and are nice roasted or eaten in salads. ‘There are some dark coloured tomatoes but Indigo Rose is the only real black tomato and is the darkest that has ever been bred. ‘During the growth process it starts out green like all tomatoes and when the sun hits the fruit it turns black rather than red.’","Horticulturalists have grown the world's first black and white tomato plants .

"The woman who received a flood of insulting messages after fumbling the first question on a television quiz show said the experience has motivated her to spread awareness about cyber bullying. On Wednesday evening, Whitney Beseler, a PE teacher from Balllarat in Victoria, botched the first question on Millionaire Hot Seat live on air. For the hundred dollar introductory question, host Eddie McGuire asked Beseler which of the following-an engagement ring, an anniversary ring, a wedding ring or a burger ring- was 'not a piece of jewellery worn to symbolise a relationship between two people.'

But many of these were less than flattering. ‘There were some really horrible messages. People attacked me about being blonde, about being female,' Beseler told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was even lambasted on my ability as a teacher. It’s lucky I have a thick skin, but it has really opened my eyes,’ she said. When explaining her notorious blunder, Beseler said it was a simple case of a mental lapse. ‘It was a just a brain fart, everyone has them, it just happened that mine was on live television,’ she said. Beseler believes it is the internet culture of trolling that gives rise to the hurtful messages. ‘I think when people are sitting behind a keyboard and hurling abuse, they don’t understand they are speaking to humans with feelings.

"Daniel Perry, 17, took his own life  after a Filipino cybersex gang threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends . Chilling 'sextortion' emails which urged a teenager to 'commit suicide now' after falling victim to online blackmailers have emerged for the first time since he threw himself off a bridge. Daniel Perry, 17, from Fife, took his own life in July last year after a Filipino cybersex gang threatened to send compromising images of him to his family and friends unless he paid them. He was encouraged into a sexual encounter via webcam before the sick criminals threatened to make the video public. His death prompted a large-scale police inquiry and at least 58 Filipino suspects were arrested in May this year after investigators traced online activity. At least three of those, Archie Tolin, 20, Jomar Palacio, 23, and Vincent Bravo, 22, are believed to have been directly involved in blackmailing Mr Perry. A BBC investigation has claimed that the Dunfermline teenager received a message from his blackmailers saying: 'I will make you suffer.' The 17-year-old begged them not to release the video footage but detectives claim the suspects replied: 'Commit suicide now.' Later, they sent a chilling message asking: 'Are you dead yet?' A BBC team traced two of the men suspected of being directly involved in Mr Perry's death. Jomar Palacio, who lives in a run-down area of Manila, said: 'I do not know him, I did not get any money, I did not do anything wrong to him, that's all.' Another suspect, Vincent Bravo, now works as a waiter in a strip club and lives in a city south of Manila. 'I didn't do it, I don't know anything about it. They have no hard evidence against us,' he told the BBC. 'I send my condolences to [the Perry family], but I wasn't the one who did it. I feel sorry because he left behind a family which loves him.' All three men will go on trial in Manila but Scots authorities want to extradite them to face trial here. Scroll down for video . He was encouraged into a sexual encounter via webcam before the sick criminals threatened to make the video public . Suspect Jomar Palacio (right) was shown a picture of Daniel Perry by the BBC, but he denied any wrongdoing . Superintendent Gilbert Sosa, director of the Filipino Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG), said: 'They will first have to be tried in the Philippines and other legal actions might follow.' More than 260 computers, phones and pornographic materials and other evidence was seized in the Philippines by 15 police teams . Philippine National Police chief Allan Purisima said the syndicate would secretly record the victims after tricking them into exposing their bodies or having cybersex. They would then threaten to send the video to their relatives and friends unless they paid anything from $500 (£292) to $2,000 (£1,100) he said. Another suspect, Vincent Bravo, said he wasn't responsible and there was no hard evidence against him . Mr Perry's death led to a large-scale international investigation - which saw 58 Filipinos arrested in May . It is thought scammers use stolen footage of pretty American girls and sophisticated computer software to interact with their target. Speaking earlier this year, Mr Perry's mother Gill Aiton said: 'I don't want any parent to ever go through what I been through. I miss him every day. 'His tormentors were pure evil. I want them to be brought back here and those responsible for his death. 'I want to look them in the eye and ask why they chose to target a 17-year-old bairn with his whole life in front of him. 'There was a long time when I couldn't mention his name without bursting into tears. I thought I would go mad with grief. 'I wish I could tell Daniel how much I love and miss him. Why did he feel that he couldn't tell his mum and dad, or his foster parent? He must have been so scared.'

"A Chinese asylum seeker was kicked off a plane that was set to deport him home after staging a dramatic on-board protest. Wei Lin, a Chinese refugee, was escorted from the Federal Court to the airport after a last minute legal bid to prevent his deportation was thwarted. Mr Lin, who was handcuffed, was escorted by several Serco guards to the last row of seats of the Air China aircraft. Wei Lin moved to the front of the plane just before take-off and began telling passengers he was an asylum seeker being expelled from the country against his will . Just prior to take-off, at about 9pm, Lin moved to the front of the plane and began telling passengers he was an asylum seeker being expelled from the country against his will. The plane had already begun to move towards the runway, but the pilot announced that the incident was 'unresolved' and the plane would return to the terminal. At about 9.50pm, Mr Lin was escorted from the aircraft and returned to the Villawood detention centre. According to Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul, Wei is a professional athlete who was targeted due to his knowledge of the use of performance enhancing drugs in Chinese sport. A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the department adhered to its duty of care in the deportation of Mr Lin . Mr Lin was escorted from the Federal Court to the airport after a last minute legal bid to prevent his deportation was thwarted . 'We are again calling on the Minister to halt attempts to deport Wei, and to halt all deportations to danger,' Mr Rintoul said. 'We are also calling on the airlines to refuse to carry forced deportations. By co-operating with the government, airline such as China Air become complicit in the government's abuse of asylum seekers' human rights.' A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the department adhered to its duty of care in the deportation of Mr Lin.

"John Bercow faces a secret cross-party bid to boot him out as Commons Speaker next year. MPs across the main parties are privately plotting to replace him with a new Speaker after the general election in May. In a dramatic move, they plan to change Commons' procedure to introduce a secret ballot for any motion to sack Mr Bercow. Scroll down for video . John Bercow (pictured) faces a secret cross-party bid to boot him out as Commons Speaker next year . Under current rules, a motion to challenge the Speaker must be 'recorded' – meaning the names of all MPs who voted to remove him would be made public. But a secret ballot would allow critics to vote him down without fear of reprisal if he survived. One plotter said last night: 'The rule now is a huge advantage for Bercow – it makes people afraid to oppose him as if we lose, he'll know who defied him.' It is thought MPs will try to secure a Commons' debate to get the procedure changed before Parliament is dissolved in March. They then plan to challenge Mr Bercow when the Commons reconvenes after May 7. Mr Bercow, pictured with his wife Sally, has been Speaker of the House of Commons since June 2009 . But last night, it was thought the rule change bid would fail. One Bercow ally said: 'There is no way they will get the time to change this before the Election. 'And if they're so frightened of going public, unfortunately they'll have to come clean to call for the procedure time.'","John Bercow faces cross-party bid to remove him as Commons Speaker .

"British Airways took on its first female pilot in 1987 and has been actively recruiting more women to its top ranks ever since. As of 2013, the airline had more female pilots than any other UK carrier, though BA's Director of Flight Operations, Captain Stephen Riley insists that the 'number doesn't nearly represent the general population.' In response to the lack of women pilots, BA has launched an 18-month 'Future Pilot Programme' in recent years - a cadet training scheme, which is open to all. British Overseas Airways Corporation, a precursor to British Airways, romanticised airline stewardesses in the 1950s . Anyone between the ages of 18 and 55 is welcome to apply and no previous flying experience is necessary. As of 2013, the programme had attracted over 5,000 applicants for fewer than 100 places. Nevertheless, the number of male pilots continues to outnumber female pilots 18 to one, with just 200 women pilots out of 3,500 flying for BA. A 1960s American Airlines advert encouraged passengers to 'think of [their flight attendant] as your mother' This United Airlines advert from the 1960s shows a woman demonstrating her ability to balance four teacups . With hopes that the numbers will continue to rise, we take a look back at the profound shift in recruitment tactics that has taken place over the years. It's clear that many airlines used to look to females as 'trolley dollies' or 'mothers' who were there to serve you while on-board. Men, on the other hand, were encouraged to try their hand at flying, using military-inspired language to make the job that much more appealing. Advertisements for male pilots, however, made references to the military and inevitable in-air romances . A TWA advert from the United States depicts only men as pilots - or as chefs, for that matter . Even recently, Virgin Atlantic's magazine adverts showcase flight attendants as stylish waitresses (left) And though some airlines still show sexualised images of female flight attendants in their adverts, the push toward women taking on high-flying pilot roles is evident. One of the most notable female-helmed flights in recent memory took place in March 2008 when British Airways' first female pilot, Capt Lynn Barton, was selected to land the initial flight to touch down at Heathrow's Terminal 5 on March 27, 2008. And for all those ladies looking to take to the skies, the next application window for the Future Pilot Programme is expected to open in February 2015.","In response to low industry numbers, BA launched Future Pilot Programme .

"Shoppers could be told how their meat has been killed, with labels on the packaging informing them over whether the animal was 'stunned' or 'unstunned', a government minister has suggested. George Eustice, the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, suggested labels such as 'stunned' on the packaging would give a 'clear definition' to consumers. It comes amid an ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers. Scroll down for video . George Eustice (pictured), the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, said labels informing consuemrs over how the animal was killed could give 'clear definition' In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling of meat and suggested suppliers used a designated 'halal' logo. It also emerged that major supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer were selling the imported meat, while popular restaurant chains such as Pizza Express had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu. Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained. The European Commission is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the European Union should be labelled. But Mr Eustice suggested this week that meat products could be labelled 'stunned' or 'unstunned, which would effectively alert shoppers as to whether their meat was killed according to religious guidelines. According to The Telegraph, Mr Eustice told MPs: '[Backbenchers have] made the point that it would be wrong just to label meat as 'stunned' or 'unstunned', and that a fairer way would be to list all the different methods of slaughter. 'The only thing I would say in response is that, from the EU perspective, 'stunned' has a clear legal definition in the legislation, and it is simply that an animal is rendered insensible to pain almost immediately.' Mr Eustice has suggested labels such as 'stunned' or 'unstunned' for meat packaging, to give customers clear information over whether the meat is halal (pictured) or non-halal and suitable under religious guidelines . He also said it would be 'difficult' to brand meat products either kosher or halal because 'there is no single definition of halal' and that a 'further complication is that not all meat slaughtered by kosher methods is deemed kosher'. And he added that it would be complicated to list all of the different methods of slaughter, and said there may not be a 'huge consumer appetite' to do so. HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON-HALAL . In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered. KOSHER . According to the laws, in order for a meat to be kosher it must come from an animal that is ruminant and have split hooves. Ruminant animals chew food once and swallow, before regurgitating it and chewing again. Before slaughtering, the animal must be healthy and uninjured and a sharp knife is used to slice through the main arteries and windpipe, causing a drop in blood pressure that causes the animal to lose consciousness. Huw Irranca-Davies, the shadow environment minister, said the labelling of meat had been 'roundly and rightly rejected' by MPs last year. However, he said that if all different types of slaughter should be labelled then 'make room on the label for slaughter by electrical current, or by carbon dioxide, inert gas, captive bolt pistol, gunshot or free bullet and so on.' 'Some advocate doing so, and it would certainly satisfy the need for transparency,' he added. The row over the labelling of halal meat was sparked in May when it emerged millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told. Several restaurants such as Pizza Express, KFC and Subway were found to be selling halal meat – mainly chicken – without printing the information on menus. Chains including Domino's, GBK, Nando's, KFC, Ask and Slug & Lettuce also admitted to using halal meat in some dishes, mainly chicken, and locations. At least ten top higher education establishments - including Oxford University and the University of Manchester – were also found to be secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals. In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served was found to unlabelled halal meal, while all the chicken served at universities in Sheffield and Exeter - which is halal - was not marked as so. Cardiff and Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the meat, without telling consumers. It also emerged that most of the major supermarkets were selling New Zealand lamb killed according to halal ritual without providing labels. The switch to slaughtering animals in line with Islamic ritual helps supermarket chains save money because the end product can be eaten by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Both halal and kosher slaughter involve a religious ritual in which the throat is cut. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, which is said to leave them in pain. The ongoing row about halal meat and the way it is packaged and presented to customers was sparked in May, after it was revealed millions of people were being sold halal and kosher meat without being told (file picture) In conventional slaughterhouses, cows, sheep and chicken are stunned, usually with an electric shock, to ensure they are unconscious before their throats are cut. This is said to minimise their suffering. After it emerged that halal was widely sold unknowingly to consumers, Mr Clegg demanded better labelling of meat. He said that while he personally had 'no problem' eating halal meat, produce should be clearly labelled because 'consumers want to know more about how the food arrived on their plate.' Religious groups from all faiths, vets and animal welfare groups have also previously joined calls for new labels to identify halal or kosher meat.","Environment minister said meat could be labelled 'stunned' or 'unstunned'

"Pressure: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair broke out in a sweat when quizzed about his relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his ex-wife, Wendi Deng . Tony Blair is one of the great alpha politicians this country has produced: a conviction politician who is not afraid to take on big and contentious issues and does not mind a challenge. Yet he remains a puzzle – even to those of us sympathetic to his deft repositioning of the Labour Party, his reformist outlook on public services and his now-unfashionable commitment to Britain’s role in some of the most difficult issues the world faces: notably the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its remedies. Abroad, Mr Blair is a well-received (and often handsomely paid) speaker and consultant, both to private companies and a range of governments. A foundation he created does underpraised work educating youngsters in countries at risk of violent extremism about the benefits of open debate and tolerance. Even his staunchest defenders, though, admit the former Labour leader has a severe image problem at home, where his reputation has been tarnished not only by the messy aftermath of the Iraq invasion and the framing of the case for war around Saddam Hussein’s missing WMD, but a more general doubt about his trustworthiness and a belief that his quest for the high life has embroiled him in entanglements and misjudgments. It is a conundrum that was expressed all too clearly when I interviewed him twice recently on a wide range of subjects for The Economist – in particular in his now widely reported and nervous reaction to questions about Rupert Murdoch and his then wife Wendi Deng (the couple divorced earlier this year). Mr Blair did something that was overdue. He finally gave an answer to a straightforward question I put about whether he had ‘got into a mess’ with his relationship with Ms Deng. There was a public falling-out this year between Mr Blair and the media mogul over colourful suspicions – first raised in The Mail on Sunday – that the former PM and Wendi had become unduly close. Friends of Mr Murdoch say that when he questioned Mr Blair about the relationship, he got only ‘politician’s answers’, which led to a long-standing political and personal friendship falling apart. Mr Blair denies all impropriety. But many in his tight inner circle know that this is not the point. When I interviewed the former PM in his offices, an elegant suite in Grosvenor Square, close to the heavily guarded American Embassy, Mr Blair was, as usual, dashing between international appointments. His staff busied around to adjust his travel plans and find his elusive glasses. I asked: Was this all a regrettable muddle, damaging to his reputation and worth clarifying? Coolly, he replied that it was ‘not something I will ever talk about – I haven’t and I won’t’. There was an eye roll and a grin/grimace, then silence. And he was exercised enough to crash his coffee cup loudly into its saucer so that the whole room jumped. Too close? There were colourful suspicions – first raised in The Mail on Sunday – that the former PM and Wendi (pictured) had become unduly close . He added: ‘It isn’t fair or right to go into that issue.’ But the subject did provoke one sign of alarm: a large, dark pool of sweat appeared suddenly under his armpit. A trusted, mainly female staff keeps a close eye on press encounters, so after long negotiations, Julie Crowley, his quite stern press aide, and Catherine Rimmer, his highly valued – and usually cheery – adviser, sat in. Occasionally, there would be a sharp intake of breath, as when the Deng question came, but they never intervened, let alone sought to stop the encounter. I reckon that candour is the best tribute and that he can take it. Which he can. I doubt that this was Mr Blair’s favourite moment, but the conversation continued cheerfully enough, along with a lot of jokes – people forget that Blair is amusing and quick on his feet. On another topic, he grew extremely animated, checked himself, and then clutched his head and sighed: ‘You have roused me to passion – as it were.’ He is a charmer and it would be fair to say that he knows it. However, even his close friends acknowledge that the story harmed Mr Blair (not least financially, since Mr Murdoch ended his donations to the American branch of Mr Blair’s faith foundation and cut him off from other donors in America). Besides the irresistible interest in the lives of the rich and famous, the factor that annoyed Mr Murdoch so much was a sense that the former PM had not been straight with him. True, some people (including Mr Blair’s fiercely protective staff) believe that all this is irrelevant at best, muck-raking at worst. I disagree, because such personal tales do give the rest of us some insight into how powerful people think and behave and where they have become entangled in their own odd logic. At 61, the trim and energetic former leader remains a fascinating figure. He has always combined a thespian lust for the limelight with a desire to be taken seriously in his political after-life. But the tensions of morality and Mammon have also been glaring in his involvement in places such as Kazakhstan, where he has set up a team of advisers, counselling the government of Nursultan Nazarbayev on ‘policy development and governance’. A laudable aim – and lucrative work. Alas, it also entailed Mr Blair appearing in a video edited to look as if the former Labour leader were a fully paid-up supporter of a leader who has zero interest in democracy, oppresses political opponents, and which weasels about its responsibility for a massacre of workers in 2011. The frustrating thing is that Mr Blair is surely right that moderate religion and engagement are vital to combat the evils of Islamic extremism. But the reasoning can get mighty tangled. Backing Egypt’s ex-military President Sisi, who is showing more talent for locking up scores of opponents than reform, looks unlikely to solve the trade-off between security and religious freedoms in Egypt and beyond. A lot of things look different in the wake of Iraq, the failed Arab Spring and the kind of appalling fundamentalist brutality we saw in the slaying of children by the Taliban in Pakistan last week. Rift: Friends of Mr Murdoch (right) say that when he questioned Mr Blair (left) about the relationship, he got only ‘politician’s answers’, which led to a long-standing political and personal friendship falling apart . Mr Blair tries hard to make Western enterprise and statecraft work for the good. But there is also a maddening blend of shrewdness and insight with avoidances and self-justifications. It leaves him with a permanent pass to the First Class lounge—but in a moral no-man’s land, garlanded one minute and decried as a war criminal the next. Mr Blair is, as he conceded, the only man to be subjected to a ‘citizen’s arrest’ by a waiter while trying to order a salad. I suspect that, for all the global glamour, commercial success and boundless self-belief, the most successful ex-Labour leader would like more credit and esteem at home. There is a frustration, even a loneliness about him, which cannot be dealt with by accumulating ever more clients and good causes. Next year, the Chilcot Inquiry will be critical of his handling of the Iraq War – but will also present him with a chance to talk about his mistakes as well as his achievements. He does not need to recant on his world-view, but he should show more openness about his failings and some regret for them. Most of all, Mr Blair needs to deal with a weakness which has come to haunt him in public and private life – he needs to talk straight.","Journalist Anne McElvoy interviewed Tony Blair for The Economist .

The Metropolitan Police offered a £10,000 reward yesterday for information leading to the arrest of Jordan Francois after he was mistakenly allowed out of Wandsworth Prison in London. But a force spokesman said the 18-year-old was arrested at 5.35am today in Edmonton, north London, and is now in custody. Police offered a £10,000 reward yesterday for information leading to the arrest of Jordan Francois (left) after he was mistakenly allowed out of Wandsworth Prison (right) in London . Scotland Yard had said Francois was 'unlawfully at large' from Wandsworth Prison, where he was on remand for attempted murder. The Prison Service said last night that it would 'formally investigate' the incident. A spokesman said: 'Releases in error are a very rare but regrettable occurrence. Jordan Francois, who was being held on suspicion of attempted murder, was released from Wandsworth Prison (pictured) by mistake but has since been brought back into custody . 'The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10 but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.' After his release, police released an appeal for information describing Francois as 6ft 4ins and stocky and with links to north London. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who was leading the investigation, called for anyone with information to contact officers 'immediately'.

"A sleeping family were saved from a blaze in their living room – when it was doused by water from the fish tank. Father-of-three Steve Whitehall forgot to blow out a candle when he went to bed on Wednesday. The unsupervised flame then sparked the fire early the next morning. But when it reached the 100-litre fish tank, it caused the glass to explode – causing 22 gallons of water to flood the burning lounge and waking the family upstairs. The 48-year-old from Warrington escaped unharmed with his teenaged children and wife Elizabeth, 45, before calling the fire brigade at 6.55am. The family were saved by their fish tank after father-of-three Steve Whitehall forgot to blow out a candle when he went to bed . Only small pockets of fire remained, as water from the tank had put most of it out. The family lost 13 of their 15 fish, but fire crews said the Whitehalls had had 'a very lucky escape'. Mr Whitehall said: 'We often have candles burning around the house and are usually very careful about making sure they are all out before we go to bed or go out. 'Unfortunately, we missed one last night and I cannot believe the damage that has been caused from just that one candle. 'Please, please, everyone, take great care if burning candles. 'We now have to sort out a fire damaged lounge, replace Christmas presents and have lost over 13 fish in the blaze. 'Fortunately, two survived in the couple of centimetres of water left in the tank. 'But, more importantly, I dread to think what would have happened if the sound of the breaking tank hadn't woken us and alerted us to the fire.' The family lost 13 of their 15 fish, but fire crews said the Whitehalls had had 'a very lucky escape' Tony Taylor, crew manager at Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'The Whitehalls have had a very lucky escape from what could have been a much more serious incident. 'Candles do need to be treated with great care, particularly at this time of the year. 'Mr and Mrs Whitehall, who have got smoke alarms fitted in their property, did the right thing by shutting internal doors before going to bed. 'This contained the fire to just the one room but we would recommend smoke alarms are fitted in rooms where candles are being burnt.'","Father-of-three Steve Whitehall forgot to blow out candle when went to bed .

"Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more Turkish migrants and their families after losing yet another EU court case. The UK had argued it should be allowed to opt out of an agreement giving workers from Turkey the same benefit rights as those from the EU. Ministers feared the Brussels ‘power grab’ would make Britain an even more attractive destination for immigrants and would lead to higher spending on welfare payments and pensions. Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more Turkish migrants and their families after losing yet another EU court case . It took the European Commission to court in a last-ditch attempt to get out of the deal. But in a ruling quietly announced last week, Britain lost the case and was told by judges at Europe’s highest court it could not opt out. It means any Turks who are allowed to come to Britain to work will be able to claim benefits for themselves and their families as well as building up pensions, which they could then transfer back to their home countries if they retire there. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘The British public quite rightly expect that those who come here should contribute. ‘We will be examining the full implications of the ruling.’","Britain could be forced to pay benefits to more Turkish migrants .

"Two out of every three secondary schools have struggled to recruit enough maths teachers in the past year, an alarming survey suggests. They also had difficulty finding English and science teachers, with almost half having problems in key subjects. The findings will add to growing concerns over the supply of teachers, which has been affected by the growing pupil population and the expansion of the School Direct programme. Scroll down for video . Two out of every three secondary schools have struggled to recruit enough maths teachers in the past year, an alarming survey suggests (file picture) School Direct, which involves training on the job, has filled just 61 per cent of the teaching places it was allocated this year. Headteachers say the problem is also exacerbated by large workloads and ‘teacher bashing’ by the Government and Ofsted. Overall, 25 per cent of schools still have at least one vacancy in maths, 23 per cent do not have enough science staff and 20 per cent are short of English teachers. The Association of School and College Leaders surveyed almost 800 secondary headteachers across the country. Some 63 per cent had problems recruiting maths teachers last year; 48.8 per cent for science, and 45.4 per cent in English. They defined recruitment problems as not having enough good quality applicants for the jobs. More than one in ten are having difficulty filling roles in geography, modern languages and design and technology. The schools also struggle to recruit English and maths teachers, with headteachers saying the quality of applicants is not good enough . Mark Jackson, headteacher of Haslingden High School in Lancashire, said he had just two applicants for a maths position. He added: ‘We were struggling all last year to get an English teacher. Part of the problem is that there is so much pressure on English teachers. There is a lot of marking; it is an incredible workload.’ A Department for Education spokesman denied a shortage, adding: ‘The teacher vacancy rate has remained low at around 1 per cent or below since 2000.’","63% of schools struggled recruiting maths teachers last year, figures show .

"Nutcracking is on the verge of becoming a lost art as sales of pre-shelled nuts continue to rise . A digital ‘e-card’ isn’t a patch on a paper Christmas greeting. A Skype call with Santa is no replacement for sitting on his knee. And a packet of pre-shelled walnuts is no substitute for the joy of spraying bits of shell shrapnel across the living room as you smash them up. Nevertheless, nutcracking is on the verge of becoming a lost art. It seems we just can’t be bothered to break into the Christmas nuts ourselves. For example, while sales of pre-shelled nuts and fruit-and-nut mixtures at Asda are up by 60 per cent compared with a year ago, sales of whole nuts in shells are down. Iron lever nutcrackers date back to the 13th century. The first use of the term in the English language was in 1481, when the Petty Customs Account recorded a dozen nutcrackers being traded. The mothballing of the nut-cracker would not just be bad news for those who enjoy taking their frustration out on some macadamias as another family argument breaks out. And our festive decor would be poorer — an overflowing basket of nuts in their shells is a visual delight. The change depresses Marlena Spieler, writer of more than 70 cookbooks, who says: ‘I like the experience of nutcracking more than the eating. Even the flavour is different. They taste so fresh, unlike the way they taste already shelled. ‘And it’s good for kids to see where nuts actually come from — and that they don’t grow in plastic packets.’ Furthermore, a recent study found that snackers who eat nuts in shells consume fewer calories than those who opt for the pre-shelled variety. The simple trick works because the sight of the piles of discarded shells acts as a visual reminder of how much you have eaten and discourages you from over-indulging. So, for those keen to cling onto a British tradition, which are the nutcrackers worth shelling out for? If you want one in time for Christmas, make sure you order today (the last day for Royal Mail to deliver first class packages in time), or if you wait until next week, ensure your order is being delivered by courier.

"British actor Idris Elba could become the next James Bond, according to leaked Sony emails. Elba, 42, who has starred in The Wire and Luther, could replace Daniel Craig as the next 007 when his contract ends after the next film, if leaked emails are to be believed. Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal allegedly told a top executive at Columbia Pictures, which distributes the Bond films, that 'Idris should be the next bond'. It is latest piece of information to emerge from the Sony hacking scandal, which resulted in the cancelling of the Christmas Day release of The Interview. Scroll down for video . British actor Idris Elba, 42 (left), who has starred in The Wire and Luther, could replace Daniel Craig, 46, (right) as the next James Bond when his contract ends after the next film, if leaked Sony emails are to be believed . Hackers threatened 9/11-style terrorist attacks on cinemas showing the comedy about two journalists – played by actors James Franco and Seth Rogen – who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The federal government confirmed on Wednesday that North Korea was behind the massive hack of Sony, which saw thousands of internal emails  leaked. According to the Daily Beast, an email sent on January 4 from Ms Pascal to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, simply said: 'Idris should be the next bond (sic).' If Elba, from Hackney, east London, did follow in Daniel Craig's footsteps, he would become the first black James Bond. Previous actors to portray 007 on the big screen include Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. Many have voiced support for Elba to play the British spy, including actor Jamie Foxx who said in an interview earlier this year that he was a big fan of the idea. Elba himself has also previously expressed desire to play the British spy, telling website Reddit that he would take the role. 'Yes. if it was offered to me, absolutely,' he said. An email sent on January 4 from Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal (pictured) to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, allegedly said: 'Idris should be the next bond' The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Actor Daniel Craig, 46, has seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's  Secret Service MI6 headquarters . A Facebook group called 'We want Idris Elba for James Bond', which was set up before the leak, also has more than 30,000 likes. The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Spectre, which follows on from the 2002 release of Skyfall, will be released in the UK in November next year. Daniel Craig, who is in contract to play Bond for one more movie at Spectre, could be seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's famed Secret Service MI6 headquarters, last week. The Liverpudlian, 46, could also be seen stood in the window of an apartment in Notting Hill, west London, filming scenes for the 24th James Bond film. Spectre was announced on December 4 and stars including Monica Bellucci (Lucia Sciarra), Christoph Waltz (Oberhauser), and Léa Seydoux (Madeleine Swann) have all been confirmed for the movie. However, the announcement was not without hiccup. The Sony hacking resulted in the film's original scripts being leaked, forcing producers to rewrite the plot line and bring in additional writers to help make changes to the ending. The leak also revealed that Spectre has a budget of over $300 million, which is $50 million more than its predecessor. Pierce Brosnan played James Bond in four of the films from 1995 to 2002, including Die Another Day . If Idris Elba did become the next actor to portray the British Spy, he would follow in the footsteps of Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore, George Lazenby and Sean Connery. Craig, 46, is set to play Bond in next year's release of Spectre. He has previously portrayed 007 in Skyfall (2012), Quantum of Solace (2008) and Casino Royale (2006). Brosnan played the spy in Die Another Day (2002), The World Is Not Enough (1999), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and GoldenEye (1995). Dalton portrayed Bond in Licence to Kill (1989) and The Living Daylights (1987). Moore, the longest-serving Bond actor, played 007 in A View to a Kill (1985), Octopussy (1983), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Moonraker (1979), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) and Live and Let Die (1973). Connery, the second longest-serving Bond actor, portrayed him in Diamonds Are Forever (1971), You Only Live Twice (1967), Thunderball (1965), Goldfinger (1964), From Russia with Love (1963) and Dr. No (1962). George Lazenby played Bond just once, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).","Actor Idris Elba could play James Bond, according to leaked Sony email .

"Violet Davies (pictured on her 100th birthday) has been threatened by East Sussex County Council with court action . A 100-year-old grandmother faces being taken to court on Christmas Eve by ‘heartless’ council officials over a nursing home bill. Violet Davies, who is deaf and blind, has received letters from East Sussex County Council demanding she pay more than £9,000 in fees for her care. With less than £3,000 in the bank, Mrs Davies cannot pay. Her only son, Les Davies, 71, says he has repeatedly tried to explain to officials that neither of them can afford the sum. But to his ‘disgust’, on December 9 the council gave his mother just two weeks to pay or face court action. It means proceedings against Mrs Davies – who has two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren – could begin on Christmas Eve. The letter stated: ‘In the event that you do not respond within fourteen days of the date of this letter we are instructed to issue proceedings, without notice, in the County Court. Any such claim will incur further costs and interest.’ Mr Davies, from Seaford, East Sussex, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year, said: ‘They’re absolutely heartless. I don’t feel like it’s Christmas now. I’m just worried all the time about what’s going to happen with this bill and I haven’t got the money to pay it. 'How can you threaten to take a 100-year-old woman who is registered blind and deaf to court on Christmas Eve?’ The retired businessman said his illness forced him to put his mother in Queensmead nursing home in January as a ‘last resort’. He and his wife Alice had previously looked after her at home, even building her a basement flat below their house in Newhaven. Welsh-born Mrs Davies joined the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service in the Second World War, taking food to bombed-out families. She worked as a school housekeeper before settling in Addlestone, Surrey, with her husband Jim. After he died 33 years ago she volunteered at an elderly people’s day centre. However, by 2003 her sight and hearing had become so poor that she was no longer able to live alone. Mr Davies estimates that he has since spent more than £120,000 on her care. In April last year he was diagnosed with cancer, and had chemotherapy and several operations. He reluctantly decided to find his mother a home. Mr Davies says East Sussex council agreed to cover most of her care while she contributed £500 a month. But in September he was told her fees had risen and she owed £9,697 – which came as a ‘complete shock’, he said. Mrs Davies, with her husband on their wedding day in 1936, cannot afford the £9,000 nursing home fees . Last night the council said it tried to assess her means, but ‘information requested had not been provided’. A spokesman added: ‘Therefore, we have good grounds to believe this person has the resources to pay… We are happy to work with the family if they believe this assessment is wrong.’ Mr Davies said he provided bank statements for himself and his mother. He added: ‘I’ve only got my pension and my mum hasn’t got any money.’ Caroline Abrahams, of charity Age UK, said it was ‘yet another symptom of a care system under terrible strain’. She added: There’s no avoiding the need for Government to pump more investment into social care.’","Violet Davies has been told by council to pay £9,000 in nursing home fees .

"A police notice deterring pickpockets has gone up in one of the busiest shopping areas in Britain – written in Romanian. The bright yellow sign, outside Covent Garden Underground station in Central London, states: ‘Ofiteri de politie in civil opereaza in aceasta zona.’ Put up by the Metropolitan Police, it translates as ‘plainclothes police officers operating in this area,’ and is believed to be the first time a force has put up a warning sign of this nature in Romanian. Covent Garden is a mile away from Hyde Park Corner – notorious for the scores of Romanian rough sleepers who have made the affluent area their home. Scroll down for video . Crackdown: The bright yellow sign in Romanian put up outside Covent Garden Tube Station warns 'plainclothes police officers operating in this area' Yesterday thousands of Christmas shoppers descended upon the area, and the crackdown by the Met is to dissuade gangs of thieves believed to be targeting large crowds of people hitting the shops before the festive holiday begins. Across Britain a minority of Romanians have been responsible for aggressive begging, pickpocketing and fraud, but the problems have been particularly bad in the capital. This year it was revealed that half of the pickpockets caught on the Tube were from Romania. Mark Field, Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said: ‘It is important to make it clear that this type of activity is not welcome on our shores. There are Romanian people here who can’t speak English and shouldn’t even be in this country if they are not seriously looking for work. ‘This is an essential move by the Met Police to make it clear that we’re on their case. ‘Those people who are coming here with no intention whatsoever to contribute to the British economy should be removed at the earliest possible opportunity, particularly if they’re guilty of aggressive begging or pickpocketing. The signs have been put up in Covent Garden, which is just a mile away from where scores of Romanian rough sleepers  have made their home . ‘There are many Romanians coming to this country willing to work, but I’m afraid there is a minority on the streets who should be removed.’ The Met would not confirm how many signs it has put up or in what languages they have been written. Jack Gordon, chairman of Hyde Park Safer Neighbourhood Ward Panel, said: ‘People around here are fed up with the pickpocketing – the place has turned into Fagin’s kitchen. ‘The crime has a hugely negative effect on tourism, on trade and on the residents. The problem is very difficult to deal with and I suppose the police are trying to prevent a crime from happening rather than deal with it afterwards.’ EU restrictions on migration to the UK from Romania were lifted in January. Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday revealed that the number of homeless Romanian migrants in some of the wealthiest areas of the capital had trebled. In May, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander called warnings of a rise in Eastern European migration ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ and ‘scaremongering’. His comments came in response to official figures showing the number of Bulgarians and Romanians working in the UK had fallen by 4,000 in the three months since employment restrictions were lifted. Figures for the whole of 2014 are not available yet but are expected to show a significant rise in the numbers coming from these countries. Last night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘In order to deter criminality, officers in Westminster deploy a number of tactics including the use of signs – in a variety of languages – warning people of the risk of pickpocketing in the area and providing reassurance regarding the presence of officers.’","Notice deterring Romanian pickpockets put up in busy shopping area .

They hope to be able to challenge the nations who are  disparaging their cuisine in a bid to 'dethrone' them as global masters of gastronomy. Star chefs Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy, who will be putting together a 20-point plan for the special report in January, have admitted that France's global culinary influence 'is no longer the same'. Star chefs Alain Ducasse (right) and Guy Savoy (left) will be putting together a 20-point plan for the 'gastrono-diplomacy' report in January . Foreign minister Laurent Fabius' 'gastrono-diplomacy' drive also includes plans to include radically easing immigration rules for cooks wanting to work with top French chefs, and a project to promote French cuisine in hundreds of embassies around the world. In the report seen by The Daily Telegraph, the chefs said: ''A feeling is setting in that the French, those lovers of good flesh, can no longer keep quality cuisine in their heritage except in certain good bistros that remain unknown or far from tourist paths.' 'We must react. How can French cuisine and wine re-enchant the world? 'We must start by highlighting our strong points and teaching the French to love their local soil and their country anew.' 'There is on the part of the Anglo-Saxons an attempt to dethrone us, to say that France used to be good but that it's lost its edge,' added Philippe Faure, a former French ambassador and ex-chairman of the Gault & Millau food guide. The chefs warned that citizens of France were beginning to feel their heritage of quality cuisine would only remain in good bistros far away from tourist traps . As part of the drive, the ministry will launch the Good France project in March which will see 1,000 chefs of different nationalities serve French food and wine in restaurants and embassies across five continents. The elaborate four course meals aim to emulate those of celebrated 19th century cook and culinary ambassador Georges August Escoffier. Unesco has named France's 'gastronomic meal' a world treasure and the country still welcomes more tourists than any other nation. But there are signs that its proud culinary reputation is beginning to diminish. Not a single French restaurant was made it into the top ten of this year's World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards which was instead dominated by Spain, the UK, USA, Brazil with Denmark as number one. Only five made it into the awards at all. The chefs claim the awards were unfairly influenced by the 'players that subsidise it' but admitted France's  mid-to-low range restaurants, particularity in tourist traps like Mont Saint Michel or the banks of the Seine, let the country down. French Foreign minister Laurent Fabius has launched a gastrono-diplomacy' to regain France's title as world's top culinary destination . The pair have now put together a long list of recommendations for regaining the country's culinary crown. They include restricting the number of starters and main dishes to three to ensure high quality, and ensuring only local, fresh, non-industrial ingredients are used. 'Red-tape' around wine and draconian alcohol advertising laws should also be cut by the government. Stricter criteria should also be introduced on food with the 'home-made' label in restaurants which currently allows most frozen and vacuum-packed food. Finally, the chefs propose that winners of the 2015 edition of France's coveted Michelin guide should be announced in a star-studded event at the foreign ministry.","France blames an 'Anglo-Saxon plot' for its ailing global culinary influence .

"The official body responsible for putting right miscarriages of justice is to launch an urgent, ‘fast-track’ inquiry into Wales’s worst mass murder following a Mail on Sunday investigation. A spokesman for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) last night revealed it has given its highest ‘priority one’ status to the case of David Morris, 52, who is serving four life sentences for the savage killings of Mandy Power, 34, her daughters Katie, ten, and Emily, eight, and her 80-year-old mother, Doris Dawson. Divorcee Mrs Power was Morris’s occasional lover, but was also in a lesbian relationship with Alison Lewis, a former police officer who was the wife of a serving South Wales sergeant, Stephen Lewis. The official body responsible for putting right miscarriages of justice is to launch an urgent, ‘fast-track’ inquiry into Wales’s worst mass murder; In 1999 David Morris murdered Mandy Power, above, and her two children, Katie, ten, and Emily, eight, along with her mother Doris Dawson at their Clydach home . Divorcee Mrs Power was Morris’s occasional lover, but was also in a lesbian relationship with Alison Lewis, a former police officer who was the wife of a serving South Wales sergeant, Stephen Lewis . Mr and Mrs Lewis were arrested for the murder and interviewed before Morris became a suspect, though not charged. Stephen’s twin, Inspector Stuart Lewis, was the first senior officer to reach the scene in Clydach, near Swansea, where Mandy and her family were bludgeoned to death. After lying in wait and slaughtering them with a heavy pole, the killer set fire to their house in an effort to cover his tracks. Inspector Lewis could not account for his movements at critical times during the night of the killings, June 26, 1999, and went off duty before telling any senior colleagues that this was a case of mass murder and arson. An official inquiry found he had told numerous lies and he was formally disciplined, though not criminally charged. As this newspaper revealed last month, a dossier compiled for the CCRC by Morris’s lawyers, Maslen Merchant and Francis FitzGibbon QC, contains compelling fresh evidence, uncovered after a five-year investigation by Winchester University journalism lecturer Brian Thornton. It includes the record of a message received by the murder inquiry incident room, which came from a trusted police informant. It stated that Mandy ‘and her kids had been threatened by her current lover’s husband who was a police officer’. Morris, who is serving four life sentences , and his victim Ms Dawson, 80; a five-year investigation by Winchester University journalism lecturer Brian Thornton has uncovered compelling fresh evidence . Also in the dossier are results of forensic tests done before Morris’s trial, which found traces of a man’s DNA on the murder weapon, the matches used to light the fire, and on Mandy’s clothes and watch. Inexplicably, further tests that could have established whether this DNA matched Morris or someone else were never carried out. Morris has always protested his innocence, and from his cell at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, is urging the CCRC to have these further tests conducted as soon as possible. In the wake of the Mail on Sunday report, several new witnesses have come forward with potentially vital new evidence. The CCRC spokesman confirmed that these statements will also form part of the new inquiry.","David Morris is serving four life sentences for killing four people .

"Mark Laverick, 41 (pictured), of Stanley, County Durham, was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for 10 years for trying to set his wife Beverley on fire . A jealous husband who doused his wife of 22 years in petrol before trying to set her alight has been jailed for a minimum of 10 years. Mark Laverick, of Stanley, County Durham, showered his wife Beverley in petrol before trying to set her on fire with matches and a lighter. The 41-year-old targeted his wife of more than two decades as she walked home from dropping their six-year-old daughter at school in June. His attempts to set his partner on fire were only thwarted when the wind prevented his matches from lighting, and a passer-by confronted him after hearing his victim's terrified screams. Laverick was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison, with an extended five-year licence period, after pleading guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent at Newcastle Crown Court on Friday. A charge of attempted murder was dropped. Judge John Milford QC branded Laverick 'dangerous' and also imposed a restraining order to keep him away from his estranged wife and their children. The judge said it was miraculous that the mother of three was not turned into a 'human torch' in the attack. He said: 'Miraculously the petrol did not ignite. 'Had it ignited she would have become a human fireball and suffered injuries which would have been painful in the extreme and disfiguring, almost certainly, for the rest of her life. 'One can think of few crueller crimes, short of murder, than setting someone alight. 'This is an extreme case.' The court heard that Laverick had been assessed as posing a high risk of causing harm to his wife and any future partner. Prosecutor Katherine Dunn told the court the couple, who had been together for 22 years and have three children together, had split prior to the incident on June 30. Their relationship had broken down in February and she had left him to go and live with her mother. In the weeks before the attack, Laverick made a series of threats towards his estranged wife and two days before the attack posted online: 'It's going to be hell or a cell for me like. I really don't care anymore.' He targeted his wife as she returned from dropping her daughter at school. He approached her and accused of her of being with someone else, before telling her: 'It ends today.' Ms Dunn told the court: 'He was carrying a bottle and he unscrewed the lid and threw the liquid into her face. 'It immediately began to burn her eyes and smelled like turps. She tried to run away from him but couldn't see where she was going and he chased her and continued to throw the liquid over her.' Laverick was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison, with an extended five-year licence period, after pleading guilty to attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) Ms Dunn told the court he then began striking matches and throwing them, but they could not light because of the wind. 'As he was throwing matches she was begging him to stop,' she said. 'She ran terrified into a nearby garden and tried to get help but the property was locked. She was screaming ""please help me"". 'He pushed her up against the fence and then used his lighter to try to set her on fire. He was flicking his lighter against her clothes, he tried to do this four or five times.' The court heard Laverick ran off when a neighbour came out of her house after hearing his victim's terrified screams. Mrs Laverick was taken to hospital where she was treated for eye irritation. She escaped serious injury. In a victim impact statement read to the court, she said she had 'never been so scared'. Pat Bott, 64, (pictured with her grandaughter Sam, 18), confronted Laverick before calling police after hearing the victim's desperate screams for help . 'He had such blankness in his eyes as he threw the matches towards me,' she said. 'All I could think of was my children.' Grandmother Pat Bott, 64, told the court how she managed to distract Laverick after hearing his wife's desperate pleas. She was passing, with her 18-year-old grandaughter Sam, when she heard Mrs Laverick screaming: 'Help, help he's going to burn me.' She said: 'He had poured petrol all over her and when we went out he was trying to light his lighter. 'I shouted ""What you doing, leave her alone"" and she managed to get free from him. 'It was scary but I think us going out brought an end to it. 'She was very upset and in tears. With me shouting, she said it gave her the strength to run.' Mrs Bott, who was nominated for a bravery award by police for her actions, said Laverick was still lurking outside when she looked out after dialling 999. She said: 'He stopped at the gate and I was thinking ""you dare come in my garden"". 'I can remember calling him a blooming idiot and then he went away.' When Laverick was arrested, he told police he had only set out to scare his wife. Christopher Knox, mitigating, said Laverick was depressed at the time, but had now found happiness with a new partner despite being behind bars. He said: 'He has, in the time he has been in custody, realised what he has done. 'He is regretful and apologetic. 'He regarded the marriage breakdown as terminal to his life. 'Fortunately, he no longer regards that as the case and accepts there is life after this marriage.' The judge said Laverick would spend until at least 2029 behind bars due to his 10-year prison sentence and the extended licence period.","Mark Laverick doused wife Beverley in petrol before trying to set her on fire .

"John Freeman, the former politician credited with inventing the television interview, has died at the age of 99 . Politician, magazine editor and pioneering television interviewer John Freeman has died, aged 99, it was reported last night. Mr Freeman was the last person living today who had been elected to Parliament in the landslide Labour victory of 1945, when he became the Labour MP for Watford. His loyal toast at the opening of Parliament prompted Winston Churchill to weep ‘all the best young men are on the other side now.’ But John Freeman was best known for his work on televison, in particular his series of Face to Face interviews on the BBC during the 1960s. He is often credited with having invented the political interview. Freeman’s face was never shown on Face to Face. Instead attention was focused on the subject of the interview, including merciless closeups, while viewers saw only Freeman’s back and the curl of smoke from his cigarette. He was renowned for his persistence and direct approach as an interviewer. Freeman’s own life was one of paradoxes. Born 19 February, 1915, the son of a Chancery barrister from whom he inherited his hard, analytical mind, it was reported that he was invited to eat with his father only once a week. Educated at Westminster School, he saw active service in The Second World War and was appointed MBE in 1943. He became a presenter of Panorama before editing New Statesman magazine and presenting Face to Face. Harold Wilson appointed him British High Commissioner to India (1965-68) and he became Ambassador in Washington DC (1969-71). He went on to become Chairman of LWT in 1971, serving until his retirement in 1984. Mr Freeman (pictured centre with Robert Kee, left, and William Rees Mogg, right, in the I.T.N. 1964 election studio) presented Panorama and Face to Face . Then, aged 69, he decided to move on again. Giving up everything he moved abroad with his third family to California where he became a visiting professor of international relations. He returned to the UK in 1990. John Freeman married four times and was known as something of a ladies man, conducting numerous affairs. In his professional life, however, he remained low key, and refused to embrace any form of celebrity. In 2005 he wrote: ‘When I retired from even the out reaches of public responsibility, I resolved to put that life completely out of mind – to forget it all, in fact.’ In recent years John Freeman had been living in a military care home in South London.","Politician and magazine editor John Freeman reportedly died last night .

"The BBC's director of TV has admitted the corporation is facing growing competition from rivals both on screen and online, with the rise of streaming services such as Netflix 'blowing deals out of the water'. Shows such as The Great British Bake Off and Strictly Come Dancing helped give the BBC some of the highest ratings on TV last year, with a 21.7 per cent share of audience viewing figures compared to ITV's 15.6 per cent. However, despite the success, the BBC's director of TV said the broadcaster was facing stronger competition than ever, thanks to the likes of online platforms such as Netflix. Danny Cohen (pictured), the BBC's director of TV, said the broadcaster was facing stronger competition than ever, thanks to the likes of online platforms such as Netflix, and said it meant the BBC faced 'hard choices' He said Netflix had managed to offer 'five times' the amount of money for a deal than the BBC could and said it had 'blown us out of the water' in terms of the deal. Despite the rival, the BBC had high viewing figures for 2014 . Danny Cohen, who is widely tipped as a future director general at the corporation, told the Financial Times: 'There's been a recent example where Netflix was able to blow us out of the water in terms of a deal. 'The sums offered by Netflix were five times what we could offer.' Netflix, a U.S.-based network which provides TV shows and films via its online platform, has grown enormously over the last 12 months, with successes such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. Mr Cohen said  the rise of Netflix, and the additional investment in TV dramas by Sky and ITV, meant the licence-funded corporation faced 'hard choices'. He said the BBC had to adjust to a 'hybrid world' of both live and online viewing. England v Uruguay World Cup match - 13.9million . Great British Bake Off, October 8 - 13.5million . Sherlock, January 1 - 12.7million . Britain's Got Talent, April 12 - 12.4million . Germany v Argentina World Cup final - 12.1million . I'm A Celebrity, November 16 - 11.9million . Strictly Come Dancing, November 15 - 11.4million . Call The Midwife, January 19 - 11.3million . Coronation Street,  January 20 - 11million . Downton Abbey, November 2 - 10.7million . He said: 'Television's not going away, channels are not going away for quite some time, but more people are going to watch online.' In March, BBC director general Tony Hall announced plans to move channel BBC Three solely online. The move would reportedly save the corporation tens of millions of pounds by slashing the youth-oriented station's budget and moving its shows to the iPlayer internet service. The former controller of the channel, Zai Bennett, recently said the plan to close it was 'perverse', 'odd' and a 'massive strategic mistake'. But, despite mounting opposition from presenters and some executives over recent months, the BBC's new chairman, Rona Fairhead, said the corporation should focus on putting even more shows on the internet. So far this year, BBC One has accounted for 21.7 per cent of live television viewing in the UK, up 0.7 per cent from last year. Meanwhile, ITV has accounted for 15.6 per cent, which is down 0.9 per cent on last year. BBC shows such as The Great British Bake Off, the second most-watched show on TV last year – beaten only by an England World Cup match – and Strictly Come Dancing helped secure its rise in the TV ratings. In contrast, the audience viewing figures released from the Broadcasters Audience Research Board (BARB), revealed that ITV's peak-time viewing fell eight per cent last year, despite shows such as X Factor, I'm a Celebrity and having the rights to this year's World Cup. So far this year, BBC One has accounted for 21.7 per cent of live television viewing in the UK, up 0.7 per cent on last year. In comparison, ITV has attracted a share of 5.6 per cent, which is down 0.9 per cent on last year .","BBC director of TV said corporation faced 'hard choices' with rise of rivals .

"Three years ago to the day, I crashed to the ground with severe acute pancreatitis. My own fault entirely. To mark a diagnosis of diabetes, and being in Cornwall for the holidays, I drank several beakers of single malt, plus a few bottles of burgundy, and the next thing I remember a student nurse was inserting a catheter the size of a hosepipe up what in a Victorian dictionary would be called my ‘organ of generation’. I was in the hospital’s high dependency unit for three weeks and received a ‘get well’ card from film director Bryan Forbes and his actress wife Nanette Newman. They’d mistaken Roger Lewis for Roger Moore. Suffice it to say, I have been teetotal since December 2011. I’ve got used to it – I have reverted to my ancestral roots and become a frowning and disapproving Welsh puritan. ALL THAT GLITTERS: Roger Lewis meets actress Barbara Windsor during his stint in panto . One thing I no longer do, come Christmas, is go to parties. What you realise, being on the water-wagon, is how boring other people become when they are drunk or getting drunk. By staying at home I also deny journalist Lynn Barber the chance to turn her back on me – she really did that after I was rude about her in a review. A textbook snub. Silly me, I thought she’d have been used to it. Despite the boozelessness, I adore Christmas more than ever. As with supermarkets, which start playing Sinatra and Elvis carols, it begins for me in November, my first mince pie going down the hatch round about Armistice Day. I love the nights drawing in, the cold. Except it seldom is cold. More of a muggy drizzle. I live in Rochester, Kent, which is pretty much unchanged since Dickens’s day – an attractively seedy town with spooky cobbled alleys and yellow fogs coming off the Medway. We have poulterers and muffin men. As there’s never real snow, however, machines spray the crowds with flecks of foam. The townsfolk can’t wait to get into their Mr Pickwick costumes and walk up and down selling chestnuts and mulled wine. Tickets for the cathedral’s carol services have been sold out for months. I’ve never had any luck finding a white Christmas, sad to report. I went to Vermont and it rained. I went to the Canadian Rockies and there was a heatwave. I watched White Christmas yet again last week – and there’s no snow in that either, until the very end, when it is plainly a Hollywood studio set. What this indicates is what a massive fabrication the whole glittery season is – a big cynical excuse for a commercial orgy, an eating orgy, but probably not an orgy orgy as everyone is too stupefied to want to be bothered with any of that and too pie-eyed to know whom to address scented thank-you notelets to afterwards. Nonetheless, I am a sucker for the theatricality (ie the kitsch) of Christmas. Not only are my halls decked with boughs of holly, my tree is a death-trap. I’ve never mastered the art of getting it to remain vertical so it tilts alarmingly, the coloured lights popping and fizzing on their frayed cord. I send out more than a hundred cards. I get about 20 back, mostly from school pals I have not clapped eyes on for 40 years who insist on enclosing their boastful round-robins: ‘I was invited by HM The Queen,’ said one, ‘to the Order of the Garter Service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.’ My social highlight in 2014 was seeing Jeremy Paxman in the gents at the Garrick Club. In Little Women, one of the monstrous moppets says that Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without any presents. For me, Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without the telly. For weeks now I have been munching Lindt chocolate reindeers as I watch absolutely terrible seasonal films on Channel 5. There are heaps of them – all the same: Santa and Mrs Santa incognito in an old folk’s home; single mums finding romance over the eggnog; hedge-fund bankers mending their Scrooge-like ways; divorcees in novelty knitwear getting reconciled. On some cable channel or other, Jamie has been stuffing his birds for ages, Nigella is licking her beaters endlessly, and over at River Cottage ‘sprouts are given a new lease of life by Hugh’. Since going teetotal Roger Lewis enjoys Christmas 'more than ever' It is not that programmes are recycled – they are in a loop. Barbara and Jim Royle, the original goggleboxers, are always swearing and being coarse; Gavin and Stacey, the Welsh-Essex Romeo and Juliet, are forever eating Christmas dinner, as is Dawn French’s vicar of Dibley. Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Jonathan Creek, Morse and Frost have a never-ending series of cases to crack. Happy Christmas to all the actors who are raking in the repeat fees! It’s easy enough to sneer at Christmas and be curmudgeonly, but I wasn’t impressed when a friend in Edinburgh, a genuine Scrooge who keeps unused boiled water in a flask next to the kettle, told me he and his wife liked nothing more than to go for a walk on Christmas Day, staring in through people’s windows at families falling out. For there are good things to be had at Christmas – love, warmth, nostalgia – not just the chance to be superior by observing greed or mocking sentimental claptrap. For example, this year there will be a round-up of my children, who, when they weren’t being told by the doctors in Cornwall that ‘there’s a chance that your father may still be with us at Christmas’, have been abroad in more recent years, breaking down in a VW camper van in France, for example, or earning a crust in a travelling circus. My son the clown, by the way, has been doing a stint in a red suit as Santa this past month in a garden centre near Bagshot, Surrey. He gets seven minutes off each hour when the elf does a magic show.

"Tearing open the wrapping on the gifts under her grandmother’s tree, Lulah Rae Smith squeals with delight at her new cuddly toys – Olaf the snowman and his donkey sidekick Sven from Disney’s hit film Frozen. Christmas for this two-year-old has come early this year, but there is good reason for Lulah’s parents Tariq and Lisa choosing to spoil their daughter. For as other children open gifts on December 25, Lulah will be in hospital receiving a life-saving blood transfusion – her 31st such treatment since being diagnosed with a rare disorder, hereditary spherocytosis, within hours of being born. 'This is number 30': Lulah Rae Smith, pictured with a sign indicating her 30th blood transfusion, will spend Christmas Day receiving her 31st such treatment . The disease causes the spleen – part of the immune system – to destroy red blood cells rather than create them. Red blood cells are vital for carrying oxygen around the body. While a mild reduction in numbers, typically caused by a nutritional deficiency, simply causes fatigue or sometimes pain, in severe cases the organs can quickly become irreversibly damaged. Lulah’s first transfusion came when she was just 20 days old, and without having one every five weeks she would die. She is just one of thousands of patients who will need transfusions over the festive period, which is why NHS Blood and Transplant is urging would-be donors not to put off giving blood until the New Year – as many do – or miss their regular scheduled appointments. Tariq, 39, a production engineer for a plastics company, explains: ‘From day one we’ve seen how much Lulah needs that blood. Towards the end of the five-weekly cycle, she loses all her energy. Then almost immediately after her transfusion it’s like she’s been recharged. ‘To think that strangers have given us this gift of life month after month is incredible. All our friends and family are donors and I do everything I can to encourage more people to donate, especially at this time of year when stocks can run low.’ There are about one million regular blood donors in England and North Wales who have given blood at least once in the past year. Appointment dates are generated automatically by computer. But last year, a fifth of appointments were missed over the festive period – a figure that could be even higher this year as Christmas Day and Boxing Day are followed by the weekend. Blood can’t be frozen, and once donated it lasts for only 35 days. Platelets – a constituent of blood commonly used to help those with leukaemia or other cancers – last for just seven days. ‘Because of this turnover, more than 6,000 donors are needed every single day of the year. It’s tough to maintain stocks at the best of times,’ says Jon Latham, of NHS Blood and Transplant. There is pressure on stocks of certain blood types, particularly O RhD Negative as it can be received by those of all blood types in situations where there isn’t time to determine type, such as after a road accident. Early presents: Lulah opens her toys - Olaf the snowman and his sidekick Sven from Disney’s hit film Frozen . Mr Latham says more than 200,000 blood donors and 12,500 platelet donors are needed this Christmas to safeguard hundreds of thousands of patients. ‘On top of those who need regular transfusions, such as cancer patients, there’s extra strain because of all the people suffering accidents with the cold weather and alcohol-related injuries around this time of year,’ he says. ‘We ran a similar campaign in 2013 and got through it by actively emailing and calling regular donors, but with the longer break this Christmas, the pressure is really on.’ He adds: ‘We’ve recently been running a Know Your Type promotion in shopping centres and universities to test new people who haven’t donated before. We’re always looking for new donors, particularly from the Asian, Caribbean, black African, Bangladeshi and Indian communities, which commonly have rare blood groups and are prone to blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia.’ Lulah, of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, is A RhD Positive, a fairly common type, but for her first five transfusions she needed O RhD Negative as she was too young to ascertain which blood type she was. Tariq recalls: ‘My father, my elder daughter Tamzyn, 15, and I have the same condition, but in a milder form. I had my spleen removed when I was five, which was very young, but we’ve been told Lulah needs to have hers removed early next year. It’s a very risky operation for someone so young, but it’s the only long-term option we have.’ As well as transfusions, Lulah is regularly admitted to Kettering General Hospital with complications related to her condition. ‘It’s increasingly hard to get a needle into her veins because of all the scar tissue,’ her father says. ‘It is very distressing but Lulah takes it all in her stride. ‘We want to thank everyone who has ever given blood – and to anyone thinking about it, I urge you to do it. We don’t mind that Lulah’s got to be in hospital on Christmas Day. Without the transfusions, our little girl wouldn’t be with us to enjoy Christmas at all.’ Find your nearest place to give blood at www.blood.co.uk or call 0300 123 2323 .","On December 25, Lulah will be receiving a life-saving blood transfusion .

"Have you ever thought about how you would survive if the nation, or even the world, faced a disaster? For many Australians, the question is simply an uncomfortable thought, but for a small section of society, known commonly as 'preppers', it is a driving passion. Despite the hype around the term which may call into mind doomsday preachers or conspiracy fanatics, the close-knit community want to be known simply as regular people who are prepared- very prepared. Scroll down for video . Peter (above) runs the Australian 'prepping' website OzPrepper and has filled his house with prepping gear . Peter, head of Australia's prepping website OzPrepper, said that he saw the movement as a way of 'making active preparations for a possible catastrophic disaster or emergency'. 'Being a prepper is no more crazy than buying a first aid kit, its just a sensible thing to do,' said Peter. 'In general, I live a relatively 'normal' life, but prepping tends to make me more aware of my surroundings and the possible things that can go wrong,' he said. After becoming interested in world politics a decade ago, Peter became increasingly fascinated with events that could end society- nuclear war, financial collapse, electrical grids shutting down, water running out. He became convinced that it was only a matter of time before some sort of disaster happened in Australia, and decided to prepare for the imminent event. Peter said he is a 'regular guy', and sees prepping as something sensible to protect himself and his dog Minnie (right) for who he has a baby holster for her to sit in when he is bush tracking . Peter with his 'bug out bag' filled with necessities in case of an emergency or natural disaster . While Peter is prepared for large-scale catastrophes and smaller natural disasters such as bushfires or earthquakes, he doesn't put much stock in the fear of some in the community who predict the end of the world. 'There are preppers who are seriously preparing for a zombie apocalypse, but personally I think that’s absurd,' Peter said. Paul, another prepper who chronicles his cross-country travels, said that prepping is 'all about being ready to deal with the curve balls that life can throw at you,' 'In other words take responsibility for your own wellbeing. There are hundreds of likely events like power outages or job losses that can befall any of us. 'Forget Armageddon and zombies, think ""company restructure"" or ""backhoe cuts power lines"",' said Paul. After working in a corporate environment for many years, Paul decided to go off the grid, 'returning to a simpler more independent and self-sustaining lifestyle.' Peter's unit has prepping items including batteries, supplies of food and water, world-band radios, and first aid . 'There are preppers who are seriously preparing for a zombie apocalypse, but personally I think that’s absurd,' Peter said . 'Being a prepper is no more crazy than buying a first aid kit, its just a sensible thing to do,' said Peter . For him, prepping simply seems like a logical step to take in order to protect himself and his loved ones against the possibility of a disaster. 'Why shouldn't people be preppers? They prepare for the chance of a flat tyre by having a spare, they prepare for the chance of a house fire by holding insurance,' Paul pointed out. 'These are very infrequent events, and yet almost everyone prepares for them. So why not prepare for events such as a pandemic, a financial collapse or even just a cyclone or flood?' Paul said that he viewed the economy as a very fragile system which could be easily upended by a disaster, as most people source their food from companies who have it imported from thousands of kilometers away. 'What happens when the trucks can't deliver the food because the power grid has failed, and diesel isn't available?' he asked. 'After about three days the supermarket shelves will be empty and people will start looking for food. You are better off not being one of those people.' Peter agreed, saying that without power society would quickly deteriorate into chaos, which is why he has identified three main areas of prepping: bugging in, bugging out, and everyday carry items. 'Bugging in' means 'staying put in your place of residence in an emergency or disaster' and 'bugging out' means 'leaving your place of residence in an emergency or disaster, typically to a bug out location (BOL), a predetermined location that has a clean and plentiful water source, and is private and secure,' said Peter. Peter's 'bug out vehicle' (BOV), a specially designed bicycle with a 1000 watt electric hub motor with 100 kilometre range . 'In a true SHTF (S**t Hit Th Fan) scenario, driving a car would be useless, because the roads would be grid locked. Here in Sydney, on a normal day, the roads are close to grid locked in peak hour,' Peter said . Peter's specially modified bicycle has a pet basket for Minnie, his 12-yeat-old chihuaua . Peter's 'bug out bag', a pack which contains all the esential items he would need in case of an emergency, is one of his most prized possessions. From Army-grade energy bars and cooking devices, to weapons, a world-band radio, a first aid kit, and a complete survival manual, the bug out bag stays in his 'bug out vehicle' (BOV), a specially designed bicycle with a 1000 watt electric hub motor with 100 kilometre range. 'In a true SHTF (S**t Hit Th Fan) scenario, driving a car would be useless, because the roads would be grid locked. Here in Sydney, on a normal day, the roads are close to grid locked in peak hour.' 'Imagine just a small disaster, it would be chaos, let alone a full blown emergency. So, that said, I plan on using  my BOV'. Paul said that preppers are often depicted as 'tin-foil-hat-wearing paranoids,' and though he admitted that a minority may be fanatics, 'most are just providing their own insurance against whatever may happen in their lives,' an attitude he encourages others to adopt. Peter's unit uses every inch of his living room and bedroom for his prepping gear . Peter has created machines in anticipation of a disaster, and is seen here with his mobile solar panel . 'Figure it out now, not after there's a disaster,' Paul said. Even for those who aren't interested in becoming preppers, both men insist that some level of preparation is essential. 'It isn’t everyone’s cup of tea to be prepared for the end of the world, but there are small things people should do, things that won’t impact on their everyday life, like having 3 to 4 months supply of food and water. And a first aid kit,' said Peter. 'Depending on where you live, you should at least be prepared for likely local disasters. Like far north Queenslanders should be prepared for a cyclone. Or someone in a bush fire prone area should be prepared for a bush fire.' Paul said that it was a good idea to consider being prepared for the most likely scenarios, to store some food and water that would last at least a few days. 'Buy a small generator so you don't lose everything in the fridge if the power fails and you can charge you phone, and maybe pick up a 50-cal Barret to fend off the zombies...just kidding.'","'Preppers' are a tight-knit community of people who are taking measures to ensure that they are prepared for disaster or emergency .

"The wife of the gunman killed during this week's cafe siege will have her bail reviewed at Sydney's Supreme Court. Man Haron Monis's wife, Amirah Drouis, has been on bail since being charged with involvement in the murder of his ex-wife Noleen Pal in 2013. NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard recently expressed concern she was out on bail and asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to review the decision. Mr Hazzard said that 'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder'. Scroll down for video . Man Haron Monis's wife, Amirah Drouis (above), has been on bail since being charged with involvement in the murder of his ex-wife Noleen Pal in 2013 . 'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' Ms Drouis has been reporting to the Campsie Police Station daily, after police launched an urgent search for Man Haron Monis's partner on the day of the Sydney siege after her mother reported her missing. Ms Droudis had acted as Monis's spokesperson for many years, delivering YouTube messages on behalf of the self-declared sheikh. In one video uploaded in 2009, a niqab-clad ‘Sister Amirah’ proclaims she is a terrorist. Man Haron Monis's partner, Amirah Droudis, shared his extremist views . On the morning of the siege Ms Droudis had been reported missing by her mother . Police arrived at Ms Droudis's family home in Belmore, but were informed that she was at a Wiley Park address. The residence is the same one she shared with the gunman before he was killed in the siege which claimed the lives of Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson. The review comes after questions were raised as to why gunman Monis was also out on bail, a detail which saw him free to interact with the community and allowed him the freedom to be in Martin Place. Monis walked into the Lindt cafe in Sydney's busy Martin Place around 9.30am on Monday, pulled a shotgun from a bag and took 18 people hostage. The siege ended in a hail of gunfire almost 17 hours later when police stormed the cafe. Ms Droudis is on bail charged with murdering Monis's ex-partner Noleen Pal in 2013 . If the original ruling is overturned, Amirah Droudis could be taken into custody. Monis came to the attention of police when he sent hate-filled letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers seven years ago. He also faced dozens of indecent and sexual assault allegations before his death on Tuesday. Mr Hazzard has asked the DPP to review any cases where bail has been granted and where there may be any similarity to the circumstances of the Monis matter. He was charged with being an accessory to the murder of Ms Pal, who was stabbed and had her body set alight.

"Ed Miliband’s leadership came under fire again last night after details of a row with outspoken Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant were revealed. Mr Bryant, as Labour welfare spokesman, protested at a decision to crack down on the benefits rights of EU immigrants. When Mr Miliband refused to back down, the fiercely pro-European Mr Bryant threatened to walk out of the Shadow Cabinet unless the party leader gave him another plum job. So Mr Miliband gave in and moved Mr Bryant to what friends claim is his ‘perfect job’ as arts spokesman. Scroll down for video . Fierce: Labour MP Chris Bryant is strongly pro-Europe. Mr Bryant, as Labour welfare spokesman, protested at a decision to crack down on the benefits rights of EU immigrants . The secret deal avoided creating a damaging Labour rift but has led to fresh claims by the party’s MPs that Mr Miliband is ‘not tough enough’ to be Prime Minister and ‘too weak’ for Downing Street. One veteran Labour MP said: ‘If Miliband cannot summon the courage to sack someone like Chris Bryant, he will never command the respect of his team.’ The disclosure comes a month after Mr Miliband was mocked for the way he sacked Left-wing MP Diane Abbott, who was fired last year for repeatedly refusing to toe the line on party policy. Ms Abbott said that the Labour leader asked her if he was doing the ‘right thing’. The secret deal avoided creating a damaging Labour rift but has led to fresh claims that Mr Miliband is ‘not tough enough’ to be Prime Minister . Sources said the Labour leader was so desperate to avoid a resignation over immigration policy that he ‘tamely’ agreed to move Mr Bryant to a new frontbench job. The row broke out after Rachel Reeves, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, unveiled plans last month to force jobless migrants from the EU to wait for two years before they could claim out-of-work benefits. The move by Ms Reeves, then Mr Bryant’s boss, was designed to counter criticisms that Labour was ‘soft’ on immigration. However, the plans infuriated Mr Bryant, a former Europe Minister under the last Labour government. Within a fortnight, he was moved from the welfare brief to the party’s culture, media and sport team. Friends said: ‘Chris didn’t agree with the policy announced by Rachel and he made it very clear. He was ready to quit and said so, but instead, he was offered the arts post which, frankly, is a perfect job for Chris.’ They denied reports Mr Bryant had also found it difficult to work under Ms Reeves, who was only elected to the Commons in 2010. Mr Bryant’s move was a little-noticed part of a wider reshuffle sparked by Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry’s resignation after she was accused of ‘snobbery’. Ms Thornberry quit after tweeting a picture of a terraced house with three England flags and a white van outside it during a visit to Rochester where Mr Bryant was in charge of a Labour by-election campaign. Last night, neither the Labour Party nor Mr Bryant were available for comment.","Ed Miliband’s leadership came under fire again after details of a row with outspoken Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant were revealed .

"Archaeologists who discovered an ancient site which could be key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Stonehenge are calling on the government to rethink  plans for a tunnel under the 5,000 year-old monument. Plans were announced last month for the 1.8 mile tunnel, costing up to £1billion, underneath the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire to help relieve one of Britain's most traffic-congested roads. Both the National Trust and English Heritage had welcomed the announcement which will give better public access to the wider prehistoric landscape and will benefit local wildlife. Plans were announced last month for the 1.8 mile tunnel, costing up to £1billion, underneath Stonehenge (pictured) in Wiltshire . Transport groups are also hoping it will ease the traffic jams on the A303, one of the main routes into the South West, which have plagued motorists for decades. But archaeologists are calling on the government to rethink its plans after a new site was discovered nearby which could be key to unlocking the mystery surrounding Stonehenge. They warn that the chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be 'wrecked' if the tunnel goes ahead. A series of digs 1.5miles away at Amersbury, next to the A303, has unearthed evidence of a settlement that pre-dates Stonehenge by thousands of years. Blick Mead is thought to have been occupied by hunter-gatherers returning to Britain after the Ice-Age when the country was still attached to mainland Europe. Thousands of tools have been discovered at the Mesolithic feasting site as well as evidence of giant bulls known as aurochs and possible structures. Archaeologist David Jaques, who made the discovery of Blick Mead, said it could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past . But the site could be destroyed if plans for a 1.8 mile tunnel go ahead experts have warned. Archaeologist David Jaques, who made the discovery of the encampment, told The Daily Telegraph: 'The prime minister is interested in re-election in 140 days – we are interested in discovering how our ancestors lived six thousand years ago.' He added: 'Blick Mead could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past. 'But our chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.' David Cameron had announced the plans to create a duel carriageway on the A303 and build a new tunnel to take traffic away from the world heritage site on an earlier visit Stonehenge. It came as part of a £15 billion package of road schemes which also include adding extra lanes to some motorways,improvements to junctions on the M25, to the A27 in Sussex, and on approaches to Liverpool and the A1 in the north east. The tunnel would aim to ease the traffic jams on the A303, (pictured) one of the main routes into the South West, which have plagued motorists for decades . But Mr Jacques warned the only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain’s history 'could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.' Professor Tim Darvill, of Bournemouth University has described this as 'This is the most important discovery at Stonehenge in over 60 years.' Experts are calling on the government to rethink plans to build on the critically important landscape. Andy Rhind-Tutt, of Amesbury and chairman of the Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, added: 'Traffic congestion to one of the country's most visited attractions will not be solved by a tunnel with one exit lane – the current tailback can extend five miles and can take two hours to get through. 'Any tunnel would need to be motorway standard, and even with four lanes there would still be tailbacks. 'A much more practical solution would be to reroute the A303 supporting South Wiltshire as well as the West Country.'","Government announced plans for the 1.8-mile  tunnel on A303 last month .

"The Saturday's singer Vanessa White will only have two days off from training over Christmas . Spare a thought for The Saturday’s singer Vanessa White as you tuck into another mince pie or piece of chocolate. After signing up with top catwalk agency Select Model Management, the pop star’s personal trainer, Giacomo Farci, is allowing her only two days off over Christmas. ‘I train five times a week, doing kickboxing and cross-training,’ reveals Vanessa. ‘I don’t want to let myself go and then have to frantically catch up in January, so I’ll be back at the gym on December 27.’ Vanessa’s kickboxing workout includes kicking pads and punching bags, and also squatting with weights to strengthen her legs. Let’s hope she doesn’t lose her temper on Christmas Day as her new skills could prove dangerous. If you do overindulge at Christmas, make sure there’s a bowl of nuts to hand. They mop up bad cholesterol and lower the risk of heart disease, say researchers, who compared the health benefits of ten different types of nuts. Pistachios have the highest concentration of phytosterols, compounds that work in the intestine to lower the amount of bad cholesterol absorbed. Meanwhile, almonds, cashews, macadamias, hazelnuts and pistachios have the highest levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, which help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood. Could whisky prevent cancer? A dram after dinner could be a real tonic – as long as it’s a certain type of whisky. Researchers found two whiskies from the island of Islay contain high levels of bromophenols, which have been shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-cancer effects. Research showed certain types of whiskey could have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-cancer effects . A team from Hohenheim University in Germany carried out a range of tests and found two single malts – Laphroaig and Lagavulin – have bromophenols, which are also found in algae and shrimps. However, they were unsure how much would have to be consumed to experience any discernible health benefits. It's the present no one wants at this time of year. But the holiday period is the peak time for passing on flu, according to research – and it may be linked to the end of term time at schools and colleges. The rates of infection in the third week of December are more than double compared with the previous two weeks, as well as in January, February and March. Scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looked at reports of flu-like illness in more than 4,000 people and the highest rates were found among those under the age of 18. In the final last week of December, there was a rise in incidence among adults, suggesting that children had passed the virus on to their families. Beware Christmas Tree Syndrome . Not all sniffles during the festive period are down to colds – the same symptoms could be due to an allergy dubbed Christmas Tree Syndrome. Firs can carry allergens such as pollen from other plants on the bark, triggering hay fever. They can also collect mould on their trunks and needles which release spores, causing allergic reactions. And it’s not just real trees that can be a problem – artificial trees can also trigger allergies. If you have stored your tree since last year, it will have amassed a layer of dust that will be dispersed when it is disturbed.","Singer has signed up to top catwalk agency Select Model Management .

"Kirsty Gallacher says her dad 'would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given' So many details surrounding golfer Bernard Gallacher’s sudden cardiac arrest in August last year remain a mystery. Prior to the attack, he had not suffered any symptoms or ill health. And, although the cause – an ‘electrical fault’ – has now been determined, doctors still cannot be sure why his heart stopped beating that day. But there is one thing on which doctors do agree: Bernard is extremely lucky to be alive. The 65-year-old, who played in eight Ryder Cups and captained Europe three times in the competition, mercifully remembers nothing of the event. As he stood up to give a speech after dinner at the Marcliffe Hotel in Aberdeen, he ‘just fell over, as if a boxer had landed a punch’. At first ‘people in the audience thought it was part of my act’, Bernard has recalled since, jokingly. His next memory came more than a week later in intensive care, with his distraught wife Lesley, and children Laura, Jamie and television presenter Kirsty, at his bedside. So, yes, many unknowns. Yet there is one certainty: were it not for the swift intervention of those in the audience who knew first aid, Bernard would not have survived. While acknowledging their incredible good fortune, Sky Sports star Kirsty, 38, still finds it hard to recount the dreadful days watching over her perilously ill father. And so, as she opens the nominations for the fourth St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes awards, she has issued an impassioned plea: ‘My dad would be dead if it wasn’t for the first aid he was given. These are skills anyone can learn – and everyone should. ‘I have, as luckily Sky offers courses. In fact, I’ve done the course twice. It’s not just cardiac arrests or heart attacks but everyday things such as cuts, burns or choking. ‘The fact is, if you don’t know what to do in a situation like that – whether it’s a family member in need or a stranger in the street – you’re helpless, and all you can do is stand by, watch and do nothing. Imagine how you’d feel if someone died when you could have helped save them.’ Among the audience at the Marcliffe that day was Colin Leyden, who by coincidence trains oil-rig workers in how to use defibrillators. These machines deliver a short electric shock via adhesive pads placed on the chest to restart the heart in the event of a cardiac arrest. A nurse – again, at the event by coincidence – performed chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth, while Mr Leyden, 44, rushed to the hotel gym to retrieve the defibrillator, which is also known as an AED. Together the pair kept his heart going for more than 20 minutes before paramedics arrived and took over. Bernard’s heart stopped three times – and each time the AED brought him back to life. Earlier this month, Bernard was able to meet his saviour and shake him by the hand. ‘What do you say to the guy who saves your life?’ he has said. ‘Thanks very much, for a start.’ 'We all feared the worst': Kirsty and her father Bernard, who suffered sudden cardiac arrest in August last year . In partnership with The Mail on Sunday, the Everyday Heroes awards recognise inspirational individuals who have helped save lives through first aid. From today, you can nominate in a number of different categories, and the winners will be announced at a star-studded ceremony at the Lancaster London hotel, hosted by Kirsty on July 1, 2015. St John Ambulance chief executive Sue Killen says: ‘Too many people die in situations where first aid could have given them a chance to live. Everyday Heroes gives us a chance to recognise the people who step in when others don’t, or can’t, act. ‘Not only do they have the first aid knowledge but they have shown the courage to help someone who needs them.’ Kirsty remembers the awful moment she discovered her father’s life was hanging in the balance. ‘My mum was in Spain at the time, so I was the first to get the call,’ she explains. ‘It was about 11pm on a Thursday, and I’d just sat down to watch the US Open when my agent rang with the news that Dad was in intensive care. It was just the most horrendous moment.’ Kirsty, Laura and Jamie booked flights to Aberdeen, where their father was in hospital, and arrived there early the next morning. ‘I’d called my mum straight away, and she’d spoken to the consultants. They’d told us all the usual things – that they were doing everything they could, that he was in the best place he could be – but nothing stops you thinking the worst. When I saw him there, my strong, fit dad, covered in tubes and surrounded by machines – nothing can prepare you for that. We thought we were going to lose him.’ It was particularly shocking for the Gallachers, who take pride in their healthy lifestyles. Kirsty says: ‘Dad swam every day and eats really well – he was never overweight, really. My mum is a dietician so makes sure of that. In fact, before the attack he was probably fitter than he’d ever been in his life. We were all brought up to respect our health and bodies.’ She is quick to point out the difference between a cardiac arrest and a heart attack: the latter is usually the result of blockages in the blood vessels around the heart, often the result of poor diet and lifestyle leading to fatty deposits inside them. The lack of blood leads to part of the heart muscle dying, sometimes causing extreme pain – hence the attack. A cardiac arrest, however, is when the heart simply stops beating. ‘It can happen to anyone,’ Kirsty adds. Fabrice Muamba retired from football on medical advice, following a cardiac arrest he suffered during an FA Cup tie in March 2012 . Footballer Fabrice Muamba survived a cardiac arrest during a match in 2012 thanks to a similar combination of CPR and AED shocks. If defibrillation is delivered promptly – within two to three minutes of collapse – survival rates as high as 75 per cent have been reported. It was this that undoubtedly saved Bernard, who, after a week intensive care, started to pull through. Kirsty says: ‘They took him out of the induced coma that they put him in to stop his organs from shutting down, and that was the sink-or-swim moment. My sister and I went back to the hotel where we were staying nearby, but we didn’t sleep a wink. ‘At about 5am, Mum called to tell us Dad was responding. After all the pain, it was the first glimmer of hope we’d had. I believe if he hadn’t been in such good health beforehand, he’d not have fought back like he did.’ Bernard was allowed home after a fortnight in hospital, and his recovery has been relatively rapid. ‘He was told he’d never play golf or swim again, but he’s doing all those things now and he seems fine,’ says Kirsty. The golf star has, like Muamba, been fitted with an implantable defibrillator – a tiny device that delivers a lifesaving electric shock to the heart if it stops again. And in Bernard’s case it has done – twice. ‘The first time it happened, he only told us in passing that he’d fallen off his chair a few days before. Of course we were furious,’ reveals Kirsty. ‘But thankfully he was OK. The second time, last November, I was at their house talking to Mum when we heard this almighty crash. We rushed in to find him on the floor, grey and ashen but conscious. ‘The ambulance came straight away and he recovered well. They adjusted his medication, and there haven’t been any incidents since.’ Kirsty, recently separated from her rugby star husband Paul Sampson, with whom she has sons Oscar, seven, and four-year-old Jude, has since joined her parents in campaigning for the £1,000 defibrillators to be installed at all golf clubs. According to a recent St John Ambulance survey, an astonishing nine in ten people don’t know what an AED is. And of those who do, almost two-thirds don’t feel they would know how to use one should they witness someone having a cardiac arrest. ‘These new digital machines are foolproof,’ says Kirsty. ‘You open the box and a recorded voice tells you exactly what to do. You can’t do anyone any harm with one either, as they read and analyse the heart’s electrical system and will only give a shock if the heart has stopped. It’s so important people know that. ‘The last thing you want to do is realise, in hindsight, that you could have helped, but didn’t.’ It's time to nominate your hero . Do you know someone who has saved a life by using first aid? St John Ambulance’s annual Everyday Heroes awards recognise the inspirational individuals who do just that – and nominations are now open. There are nine categories, recognising both individuals and organisations who support training, and the winners will be honoured at a ceremony at the Lancaster London hotel on July 1 next year, hosted by Kirsty Gallacher. The shortlist for the Guy Evans Young Hero Award will be featured in these pages and Mail on Sunday readers can vote for the winner. Sue Killen, chief executive at St John Ambulance, says: ‘We’re on the lookout for ordinary people who have done extraordinary things by putting first aid into practice when it matters most, or by helping more people learn this vital skill. Everyone has the ability to save a life and we want to celebrate those who are doing just that. ‘Thanks to the first aid knowledge and heroic actions of some incredible individuals, people are alive today who otherwise wouldn’t be. We believe these achievements should be recognised.’ Make your nomination at sja.org.uk/everydayheroes.

"Celebrity memoirs are no longer popular as the genre has already 'peaked', according to one of Britain's leading publishers. Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, has slashed the number of books written by the rich and famous that his company buys up. He claims their profits are now 'hit and miss' - and says even those expected to do well, written by some of the country's biggest names, are failing to match expectations. Undersold: Memoirs written by Stephen Fry and John Cleese both sold 60,000 copies - far less than what was expected from two of Britain's most popular comedic actors . Mr Redmayne, older half-brother of actor Eddie Redmayne, told the Evening Standard: 'We're moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff. HITS . Lynda Bellingham: There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You . Sales: 265,000 . Roy Keane: The Second Half . Sales: 149,000 . Guy Martin: My Autobiography . Sales: 168,000 . FLOPS .

'A lot of books were bought last year for large amounts of money which just didn't do the numbers at all. He declined to identify which stars he had in mind. Certain celebrities have enjoyed huge success - with Alex Ferguson's tell-all book notching up nearly 700,000 sales so far this year. Other hits have been Roy Keane's The Second Half, selling 149,000 copies, and Lynda Bellingham: There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You, selling 265,000 copies. But for every successful book there are many more flops and Mr Redmayne says he feels it's now time to pull back. The publishing chief - who took charge of Rupert Murdoch's HarperCollins last year - was speaking as annual accounts revealed the company's revenues dropped nearly six per cent to £180 million in the year to June. He claimed part of the reason for the fall in revenue was his 'strategic decision' to avoid 'unprofitable' non-fiction publishing - and he pointed out that operating profits actually jumped 80 per cent to £5 million. He said: 'I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to back-list well. Speaking to The Times, he added: 'We want a broad swathe of publishing, but historically, HarperCollins, and indeed a lot of other publishers, had been making some very, very big bets on big celebrity autobiographies. 'That celebrity non-fiction market, in my opinion, has peaked. It's still there, there's still a market for it, but it is coming down. 'I think the prices - the advance that we pay the authors - needs to reflect that.' Last year Pippa Middleton was dropped by Penguin after her party planning book Celebrate sold only 2,000 copies in the first week. Huge hit: Roy Keane's tell-all book The Second Half was one the year's success stories, selling 149,000 copies since its October release . Flops: Both Hillary Clinton's and Kelly Brook's autobiographies flopped in sales - with the model's Close Up selling just 8,000 copies . The Duchess of Cambridge's sister was said to have received a staggering £400,000 fee for the book in advance. The Bookseller Magazine recently reported that sales of biographies and autobiographies had slumped four per cent in 2014. Patrick Neale, the owner of Jaffe and Neale's bookshop in Oxfordshire, told the magazine: 'I have always asked when the bubble is going to burst on celebrity titles and to date I have been proved wrong, but actually this might be the year it has finally happened. 'Sales of Stephen Fry and Michael Palin books have been low, which is surprising.' A novel by the online video blogger Zoe Sugg, known as Zoella, has been the biggest success of the Christmas period - despite critics commenting on her use of a ghost writer. Her book Girl Online sold more than 78,000 copies in its first week - more than JK Rowling, Dan Brown or EL James achieved with their first books.

"Waiting times in A&E departments have hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours. Relatives described corridors resembling ‘military field hospitals’ with patients lining up on chairs or trolleys because there were no beds available. Senior doctors in some hospitals say the situation is as bad as they have ever known and fear it will intensify over the winter. NHS figures show that last week was the worst since records began in November 2010 – with 44,883 patients spending more than four hours in A&E before it was decided whether they should be admitted. It is the second week running that waiting times hit record levels. Waiting times in A&E departments have hit record levels for the second week running with tens of thousands of patients left for up to 19 hours. Above, file image . A further 10,136 patients whom doctors decided should be taken on to wards had to wait on trolleys for at least four hours because there were no beds. This is the highest figure on record and more than double the number for the same week last year, which was just under 4,000. The Government’s target is that 95 per cent of A&E patients should be either discharged or admitted within four hours. Last week only 89.8 per cent was achieved. In one case, an 82-year-old with motor neurone disease was left for 19 hours on a trolley in a corridor at Hull Royal Infirmary, East Yorkshire. The family of John Mant complained to hospital managers, who promised to investigate. At Tameside A&E unit, Tony Price, a senior IT expert at Hewlett Packard, described ‘chaos’ on Wednesday night and said corridors resembled a ‘military field hospital.’ Writing on Twitter, he said his partner Mandy had been waiting 17-and-a-half hours with other patients on chairs or trolleys in a corridor. The crisis is partly due to hospitals being unable to discharge elderly patients as there are so few places in care homes. This leads to a bed shortage in wards, which means patients cannot be moved out of A&E. On top of this, rising numbers of patients are turning up at hospitals because they cannot get an appointment with their GP. Andy Burnham,  Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘This was the worst week in A&E in many years' Andy Burnham, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘This was the worst week in A&E in many years. ‘All over England, emergency services are stretched to the limit. Seriously ill people are waiting hours for ambulances to arrive or on trolleys in hospital corridors. This is before the winter has begun in earnest.’ Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association’s council, which represents doctors, said: ‘Staff are working flat out but the system is really struggling to cope with the sheer number of patients coming through the door. ‘Growing pressure on services throughout the year means hospitals have no spare capacity to deal with the winter spike in demand. ‘So patients are enduring delays in their treatment, and the NHS finds itself running just to stand still.’ Dr Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Our health service is running at full capacity and the strain on the system is immense. ‘The fear is that as the festive period gets underway, A&Es are set to get even busier and performance could deteriorate further.’ Earlier this week, a senior A&E consultant at Cambridge University Hospitals said the pressures were the worst he had known. Dr Adrian Boyle told ITV News there is ‘absolutely a winter crisis’, adding that the NHS is ‘going to have a very, very tough winter’. Last month the Government announced it was injecting an extra £700million into the NHS to help stave off a winter crisis. The money is intended to pay for extra staff and beds but senior doctors say it is merely a ‘sticking plaster’ and too little, too late. Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: ‘Pressures on our A&E services continue to increase significantly. We have admitted more people to hospital this week to take care of them than in any previous week on record. I want to pay tribute to the staff dealing with that – they are doing a brilliant job.’","Relatives described A&E corridors resembling 'military field hospitals'

"A British woman who suffered nine miscarriages and a stillbirth has received the backing of 50 celebrities to release a film about her tragic experience. A-listers ranging from Hollywood actors Al Pacino and Jennifer Aniston to singer  Ed Sheeran and and TV personality Simon Cowell have all shown their support for scriptwriter Rebecca Rian's movie Jacob And I. The stars have taken to social networks to post pictures of themselves  holding up a placard reading #JacobAndI in a bid to help raise the £1.3million needed to fund the project. Scroll down for video . A-list support: Scriptwriter and director Rebecca Rian has received backing from famous faces including Jennifer Aniston (pictured) to help raise the £1.3million needed to fund her feature-length film Jacob And I . Rebecca told the Sunday People: 'I think they respect that I'm turning something sad into a positive, which is why they are willing to get behind it. 'Everyone knows someone who has been affected by stillbirths or miscarriages. Even A-listers.' Rebecca and her husband Daniel's ordeal began in 2008 when she first fell pregnant, but at six months they discovered their son Jacob had died in the womb when she went into premature labour. Hollywood heavyweights: The British woman's campaign has gone international, with American stars like Al Pacino showing their support . Homegrown talent: Ed Sheeran has also been pictured holding up a placard to promote Jacob And I . Jumping on the bandwagon: Stars like Jessie J have helped Rebecca's Twitter followers soar . Within a five year period, the couple also suffered the heartbreak of nine miscarriages, including twins. In 2011, Rebecca finally welcomed a healthy baby girl called Ayva, but they will never forget their son. 'These stars have helped give Jacob a voice and a legacy', she added. Moving: Rebecca says  stillbirths and miscarriages have touched the lives of so many - and Gary Barlow has first-hand experience since his daughter Poppy was tragically stillborn in 2012 . Rita Ora shows her support: Rebecca and her husband Daniel's struggle began in 2008 when they discovered their son Jacob had died in the womb and the filmmaker went into premature labour . Simon Cowell gets behind the cause: Rebecca then suffered nine miscarriages over a five year period . Celebrities backing the campaign also include Jessie J, Emma Thompson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Nicole Scherzinger and Billie Piper. Jacob And I, which is currently in production and is being filmed in both London and Los Angeles, follows the emotional journey of two parents who are on a journey to be reunited with their son. In a promotional video for the movie on fundraising website KickStarter, Mrs Rian says: 'Who is Jacob? Jacob is what the world and medical profession classify as a stillbirth. To me, Jacob was a son. Doing something positive: Iggy Azelea has also backed the campaign, which aims to raise £1.3million via a Kickstarter page . 30 Days to go: Stars like David Walliams are urging people to donate so the film, which is being shot in both London and Los Angeles, can reach completion . Giving Jacob a voice: The couple now have three-year-old daughter Ayva, but their son Jacob will always have a place in their heart . 'The point of Jacob And I is to recreate life, it was to give Jacob a leading role, to give him a voice, to let him tell his story. 'As a writer it's very important to me to make sure that every aspect is believable, and it's real and you are able to understand what the character's life and thoughts are about. This is his story.' Mrs Rian hopes to raise the £1.3million to fund the film, which will be produced by Tracey Hicks and Jason Swain and released in 2015, through donations.

"Nigel Farage has been accused of 'abusing his power' to try to help Kerry Smith (pictured) become MP for Basildon South in Essex . Nigel Farage was embroiled in a damaging new row last night over the Ukip candidate forced to resign because of racist and obscene remarks. The Ukip leader was accused by senior party figures of ‘abusing his power’ to try to help Kerry Smith become MP for Basildon South in Essex. The Mail on Sunday can also disclose a leaked email shows Mr Farage urged Ukip chiefs to ignore protests about Mr Smith’s ‘rough and ready’ style and ‘unsubstantiated rumours’ about him. The news came as it was revealed that: . The dispute has fuelled fears among Ukip supporters that a series of controversies threatens to wreck its hopes of success in May’s General Election. Mr Smith was forced to resign as a candidate last week after The Mail on Sunday revealed he mocked gays as ‘pooftahs’ and referred to a woman as a ‘chinky bird’ in bombshell phone calls. But to the dismay of several prominent Ukip supporters, Mr Farage continued to defend him, claiming Mr Smith ‘talks and speaks’ like lots of Britons. A leaked email shows the lengths Mr Farage was prepared to go to help him be selected for the seat. When Ukip members in Basildon met 11 days ago to pick a candidate, Mr Smith was not on the list, having been banned weeks earlier. But hours before they met, Mr Farage emailed Ukip’s national executive urging them to give him another chance. He wrote: ‘As leader of Ukip I have never involved myself in candidate selections. But in the case of Basildon South, I have received many objections to the removal of Kerry Smith from the local branch. The reason for his exclusion is he is a bit rough and ready, and there were several rumours which have not been substantiated. ‘We have been too cautious so I recommend we reverse our earlier decision.’ Scroll down for video . A leaked email shows Mr Farage urged Ukip chiefs to ignore protests about Mr Smith’s ‘rough and ready’ style and ‘unsubstantiated rumours’ about him . Mr Farage’s call was immediately backed by his party’s National Executive Committee and the same day Mr Smith was selected. Mr Farage’s intervention came as Mr Hamilton, now a Ukip supporter, was stopped from competing for the Basildon seat. He was forced to pull out after a Ukip letter concerning claims he abused his expenses was leaked. It prompted claims that Mr Farage’s main aim was to block Hamilton, seen by some as a higher profile vote loser. A senior Ukip source said: ‘Nigel has shown a lack of judgment over Kerry Smith. In the eyes of some he abused his power in trying to get him a Parliamentary seat. We can’t understand why he appears so keen to speak up for Smith. It looks as though he was so desperate to stop Hamilton, whom he dislikes and sees as a rival, he lost all sense of proportion.’ Ukip leaders also revealed a tape of Mr Smith’s remarks was sent to them months ago. A party insider said: ‘Farage’s team knew about Smith’s disgraceful remarks. That is why he was fired in the first place. They thought the tape recording would never see the light of day so they put him back on the list. Others thought the public should know the truth.’","Ukip leader Nigel Farage is embroiled in a new row over Kerry Smith .

"An autopsy report of a California mayor shot dead by his wife reveals that she had suffered years of abuse. Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say Lyvette Crespo shot her husband Daniel - who was the mayor of Bell Gardens - several times in October after he got into a physical altercation with their 19-year-old son. Now, an autopsy report reveals that Lyvette's daughter Crystal told investigators that Daniel had been '“verbally and physically abusive to her mother over 20 years.' Scroll down for video . Shooting: Sheriff's officials say Lyvette Crespo (second from right) shot husband Daniel Crespo (far left), several times in October after he got into a physical altercation with their 19-year-old son (far right) What happened? Mayor Daniel Crespo, pictured with daughter Chrystal, allegedly told his brother William there was another woman . Crystal also stated that the abuse had become worse over the past two years. 'The decedent and his wife were not sleeping in the same bedroom, and he was known to drag her by the hair to force her to do so,' said the report, according to the Los Angeles Times. The coroner's investigator's notes also stated, 'The decedent had threatened to kill her and the children if she attempted to report the abuse.' It was also noted that Daniel's mistress had begun making calls to the home. Claudia Osuna, a lawyer for the Crespos' adult son and daughter, said her clients were standing by their mother. She stated that the son also was a victim of domestic violence. A biography on the Bell Gardens website said the Crespos were high school sweethearts who married as teenagers in 1986.

Bell Gardens City Council members serve part-time and rotate the mayor's position among themselves. Crespo, first elected to the council in 2001, was a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer.","The wife who shot dead her mayor husband suffered years of abuse according to his autopsy report .

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Barclays Premier League starting XI of the day. Saturday saw Manchester City keep up the pressure on league leaders Chelsea without a striker and also saw West Ham continue their fine start to the campaign thanks to fine performances by England's Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll. However the star of the day was Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin who scored a remarkable hat-trick to beat West Brom from 2-0 down. So, here is our team of the day. GK - Adrian (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5 . Patrick Collins at Upton Park . The Spanish keeper enabled West Ham to dominate the match and build from the back. The 27-year-old denied David Nugent and Leonardo Ulloa late on to maintain the clean sheet. West Ham keeper Adrian makes another save to frustrate Leicester at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon . DEF - Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton vs Everton) - 8 . Sam Cunningham at St Mary's . The right-back continues to earn the plaudits with a man of the match performance as Ronald Koeman's side cruised past Everton. The England international was a constant threat on the right. Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne, up against Leighton Baines, was superb again on Saturday . DEF - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa vs Manchester United) - 7 . Laurie Whitwell at Villa Park . Imperious at heart of Villa’s defence for the most part, physically dominating his Dutch colleague Robin Van Persie. Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar (right) managed to contain his Dutch colleague Robin van Persie at Villa Park . DEF - Michael Carrick (Aston Villa vs Manchester United) - 7 . Laurie Whitwell at Villa Park . Classy in central defence, moved to midfield at half-time to provide a platform for United attacks . Michael Carrick (right) started the game in defence but was moved back into midfield at half-time . DEF - Aaron Cresswell (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5 . Patrick Collins at Upton Park . 25-year-old summer signing from Ipswich ran over six miles during a determined performance for the Hammers and looks to have made the step up to the Premier League with consummate ease. West Ham left back Aaron Cresswell was effective for the Hammers during the 2-0 win over Leicester . MID - Erik Lamela (Tottenham vs Burnley) - 8 . Matt Lawton at White Hart Lane . The Argentine fired in a spectacular 25-yard curling left-foot shot that was hit on the move and with more than enough pace to elude Tom Heaton to hand Spurs the three points with one of his finest games in a Tottenham shirt. Argentina international Lamela (centre) celebrates scoring the winner for Tottenham with a fine strike . MID - Alex Song (West Ham vs Leicester) - 7.5 . Patrick Collins at Upton Park . Song offered his own thoughtful, considered approach. He gives West Ham a dimension beyond the purely physical and contributed richly. West Ham midfielder Alex Song (second left) drives forward as Leicester forward Leonardo Ulloa watches on . MID - Stewart Downing (West Ham vs Leicester) - 8 . Patrick Collins at Upton Park . Much like Song, Downing was highly effective for West Ham and is clearly relishing his free role in the Hammers attack. Scored a fine second-half goal to secure the win. Downing salutes the Upton Park faithful after his 55th minute strike put West Ham firmly in control . MID - David Silva (Manchester City vs Crystal Palace) - 8 . Adam Crafton at the Etihad Stadium .

David Silva celebrates his second goal of the day as Manchester City cruised out to a 2-0 lead . FWD - Andy Carroll (West Ham vs Leicester) - 8.5 . Patrick Collins at Upton Park . The striker fired in his third goal in three games and continues to make his mark since returning from a series of injury setbacks. His hold up play and threat in the air is providing West Ham with a fine alternative in attack. Hammers striker Andy Carroll races away to celebrate after he opens the scoring at Upton Park . FWD - Charlie Austin (Queens Park Rangers vs West Brom) - 9.5 . Jack Gaughan at Loftus Road . A penalty, a poacher’s finish and an instinctive header hauled three points from what appeared a point of no return – QPR’s first Premier League hat-trick since Bradley Allen in November 1993, and what a time to get it .

"Arsenal visit Liverpool on Sunday afternoon with both sides desperate for the win to reignite their Premier League campaigns and push back towards the Champions League places. Arsene Wenger’s side return to Anfield to the scene of last season’s humiliating 5-1 drubbing at the hands of a Raheem Sterling inspired Liverpool. The 20 year-old has already become an integral member of Liverpool and England’s side, featuring 58 times so far for club and country in 2014 whereas Arsenal have a new talisman lighting up the league in Chile international Alexis Sanchez, but who has the edge ahead of the Anfield battle? Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez has already scored nine goals in the Premier League this season . Raheem Sterling scores Liverpool's opening goal against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday . It’s evident both rapid forwards have become the key man in their respective sides with Sanchez adding fresh impetus to Arsenal’s attack since his £30million summer move from Barcelona. In 15 Premier League appearances so far for the Gunners Sanchez has impressed with his dogged work rate but has also found the back of the net nine times. Compare this to Sterling, who hasn’t scored a league goal since September, and Sanchez’s attacking efficiency becomes even more prevalent with a 32 per cent goals-to-shot ratio for the Gunners with Sterling well off on 13 per cent. Here's is the Premier League table before the fixtures on Sunday, with Arsenal five points clear of Liverpool . Sanchez (centre) celebrates with teammates after scoring in Arsenal's 1-0 win over Southampton . Despite an indifferent start to the season, Wenger’s side have only lost one of their last six matches in all competitions and this coincides with Sanchez’s recent flourishing form. The 26-year-old has scored seven and assisted four of Arsenal's last 17 league goals at 65 per cent involvement, which underlines his importance as the spearhead of the Gunners attack. Sterling scored twice in the 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal in this fixture last season and with the departure of Luis Suarez, persistent injuries for Daniel Sturridge and lack of form from summer purchases, the 20-year-old has become the focal point of Brendan Rodgers’ front line. The Chile international has lit up the Premier League with a series of fine performances for the Gunners . Sterling scored a double as Liverpool humiliated Arsenal 5-1 in this Anfield fixture last season . The youngster has recently been deployed by Rodgers down the middle and scored a brace in the midweek Capital One Cup win over Bournemouth, ending a 17 game goal drought for Liverpool. He obviously needs to get back amongst the goals but his impact on the team is undeniable. His pass completion is at eighty per cent and at seventy five in the final third. He’s linking up well with his team-mates and acting as the linchpin going forward. Sanchez has become renowned for his endeavour and work rate, which Wenger has praised for motivating his team-mates into similar action. Sanchez has become an integral part of Arsenal's attack since signing from Barcelona this summer . However Sterling has also adapted his game to lead the line, winning 86 per cent of tackles and a statistic well ahead of Sanchez’s 72 per cent rate. Providing pace, an outlet and goals mixed with a brutal work rate, you can see similarities between Sanchez and Sterling. They can adapt in a central or wide role and clearly drive their side on, with both creating 40 chances for their team in the league this season including four assists for Sterling and five for Sanchez. Sterling, missing a golden chance at Manchester United, hasn't scored a league goal since September . As both Liverpool and Arsenal have had their defensive frailties exposed this season, the pace from Sterling and Sanchez is a true asset. Their ability to start fresh counter attacks with one in two success rate in dribble completion highlights both their attacking potency. There is a down side to their impact with the pair in danger of burnout as we approach the turn of the year but if they continue to lead their team with such aplomb then it’s hard to see either manager resting their star man too much other the busy festive fixture list. A win at Anfield on Sunday afternoon will gain more plaudits but which talisman will prevail is difficult to predict. All that is certain is Sanchez and Sterling can provide a fascinating head-to-head in the crucial clash.","Alexis Sanchez will go head-to-head with Raheem Sterling at Anfield .

"Sam Allardyce has revealed that his West Ham strikers are enjoying working with retired frontman Teddy Sheringham. The Hammers boss, who employed Sheringham as a coach during the summer, believes the former England international is handing down invaluable insight to Andy Carroll and Co. Allardyce told Sky Sports Goals on Sunday: 'He (Sheringham) is in for a couple of days a week and the lads enjoy what he does. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Sam Allardyce believes Teddy Sheringham has been having a positive effect on the West Ham strikers . The former West Ham striker was employed by Allardyce during the summer . 'I like Teddy to talk about the finer things a striker needs to do. We can all do things like shooting practice, but passing his experience on in terms of when you’re in the box is what's important. 'If he talks to them about that. How are you striking the ball, timing or runs - all that sort of stuff. The one on one stuff is more important for him to give to them.

"A leading bishop who has resigned in shame over an affair said last night that he was ‘relieved’ the secret was out. Kieran Conry, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, confessed on Saturday to being an ‘unfaithful’ priest. He also stands accused of a second affair with a married parishioner 20 years his junior, who spent at least three nights at his home. Last night, Catholic Church leaders were accused of a cover-up, with a lawyer saying they have ‘known for years that the bishop has been having affairs’. The lawyer is representing the husband of a 43-year-old parishioner to whom the bishop had become close, and claimed he was considering a possible High Court action against church chiefs. Scroll down for video . No secret: Bishop Kieran Conry with his female friend, whose face has been obscured for legal reasons . Bishop Conry, 63, said he felt ‘liberated’ knowing he no longer has to bear the burden of his guilt alone. ‘It has been difficult keeping the secret,’ he told the Mail. ‘In some respects I feel very calm. It is liberating. It is a relief. I have been very careful not to make sexual morality a priority [in his sermons]. I don’t think it got in the way of my job, I don’t think people would say I have been a bad bishop. But I can’t defend myself. I did wrong. Full stop.’ Bishop Conry – a leading religious figure close to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Church in England and Wales – became a bishop in 2001. He is sworn to celibacy and has for years preached about the Church’s ‘moral authority’ and the importance of the sanctity of family life. On Saturday, however, he resigned, admitting he had been ‘unfaithful to his promises’ in ‘a relationship of six years ago’. He has also been seen in public more recently with a married mother of two, who was one of his parishioners. In a handwritten love letter dated earlier this month, he wrote to the 43-year-old woman: ‘It’s all right to say that [your husband] did bad things, but you knew that he didn’t love you. ‘You know (I hope) that I did. And I did, and do.’ The letter was signed: ‘your K xxxxxx.’ They are said to have been close for more than a year and reportedly exchanged hundreds of text messages. The married parishioner was seen spending at least three nights at the bishop’s home and they visited the British Museum, a Matisse exhibition and the ballet together. They were also photographed walking together one Saturday carrying groceries. Bishop Conry and the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly became close after the woman and her husband started to take part in church activities last summer. Transubstantiation: Bishop Conry gives mass. He confessed his misbehaviour in a statement yesterday . The bishop denied that they had a sexual relationship, although he admitted she had stayed at his house in Pease Pottage, West Sussex. In a statement read out at Masses yesterday, he said: ‘I am sorry to confess that, going back some years, I have been unfaithful to my promises as a Catholic priest. ‘I would like to reassure you that my actions were not illegal and did not involve minors. As a result, however, I have decided to offer my resignation.’ Yesterday, he denied to the Mail that Church leaders had known about his affair. However, the mother of two’s furious husband has claimed they did know but took no action. The husband’s lawyer Clare Kirby said: ‘My client is considering pursuing a possible High Court action against the Catholic Church because they have known for years the bishop has been having affairs. If they had taken action, he almost certainly would not have lost his marriage.’ Last night, a spokesman for the Catholic Church declined to respond to allegations of a cover-up about the bishop’s love life.","Kieran Conry, Catholic Bishop of Brighton, confessed to being 'unfaithful'

"Arsenal's Wellington Silva, a 21-year-old Brazilian who joined them almost five years ago but is yet to play a game because of work permit issues, is among players facing bans from football if allegations of match-fixing in Spain are proved in court. Silva, a winger, joined from Fluminese for around £3.5m in January 2010, and played in the reserves that summer but did not get a ‘special talent visa’ as anticipated. He has been out on loan at a succession of Spanish clubs ever since and is currently at Almeria. He was on loan at Levante in May 2011 when he played for them in a 2-1 end-of-season defeat to Real Zaragoza - a match now at the centre of major match-fix case. Arsenal's Wellington Silva, on loan at Almeria, is among players facing a ban for match-fixing in Spain . A criminal complaint was filed by Spanish prosecutors last week, naming 41 people who may now face court hearings, probably in February. Manchester United’s Ander Herrera, who played for Zaragoza in the match, and Swansea’s Jefferson Montero, who was playing alongside Silva for Levante that day, are also among the 41 names and could face trial. Silva is among those already interviewed by prosecutors. All the players deny any wrongdoing. By winning the match, Zaragoza avoided relegation. It is alleged in court papers filed last week that the club’s financial director Francisco Javier Porquera paid €965,000 (£757,000) to 11 squad members at his club, including Herrera, and that the players withdrew money from their bank accounts in cash and gave it back to him. It is alleged that money in turn ended up with the Levante players. Court documents show Herrera received two payments, of €50,000 (£39,000) and €40,000 (£31,000), from the €965,000. Some Zaragoza players have admitted getting the money but dispute its purpose. Herrera said in a statement last week: ‘I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results … I love football and I believe in fair play, both on and off the pitch.’ Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is among the 41 names and could face trial . Theoretical punishments for anyone found guilty of fixing range from prison sentences of up to four years, to large fines and bans from playing. Experts in Spanish law believe even ‘guilty’ verdicts would not end in custodial sentences for anyone without any previous criminal convictions. But lengthy bans would be a real possibility. Wellington Silva will become eligible for a British work permit next summer and is expected to return to Arsenal for the 2015-16 season. Only the case clouds his future. An Arsenal spokesman told MailSport: ‘We have no further information on this and no comment to make.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Arsenal's Wellington Silva is among players facing a ban following allegations of match-fixing .

"First there was uproar over news that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos. Now, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the hides of culled ponies are being crafted into ‘wild pony’ pagan drums – used in Druid-style retreats and musical performances to capture the rhythms of ‘life and the moon’. Dartmoor ponies are a distinctive, hardy breed, essential to the maintenance of unique moorland landscapes and the rare insects they support. Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, said the culling scheme was 'a bitter pill to swallow' But they have been in trouble for years. While they continue to reproduce, the prices they fetch at market have slumped – four ponies recently sold for £1 – and farmers can no longer afford to keep them. Now, the autumn ‘drifts’ where the ponies are herded down from the hills to market have resulted in culls, with hundreds of unwanted animals – mainly the very young and the old – being slaughtered. Where once 30,000 ponies roamed the moors, there are now believed to be fewer than 1,000 breeding mares. Conservationists argue it would be more effective to reduce the number of stallions to stifle reproduction, rather than to  slaughter so many animals. But the controversial zoo programme, set up by Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, claims that selling the meat is a way to raise funds to conserve future herds. Now, in addition to the zoo programme, the hides of culled ponies are being used to create hand-crafted drums. The drums are made by Carolyn Hillyer, a musician and Dartmoor resident, who runs alternative workshops and has been making traditional artisan hand-drums for 15 years, using locally sourced deer skin, and horse hides from America. One of her CDs is titled: ‘Drum Songs From The Heathen Hills’. Last year, after speaking with Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, who has been battling to save the ponies for more than 16 years, she suggested she could use the hides of the culled ponies to make drums. ‘They are the first wild pony drums to be made in this country for a very long time,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘And we see it as part of a wider regeneration project for the whole region. ‘It’s a sensitive project and it’s taken a year to get to this stage, as I have been working with other people in the community. But the ethos behind it is that nothing is wasted. As far as we know, this is the first time this has been done in this country.’ Controversial drum-maker Carolyn Hillyer runs alternative workshops and has been making artisan hand- drums for 15 years . Charlotte Faulkner said the culling scheme at first ‘seemed like swallowing a bitter pill’. ‘We had reached the desperate situation where there was nowhere for these unwanted ponies to go. It was breaking my heart,’ she said. ‘It was difficult. First using the ponies for zoo meat, then using their hides. We don’t want to be shooting ponies and feeding them to lions. But the ponies face such a dire situation. And with this, we are protecting the herds, and the moors. And nothing is being wasted. Carolyn has made three of the pony drums so far and has given me one. It has the most amazing deep fur hide, is a sort of a stone colour, and has a very resonant sound. ‘I see the drums as a symbol of the ponies’ voices … calling you to listen to their cry for support to help them continue looking after Dartmoor.’ Journalist Sybil Ruscoe visited Dartmoor and followed the journey of the ponies from their slaughter, with bolt guns, to the zoo feeding, and the drum making process, for BBC Radio 4’s On The Farm. She describes the resulting 25-minute programme as ‘a hard listen’ – a far cry from the 1930s, when there were said to be 30,000 ponies on the moors. But the demand for the ponies at market has been falling – particularly since the recession. The animal welfare lobby has argued the problem could be remedied by removing stallions. But local conservationists say stallions are essential for holding a herd together. ‘What we are doing sits within the conservation of our heritage,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘We want to encourage people to support the care of these ponies and the drums are a way of doing this.’ But a spokesman for PETA, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, said culling was ‘a cruel and ineffective way to manage pony numbers when chemical sterilisers are available’. He added: ‘That the slaughtered carcasses of these much loved animals are being turned into musical instruments or slabs of meat for depressed tigers in Devon’s zoos is the final indignity.’","Hides of culled ponies being crafted into 'wild pony' drums used in retreats that 'capture the rhythm of life'

"Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group when it comes to straight red cards but sometimes he sees ones which just are not there. When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who had made the foul. Both players were fully committed and the Aston Villa player's momentum meant he caught the Manchester United man with his right leg as he followed through. Mason would not have been influenced by the United players who surrounded him, he had already decided and gone for his top pocket where he keeps his red card. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal. Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor was sent off for this tackle on Manchester United's Ashley Young . There was an interesting incident at White Hart Lane from which Tottenham got their first goal. The home side were rightly awarded a free-kick for handball which Harry Kane took immediately. His pass went towards Christian Eriksen, who was clearly in an offside position, but he ignored the ball. Nacer Chadli ran on to it and crossed for Kane to score. The assistant did very well to hold his flag and was absolutely correct to do so. However, replays highlighted that the ball was moving when Kane took the free-kick. Mike Jones should have seen from this from his position and ordered the free-kick to be retaken. Harry Kane nods in Tottenham's opener against Burnley but there was controversy in the build-up . Another excellent offside decision came from Dave Bryan at Manchester City when Frazier Campbell looked well offside before his overhead kick went just wide. Replays showed how good a decision this was but his form was certainly not matched by Peter Kirkup at the other end. Trailing 2-0, Crystal Palace should have got back into the game when James McArthur headed home a Yannick Bolasie cross. However, Kirkup flagged for offside when Fernandinho, who was right in front of him, had clearly played McArthur onside. Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur (right) had this header against Man City wrongly ruled out . There was some lovely justice seen at St Mary's when Jon Moss missed Phil Jagielka clearly kick Shane Long when he was in the air. Moss must have thought that Jagielka had kicked the ball so wrongly awarded a corner from which Southampton got their opening goal. Southampton didn't get a penalty for this kick on Shane Long by Phil Jagielka but scored from the corner . Craig Pawson was right to award QPR a penalty when James Morrison pulled back Leroy Fer at a corner, but the home side should have had another when Joey Barton was sent sprawling in the area when caught by Morrison's trailing leg.","Aston Villa's Gabriel Agbonlahor was shown a red card by Lee Mason .

"Too much pressure has been placed on the shoulders of Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard, according to former Liverpool left-back John Arne Riise. There has been talk in recent weeks of a big-money move for the Stromsgodset attacking midfielder, who has been on a tour of Europe's top clubs over the last month. Odeegard has trained at Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Arsenal among others, while more top clubs have also registered interest in the 16-year-old. Martin Odegaard's name has been mentioned in the same sentence as many of Europe's top clubs . The Stromsgodset midfielder has trained with Liverpool, Arsenal and Bayern Munich among others . Age: 15 (D.O.B. 17/12/98) Born: Drammen, Norway . Position: Attacking midfielder . Club: Stromsgodset (2014-) Appearances: 24 . Goals: 5 . International appearances: 3 . International goals: 0 . And Riise, himself a former Norwegian international, admits that he feels for Odegaard after the pressure that has been put on him. 'I feel a bit sorry for the boy,' Riise told Dagbladet. 'With anticipation the pressure rises. There is talk of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal. It makes people expect a lot. 'But he does seem to have his feet firmly on the ground and it seems like he has a great family around him. Even so, it will be tough for him now. People are wary of him and people will look out for him.' Odegaard turned 16 last week, and can only now sign his first professional contract. If he does decide to leave his homeland, Stromsgodset will be due a compensation package. Odegaard was the youngest player to feature in a Euro qualifier after making his Norway debut vs Bulgaria . The promising attacking midfielder has made 25 appearances for the Norwegian side since making his debut in April and has scored five goals. He already has three full caps for Norway having made his international bow in August. Odegaard has been guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and is now the assistant manager at Mjondalen.","Martin Odegaard is a 16-year-old attacking midfielder at Stromsgodset .

"Coco, a reddish-brown pit bull with white markings, went missing from her Southern California home on Thanksgiving. Nearly a month later, she was found and reunited with her owners — but she was a different color. Riverside County animal services officials made the match when they scanned a stray, black dog for an implanted microchip and found she was listed as an 8-month-old reddish-brown pit bull adopted in October from a San Jacinto shelter. Before and after: Coco used to be a reddish-brown pit bull (left) but was dyed black after it was stolen. Officials say the deception was to keep its owners from getting the pooch back . 'She actually recognized me when I went in there to verify it was her,' owner Heather Lowery told NBC Los Angeles. 'She shakes her whole body as if she were Pluto basically, and she did it again today. She jumped right on (me) and took pictures with me.' Officials believe Coco was stolen and dyed in an act of deception to make it harder for Lowry to find her, said Riverside County Field and Shelter Deputy Director Frank Corvino. Officials believe the dog escaped from the thief's property. 'The dye job is not very good,' Corvino said. 'But it would work if someone's looking for their missing, reddish-brown dog.' Coco's human, Heather Lowery, said the pit bull immediately recognized her, although Lowery was surprised to discover her new color . Animal Services spokesman John Welsh said Coco shouldn't suffer any long-term consequences from the dye. Lowry said she was shocked when she learned what had happened to Coco. 'I didn't think someone would go as far as to dying a dog's fur to keep them,' she said.","Coco disappeared from her Southern California home on Thanksgiving .

"From bitterns and badgers in Suffolk to bald eagles and bears in Canada – what a contrast! I’d just finished this year’s BBC Springwatch series at the RSPB’s Minsmere reserve in Suffolk so it was time for a family holiday, and there was a trip I’d been looking forward to for a long time. Over the years I’ve been very spoiled, travelling all over the world filming wildlife, and there are certain places I put on my bucket list to go back to with my family – partner Nick and our son Ollie. Knight Inlet in British Columbia was one of them. Grizzly bears gorge themselves on salmon in the water on Vancouver Island . Michaela Strachan with her partner Nick and son Ollie at Knight Inlet . It’s a special place, a floating lodge in the middle of the wilderness, accessible only by boat or float plane and one of the best places in British Columbia to see grizzly bears. Floating lodge Knight Inlet, Vancouver Island, is accessible only by boat or floating plane . I’d filmed there a couple of times, about ten years ago. The first time was for a show called Animal Planet. We went in August during the salmon run and filmed the grizzlies fishing and gorging in the river. It was an amazing sight. The second time was for a series called Michaela’s Wild Challenge when I was given two tasks – to see a grizzly baby and to get a ‘kiss’ from a hummingbird. Knight Inlet is a stopping point for Rufous hummingbirds on migration and after a lot of patience, sitting next to a hummingbird feeder with red lipstick and sugar on my lips, I did actually complete that particular challenge. Staying at Knight Inlet involves a three to five-day package, and with British Columbia such a long way to go – especially when you live in Cape Town, as we do – I left it to the Canada experts, Discover the World, to create a two-week trip around my ‘bucket-list’ destination. We started off in Vancouver, which is a fabulous city. It’s easy to see why it’s considered one of the top five places in the world to live. Surrounded by beaches, ocean, mountains and greenery, it reminded us of Cape Town. We stayed in English Bay, near the beach and right beside Vancouver’s famous Stanley Park. It’s a stunning place, with nearly 1,000 acres of west coast rainforest, a smattering of manicured lawns, beautiful gardens, sports fields, an outdoor pool and a six-mile sea wall. It’s a green playground in the heart of the city and incredibly well organised – to avoid accidents the sea wall has a one-way path for cyclists and another for runners. Amazingly, everybody sticks to the rules! The Lost Lagoon in Vancouver's stunning  Stanley Park, almost 1,000 acres of green space and facilities . In all we spent five days in Vancouver, two at the start of our trip and three at the end. We did a sightseeing tour the first day that took us to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as well as Stanley Park, Gastown, Granville Island Market and a few other ‘must-see’ spots. It was very touristy but gave us a quick overview of the city. We particularly loved the suspension bridge, which is 450ft long, 230ft high and wonderfully wobbly! We went on a boat ride in Howe Sound, a trip up Grouse Mountain – where we saw a very funny lumberjack show – hired bikes for a day and enjoyed a lovely harbour dinner cruise. Vancouver is an uncomplicated place to get around. People are incredibly friendly, and although cities are not really my thing, we really enjoyed it. Apart from seeing grizzly bears, I wanted to show the family orcas, and Vancouver Island – across a sea strait from the city of Vancouver – is a great place to see them. There are two top spots, Victoria, the main city on Vancouver Island, and Telegraph Cove, a more quirky town, full of character and history, tucked away on the east coast of the island. The sea wall path is a one-way road for runners and cyclists ... and everyone abides by the rules . Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood, Gastown, is packed with restaurants, bars and tourists . I had already been to Telegraph Cove filming, so this time we went to Victoria. We went on two ‘whale-watching’ trips (orcas – despite their other name, killer whales – are actually classed as dolphins) and were amazed at the number of orcas we saw. These were residents, and can be regularly spotted between June and September. There are three resident pods around Victoria with about 80 orcas in each. Wildlife presenter Strachan also visited the city Vancouver on the mainland and felt right at home with the hippy vibe of Tofino in British Columbia . Our next stop was Tofino and Ucluelet on the west coast. Our hotel at Ucluelet, the Black Rock Oceanfront Resort, was a stunning place right on the ocean. Tofino is a chilled little town with lots of organic cafes, surfers, trees and beaches, and from here you can go on whale-watching boats and bear-watching trips. We went kayaking and black bear-watching and both trips were brilliant. Tofino is the sort of place you could chill in for weeks, and if you get a pair of colourful baggy trousers, a few dreadlocks and drink lots of kale smoothies, you’d fit in perfectly. (I felt very comfortable with the hippy vibe, as I’ve never grown out of tie die since it was in fashion in the 1970s!) The next part of our trip was undoubtedly the highlight – our four-day package to Knight Inlet. To get there we had to go by float plane, and it was hugely exciting getting on board. The trip made a memorable start to our adventure. The flight is a stunning half hour over the Great Bear Rainforest, the largest piece of intact temperate forest left in the world. Red cedar, western hemlock and sitka spruce, some of them 1,000 years old, reach high into the sky. Of course logging is a continuous threat, and we saw plenty of it as we flew over, but these days, it’s more controlled than it used to be, and much more sustainable. Orcas, or killer whales even if they're not actually whales (they're predatory dolphins) frolic off Van Island . Michaela flew a stunning half-hour in a float plane over the Great Bear Rainforest to Knight Inlet . As we arrived into Glendale Cove we could see the floating lodge that would be home for the next three nights. Knight Inlet used to be a fishing lodge but was bought in 1996 by the Wyatt family and is now run as a grizzly bear-watching paradise. The area has one of the largest concentrations of grizzly bears in British Columbia, with 30 to 40 bears. The population changes regularly depending on the number of new cubs the bears produce. During spring and summer, the bears feed on the cove’s abundance of sedge grasses, berries and shellfish in the inter-tidal zone, and they are easy to spot. Come August, the salmon run starts and the bears gorge on the abundance of rich protein, fattening themselves up ready for their winter hibernation. When you arrive at Knight Inlet they tell you it’s ‘Bear Boot Camp’ – and they’re not kidding. The three days are packed with activities you can choose from, and the days go ridiculously quickly. A good sign for bear watching that highlights the risk to visitors from the grizzlies . We went on several estuary tours to watch bears and bald eagles, an inlet cruise to the waterfalls, which included getting soaked by going through the spray of one (a highlight for Ollie), a walk through the forest to ‘above the clouds’, a kayak trip and a whole-day marine tour to spot orcas, seals, sea lions and humpback whales – and we saw plenty of them. Knight Inlet is a remote, dramatic and wild place, with towering snow-capped granite cliffs, waterfalls, glaciers and an abundance of wildlife. I can’t fault it: the food, rooms, organisation, staff and activities, were all brilliant and I couldn’t help but fall in love with the place. You can feel the stress lifting off your shoulders as the fresh air and beautiful wilderness works its healing powers and you reconnect with nature. It’s a place that pulls you back. So now Knight Inlet is off the Bucket List, where next? Antarctica, the Amazon, polar bears in the Arctic, Baja California to see the blue whales, Kenya during the migration, diving on the Barrier Reef… the list goes on and hopefully I will slowly tick them off!

"Her slender new figure is the envy of many after she lost four stone on a strict diet. But the Duchess of York may have been trying a little too hard to show it off yesterday – when she donned this daring ‘sexy Santa’ costume for a party. Sarah Ferguson, 55, was spotted showing off her slim-line legs in the racy outfit as she celebrated Christmas with friends and family. Scroll down for video . Slender: The duchess, 55, was seen chatting with male guests at the pub in Surrey while wearing a Santa outfit . As well as a fur-trimmed mini-dress and matching hat, she also sported a pair of high-heeled knee-high brown suede boots. The duchess was at the Fox and Hounds in Englefield Green, Surrey, with ex-husband Prince Andrew, 54, and daughter Princess Beatrice, 26. Beatrice dressed as a giant Christmas pudding, complete with white icing and holly decoration. Meanwhile, her mother chatted to locals and enjoyed the attention of two young men wearing novelty hats. Best-dressed: Princess Beatrice also got into the festive spirit as she turned up in a Christmas pudding outfit . Slimline: The duchess recently lost more three stone after spending time at a boot camp in Swiss ski resort Verbier while also undertaking a strict new diet . She and Andrew, who sat at a table with friends in the pub's restaurant, relaxed as they enjoyed the live show. A source at the party told the Sunday Mirror: ‘No one was expecting royalty to drop in but it was just an incredible night. ‘Fergie looked fantastic and it was obvious she has a new-found confidence. The duchess recently underwent a strict dieting regime and boot camp in Swiss resort Verbier. The former WeightWatchers spokeswoman has told of her decision to shed the pounds ‘before the age of 55’ after her weight ballooned to 16 stone.

The source added: ‘Andrew and Fergie were singing along to the entertainment and they were dancing to the music. It was a real royal shindig.’ The couple divorced in 1996 but have remained close. The Prince recently revealed that he remained friends with his former wife 'more for family than anything else'. The royal spoke about the couple's split and continued friendship in a candid interview with US satellite TV channel CNBC.","Duchess enjoyed festive night out at a pub in Surrey with Prince Andrew .

"President Barack Obama . said in a TV interview set for broadcast on Sunday that he will . do 'everything I can' to close the U.S. military prison at . Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after four Afghan detainees held there . were sent home. Obama promised to shut the internationally condemned prison . when he took office nearly six years ago, saying it was damaging . America's image around the world. But he has been unable to do . so, partly because of obstacles posed by the U.S. Congress. President Obama on Sunday said he is going to keep trying to shut down the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, even as he's failed to do so six years after taking office and making the same promise . 'I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it,' Obama . said on CNN's 'State of the Union with Candy Crowley' in an interview taped on Friday. 'It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and . extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being . held,' he said. 'It is contrary to our values and it is wildly expensive. We're spending millions for each individual there. And we have . drawn down the population there significantly,' he added. In the latest step in the gradual push to close the prison, . four Afghans held for over a decade at Guantanamo have been sent . home, the Pentagon said on Saturday. This file photo shows Al-Qaeda and Taliban detainees captured in Afghanistan after the 2001 terror attacks at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay . The men were flown to Kabul overnight aboard a U.S. military plane and released to Afghan authorities, the first such transfer of its kind to the war-torn country since 2009, according to a U.S. official. With a recent trickle of releases, including the transfer of six prisoners to Uruguay earlier this month, Guantanamo's detainee population has been gradually whittled down to 132. The repatriation of the four Afghans, identified as 'low-level detainees' who were cleared for transfer long ago and are not considered security risks in their homeland, had been in the pipeline for months. But in a measure of what one senior U.S. official described as an improving relationship with the new Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, Washington went ahead with the transfer after he formally requested it. Senate Intelligence Chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, speaks to reporters about her committee's explosive report showing the CIA interrogation of Al-Qaeda suspects was far more brutal than acknowledged and did not produce useful intelligence . Guantanamo was opened by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, to house terrorism suspects rounded up overseas, with Afghans originally the largest group. Most of the detainees have been held for a decade or more without being charged or tried. Thirteen other prisoners of various nationalities have been transferred from Guantanamo since early November, and several more could be repatriated or sent to countries other than their homelands by year-end, U.S. officials said. While at Guantanamo, terrorists Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (left) underwent 'rectal rehydration' along with Abu Zubaydah (right) during CIA interrogations . Part of the U.S. Senate's controversial and redacted report include the gruesome details on the rectal torture of one detainee . Just two weeks ago, the U.S. Senate said in a bombshell new report that torture of Al-Qaeda suspects — most instances at Guantanamo — was far more brutal than acknowledged and failed to produce useful intelligence. Among the findings: a CIA operative used 'Russian Roulette' to intimidate a prisoner and another — untrained in interrogation techniques —  threatened to use a power drill. Detainees were humiliated through the painful use of medically unnecessary 'rectal feeding' and 'rectal rehydration.' One died of hypothermia while shackled, while some suffered broken limbs. U.S. Army Military Police walk through a cell block during morning prayer at Guantanamo's Camp V in 2013 . The report said the Central Intelligence Agency also misled the White House and Congress with inaccurate claims about the program's usefulness in thwarting attacks, the Senate Intelligence Committee said in its graphic report that revived the debate over interrogation techniques such as waterboarding. President Obama said then that torture had been counterproductive and contrary to American values. CIA director John Brennan defended his agency's adoption of tough tactics under president George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda attacks on US cities. He insisted that, while mistakes were made, brutal techniques 'did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives.' In the latest step in the gradual push to close Guantanamo (pictured), four Afghans held for over a decade at Guantanamo have been sent home, Pentagon officials said Saturday . Obama still faces major obstacles in trying to shut down the prison, among the biggest being the Yemeni detainees who make up more than half the remaining inmate population. Most have been cleared for transfer but are unable to return home because of the chaotic security situation in the Arabian Peninsula state. Two weeks ago a U.S. Senate report delivered a scathing indictment of the harsh Bush-era interrogation program used on terrorism suspects. Obama banned the techniques when he took office in 2009.

"Seven girls aged between 13 and 14 have fallen pregnant after going on a school trip in Bosnia. Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision when the girls, from the town of Banja Luka, returned from a five-day trip to the capital city. The school had taken 28 girls on the educational outing to Sarajevo to visit museums and other historical sitess, but since returning the girls have now reportedly dropped out of lessons. Scroll down for video . The 28 schoolgirls were on a trip to the capital of Bosnia, Sarajevo (pictured), when seven returned pregnant . The case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia, where the number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 has increased significantly. Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo said that a growing trend for underage pregnancies in Bosnia is worrying. 'That is the trend of today. But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,' he added. He added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education. 'It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences. 'We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.' Parents of the girls, who are from the town of Banja Luka (pictured), are demanding to know why the teachers were not providing better supervision on the trip . Young girls in Bosnia are seeking advice from experts online, the InSerba News Network has reported. One schoolgirl wrote: 'I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged.' Last year in Sarajevo 31 underage girls became pregnant but seven out of 28 girls in one five day period has set something of a record. The National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, Nenad Babici, admitted more children in his country are engaging in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14. But he didn't blame the teachers for the school trip pregnancy boom - he said it was down to 'parental neglect'.","The girls had been on a five-day trip to Bosnia's capital city of Sarajevo .

Sweets, tea boxes, plates and other representations of temptation adorn the walls.

'The theme was immediately clear to me: seven floors, seven deadly sins. 'I had a carte blanche but with technical constraints, of course. It was not too difficult to work especially on Lust and Gluttony, with Miserliness and Pride, for example, were a real challenge because these universes are far from mine.

"Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the godmother of a lesbian couple's baby girl in a Roman Catholic ceremony on Saturday - though the Church opposes gay marriage. Baby Umma Azul is just over 2 months old and was baptized as mothers Carina Villarroel and Soledad Ortiz, who were married last year, looked on. She's the first child known to receive this church blessing in Argentina. The ceremony took place in the Cathedral of Cordoba and was officiated by Father Carlos Varas, Reuters reports. The city is located 435 miles from the capital. Scroll down for video .

'Father Varas told us he had been waiting for a couple like us, a gay one, and we happened to come and he accepted us,' Villaroel told the news agency. 'There's really been a social change for Catholicism to have said yes to baptizing a child from a lesbian family.' Fernandez de Kirchner won a political . battle against Pope Francis in 2010 when he was Argentina’s top . church leader and the country became the first in Latin America to . legalize gay marriage.

But . gays were celebrating the move anyway on Friday, saying it suggests a . new opening for the global church now led by their Argentine pope. The Vatican considers marriage only to exist between a man and a woman, Reuters notes, and says only children born from wedlock may be baptized by the Church.

"Bournemouth's Elland Road hoodoo continued as 10-man Leeds dented their promotion hopes through Luke Murphy's spectacular strike. But Eddie Howe's Championship leaders had only themselves to blame after substitute Yann Kermorgant wasted an opportunity for a 86th-minute equaliser after blasting his penalty against the crossbar.

Bournemouth were awarded the spot-kick after referee Oliver Langford dismissed Giuseppe Bellusci for hauling down Callum Wilson as he raced into the penalty area. Moments earlier Marc Pugh had also struck the woodwork as the visitors made it seven defeats in as many visits to this ground. During an even opening period, Leeds midfielder Murphy thrashed in from 20 yards and Bournemouth, who began the night top of the Championship with a three-point buffer to those outside the automatic promotion places, could not muster an equaliser. Bournemouth had not previously lost on their travels since September at Derby, a sequence of eight wins and a draw preceding a trip to one of their least favourite grounds. Despite carving out some glorious chances against their relegation-threatened hosts, however, they failed to continue that rich run of form. Wilson's pace offered a constant threat on the break – three times he got beyond the home backline but failed to apply a finishing touch – while his strike partner Brett Pitman had the ball in the net shortly after Leeds went ahead only for an offside flag to cancel his opportunistic effort out. 'I had a gut feeling at the time that it was a tough call for us. There seemed to be a defender between Brett and the goal and if that was the case I will be bitterly disappointed,' Howe added. Equally contentious was the late penalty and Leeds manager Neil Redfearn – whose relegation-threatened team held on for a surprise league double – said: 'It seems to be a standing order for us – a bad refereeing decision. It's about three yards outside the box.' Leeds United goalkeeper Marco Silvestri (right) saves the headed effort of Bournemouth's Callum Wilson .

In front of their lowest home Championship crowd of the season, Redfearn's team went ahead in the 36th minute when Sam Byram and Rodolph Austin combined on the right flank to feed Murphy, who followed his late equaliser against Birmingham at the weekend, by arrowing a left-footed drive beyond the despairing grasp of Artur Boruc and into the top corner. Leeds, winless in eight matches and reeling from the news that owner Massimo Cellino must resign from the board on Wednesday and not have any influence on club affairs until April 10 after he lost his Football League appeal, shrugged off their troubles and rode their luck to complete a surprise double over the division's top team. 'I spoke to Massimo yesterday and he basically said that nothing changes. It's still his football club. Someone else will sign the cheques but it's business as usual,' Redfearn said.

Flowers are placed on a police car near the scene of the shooting of Officer Charles Kondek in Tarpon Springs . The shooting did not appear to have any connection to the ambush killings of two New York police officers a day earlier. Authorities said Kondek responded to a noise call around 2 a.m. at an apartment complex in Tarpon Springs, about 30 miles northwest of Tampa. Parilla was pounding on doors, looking for a neighbor who 'dimed him out' to police, authorities said. When Parilla saw Kondek, he fired multiple rounds at the officer, striking him once above his bullet-proof vest. Kondek later died of his injuries at a local hospital, the police department said. 'We know we have the right guy in custody,' Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. 'This guy knew what he was doing, he killed a cop and he needs to be held accountable for that.'

He also got to see real life elves hard at work making toys in Santa’s workshop and met giant-sized teddy bears preparing to load presents into his sleigh for delivery on Christmas Eve. The highlight of his festive treat, however, was when he summoned up the courage to toddle through a magical forest and go into Father Christmas’s house so he could meet the great man himself. George had the chance to chat to Father Christmas while William and Kate stood beside him and was given a gift-wrapped wooden train as a present – an ideal present for the youngster who loves his ‘choo choos’. Surprise visit: Members of the public couldn’t believe their eyes as the royal party turned up at Santa’s Magical Journey at Thursford (pictured above) Staff were only told that they were getting an unofficial Royal visit shortly before their arrival with other members of the Middleton family. William and Kate, who is pregnant with her second child, were given a standard timed slot on arrival and queued patiently with other parents. General manager, Geraldine Rye, said: ‘George seemed to have a lovely time. When I saw him, he was walking around. ‘It was a private visit and they were not given any special treatment. We only knew shortly beforehand that they were coming. ‘They went around the winding path in our exhibition centre and would have seen animated animals like polar bears, penguins and reindeers as well as elves and snowmen. Short notice: Staff were only told that they were getting an unofficial Royal visit shortly before their arrival with other members of the Middleton family . ‘It is a fantasy land and the animated elves tell stories which you can listen to as you go round. It is all very traditional and is designed for families with young children. ‘They would also have seen Santa’s workshop before going to Father Christmas’s house. There were lots of different things for them to see and they were treated just like everyone else. ‘The visit including going into Santa’s house usually takes at least 45 minutes, but they seemed to be here a long time. They didn’t miss anything and they had a good time. ‘Lots of people recognised them, but they didn’t get any hassle and nobody tried to take any pictures of them.” Miss Rye added: ‘Father Christmas speaks to the children who stand in front of him with their parents. The only other person in the room is an elf who sorts out the presents. ‘What he says to them and their parents is private. Only Father Christmas and his elf know what has been said. ‘The children are given different gifts according to their age and George would have got a wooden train just like other boys who are his age.’ Royal invitation: Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa . Sources have told the Mail that William, Kate and George – as well as the rest of the Middleton family – arrived in Norfolk on Thursday for what has been described as a ‘perfect family Christmas’. Keen to show off their new ten-bedroom mansion, Anmer Hall, situated on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, William and Kate are hosting an extravagant festive celebration for Michael, Carole, James and Pippa. The house, which boasts its own swimming pool and tennis court, was a wedding gift from the Queen and has recently undergone a multi-million pound refit. It is just a short drive from her private country residence, Sandringham House, where the rest of the Royal Family are congregating for their annual holiday. Now that Kate’s family has joined the extended gathering for the first time, the question remains: will they be invited to join the Queen at church on Christmas Day or one of the daily hunting parties enjoyed by the royals over the festive season, including the coveted Boxing Day pheasant shoot? ‘The Duchess has long been keen to host big family Christmas in her new home, the kind of Christmas she enjoyed as a girl, and most of the Middletons duly arrived on Thursday afternoon,’ the source revealed. Previous family day out: The Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George as he and Prince William look on while visiting the Sensational Butterflies exhibition at the Natural History Museum in July . ‘It’s not clear yet whether the Duchess’s family have been invited to join the Queen, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see them walking to Church on Christmas Day and even join everyone for lunch before returning to Anmer in the evening. ‘It will be quite a turn up for books if they do, but the Queen doesn’t do anything by the book when it comes to William’s new family.’ Aides say that the Duke and Duchess will joined the Queen for church on Christmas morning without their toddler son.","The 17-month-old future king visited Santa’s Magical Journey in Norfolk .

"Rolf Vogt's place in Calle, Germany, is known simply as the 'Christmas House', such is its place in the hearts of locals and the hundreds of visitors it attracts. Vogt puts up more than 400,000 lights – he's lost count – as part of his family's annual festive celebration covering his house, garden, trees and fences with the colours of Christmas. He couldn't have predicted that what began with two travel bags full of lights from a Wal-Mart in the US on the trip that first inspired him would become an obsession for not just him but those who make the annual pilgrimage to see his handiwork. Rolf Vogt's place in Calle, Germany, is lit up by more than 400,000 lights for Christmas . Vogt was inspired by a trip to the US when he was impressed by the residential festive displays . 'The idea comes from the year 1999,' Vogt says. 'We were in America in December with our son and spent a whole night going round - about eight hours - and looked at the houses. There was one more beautiful than the others, and from that came the idea to go straight to Wal-Mart. We packed two travel bags full of lights and came back.' Despite beginning with far fewer lights, visitors started seeking out the 'Christmas house' from its very inception, even though Vogt said the family had originally only put up the display for their own pleasure. 'One evening my youngest came down and said, ""Daddy, go out, there are ten cars at the door"". I go out and wonder what's going on here. ""Hello, oh, it looks so good,"" and so on and so forth, and then they keep saying, ""Is there bratwurst and mulled wine here?"" I say: ""Goodness, yes"". We had only made it for ourselves the first time round. But the idea was already there to make it 5000 lights for the second year.' Each year his design gets bigger and he sells mulled wine and bratwurst to help meet the costs . Distributing the wine and sausages goes some way towards funding the lights for Vogt and family, who pay thousands of euros to keep the place aglow. Between the illuminated Santas, stars and snowflakes, Vogt says he has lost count of the actual number of lights. '[A]round 450,000, maybe a few more, a few less. So I don't know exactly, because I've only got the giant mountain [of lights], you can't count them any more,' he said. Santa's sleigh and reindeer shine bright atop Vogt's house which he starts decorating in July . But for the family, Vogt added, the display is not just a Christmas project but occupies them year-round. 'I start at the end of July, cutting down all the shrubs and the lilacs and I gradually begin to display the first things. And then it always takes time for me to find the beginning, how I imagine it now, because people want to see it different every year, and when I have the beginning, then it continues bit by bit, then the thoughts of how I build it comes together,' he said. Their efforts make the most of the long nights in winter by switching on at 5pm every evening until 9pm, from late November until late December.","Rolf Vogt's house in Calle, Germany, has lit up his house for 15 years .

"A revolutionary piece of furniture lets you lock yourself away from the world outside (or even just get a moment of peace away from the kids). The Orwell Sofa is a cabin-like futon that features a roll-down 'blind' letting you cocoon yourself inside. A pair of young designers from Barcelona created the so-called private urban fort to 'recapture that intimacy which can sometimes be lost, even within our own homes'. When the rolled-up curtains come down they shut out light and sound . The hybrid futon, created by Álvaro Goula and Pablo Figuera, can be utilised in a number of ways from daybed to bunker depending on how its features are adapted. The sofa was referred to as 'a piece of furniture somewhere between a sofa, a bed, and a cabin' as it sat curiously in the design studio, before being christened after the famed writer of 1984. 'Orwell invites you to rest it in its interior and resuscitate that childhood memory of a cabin,' write Goula and Figuera on their website. 'That magical, hidden place that all children wished they had.' The private urban fort 'recaptures intimacy which can sometimes be lost, even within our own homes' When the rolled-up curtains come down they not only shut out the light, hiding you from view, but also insulate against sound, for the ultimate private moment of peace. The high back side and large surface area - similar to that of a bed - allows the sofa to be used either sitting or lying down without feeling cramped. The sleek design lets adults who have long outgrown building forts from sofa cushions to indulge in the activity and create private territory in style.

"Konrad Kramar's new book details the team of Austrian salt miners who bravely defied the Nazis to save much of Europe's cultural heritage . A new book published this week in Austria details how the finest art treasures in the world looted by the Nazis - worth an estimated £5billion at today's prices - were saved from destruction by a team of salt miners. Although credit for their salvation has gone to the 'Monuments Men' of the Allies who took charge of the masterpieces following the collapse of the Third Reich, the real heroes were apparently a group of Austrian workers who refused to obey orders for their destruction. George Clooney's movie 'The Monuments Men' which opens on new year's day only gives a sanitised Hollywood version of what took place in the dying days of the Second World War, one in which the Americans claim the glory for rescuing history's glittering prizes. The new book 'Mission Michelangelo' tells the real story. Written by Viennese journalist Konrad Kramar, it reveals how the miners were aided in their efforts to save the artworks by one of the most feared men in the whole of Nazi Germany. He was Ernst Kaltenbrunner, an Austrian by birth who would be hanged by the Allies at Nuremberg for war crimes. As head of the SD, the security service of the SS, he was second only to Heinrich Himmler in overseeing the Nazi network of terror, repression and murder in all conquered territories. Kaltenbrunner returned to his homeland 11 days before Hitler killed himself in his Berlin bunker on April 30 1945. Before his death the Fuehrer issued his infamous 'Nero Decree' - the order to destroy all infrastructure, power plants, roads, bridges, railways and mines to prevent them from falling into the hands of his enemies. Included in this decree were the the 40,000 square metres of galleries in the Altaussee mine where the most wonderful paintings of history were stored. Once planned to be displayed in the Fuehrer's planned 'Supermuseum' in Linz, he ordered them to be destroyed in an act of colossal spite. Ernst Kaltenbrunner (right), pictured with Wilhelm Keitel at the Nuremberg Nazi war crimes trials. His influence led to the art being saved. He was later hanged . Subject of a new film: George Clooney's movie 'The Monuments Men' follows the heroic exploits of the monuments, fine arts and archives division trying to save works of art at the end of WW2 . Michelangelo's statue 'The Bruges Madonna,' Jan Vermeer's 'Painter in his Studio' and 'The Astronomer,' Jan van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece and works by such masters as Rembrandt and Rubens - 6,557 in all - were stored in the mine that was to be obliterated by huge TNT bombs. Alois Raudaschl, the miner's foreman, was no resistance figure but a paid-up member of the Nazi party. He was horrified when he learned that the local Nazi gauleiter, a violent drunkard called August Eigruber - he would also be hanged for war crimes in 1947 - intended to carry out Hitler's Nero Order and destroy the art treasures. On May 3 1945, just days after Hitler's suicide, Raudaschl met secretly with Kaltenbrunner because he had heard he was sympathetic to saving the artworks. 'He believed Kaltenbrunner could stop the madness of the order to detonate the mine and everything in it,' wrote Kramar. Despite providing the second-largest consignment of volunteers for the unit, the only English character in the film - played by Hugh Bonneville - is entirely fictional . Eigruber had already placed two 500kg bombs inside the mine codenamed 'Dora' by the Nazi high command and was waiting for explosives experts to arrive to arm them before he set them off. Kramar went on; 'It wasn't resistance fighters, an Austrian agent of the British secret service who claimed the credit, nor the Monuments Men or the management of the mine who saved the paintings, but the miners themselves.' Kaltenbrunner, like Albert Speer Hitler's court architect, realised the futility of the Nero Decree and gave his blessing to the miners to thwart it. 'Raudaschl and about a dozen miners went back to the mine the next day and removed the bombs and hid them in surrounding woodland,' said Kramar. Reporting for duty: Bill Murray plays one of the experts employed in the team . The miners blockaded parts of the mine leading to the rarest paintings and statues, all aware that they were committing high treason against the Nazi state even though Hitler was dead.  Had the Nero Decree been enforced at the 11th hour, all would have been guillotined for their actions. Eigruber got wind of Kaltenbrunner's patronage of the miners and sent two men to arrest him. 'But they were frightened off by the SS sentries guarding his door,' said Kramar.  Later that night Eigruber called around to demand the return of the bombs to the mine.The SD chief roared at him: 'As of this moment I am still head of the Security Service of the SS and those mines remain outside.' By dawn the next day the miners had posted guards on the entrance to the mine and allowed no-one into them. Thirteen days later the Monuments Men rolled into Altaussee and took the treasures to Munich. George Stout, the American lieutenant in charge of the Monuments Men, tried to discover who had saved the treasures. He was sickened by the claims of resistors who he called 'vain, creeping toads' because he knew they had done nothing to thwart the destruction plans. 'The real heroes were the miners,' said Kramar.","Austrian journalist's book details how salt miners saved artworks .

"Sony says it will release the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy 'The Interview' mere days after it announced the film would not in theaters for its scheduled Christmas release date. Sony cancelled the film's release last week after the hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it. 'Sony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Boies on today's NBC's Meet the Press. Scroll down for video . Sony says it will in fact publicly release the Seth Rogen-James Franco comedy 'The Interview' despite threats from hackers . 'Sony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Boies on NBC's Meet the Press. President Obama later said Sony had made a mistake in cancelling the movie, and that he would have intervened to make sure it went ahead. The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes. 'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed,' he said, according to The Daily Beast. 'It will be distributed.' The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie pulled it after the threats. That came after a series of embarrassing internal documents were made public, from plans for the upcoming James Bond film, to internal emails arguing over the company's direction, to discussion of past theatrical failures. Pascal has been especially embarrassed by the leaks, recently having emails released revealing that things are so bad between the actor and the studio in fact that Sony head Amy Pascal calls him an 'a**hole* not once, but twice in emails exchanges. The hackers leaked embarrassing emails between Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin joking in a racially insensitive manner about Obama's film tastes . Actress Angelina Jolie was also ripped in some of the email exchanges with Amy Pascal, seen here together at a  Women in Entertainment Breakfast in L.A. She also believed Idris Elba should be cast as the next James Bond. Meanwhile Angelina Jolie was referred to as a 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one exchange discussing the star's passion project remake of Cleopatra. Boies called the hacks 'a state sponsored criminal attack on an American corporation and its employees. Sony has been glad for the FBI's help in investigating the hack, and 'the rest of the government has got to get behind it and has got to figure out a way that we can protect our national security.' As Vox notes, one viable option to get the movie out would be Crackle, the streaming service that Sony already owns. However, Boies was unsure how viewers would finally be able to see the film. Sony cancelled The Interview's slated December 25 release last week after the hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it . 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. 'But it's going to be distributed.' Just this weekend, North Korea threatened more attacks against the U.S. government and other American institutions in the wake of the hack on Sony which cancelled the release of The Interview. Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The government - which was outraged by the film showing the assassination of leader Kim Jong Un - also claimed to have 'clear evidence' that the U.S. government engineered the project as a 'propaganda' attack against North Korea. Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism . In a ranting post published by the state news agency KCNA, Korean authorities hit back in an escalating war of words in which they say they will 'blow up' the White House - while bizarrely continuing to deny they have anything to do with the cyber attacks on Sony. North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from.","'Sony only delayed this,' said company attorney David Boies on NBC's Meet the Press .

"Liverpool were the beneficiaries of a decision that Gary Lineker described as the 'worst penalty decision ever' in their clash at home against Leicester City. The hosts took the lead through a Steven Gerrard penalty in the 17th minute but their visitors were left furious after referee Mike Jones deemed that Wes Morgan handled the ball in the penalty area when it seemed to hit him in the face. An excellent sliding pass from Liverpool forward Coutinho released Raheem Sterling in the 16th minute and as the frontman checked back, Leicester defender Morgan slid in and was adjudged to have handled. Liverpool were the beneficiaries of a decision that Gary Lineker described as the 'worst penalty decision ever' The ball hits Wes Morgan (right) in the face but Mike Jones gave Liverpool a penalty .

That was certainly the view of Leicester legend  Lineker on New Year's Day. The Match of the Day presenter tweeted: 'Worst penalty decision ever as Mike Jones gives handball against Leicester's Morgan at Anfield when it him in the face.' After the official awarded Liverpool another penalty, which Gerrard scored to make it 2-0, Lineker added: 'Mike Jones strikes again! Two ludicrous penalty decisions! Wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on MOTD. 'I reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night.' Leicester players surround the official after Liverpool were given a penalty in the first half . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson believes video technology would have prevented his side conceding two penalties in their 2-2 draw at Liverpool. 'I see what everyone sees, things happen very quickly,' said Pearson after the match . 'It is going to fuel the debate again about use of technology because we (the Leicester dugout) have the benefit of being able to see it in a few seconds and know what has happened and it is unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that in the first half. 'I am not going to go down the route of being ultra-critical because at the end of the day the game could be a lot easier by utilising what is available to us, but we don't.' On Simpson's penalty he added: 'It hit his hand but it is how the rules are interpreted and whether there is a level of consistency. Referee Jones awarded the controversial penalty . Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened. 'You can see from the player's reaction it is unintentional but I fully accept it hits his hand. 'There were other occasions at both ends where you could say if that one is given why aren't the others. 'This is the problem the game has. It exposes human beings to making errors - that is not a criticism of the officials but we could make it much easier for everyone concerned if technology was utilised. 'It takes a couple of seconds. Even when the whistle has gone and players are remonstrating with the officials it could be reviewed instantaneously.

"The Siberian senator said women in Russia could 'live without lipstick' and should try using beetroot as an alternative . A Russian politician has offered some sage advice to women struggling to afford imported beauty products: use beetroot instead of lipstick. Siberian senator Igor Chernishev suggested women who could not afford expensive imported lipstick could opt for the ‘natural look’ or even use beetroot as an alternative to make-up. Mr Chernishev, who represents the city of Tomsk, wrote on a Russian website: ‘Women can live without imported lipstick, men like a natural look. ‘And if they really must use make-up on the lips – there’s no problem, they can use beetroot. It’s natural and chemicals don’t enter the body.’ The senator also claimed that Russian women had no need to buy expensive imported underwear. ‘Our women will look better in lingerie made in Moscow than in France,’ he said. It comes as Barack Obama warned President Vladimir Putin was at the centre of ‘a huge economic contraction’ due to the Ukraine crisis. Speaking to CNN yesterday [SUN] Obama rejected suggestions he had been ‘outmanoeuvred’ by Putin. He said: ‘Right now, he’s presiding over the collapse of his currency, a major financial crisis and a huge economic contraction. ‘That doesn’t sound like somebody who has rolled me or the United States of America.’ The EU and the U.S have imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia, and the financial crisis there has seen the rouble halve in just a few months. The effects of the crisis are being felt not just within the country, but further afield too, with France’s ski resorts reporting a dip in super-rich and middle class Russians visiting tourist destinations. Falling Russian tourism has also been reported in Austria, Germany, Cyprus, as well as in the UK. Russian carrier Aeroflot has suspended its weekly flights from Moscow to Innsbruck reflecting the fall in demand reported by Austrian hoteliers. Scroll down for video . Mr Chernishev's comments come American President Barack Obama warned Vladimir Putin that Russia was at the centre of of 'huge economic contraction' following the conflict with Ukraine . In Germany’s Oberbayern region in Bavaria, the number of Russian visitors fell nearly 4.5 per cent from January to September compared to the same period in 2013, according to Bayerische Rundschau TV. The local statistics office reported a 20 percent decline in September alone versus the same month a year ago. Increasing political tensions and the falling rouble have been cited by tourism chiefs as reasons why Russians might not be travelling so much this season, resulting in less enthusiasm and less financial freedom to visit EU nations. Carole Genevray, marketing director for Comete Conseil, said the main cause of the decline was ‘geopolitical reasons’. She said: ‘We’ve received fewer reservations from Russian clients this year. We can draw parallels with what happened on the coast this summer, where they too were less present.’ Adeline Roux, director of the tourism office in Courchevel, in the French Alps, told France’s i-Tele that the decline in Russian guests could be long-lasting. She said: ‘Depending on the evolution of the crisis that Russia now faces, we run the risk especially of facing an impact next winter (too).’ In Moscow, a man on crutches walks past a shop advertising sales of up to 90 per cent before closing down .

"Abdul Ghafoor, 33, dragged the young woman into bushes and raped her for three hours . An Asian father-of-four dragged a young pub worker off the street and raped her for three hours saying 'you white women are good at it'. The woman, who is in her 20s, was walking home from work in Bedford at around 11pm when she was grabbed by Abdul Ghafoor, 33, and forced her into undergrowth, a court heard. Ghafoor had drunk five rum drinks when he came up behind her and bundled her into the bushes where he began sexually assaulting her in an attack that lasted from 11.25pm until 2.45am. The victim had sent a WhatsApp message to her sister when she left work on May 30 this year to say she was walking to their flat. But the married father-of-four, who had earlier propositioned two other white woman, demanded that the woman perform a sex act on him saying 'you white girls are good at it'. She was able to send a second message to her sister saying 'help me' before he smashed her phone. At one point she managed to make a run for it when Ghafoor vomited as a result of the alcoholic drinks he had downed, but he caught her and took her back into the undergrowth. Her sister had raised the alarm and the victim heard the police helicopter overhead as a major search was launched to find her. Eventually Ghafoor allowed her to get dressed and walked out on to the the road with her saying she should accompany him into town, but they were seen by police inspector, Jamie Longwith. She got into the officer's car while Ghafoor made an attempt to escape but was caught. Prosecutor at Luton Crown Court, Sally Hobson, said Ghafoor's attack had a racial aspect as he had made comments about the sort of behaviour white women would engage in. 'He made racially aggravated comments to the effect that this is the sort of behaviour that white women would engage in. If he saw her again she would give him a blow job,' she said. 'She was a white woman and he believed it was okay to behave in this way. It was a stranger rape of a young woman going about her business in her home town she she ought to feel safe.' Earlier the prosecutor said: 'We all see the news and we know the dangers of walking home. For the woman, a nightmare came true that night.' Ghafoor went up behind the woman on Cardington Road (pictured) and dragged her into undergrowth . Ms Hobson said the victim had been 'like a frightened rabbit in the headlights' when she gave evidence in the witness box.' She has been seeing a specialist counsellor and  is now on medication and suffers from nightmares. But she described her as 'extremely brave young lady who conducted herself with dignity'. The victim listened to the sentencing from another room in the court building via a link. Last month a jury found him guilty by majority verdicts of three offences of assault by penetration, two offences of rape, false imprisonment and assaulting the woman occasioning her actual bodily harm. They found him not guilty of a third offence of rape but guilty by a majority of an alternative offence of attempted rape. Ghafoor, of Nash Road, Bedford, told the jury he had drunk around five rum based drinks during the evening. He claimed she she consented to sexual activity. Asked to explain her Whatsapp message, he said the victim was asking her sister to arrange a birthday party to which he would be invited. Judge Richard Foster said the victim had been subjected to a 'nightmare of unimaginable proportions'. He told Ghafoor he had been on the lookout for a victim that night and subjected the woman to the most appalling sexual abuse for over three hours. 'You forced her to perform oral sex and you said: ""you white girls are good at it."" To some extent the offence was racially aggravated.' He passed a life sentence for public protection saying he regarded Ghafoor as a dangerous offender. If he had not received life he would have sentenced him to 18 years, which means Ghafoor cannot be considered for parole until he has served 9 years. The judge praised the victim for her 'exceptional bravery'. He recommended three officers - Inspector Longwith, the officer in the case DC Jon Wheeler and assistant investigator Derek Winn - for commendations.","Woman in her 20s was walking home from work in Bedford at around 11pm .

"A letter from Sergeant Bernard Brookes says that German troops wore women's clothes to entertain British soldiers during the Christmas Day truce . Cross-dressing German troops put on a pantomime for British soldiers during the First World War Christmas truce, wearing blouses and skirts they had stolen from a French farmhouse. Newly-discovered letters from the trenches reveal that British servicemen were entertained by their German foe, who dressed up in women's clothes and caused 'much merriment'. It has long been known that the enemies set aside their weapons on some parts of the frontline on Christmas Day in 1914 for a game of football, but the letters shed new light on the meeting between the troops. Former police officer Bob Brooke, 58, from Maybole, South Ayrshire, found the detail in letters his grandfather Bernard sent home from France. Bernard, 22 at the time he wrote the letters, was a sergeant with the Queen's Westminster Rifles. He survived the war and died in 1962, aged 69. One letter explains: 'Many of the Germs [sic] had costumes on which had been taken from houses nearby, and one fellow had a blouse, skirt, top hat and umbrella which caused much merriment.' The troops even exchanged addresses and promised to write to each other at the end of the war if they 'came through safely'. The 58-year-old said: 'It was the last thing I expected to find,' he said. 'You can only imagine the men were sick of the death and carnage and were desperate for an escape through entertainment. 'It must have seemed like a pantomime to my granddad and the other British soldiers.' Former police officer Bob Brooke, 58, found the detail in letters his grandfather Bernard sent home from France .

Group of German soldiers with two English soldiers, one in great coat (left) and one in rear wearing a balaclava . The full tale is recounted in a new book by Mr Brookes' aunt Una Barrie, called A Signaller's War, with all profits donated to the British Legion. Soldiers emerged from their trenches along parts of the Western Front and met each other in no man's land on December 25, 1914 . WWI historian Alan Cleaver said he had heard rumours of troops dressing up for each other but the letter was the first concrete evidence of it actually happening. He said: 'I'd heard stories of pantomimes and dressing up on the Western Front but never seen written evidence until now. 'His account is particularly interesting as it confirms men dressing in fancy dress and women's clothing during the truce.' Another letter discovered in Scotland tells the story of a German soldier who defected to the British side during the Christmas truce. A poignant note from Captain John Stansfeld, who was in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders, reveals a 100-year-old love story. His letter says: 'Tonight a German came across and deserted to our side. 'He had been talking to some of Scots Guards on Xmas Day and took advantage of the truce to come right in. 'He is married to an English girl and lives in Devonshire.' Captain Stansfield's great-grandson Edward said: 'We may never know what happened to this young German defector.'","Cross-dressing Germans put on a panto for British troops, letter reveals .

"For the fourth time since he began his month-long, New York City street-art project, enigmatic graffiti artist Banksy's work has been struck by vandals. The latest pieces hit are a stencil on the side of a building in Woodside, Queens, and a car that was part of an installation on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side. The Ludlow Street piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night-vision goggles. Scroll down for video . Vandalizing vandalism: This installation in Manhattan is the fourth Banksy piece to be hit by vandals . Turf: A graffiti artist called 'Problem Child' says this Banksy piece was done on 'his territory' The installation first appeared five days ago, with the vehicle completely in-tact. As of Monday afternoon, the doors and gas cap had been removed from the car. The piece in Queens was damaged about 9 p.m. Monday, just 13 hours after it had gone up. A fellow tagger who calls himself 'Problem Child' is reportedly responsible for defacing Banksy's piece. 'He kept saying about how this was his area. And the guy was pissed,' Kevin Mazeski, who witnessed 'Problem Child' defacing the piece told Gothamist. Omar NYC: Omar NYC is another graffiti artist who isn't thrilled Banksy is in New York this month . Rat: The vandal who tagged this Banksy piece left the message, 'We don't need no more rats!' On Friday, a beaver stenciled on a wall in Brooklyn by the elusive artist also was damaged. The piece, which depicted a beaver leaning up against a railing, was covered with spray paint that read 'we don't need no more rats!' in red capital letters. The beaver's face also had been chipped off. The vandalism was signed 'Math,' likely the name of another graffiti artist. Earlier this month, rival graffiti artist 'Omar NYC' spray-painted over a Banksy piece in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Banksy's work getting vandalized is no surprise; other graffiti artists - often jealous of his notoriety - will deface his work, many in misguided attempt to make a name for themselves. Original: This was Banksy's Ludlow Street installation before it was damaged by vandals . Better Out Than In: Banksy's New York City artists 'residency' is scheduled to last until the end of October . Additionally, his work is very valuable, with some of his pieces fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even small bits of larger projects - like a car door, for example - could be worth thousands of dollars on the Internet. On Sunday, the artist sold original works - many worth thousands of dollars - at a tent next to Central Park. He sold the pieces for $60, as most passersby didn't recognize the art as valuable, or believe they were authentic Banksy pieces. In total, Banksy sold eight paintings on Sunday, for a total of $420. Banksy's month-long, New York City 'residency' - entitled 'Better Out Than In' - is expected to continue until the end of October.","Banksy is in the midst of his New York City graffiti-art project called 'Better Out Than In'

"Died: Ravi Shankar, 92, performs during a concert in Bangalore, India . Ravi Shankar, the Indian sitar player whose sound had a major influence on The Beatles, has died at the age of 92. Besides working closely with George Harrison, he also collaborated with musicians as diverse as violinist Yehudi  Menuhin and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. A statement on his website said he died on Tuesday in San Diego, near his southern California home, with his wife and one of his two daughters by his side. The musician’s foundation issued a statement saying that he had suffered chest and heart problems and had undergone heart-valve replacement surgery last week. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh called Shankar a ‘national treasure’. Labelled ‘the godfather of world music’ by Harrison, Shankar helped millions of classical, jazz and rock lovers discover the centuries-old traditions of Indian music through the sitar, the long-necked stringed instrument that resembles a giant lute. However, the sound was so unusual to Western ears at the time that some fans mistook his tuning up for actual music. Shankar’s close relationship with Harrison, the Beatles’ lead guitarist, shot the Indian musician to  global stardom in the 1960s. Harrison had grown fascinated with the sitar and played the instrument, with a Western tuning, on the song Norwegian Wood. But he soon sought out Shankar, already a musical icon in India, to ask to be taught to play it properly. The pair spent weeks together, starting the lessons at Harrison’s house in England and then moving to a houseboat in Kashmir and later to California. Scroll down to watch video .

Tribute: Indian students light candles to pay tribute to Ravi Shankar . Memory: A student pays tribute to Ravi Shankar in front of a picture of him . Gaining confidence with the complex instrument, Harrison recorded the Indian-inspired song Love You To on the Beatles’ Revolver album, helping spark the ‘raga-rock’ phase of 1960s music and drawing increasing attention to Shankar and his work. Shankar played the 1967 Monterey Pop festival and at Woodstock in 1969 and also pioneered the concept of the rock benefit gig with the 1971 Concert For Bangladesh, where he appeared alongside Harrison and other stars. Moved by the plight of . millions of refugees fleeing into India to escape the war in Bangladesh, . Shankar reached out to Harrison to see what they could do to help. In . what Shankar later described as 'one of the most moving and intense . musical experiences of the century,' the pair organized two benefit . concerts at Madison Square Garden that included Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan . and Ringo Starr. The . concert, which spawned an album and a film, raised millions of dollars . for UNICEF and inspired other rock benefits, including the 1985 Live Aid . concert to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia and the 2010 Hope . For Haiti Now telethon. Soul-star Norah Jones and her father Ravi Shankar were known to have a strained relationship . Ravi Shankar pictured with his daughter Anouskha in London . To later generations, he was known as the father of popular American singer Norah Jones, although the pair were estranged. Shankar also composed a number of film . scores – notably for Satyajit Ray’s celebrated Apu trilogy (1951-55) and Richard Attenborough’s Gandhi in 1982 – and collaborated with . avant-garde US composer Philip Glass in Passages in 1990. His last musical performance was with his other daughter, sitarist Anoushka Shankar Wright, on November 4 in Long Beach, California. His foundation said it was to celebrate his tenth decade of creating music. The multiple Grammy award winner had learned the night before his surgery that he was to receive the lifetime achievement honour at next year’s ceremony. VIDEO: Shankar perfroms in India with his daughter Anoushka in 2009... Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy of America, said: ‘He was deeply touched and so pleased.’ He added: ‘We have lost an  innovative and exceptional talent and a true ambassador of inter- national music.’ As . early as the 1950s, Shankar began collaborating with and teaching some . of the greats of Western music, including violinist Yehudi Menuhin and . jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. He . played well-received shows in concert halls in Europe and the United . States, but faced a constant struggle to bridge the musical gap between . the West and the East. Though the audience for his music hugely expanded after his mainstream success, Shankar, a serious, disciplined traditionalist who had played Carnegie Hall, chafed against the drug use and rebelliousness of the hippie culture. 'I was shocked to see people dressing so flamboyantly. They were all stoned. To me, it was a new world,' Shankar told Rolling Stone of the Monterey festival.

'That was too much for me. In our culture, we have such respect for musical instruments, they are like part of God,' he said. Ravindra Shankar Chowdhury was born April 7, 1920, in the Indian city of Varanasi. At the age of 10, he moved to Paris to join the world famous dance troupe of his brother Uday. Over the next eight years, Shankar traveled with the troupe across Europe, America and Asia, and later credited his early immersion in foreign cultures with making him such an effective ambassador for Indian music. Inspirational: George Harrison and Ravi Shankar  at a press conference in New York, 1971 where they announced a benefit concert for the Bangladesh refugees . During one tour, renowned musician Baba Allaudin Khan joined the troupe, took Shankar under his wing and eventually became his teacher through 7 1/2 years of isolated, rigorous study of the sitar. 'Khan told me you have to leave everything else and do one thing properly,' Shankar told The Associated Press. In the 1950s, Shankar began gaining fame throughout India. He held the influential position of music director for All India Radio in New Delhi and wrote the scores for several popular films. He began writing compositions for orchestras, blending clarinets and other foreign instruments into traditional Indian music. And he became a de facto tutor for Westerners fascinated by India's musical traditions. He gave lessons to Coltrane, who named his son Ravi in Shankar's honor, and became close friends with Menuhin, recording the acclaimed 'West Meets East' album with him. He also collaborated with flutist Jean Pierre Rampal, composer Philip Glass and conductors Andre Previn and Zubin Mehta. 'Any player on any instrument with any ears would be deeply moved by Ravi Shankar. If you love music, it would be impossible not to be,' singer David Crosby, whose band The Byrds was inspired by Shankar's music, said in the book 'The Dawn of Indian Music in the West: Bhairavi.' Ravi Shankar plays his sitar in Los Angeles. Shankar, the sitar virtuoso who became a hippie musical icon of the 1960s after hobnobbing with the Beatles and who introduced traditional Indian ragas to Western audiences over an eight-decade career . Shankar's personal life, however, was more complex. His 1941 marriage to Baba Allaudin Khan's daughter, Annapurna Devi, ended in divorce. Though he had a decades-long relationship with dancer Kamala Shastri that ended in 1981, he had relationships with several other women in the 1970s. In 1979, he fathered Norah Jones with New York concert promoter Sue Jones, and in 1981, Sukanya Rajan, who played the tanpura at his concerts, gave birth to his daughter Anoushka. He grew estranged from Sue Jones in the 80s and didn't see Norah for a decade, though they later re-established contact. He married Rajan in 1989 and trained young Anoushka as his heir on the sitar. In recent years, father and daughter toured the world together. When Jones shot to stardom and won five Grammy awards in 2003, Anoushka Shankar was nominated for a Grammy of her own. Shankar, himself, has won three Grammy awards and was nominated for an Oscar for his musical score for the movie 'Gandhi.' Despite his fame, numerous albums and decades of world tours, Shankar's music remained a riddle to many Western ears. Shankar was amused after he and colleague Ustad Ali Akbar Khan were greeted with admiring applause when they opened the Concert for Bangladesh by twanging their sitar and sarod for a minute and a half. 'If you like our tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more,' he told the confused crowd, and then launched into his set.","Labeled 'the godfather of world music'

"Shocking video taken at a protest in St. Louis shows several demonstrators taunting police just hours after two NYPD officers were killed in an apparent 'retribution' killing following the Michael Brown and Eric Garner grand jury decisions. Bassem Masri has made headlines before for his protest tactics and Saturday he appeared to stay true to form in a video in which he chants at police, 'Pigs in a blanket smell like bacon.' Hours before, Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot and killed NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos after posting he'd soon be 'putting pigs in a blanket.' A group of protesters in St. Louis taunted police officers with the chant 'pigs in a blanket smell like bacon' on Saturday night just hours after a . Man behind the scarf: The man behind the chants appears to be Bassem Masri, who wears a scarf on his face during protests in solidarity with the Palestinian restance . Bassem Masri, pictured, did not go so far as to condone the violence but did blame the police for the fate that befell Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos . Masri has gained a wide internet following for the protests he routinely live streams on the site Ustream. His chants, in which he was joined with several others during part of a Saturday march, immediately won him a barrage of internet attacks. Masri rebuffed them all, tweeting, 'They offended about the ""Pigs in a Blanket"" chant, then applaud #IamDarrenWilson bracelets & constant demonization of every1In their way #Ferguson.' Despite the shocking nature of his chants, Masri--who wears a scarf around his face during protests in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance--maintains in other tweets that he's against any sort of violence. 'I can't speak4why the guy did what he did in NY,' he tweeted. 'For future references we in #Ferguson dont want any 1 2 die at all. keep the moral high ground.' Meanwhile, an eyewitness who spoke to The Daily Beast said that 'a lot of people were clapping and laughing' following the murder of the two police officers. 'Some were saying, ""They deserved it,"" and another was shouting at the cops, ""Serves them right because you mistreat people!”' said the man, identified as Carlos. Civil rights leaders Sunday condemned the ambush killings of two New York police officers and expressed fear that the backlash over the bloodshed could derail the protest movement that has grown out of the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Defended: The families of Michael Brown (left) and Eric Garner (right) have condemned the killings of two police officers after it emerged gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley said his attack was avenging their deaths . In the raw hours following the killing of the officers, police union officials and politicians accused those who have protested the deaths of Garner and Brown of fanning anti-police fervor. Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association in New York, said there was 'blood on the hands' of demonstrators and elected officials who have criticized police tactics. The Garner and Brown families issued statements repudiating the officers' killings, while civil rights leaders took to the airwaves to try to put some distance between the movement and the crime.

"Premier League referee Mike Jones will be the fourth official during West Ham's home game against Swansea on Sunday - a week after wrongly showing Sergio Aguero a yellow card for diving. The 46-year-old, who had already been appointed as referee for Tuesday night's clash between West Brom and the Hammers, has come in for criticism after booking the forward during Manchester City's 3-0 win against Southampton. Aguero appeared to be fouled inside Saints' area by defender Jose Fonte but Jones awarded Ronald Koeman's side a free-kick and cautioned the Argentine for simulation. Jose Fonte makes clear contact with Sergio Aguero as the Argentine falls to the ground inside the box . Mike Jones books Aguero for diving despite the Manchester City striker's pleas of innocence . Aguero is clearly fouled inside the area by Fonte but was booked for a dive inside the opening 10 minutes . There has been no indication from the Premier League that Jones not being given a match to officiate is related to his performance at St Mary's on Sunday. Former Premier League referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll believes Jones' decision to show Aguero a yellow card was one of the worst decisions of the season. He wrote on Sunday: 'Mike Jones, often considered as the weakest member of the select group of referees, made one of the worst decisions of the season when he somehow missed Jose Fonte wipe Sergio Aguero out for a stonewall penalty. 'As if that was not bad enough Jones then rubbed salt in the wound by showing Aguerro a yellow card for diving! However, Manchester City won the match comfortably enough so does it really matter that Jones made such a blatant mistake – after all he is human? Well I think it does. Jones has a heated discussion with Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini on Sunday at St Mary's . Jones also showed a red card to City defender Eliaquim Mangala (second from right) against Southampton . 'Firstly Aguero has a yellow card to his name that, however wrong, cannot be over turned. He could end up being suspended for accumulating cautions. 'Next his booking will be recorded as simulation which will mar the Premier league statistics and be forever against Aguero’s record.' Jones, who will take charge at the Hawthorns just over 48 hours after his controversial display on the south coast, will work underneath referee Chris Foy at in Sunday's lunchtime kick-off at Upton Park.","Mike Jones will be the fourth official for West Ham vs Swansea .

"Pope Francis, already Time Magazine's 'person of the year,' has had a repeat of the honour from an unexpected quarter. The Advocate, America's oldest gay rights magazine, chose the head of the Catholic Church as the 'single most influential person of 2013 on the lives of LGBT people.' That's despite the church's longstanding conflict with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community over its opposition to same-sex marriage and to homosexuality more generally. 'The single most influential person of 2013 on the lives of LGBT people': Pope Francis waves during his inauguration mass at St Peter's square in March. In July he famously said he would not 'judge' homosexuals . 'While 2013 will be remembered for the work of hundreds in advancing marriage equality, it will also be remembered for the example of one man,' wrote the online magazine in announcing its choice. The pontiff famously said this summer he would not 'judge' homosexuals. Those remarks, the Advocate said, 'became a signal to Catholics and the world that the new pope is not like the old pope.' Francis 'has not yet said the Catholic Church supports civil unions' between same-sex couples, but the comments he has made have 'already caused reflection and consternation within his church.' As the leader of the world's 1.2billion Catholics, the editorial noted, 'like it or not, what he says makes a difference.' None of the gay community's disagreements with Catholic clergy - such as over the role of women and contraception - 'should lead us to underestimate any pope's capacity for persuading hearts and minds in opening to LGBT people, and not only in the US, but globally,' the magazine said. Spiritual figurehead: As the leader of the world's 1.2billion Catholics, the editorial in the Advocate announcing the decision to honour Pope Francis noted, 'like it or not, what he says makes a difference' The Pope spoke out on homosexuality during an intimate address to journalists aboard a jet taking him home from his visit to Brazil in July. In remarks at odds with traditional rhetoric, the Pontiff refused to condemn homosexuality, saying: ‘We must  be brothers.’ In the most conciliatory words yet from the Vatican on the subject of gay priests, he added: ‘If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?’ He stressed that the official position of the Church is that homosexual acts are sinful, but homosexual urges and thoughts are not. But the message that gay people should be ‘integrated’ into society rather than marginalised marked a clear departure for the Papacy. In recent years the pronouncements of Francis’s predecessor Pope Benedict had fiercely condemned gay rights and at one point the former Pope described gay relationships as ‘evil’. The U.S. gay rights community has had particular success this year in fighting to legalize same-sex marriage. In June, the Supreme Court struck down the 'Defense of Marriage Act,' which restricted federal marriage benefits to heterosexual couples.","Francis named 'single most influential person on the lives of LGBT people'

"Christmas is always a boom time for the perfume industry — the run-up to the big day accounts for more than half of all perfume sales for the year — but it seems that it’s not all going to be Dior and Chanel sitting under the tree. Last week it was revealed that scents from stars such as Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini are outselling established fragrance brands such as DKNY, Hugo Boss and Gucci by as much as three to one. But are these perfumes actually any good, or are they simply trading in on a name? To find out, we asked fragrance expert, Callum Langston-Bolt, of Les Senteurs, London’s oldest independent perfumery, to blind-sniff some of the best-selling celebrity scents from The Perfume Shop, and give his verdict, before revealing to him exactly who was behind each one. The results may put some noses out of joint . . . CHERYL FERNANDEZ- VERSINI . Storm Flower, £27 for 50ml . THIS smells very soapy and clean because it’s based on the sort of notes often used to fragrance washing powder. Add peach — as you’ve got here — or white florals, and you get something slightly reminiscent of very posh laundry detergent. Musk scents like this are very cheap to make in a laboratory and can make a fragrance long-lasting, but unless they’re mixed well, smell a bit flat. This is not as sugary as some, and really rather nice. Initially I thought that this was Justin Bieber, but I can see how it works for Cheryl playing on her girl next door image. Nice and gentle if you like clean floral scents. 4/5 . VICTORIA BECKHAM . Signature, £14.99 for 75ml . This is exactly what you’d expect from a celebrity fragrance: generic and rather cheap. It’s very fruity, very sugary with some white florals in there. They can be quite sweet and sickly, but this isn’t. The floral notes are very thin. I’d guessed this was Cheryl, because as an international style ambassador you’d expect better of Victoria. 2/5 . JUSTIN BIEBER . Collector’s Edition, £39.50 for 100ml . This has more of the sugar-iness I mentioned. These are the sort of cloying scents you’ll find yourself choking on, when you’re sitting behind someone on the bus who is wearing too much of it. I thought it was Rihanna, but it turns out to be teen icon Justin Bieber. I can see the appeal of the bottle, which comes with a gold record charm. 2/5 . KATY PERRY . Killer Queen, £19.99 for 100ml . Goodness, this is much more interesting than many of the others. There are slightly richer floral notes going on in here. You’re not being hit in the face with sugar, there’s a warmer, more gourmand vanilla note in it as well. I can smell a nice orange blossom, rose and a bit of patchouli. My first guess was Victoria Beckham as I had faith in her doing something a bit different. I wouldn’t have thought it was Katy Perry — and the bottle’s quite interesting, too. 4/5 . ONE DIRECTION . You & I, £19.99 for 100ml . This is very syrupy and fruity. There’s quite a bit of peach in here — it’s a popular scent so many fragrances use it. But I’m also getting that horrible plasticky apple note that you’ll find in DKNY’s Be Delicious. It really hits you in the back of the throat, but if you like that perfume, you might very well like this. There’s a bit of jasmine and tuberose in the heart but it’s basically very summery and very fruity. To me though, it smells like a shampoo. I thought it was Beyoncé’s. And although I’m sure the pentagon-shaped bottle is meant to represent the five members of the band, it’s quite uninspiring. 2/5 . BRITNEY SPEARS . Fantasy, £19.99 for 100ml . This is really generic — it’s like the paint-by-numbers recipe for the sort of sugary white floral that you see at this end of the market. They always start with something fruity, mango or peach, then there’s some white flowers at the heart — jasmine, tuberose, maybe gardenia — and the base is wood or musks. But there’s no real depth to it, it’s just sugar. I suppose finding out it’s Britney isn’t that much of a surprise, and the bottle is one of the ugliest I’ve seen.1/5 . BEYONCÉ . Rise, £19.99 for 100ml . This is actually really nice. It’s quite clean, quite fresh, and has a very classic eau de cologne style to it. At the top it’s very citrussy, the florals are basic but not overly sugary and overall it’s quite refreshing. Initially I guessed Lady Gaga, but then I thought Rihanna — I really wasn’t expecting Beyoncé. And, while it’s pleasant, I wouldn’t say it was the ‘empowering’ scent for women she claims she was aiming for. 4/5 . NICKI MINAJ . Onika, £28.50 for 50ml . Urgh, this smells like those disgusting bright green sour apple sweets you find — or like an apple vodka alcopop. There’s something really childish about it: there’s a bit of blackcurrant or peach coming through, but it’s all fruit and all sweet. It’s like being in a sweet shop — really horrible. I thought it had to be One Direction because it was so pre-pubescent, and there had been absolutely no attempt to make it more sophisticated. You’d have to be a real fan of breakthrough artist of the year Nicki Minaj to want this. 1/5 . LADY GAGA . Eau de Gaga, £31.50 for 50ml . Mmmm, this isn’t bad at all. There’s something of the Nineties about it — it reminds me of the citrussy, clean scents that were very popular then, such as L’Eau D’Issey from Issey Miyake. After the Eighties, when everything had been quite dark and heavy with scents like Christian Dior’s Poison, the Nineties trend was for lighter and zestier scents. And there’s a nice pepperiness to it too. I did guess this was Lady Gaga and I’m impressed by the bottle too: it looks very high end in a Tom Ford or Chanel type way. 5/5 . RIHANNA . Rogue, £19.99 for 75ml . Another of those very fruity fragrances, this is slightly more subdued and less cloying than some of the others. There’s a strong blackcurrant note in it, but in a very Ribena-esque way, and some sort of muted strawberry as well . I thought this had to be Britney as it seemed to be targeting young teenagers and I was taken aback to find out it was Rihanna’s. Her whole persona is about being outrageous so you would expect her to be doing something different. But there’s nothing sexy about this —it’s incredibly unprovocative for someone who courts controversy. 3/5 .

"At his side for interviews and public appearances, Camille Cosby has steadfastly stood by her husband Bill. As dozens of allegations pile up against the comedian - two more women came forward this week claiming they were assaulted - some question how Camille can keep up appearances. Page Six reports that one family friend, Revered Carl Dianda, who married the couple and saw them last at their 50th wedding anniversary last year, believes Bill is innocent of the alleged abuse. Scroll down for video . Loyalty: Camille Cosby, 69, has endured rumors of husband Bill's bad behavior for years, but friends are puzzled by her loyalty as numerous women come forward with claims of drugging and sexual abuse . 'I will help Camille and Bill in any way that they want me to. I’m not going to be embarrassed to say anything. What I know is what I know, and Bill has never done anything to embarrass anyone,' Dianda said. Still, unnamed friends claiming to have been close to the couple in the past spoke of being confused about Camille's silence as more allegations come to light. A sorority sister from Delta Sigma Theta attested to Camille's character, telling Page Six that she was 'by no means weak.' 'But it’s puzzling why she’s put up with it. She’s a self-made woman. She didn’t need Bill Cosby. You can say that Bill Cosby needed Camille Hanks.' Another family friend said he wasn't surprised the clergy would support Cosby, considering the family has played a strong role in the Washington, DC, Catholic Church. 'You’re not going to hear Father or anyone associated with the church publicly speak out and put their names on it no matter how bad this gets,' the friend said. Stand up: Camille and Bill were married by Revered Carl Dianda, who said he believed Cosby was innocent and that his wife would stand by him . Family: Camille and Cosby with daughters Erika Ranee and Erinn Chalene in 1966. Another daughter, Evin, has come forward charging that her father is innocent . 'Almost every year, Bill and Camille come in at some point, whether it’s the anniversary, a concert, a trip to Ben’s Chili Bowl, or just to visit.' 'They get all of us together, and we have a blast. But you can tell that he has a roving eye. He always has, and Camille knows that, too.' But as allegations move beyond infidelity to claims that the comic drugged and assaulted numerous women, friends question how long Cosby's wife can stay quiet by his side. The list of women grew this week, as exotic dancer Chloe Goins, 24, came forward saying she blacked out at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 from a drink Cosby gave her, and came to only to see the comedian sucking her toes and touching himself. Another woman, identified only as Lisa, told Dr Phil she was drugged in 1988 in Cosby's hotel room, waking up days later in her own bed with no recollections of what happened in between. The two alleged victims join almost two dozen women who have already come forward, including model Janice Dickinson and former Playmate PJ Masten. 'I know that in speaking with her — and we’re usually honest with each other — she seems to believe that the women will be exposed eventually so it’s best not to say anything,' Camille's sorority sister said. 'But maybe the eventuality of her husband being exposed has arrived.'","Reverend Carl Dianda, the priest who married the couple, believes 78-year-old Bill Cosby is innocent .

"A Liberal Democrat minister has ordered Government lawyers to oppose the right of Christian workers to wear a cross. On the instructions of Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone, they will call on European human rights judges to dismiss the claims of Christian workers who have been banned from displaying the symbol of their faith at work. The move means that David Cameron’s Coalition is now lined up against the Christian churches on a second battleground – the Prime Minister is already at loggerheads with both Anglican and Roman Catholic churches over same-sex marriage. Lynne Featherstone: Opposes right of Christian workers to wear a cross . It also puts the Government at odds with its own equality quango. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is to argue in the same European Court of Human Rights test case that workers should have legal protection if they wish to display a token of their religious faith at work. The Strasbourg court is poised this spring to begin consideration of the cases of Nadia Eweida and Shirley Chaplin. Mrs Eweida, a British Airways check-in clerk, was suspended from work in 2006 after refusing instructions to take off the cross she wore while at work. Controversy: The Strasbourg court will hear the case of two Christian workers this spring . Delia Smith, above, has made an impassioned defence of Christianity against attacks from ‘militant neo-atheists’. The TV cook voiced concerns about the threat to believers from ‘devout secularists’ in her Lent Appeal on her website. She wrote: ‘I am, as you may or may not know, a passionate believer but of late, we are somewhat under the cosh. ‘There is a running battle going on in the Press, and militant neo-atheists and devout secularists are busting a gut to drive us off the radar and try to convince us that we hardly exist.’ On www.deliaonline.com, which has two million regular users, she urged people to support the aid charity CAFOD, the Catholic Agency For Overseas Development. She added: ‘While the belief battle grabs the headlines, one thing we all stand united on is hopefully our common belief in human life and human flourishing.’ Miss Smith, 70, later said she was responding to atheist scientist Richard Dawkins, who said recently that religion was increasingly irrelevant in Britain. She said: ‘Atheists have been saying that Christianity is dying. He [Richard Dawkins] did a survey which said we were not a Christian country, which was cheeky – and not true. Christians are alive and kicking.’ Mr Dawkins had backed up his claim by saying that the proportion of people identifying themselves as Christians had fallen from 72 per cent to 54 per cent during the past decade. Miss Smith, who was baptised in the Church of England and attended a Methodist Sunday school before converting to Roman Catholicism at 22, has written books on religion. BA backed down after her case provoked condemnation, but Mrs Eweida, 58, has been campaigning to cement the rights of Christians to wear religious symbols, a right she says is routinely accorded to followers of other faiths. Mrs Chaplin, 56, a nurse, was barred from working on the wards of her hospital in Exeter after she refused to remove or hide the cross she wore on her necklace chain. The claims of both women that they have a right to wear a cross – under European human rights rules which guarantee the right to manifest belief – have been rejected by British courts. Both women have won backing from the Equality Commission, headed by former Labour politician Trevor Phillips, which is to tell the Strasbourg judges that believers have the right to display their faith even if it is not a strict requirement of their religion that they do so. But Government lawyers will follow the line set down by Miss Featherstone and argue that ‘in neither case is there any suggestion that the wearing of a visible cross or crucifix was a generally recognised form of practising the Christian faith, still less one that is regarded as a requirement of the faith’. The Eweida and Chaplin cases are among four test claims regarded by Christians as being at the centre of their efforts to ensure their faith is not marginalised by the State or pushed out of public life. Two other cases involve a registrar sacked by her council for declining to conduct civil partnership ceremonies, and a Relate counsellor sacked after he said he would not give sex advice to gay couples. A spokesman for the Home Office, which supervises Miss Featherstone’s Equalities Department, said: ‘The Equality Act makes very clear that people have the right to express their views in a legitimate way, as long as they do not discriminate against a particular group or individual. ‘Therefore the UK is not in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, as alleged by the applicants. It would be inappropriate to comment further on the details of these cases at this stage.’ But former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said: ‘The irony is that when governments and courts dictate to Christians that the cross is a matter of insignificance, it becomes an even more important symbol and expression of our faith.’","Move is from Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone .

"Eighties TV star Lysette Anthony has admitted how she was left homeless and on benefits after a succession of 'expensive husbands' She may have been known as the face of the eighties, raking in thousands for a day’s work in front of the camera. But yesterday television star Lysette Anthony revealed that she has been left penniless, homeless and at times hungry – after a series of ‘expensive husbands’. Miss Anthony is best known for starring in shows such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and in Three Up, Two Down, on which she made £2,500 a week. The actress, who says she earned only £6,000 this year, has explained that expensive legal battles with her former partners led to the demise of her fortune. She also criticised the drop in fees paid to TV actors over the last two decades, saying: ‘In those days you could earn a living, but it’s got to the stage where we actors can’t go on like this.’ Called the ‘face of the eighties’ by photographer David Bailey, Miss Anthony was also well known for her modelling – commanding tens of thousands of pounds for a single shoot. However the 51-year-old went through a series of rocky relationships, with her first marriage to actor Luc Leestemaker ending in 1995 after five years. She walked down the aisle for a second time with director David Price, but they split two years later. Miss Anthony said: ‘Over the years I have had quite a lot of expensive husbands. I have been homeless and on welfare for a while. That was during what I called “the troubles”.’ Scroll down for video . She added: ‘Everyone’s behaving now and that’s fine, but there have been times when I got incredibly thin because I couldn’t really afford to eat.’ The actress also went through a highly publicised break-up from BAFTA-nominated composer Simon Boswell, the father of her son Jimi. Speaking about their relationship breakdown, Miss Anthony criticised the legal system’s treatment of non-married couples. The sitcom actress was first discovered by photographer David Bailey who called her 'the face of the Eighties' Her first marriage to Dutch actor Luc Leestemaker (left) in 1991 lasted just four years and she had a bitter court battle with Simon Boswell (right) - the father of her 10-year-old son, Jimi . She shot to fame in Three Up, Two Down and starred in Woody Allen's (right) 1992 drama Husbands and Wives with Sydney Pollack (left) She told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘The law in this country is a disgrace if you’re not married. We bought a house together, but all that you are owed in terms of your input, your finances, is your investment in the property, in the bricks and mortar. ‘So the fact that you bought heaven knows how many Christmas presents and paid for and contributed, that’s irrelevant, and also every single gift that you’ve ever been given is no longer yours. It’s simply because you’re not married, and it’s absolutely wrong.’ She added: ‘But to be fair to Simon, he did do the honourable thing and made up the difference and has put it in trust for Jimi.’","Lysette Anthony dropped to 6st 7lb because she couldn't afford to eat .

"Couples with teenage children are at risk of breaking up because they suffer from ‘lost youth envy’, experts say. Many people become unhappy when they see their children dating and partying because they can no longer do so themselves, according to a study. And this causes some parents to become dissatisfied with their own relationships. Couples with teenage children are at risk of breaking up because they suffer from ‘lost youth envy’, experts say, with many becoming unhappy when they see their children partying and dating (file photo) Susanna Abse, chief executive of the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, which conducted the research, said the risks are even greater over Christmas. ‘Memories of the excitement you felt in childhood come back, making it all the harder to deal with disappointment,’ she explained. This leads to a sharp rise in the number of couples seeking relationship counselling in January. The research, which looked at 7,455 people having relationship counselling, identified the main life events that can cause relationships to break down. Other common triggers for dissatisfaction between partners include a couple’s first row and their first baby . Mrs Abse said that parents typically in their 40s and 50s can find it hard to see their children coming of age, which can be ‘a trigger for dissatisfaction between partners and sadness about lost youth’. Other common triggers included a couple’s first row and their first baby. Parents who work were most at risk of neglecting their relationship as they tried to compensate for leaving their child at nursery by spending as much of their remaining time as possible with them. And high-flyers, who may have excessive expectations of themselves and their partners, are also particularly at risk. ‘They expect to have perfect bodies, a great sex life, be fabulously successful at work and have a glittering social calendar,’ Mrs Abse told the Sunday Times. ‘This can leave them feeling very anxious, constantly checking how well they are doing.’ They are then more likely to turn on their partner when reality falls short of their expectations, she said. Being a high-flier can also cause issues if one partner becomes more successful than the other. Another common problem is when one partner is carefree and the other ‘double doses’ on unhappiness and worry. The study also found that having a bad relationship can make you mentally ill. Almost 75 per cent of those in counselling had depressive illnesses, and those who were most unhappy in their relationship had the highest level of depression.","Researchers looked at 7,455 people having relationship counselling .

"After an Austrian drag queen won the Eurovision song contest, Russia has demanded a ‘straight’ version of the annual competition, which it has denounced as ‘endless madness’. Popularly known as 'the bearded lady', Conchita won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night in Copenhagen with the James Bond-like theme Rise Like A Phoenix, before a global TV audience estimated to be around 180million people in 45 countries. But some watching in Russia bristled at the sight of Conchita, the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big hit: Singer Conchita Wurst representing Austria performing the song Rise Like A Phoenix during the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen on Saturday . Outspoken: Communist Party deputy Valery Rashkin has called for Russia to leave the Eurovision Song Contest . ‘The last Eurovision contest's results exhausted our patience,’ Communist Party deputy Valery Rashkin told the Interfax news agency, according to The Local. ‘We must leave this competition. We cannot tolerate this endless madness.’ Mr Rashkin proposed that Russia breaks away from Eurovision and helps create a Voice Of Eurasia contest, with nations from the former Soviet Union. Russia has an intolerant stance on homosexuality. It does not recognise gay marriages or civil unions, and openly gay and lesbian Russians say they've been targeted by vigilantes, even more so since President Vladimir Putin approved a law last year banning what it calls gay 'propaganda' from reaching minors. Mr Rashkin's Eurovision proposal was met with a chorus of approval by advisers to reactionary Belarus President Aleksander Lukashenko. ‘Conchita Wurst's Eurovision victory symbolizes the complete collapse of the European Union's moral values,’ the country's advisory Slavic Committee said in a statement. Meanwhile, Conchita Wurst has had a sausage named in her honour, created by the butcher near her family home in Bad Mitterndorf in Styria in southern Austria. Joe Aichinger, 38, created the Conchita Wurst - Wurst means sausage in German - as a tribute to the village's most famous inhabitant and was delighted when she made a surprise visit to the shop and even helped him sell them after a visit to see her parents, who run a nearby guesthouse. He said that the sausage creation was selling well and added: ‘It's extra spicy, just like she is.’ And he was delighted when Conchita turned up and donned a white coat to help him sell the sausage to locals. Meat and greet: Eurovision Song contest winner Conchita Wurst with butcher Joe Aichinger, who created a sausage in her honour . Asked what she thought about the creation she said: ‘It looks good, but I never imagined it would be so big.’ She said: ‘Wurst is, after all, my name, it's from the German expression. It's all sausage, which means I don't care. It's all sausage after all if I am man, or a woman.’ Village priest Michael Unger was an unexpected fan. He said: ‘I am proud that she stands to what she is.’ He even gave her a pack of sausages to take with her. And the first person that was given a sample was the Danish ambassador to Austria, Liselotte Plesner, who had given her tips on the language before her trip to Copenhagen.","Conchita won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night in Denmark .

"The chaotic scenes inside a New York subway station moments after two police officers were murdered was captured on cell phone  by a man who happened to be in the station on Saturday afternoon as police entered in pursuit of killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley. The footage, captured by John Arcequie, shows a number of cops running onto the platform. One officer can be heard shouting at the people inside Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station to 'get on the floor' as his colleagues conduct their search. As officers run into the station, Arcequie can be heard saying 'Yo this is crazy. Y'all seeing this?' Seconds later a woman can be heard starting to cry and he  can be heard trying to comfort her. Scroll down for video . The chaotic scenes inside a New York subway station moments after two police officers were murdered was captured on cell phone by a man who happened to be in the station on Saturday afternoon as police entered in pursuit of killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley . Another video, also filmed by Arcequie, appears to have been taken a short time later and shows police explaining their operations to people sitting in the stairwell of the Brooklyn station. The gunman who fatally ambushed two New York City police officers in their squad car had a long criminal record, a hatred for police and the government and an apparent history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago, police said on Sunday. Brinsley approached people on the street moments before opening fire and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them to 'watch what I'm going to do,' Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. A portrait of the shooter emerged as big-city police departments and union leaders warned officers to change up their routines and insist on extra backup a day after Brinsley carried out what he portrayed online as retaliation for the slayings of black men at the hands of white police. The footage shows a number of cops run in and one officer can be heard shouting at the people inside Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station to 'get on the floor' as his colleagues conduct their search . A second video, also filmed by Arcequie, appears to have been taken a short time later and shows police explaining their operations to people sitting in the stairwell of the Brooklyn station . Investigators were trying to determine if Brinsley had taken part in any protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose names he invoked in his online threat, or simply latched on to the cause for the final act of a violent spree. Police said he had no gang affiliation. Brinsley, 28, had at least 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio and a troubled childhood so violent his mother was afraid of him, police said. Brinsley had also ranted online about police and government and expressed despair about his own life, Boyce said. Boyce said Brinsley's mother believed he had undiagnosed mental problems and may have been on medication later in life but detective said they were still trying to determine if he had a mental illness. Brinsley approached a squad car from behind and fired four shots, fatally wounding officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, before running into a subway station and ultimately killing himself. Hours earlier, Brinsley had shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend at her home outside Baltimore then made threatening posts online, including a vow to put 'wings on pigs,' and references to a pair of police-involved deaths that have sparked racially charged protests across the country. Ismaaiyl Brinsley approached people on the street moments before opening fire and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them to 'watch what I'm going to do' Gun: This photo provided by the New York Police Department shows the weapon used to kill the officers . The killings dramatically escalated tensions that have simmered for months over the deaths of young black men. The siege mentality was evident in several memos circulating among the rank and file at the 35,000-officer New York Police Department, the nation's largest. A union-generated message warned police officers they should respond to every radio call with two cars - 'no matter what the opinion of the patrol supervisor' - and to not make arrests 'unless absolutely necessary.' The president of the detectives' union told members in a letter to work in threes when out on the street, wear bulletproof vests and keep aware of their surroundings. 'Cowards such as yesterday's killer strike when you are distracted and vulnerable,' the letter read. Another directive warned officer in Newark, New Jersey not to patrol alone and avoid people looking for confrontations with them.

Above, Jeh Johnson, President Obama's Secretary for Homeland Security lays two bunches of roses . A the same time, a memo from an NYPD chief asked officers to avoid fanning rage within the ranks by limiting comments 'via all venues, including social media, to expressions of sorrow and condolence. ... Even in our most difficult times, we will remain consummate professionals.' Brinsley traveled by bus to New York City on after wounding his girlfriend. Before the shootings, Brinsley wrote on an Instagram account: 'I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs,' officials said. He used the hashtags Shootthepolice RIPErivGardner (sic) RIPMikeBrown - references to the police-involved deaths of Garner and Brown. The slayings come at a tense time; Police in New York and nationwide are being criticized for their tactics, following the July death of Garner, who was stopped on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Amateur video captured an officer wrapping his arm around Garner's neck and wrestling him to the ground. Garner was heard gasping, 'I can't breathe' before he lost consciousness and later died. Sealed off: Witnesses uploaded pictures to social media of the street, which was cordoned off . Demonstrators around the country have staged die-ins and other protests since a grand jury decided Dec. 3 not to indict the officer in Garner's death, a decision that closely followed a Missouri grand jury's refusal to indict a white officer in the fatal shooting of Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. Court records in Georgia show that Brinsley had several run-ins with the law there in recent years. Charges included gun possession, shop-lifting and theft. Bratton and De-Blasio attended Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where Cardinal Timothy Dolan called for calm. He asked the police commissioner to tell his troops that 'we love them very much, we mourn with them, we need them, we respect them, we're proud of them and we thank them.' Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand . Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams visited a makeshift memorial at the site of the slayings, calling on protest organizers to 'hold off on any type of protest until these officers are laid to rest in a peaceful manner.' At an appearance with the Rev. Al Sharpton where he denounced violence against police, Garner's mother expressed her dismay. 'I'm standing here in sorrow about losing those two police officers that was definitely not our agenda,' Gwen Garner said. 'We are going in peace and anyone who's standing with us we want you to not use Eric Garner's name for violence because we are not about that,' she said. 'These two police officers lost their lives senselessly and our condolence to the family and we stand with the families.' Police today revealed a timeline of Ismaaiyl Brinsley's movements on a day that began with the unauthorized entry into his ex-girlfriend's flat and ended with his suicide in a Brooklyn subway station: . 5.30am . Enters apartment of ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in Owings Mills, Maryland with a key he should not have had. They argue. 5.50am . Brinsley fires a single shot at Thompson, reportedly into her stomach. He flees with her cell phone. 6.05am . Brinsley calls Thompson's mother to apologize for shooting her. He claims it is an accident, and that he hopes she lives. 6.35am . Baltimore County Police begins monitoring him. They track Thompson's cellphone to the I-95 freeway, where he is believed to have been riding a bus. During the journey he keeps phoning Thompson's mom, and reveals he is headed to New York City. 10.50am . Brinsley arrives in New York City, in the West Side, and rides the subway to Brooklyn. 12.07pm . He throws away Thompson's phone in the Barclays Center. The NYPD later recovered it. Investigators are unclear where he goes between midday and the killings at 2.47pm. 1.30pm . Baltimore County Police send the NYPD a fax alerting them to Brinsley and his intentions. By the time it filters down to the rank-and-file, he has already struck. 2.47pm . Brinsley identifies his targets in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, tells passersby to watch, then fires four shots at them. As he flees he confronts two Con Edison drivers, who chase him in their truck and point officers in their direction. He runs into the Myrtle/Willoughby G train station, where he shoots himself dead on the platform .","A passer-by captured cell phone footage of the chaotic scenes inside Myrtle-Willoughby Avenues station on Saturday afternoon .

"Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston was cleared of the accusations he faced at a student code of conduct hearing involving an alleged sexual assault two years ago, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press on Sunday. Former Florida Supreme Court judge Major Harding wrote in a letter to Winston that the evidence was 'insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof.' Prosecutor Willie Meggs made a similar decision a year ago when he decided not to criminally charge Winston, citing a lack of evidence. This month, a two-day hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. The ramifications for Winston ranged from a reprimand to expulsion from school. The woman can request an appeal within five days. Scroll down for video . Cleared: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston was cleared of the accusations he faced at a student code of conduct hearing involving an alleged sexual assault two years ago . 'We will consider an appeal but right now we feel a little duped,' said Baine Kerr, one of the woman's lawyers. 'At some point we have to recognize that Florida State is never going to hold James Winston responsible.' AP is not identifying the woman because it does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse. Kerr said in the emailed statement that between his client, Winston, and two teammates that were at the off-campus apartment - Chris Casher and Ronald Darby - only the woman would answer questions about what happened. 'Somehow Jameis Winston still wins,' Kerr said. 'The order doesn't even follow the Student Conduct Code and it ignores the bulk of the evidence.' Florida State president John Thrasher said in a statement that the university selected the former state Supreme Court justice to remove any doubt about the integrity of the process. 'He (Harding) conducted a thorough Student Conduct Code hearing and reviewed more than 1,000 pages of evidence generated by three other investigations, and we would like to thank him sincerely for his service,' Thrasher said. Harding wrote that both sides' version of the events had strengths and weaknesses, but he did not find the credibility of one 'substantially stronger than the other.' Game time: Florida State faces Oregon in the College Football Playoffs semifinal on January 1. Before the ruling, there were questions whether Winston would be available to play . Ruling: This month, a two-day hearing was held to determine whether Winston violated four sections of the code of conduct - two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment . 'In sum, the preponderance of the evidence has not shown that you are responsible for any of the charged violations of the Code,' Harding wrote. Winston family adviser David Cornwell did not respond to requests for comment. Cornwell has contended that attorneys for the former student pushed for the hearing after they were rebuffed in an attempt to reach a settlement with Winston. Florida State faces Oregon in the College Football Playoffs semifinal on January 1. Before the ruling, there were questions whether Winston would be available to play. The Seminoles won a national championship with Winston at the helm last season and have not lost a game since he earned the starting job before the beginning of the 2013 season. Florida State is currently being investigated by the Department of Education on how hit handles possible Title IX violations. The woman who said Winston assaulted her filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, which decided the university should be investigated for possible Title IX violations over the way it responds to sexual violence complaints. Title IX is a federal statute that bans discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. The Department of Education in 2011 warned schools of their legal responsibilities to immediately investigate allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence, even if the criminal investigation has not concluded.","Jameis Winston was cleared of the accusations he faced at a student code of conduct hearing involving an alleged sexual assault two years ago .

"A Florida woman will not be charged with a crime after authorities say she attacked her boyfriend and threatened him with a knife. The reason 31-year-old Shavonna Rumph gave police for the December altercation: her boyfriend, 33-year-old Henry Price Jr, refused to cuddle with her. Regardless of the reason, an assistant state attorney in Florida reported on Wednesday that a misdemeanor battery charge would not be filed against Rumph. Cuddle bully: Shavonna Rumph will not be charged after pulling a knife on her boyfriend after he refused to cuddle with her . According to a report from the Manatee County Sheriff's office, on December 28, Rumph and Prince had been drinking at the home they share in Bradenton - according to the report, the couple had been drinking all day and through the night. At some point, the couple got into an argument 'over Henry refusing to ‘cuddle’ with Shavonna when they went to bed,' the report states. According to the report, the argument 'turned physical when Shavonna grabbed Henry by the shirt, causing it to tear.' History: The police were called during another altercation between Rumph and her boyfriend after she 'slashed the tires on his car' After ripping his shirt, Rumph - an employee at a local Kentucky Fried Chicken - 'picked up a kitchen knife as if she was going to use it to hurt or stab Henry,' according to the report. Price told authorities that Rumph didn't want him to leave after the initial altercation, which is when she grabbed the knife. The day after the incident, Rumph posted on her Facebook page a cartoon implying that it is better to smoke marijuana than drink. In the cartoon, it shows an image of a man and a woman fighting, with the caption explains that alcohol makes people 'aggressive.' This isn't the first time the police have been called in to break up a fight between the couple. In April of 2011, Rumph was suspected of flattening the tires on Price's car, as well as smashing its windows. Additionally, she was accused of breaking an apartment window as Price was on the phone calling 9-1-1. 'Aggressive': Rumph posted this on her Facebook page the day after she allegedly pulled a knife on her boyfriend after drinking all day . In that case, prosecutors again declined to file charges against Rumph. Initially, Rumph was booked into jail on misdemeanor domestic battery charges. She was released on $250 bond. It's unclear why prosecutors declined to charge Rumph with any crimes.","Shavonna Rumph told authorities she and her boyfriend had been drinking all day .

"Wasps celebrated the beginning of a new chapter in their 147-year history by routing London Irish at the Ricoh Arena in a 48-16 victory built on a fly-half masterclass from Andy Goode. An Aviva Premiership record crowd of 28,254 gathered in Coventry to watch the club's debut in their new home in the West Midlands and were rewarded with a bonus-point win against weak opposition. Fittingly, it was Coventry-born Goode who ensured the controversial relocation from High Wycombe, where Wasps had been based for the past 12 years, began as scripted. Wasps' Andy Goode breaks clear to score a try during his side's comfortable 48-16 victory against London Irish on Sunday . Goode (right), who was born in Coventry, is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring his only try of the match . Man of the match Goode successfully kicks one of eight penalties on his way to a 33-point haul at the Ricoh Arena . The man of the match finished the afternoon with a 33-point haul consisting of a try, eight penalties and two conversions, with just one missed shot at goal all afternoon. Joe Simpson, Elliot Daly and Andrea Masi also crossed to keep Wasps in the hunt for a place in the Premiership play-offs. While the Ricoh Arena is a welcome addition to the Premiership, the playing surface is a cause for concern with the pitch churning up alarmingly beneath one second-half scrum and ground staff worked on several muddy patches during the game. England wing Christian Wade returned from a three-week absence because of an ankle injury and he sensed an early a comeback try was there for the taking after superb hands from Simpson prevented a move from breaking down, but he was unable to wriggle through the Irish defence. A laboured clearance soon blotted Simpson's copybook and gave Irish an easy try with Blair Cowan charging down the kick at the base of a five-metre scrum before sending Geoff Cross over. Players from both teams receive a warm welcome ahead of Wasps' first game at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry . Wasps' Joe Simpson dives over the line for a try during his side's crushing victory on Sunday afternoon . A Premiership record crowd of 28,254 filled the Ricoh Arena to watch Wasps in action against struggling London Irish . Three penalties from Goode kept Wasps in contention on the scoreboard, but with their scrum dominating, they were in full control with Cross' touch down coming against the run of play. Another monster kick from Goode sailed between the uprights and when the pinpoint fly-half added his fifth, Wasps had eased 15-10 ahead. The conditions were perfect for kicking and Goode and Tom Homer took advantage by exchanging penalties in a first half that was short on thrills, despite a late flourish from Irish that was orchestrated by Shane Geraghty. The near-capacity crowd was brought to its feet just four minutes into the second half, however, when Simpson finished a sweeping move that started in Wasps' half.

Simpson is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring one of Wasps' four tries against London Irish . Quick hands gave Wade space to exploit and a heartbeat later the home side capitalised on an overlap with unerring execution, offering Simpson a simple route over the whitewash. Gaps were appearing in the Exiles' defence with increasing regularity and wing Sailosi Tagicakibau would have been awarded a try but for a forward pass. Wade was trying everything possible to find a way through the green shirts, but it was the irrepressible Goode who breached the wall when the pressure created by waves of attacks finally told. Daly followed Goode over the whitewash two minutes later after Irish had been stretched to breaking point once more and just as it appeared time had run out on Wasps' quest for the bonus point, Masi touched down with seconds to spare.","Wasps' Andy Goode finished the match with a 33-point haul after a try, eight penalties and two conversions .

"When a Memphis Grizzlies intern had his car stolen, the team decided they couldn't let Christmas go by without making it up to him. Identified as Brandon on the team's Facebook page, the intern was waiting with veteran guard Vince Carter in the parking garage when the team surprised him. 'My man had a tough time, he lost his car, somebody stole it,' Carter said before surprising Brandon. 'Everybody chipped in for him for Christmas, you know, it's the holiday season of giving. That's what we wanted to do.' The New York Daily News reports that the team then surprised him with a brand new Nissan bearing a bow. The Commercial Appeal reports that Henderson, an intern in basketball operations, had had his 1993 Chrysler New Yorker stolen while out listening to musicians at an art gallery. That was one day before Thanksgiving, just before the team went on a six-day trip. It was Henderson's only means of transportation. Griz players teamed up and purchased a new Nissan Altima, surprising the 24-year-old Henderson with the red-bow-covered car Friday morning before their loss to the Chicago Bulls. Forward Quincy Pondexter had been blocking Brandon's view before stepping aside to reveal the new car. 'He's trying to hold back the tears right now, but, hey, he should cry,' Carter says. Also present are players Courtney Lee, Nick Calathahes, Tony Allen and Mike Conley. Brandon hugs the teammates in gratitude as they egg him on to get behind the wheel of his new ride. 'I don’t know how the guys found out,' Henderson told reporters. 'I kept it like that because I try to keep stuff that happens at home away from work. It didn’t seem real. It seemed like a dream. It’s like stuff you see on TV. They didn’t have to do it, but it’s a blessing.'","Identified as Brandon on the team's Facebook page, the intern was waiting with veteran guard Vince Carter in the parking garage when the team surprised him .

"Fluid feast: The liquid lunch, above, contains turkey gel, umami-rich gravy, carrot fluid gel, dehydrated Brussels sprouts and potato-infused foam . For most of us, Christmas is a time to ditch the diet. But jockeys have to forego all festive treats to stay light enough for winter races. So food scientist Dr Rachel Edwards-Stuart and bookmakers William Hill have now created the first ever liquid Christmas lunch – containing just 294 calories – for riders in the William Hill Winter Festival at Kempton Park this weekend. The high-tech fluid festive feast contains turkey gel, umami-rich gravy, carrot fluid gel, dehydrated Brussels sprouts, potato-infused foam and cranberry 'air'. And it is served with an espresso-style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter – an extra 38 calories. Unlike the rest of us, jockeys aren’t able to get stuck into the classic 7,000 plus calorie Christmas dinner. The drink is a balanced, high carbohydrate, low glycaemic load meal which provides all the nutrition needed for a jockey to remain light, yet full of energy and sharply focused before a big race. Jon Ivan-Duke at William Hill said: 'Christmas is a time when we all want to let ourselves go and enjoy all the different foods on offer but the top jockeys can't do that. 'Typically jockeys trying to make weight will eat a restricted calorie diet in the run up to a big race, so the traditional Christmas lunch was most definitely off the menu for those racing at the William Hill Winter Festival. 'The usual festive fare for jockeys riding on Boxing Day would be a slither of turkey, a couple of sprouts and a few water biscuits. 'Even then they will probably spend a couple of hours on race day in the sauna sweating off those last few pounds!' Champion jockey A P McCoy who will be riding at the William Hill Winter Festival at Kempton Park on Boxing Day added: 'This is a great invention for jockeys who are struggling to make weight for the William Hill King George but still want to feel part of their family's festive celebrations. 'I always used to feel a bit left out when they all started tucking in to their turkey so this year I am looking forward to enjoying the full flavours of Christmas lunch, without having to worry about the calories.' Treat: The meal is served with an espresso-style shot of mince pie extract and a spoonful of powdered brandy butter (pictured) – an extra 38 calories. A traditional Christmas lunch contains more than 7,000 calories . Clever: One jockey said that the liquid feast was a great invention for those who did not want to forego all festive treats. It offers riders the full flavours of Christmas lunch, without all of the extra calories. (File image)","Jockeys have to forego festive treats to stay light enough for winter races .

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger felt bad memories of last season's 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Liverpool might have affected some of his players during Sunday's 2-2 draw at Anfield. Brendan Rodgers' side were dominant in the opening half but both sides went into the break level at 1-1, a stark contrast to the last time the two sides met in February - when Liverpool were already leading 4-0. This time around Olivier Giroud looked to have given Arsenal a welcome three points with his second-half goal, but Martin Skrtel's injury-time equaliser earned the hosts a share of the spoils - leaving the Gunners four points off fourth-placed West Ham as a result.

After the game Gunners boss Wenger admitted his side played with too much anxiety throughout, sitting off their opposition far too much as a result. He said: 'We had problems to get our flow going. 'We did not have enough possession in the game. In the first half it was down to tactical and some psychological reasons: maybe bad memories from last year. Some players were not at their best.

'To concede the corner that was a bit unlucky but then we didn't jump with Skrtel. 'Overall it is a fair result but a frustrating result for us because they came back when we had plenty of defenders on the pitch and could have defended the set-piece much better.'","Arsenal conceded a last-gasp goal to be denied a win at Liverpool .

"Jailed: Rhiann Burnie has been jailed for two years and eight months at Burnley Crown Court for attacking her boyfriend of a year Shane McMullen . A 'sinister' young mother stabbed and battered her boyfriend because he failed to call her every two hours on a night out, leaving him so badly injured paramedics believed he was dead, a court heard yesterday. Rhiann Burnie, 21, punched bricklayer Shane McMullen, 23, then knifed him in the shoulder before lighting up a cigarette and mopping up blood as he lay on the floor clinging to life, the jury at Burnley Crown Court was told. The prosecution claim she flew into a rage about him going to an engagement party and leaving her at home with her two-year-old daughter. Despite the wound severing a major artery and causing significant blood loss, Mr McMullen survived but has suffered memory loss and has nightmares of being stabbed again. A jury was told he had been attacked simply because he forgot to ring her 'every couple of hours' as she demanded. Burnley Crown Court was told the couple had been in a relationship for a year and initially was 'happy and healthy' yet a 'darker more sinister side' of Burnie's character emerged, said Miss Rachel Woods, prosecuting. Burnie had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife with Mr McMullen having to wrestle them off her, it is alleged. She had also smashed doors and furniture during heated arguments and had revealed she had been advised to attend anger management courses. Miss Woods added: 'She revealed a different side of her character, a volatile side, an aggressive side, an unpredictable side where she would lose her temper and damage the property and furniture, doors, in a fit of rage. 'No sooner would she blow up she would calm down. In flashes of temper the knife would come out and then matters would calm down - Mr McMullen had little realisation what lay ahead.' Mr McMullen saw the previous threats as empty and never thought she was capable of using a knife. He would often leave the house to let her cool down. But the stabbing occurred in April after Mr McMullen was invited to the party at Burnley Football Club's Turf Moor ground in Lancashire. Couple: Shane McMullen with partner Rhiann Burnie, who puffed on a cigarette while mopping up his blood as he lay on the floor of their home . Miss Woods added: 'It is quite apparent that she was very keen to know exactly what he was up to that evening. She had ran out of credit on her own mobile phone and so she kept his so that they could continue contact throughout the evening. Violent: Mr McMullen suffered the life threatening injuries because he hadn't called Burnie 'every couple of hours' like she had wanted . 'He telephoned her and spoke to her before he went to the party not causing any difficulty at that stage. He made the error of not keeping in contact with the defendant.' The court heard Mr McMullen arrived at Burnie's home in Burnley after the function and she was said to be 'not best pleased'. She was so annoyed she punched him in the face fracturing his nose and leaving him with a black eye. She then went to the pub and continued drinking at a friend's house before returning home at around 3am. On arriving back she taunt Mr McMullen telling him that she had been with another man. He got up and dressed before making an attempt to leave. But as he did so Burnie took the kitchen knife and attacked him in a 'fit of rage, or jealousy, or control,' added Miss Woods. Mr McMullen staggered into the backyard where he was found in the backyard with a blood soaked shirt. Police arrested Burnie but she initially claimed her boyfriend had come home injured, before suggesting there must have been an intruder at the house. She also refused 'point blank' to tell officers Mr McMullen's name, instead giving a false, foreign name despite police needing to call a next of kin. She then claimed she hadn't realised how serious his injuries were and only sought help when she looked out of a back window and saw him turning grey and eyes rolling. Miss Woods said: 'She claims that she was unaware that he had a serious injury and thought about turning the lights off and going to bed. She told the police she had a cigarette and she mopped up the blood in the kitchen.' 'The defendant did later accept that when she got back she was still annoyed and cross that he had left her alone whilst he was enjoying himself. 'She accepts that she had gone upstairs to the bedroom where he was sleeping and taunted him and tried to get a reaction out of him claiming she had just been with another man. 'There was a row in which she claims she was pinned down on the bed by him by her wrists, because he was angry and shouted. She accepted he didn't hit or hurt her.' In a video taped interview Mr McMullen said: 'I went to the engagement do with all my mates and I forgot to ring her. I remember just coming round in hospital. I think my brain shut down.' Relationship: The couple had been happy but the court heard of Burnie's 'sinister' side and she had on two previous occasions turned on him with a knife . He said of the relationship: 'It was good up until eight months. She just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house, breaking stuff then I would have to fix it. Victim: Shane McMullen told the court: 'She just started going loopy like screaming and shouting all the time and throwing stuff about in the house' 'We'd argue when rough, after we'd been out, then it started happening when we were out and then it was getting worse and worse, we'd argue about little things. 'She would throw anything, like a plate, I thought 'what a nutcase' but she always calmed down. We would be arguing and she would go to hit me, she thought I had been looking at her mates if we were out. If I couldn't calm her down I used to go for a walk. 'She picked up a knife before but I never felt threatened. I thought she might have slashed me, I never took much notice because I never felt threatened. 'She got a knife and started waving it around, I said 'what are you doing', she started pointing it about. I was a bit paranoid. This is when it was getting ropey and I was thinking 'this isn't going to work'.' He said he had repaired the bedroom door four times after she broke it by kicking and pushing it through. He said: 'Every time we had an argument she would do that so I would have to repair in. I just think she needs to sort her anger problems out. She used to say people told her to go for anger management, she never really went into it.' 'I have the odd nightmare about being stabbed, not by her, by other people, someone comes and sits on me and stabs me in the chest. I've had it more than once, it makes me wake up. I just try and block it out.' Burnie denies wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm but admits the lesser charged of unlawful wounding. The trial continues.

"'You can't be pro choice except when you don't like the choice': Furedi made the comments online . The head of the country’s biggest abortion charity has said women are legally free to terminate pregnancies because they are unhappy with the sex of their unborn child. Ann Furedi, the chief executive of BPAS, said no law prevents abortion on grounds of gender – and even compared it to abortion after rape. Her organisation carries out more than a quarter of abortions in England and Wales. Mrs Furedi’s comments follow the  decision earlier this month not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions – as part of a newspaper probe – for women who said they did not want girls. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public  Prosecutions, said that although there was a realistic prospect of securing convictions, it would be against the public interest to take the doctors to trial. The doctors’ professional body, the General Medical Council, can still strike them off. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for ‘urgent clarification’ from Mr Starmer, while Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, Emily Thornberry, said: ‘Abortion on grounds of gender selection is a terrible crime, and the law is crystal clear on this.’ However, Mrs Furedi’s comments have raised the question of whether this really is the case – and whether major abortion providers are quietly carrying out such terminations, which are thought to be increasingly common among some Asian communities. Writing on the website Spiked, Mrs Furedi said that if doctors decide that going through with a pregnancy will damage the mental health of the mother-to-be, then abortion is within the law. ‘A doctor agreeing to an abortion on grounds of rape would be breaking the law no more and no less than a doctor who agrees an abortion on grounds of sex selection,’ she said. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has sought urgent clarification on the issue of whether or not doctors could be prosecuted for granting an abortion on the basis of gender . ‘While it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion, nor is rape, or incest, or being 13 years old. 'Nor is being homeless, or abandoned, or just feeling there’s no way you can bring a child into the world... yet they are all reasons why a doctor may believe a woman has met the legal grounds of abortion.’ She continued: ‘The woman gives her reasons, the doctor decides on the grounds as set out in the law... there is no legal requirement to deny a woman an abortion if she has a sex preference, providing that the legal grounds are still met. Abortion has been legal since the 1967 Abortion Act set out the grounds on which a woman’s pregnancy may be terminated. The . key clause says an abortion can be performed if two doctors decide ‘the . continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the . pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the . pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater than if . the pregnancy were terminated’. A further clause, giving weight to . Ann Furedi’s argument says . ‘account may be taken of the pregnant woman’s actual or reasonably . foreseeable environment’. In other words, if doctors decide pressure . in a family where girls are unwanted would affect the woman’s mental . health, they may approve a termination. ‘The law is silent on the matter of gender selection, just as it is silent on rape.’ Mrs Furedi claimed those who want to stop abortion on grounds of sex were hindering the pro-choice movement as much as anti-abortion protesters who picket clinics. ‘We either support women’s capacity to decide, or we don’t,’ she said. ‘You can’t be pro-choice except when you don’t like the choice, because that’s not pro-choice at all.’ She questioned whether it is right that a woman pregnant with a girl should be made to have the baby if ‘her family will disown her and she’ll lose her home, her husband whom she loves, and her existing children’. Since abortion was made legal in 1967, the overwhelming majority of terminations have been carried out on the basis that two doctors agree there is risk of injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman or her family. Nearly 200,000 abortions in England and Wales are now carried out each year, and abortion ends more than one in five of all pregnancies. Some 55,000 terminations are performed by BPAS – formerly the British Pregnancy Advisory Service – each year in its clinics, which also provide advice and counselling to pregnant women. The charity received more than £26million in abortion fees last year, much of it paid by the taxpayer through the NHS. Anti-abortion campaigners responded with fury to the idea that sex-selection abortions are not only legally acceptable but should even be encouraged. Divisive: the latest comments are sure to provoke strong reactions from both side of the debate on abortion . Jack Scarisbrick, of LIFE, said the 1967 Abortion Act should be the subject of an immediate inquiry by the CPS and Department of Health. ‘The mental health clause amounts to abortion on demand,’ he added. ‘Why has the Department of Health not stamped out the conveyor-belting of women through the abortion clinics?’ He described abortion in Britain as a ‘runaway bus’, asking: ‘How else could gender-selection abortion – aborting unborn girls simply because they are female – be potentially widely available in abortion clinics across the country?’ ANN Furedi is a former magazine journalist  who has become an outspoken leader of the abortion industry. In a decade running BPAS, she has repeatedly challenged the widely-held assumption that abortion is a last resort for desperate women who stand to suffer deeply if they go ahead with their pregnancies. Instead, critics say Mrs Furedi, 52, has effectively championed the view of abortion as another form of contraception. She welcomed news that half of all pregnancies among girls under 18 end in abortion as ‘a positive sign’. A health writer for Cosmopolitan and Company, she became an abortion campaigner in the Nineties. She was BPAS spokesman in 2000 when she declared that ‘it may be time to understand that, for women, abortion is an essential method of family planning and accept it as such.’ She has run BPAS since 2003 and earns £125,000. In 2009, as Labour’s ‘teenage pregnancy strategy’ to reduce pregnancies with more contraception and sex education collapsed, she saw an increase in abortion as the bright side. She said: ‘This means more young women know how to get the care they need and if they have other plans for their teenage years aside from motherhood, they felt more able to make that choice.’ She is married to Frank Furedi, 66, with whom she has an 18-year-old son. The former student radical and founder of the Revolutionary Communist Party is Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Kent University and a leading figure behind the Spiked website on which his wife defended abortion on grounds of sex.","Ann Furedi made the comments in an article online .

"Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke have instructed government advisers to 'ignore' the will of Parliament to reform human rights law, it was claimed yesterday. The explosive allegation was made by Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky as he resigned in protest from the UK Commission on a Bill of Rights. David Cameron established the commission in the hope of finding a way to stop human rights rulings damaging Britain's national interests after the Commons voted overwhelmingly against a ruling by the unelected European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg that prisoners should be allowed to vote. Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke have instructed government advisers to 'ignore' the will of Parliament to reform human rights law, Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky claimed . MPs want the commission to consider introducing a 'democratic override' – which would allow Parliament to reject harmful verdicts from Strasbourg. But Dr Pinto-Duschinsky said he had been secretly told by Tory Justice Secretary Mr Clarke and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg to ignore 'agitation from Parliament'. The hugely-respected political scientist claims the panel – which is stuffed with liberals hand-picked by Mr Clegg – has effectively been told to reach the conclusion that no change is needed to human rights law. Resignation: Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky has attacked both Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke . Yesterday, it also emerged that the commission is objecting to giving Parliament a greater say on the grounds that 'many of the most objectionable laws in Nazi Germany were passed, at least in the early years, by a democratically elected assembly'. Members believe that allowing MPs to override human rights is the tyranny of the majority. Dr Pinto-Duschinsky was considered by many Tory MPs as their best hope for securing meaningful reform. But he decided to quit after a row with Sir Leigh Lewis, the chairman, whom he accuses of giving undue weight to human rights lobbies. Claiming that 'the Lib Dem tail is wagging the Conservative dog', Dr Pinto-Duschinsky also attacked Mr Clarke, who has repeatedly clashed with his own party over human rights and is a strong supporter of the Strasbourg court. He said Mr Clarke was 'sidelining not only parliament but also the Prime Minister, and I consider that disloyal'. He told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme: 'The commission answers to Ken Clarke – he and Nick Clegg set it up and selected the chairman. His civil servants run the commission and staffing, his hands are everywhere. The commissioners were called in last December by Ken Clarke and Nick Clegg and told we should ignore what was called “agitation” from Parliament. 'Now I consider that a ten to one vote, an overwhelming vote (on prisoner voting) by our House of Commons, can't be dismissed as agitation. And I said so.' Explaining his decision to quit, Dr Pinto-Duschinsky said: 'I could have settled for a quiet life, but it goes against my deepest convictions to sacrifice our parliamentary sovereignty, which is at stake, and I'm afraid I'll have to pay the price.' Incredibly, he said, the issue of parliamentary sovereignty had been discussed only once since the commission was established in February last year. He also claimed he had been leant on by the Ministry of Justice not to issue a statement arguing for parliamentary powers to override Strasbourg. He said he was told 'the Lib Dems won't agree'. Respected political scientist Dr Pinto-Duschinsky has now resigned from the UK Commission on a Bill of Rights in protest at what he says is the government's stance on human rights law . A series of leaked e-mails yesterday laid bare the tensions within the commission, which is supposed to be examining the case for a British Bill of Rights to replace Labour's Human Rights Act. The messages, seen by the Mail, show the commission arguing forcefully that Parliament should not be allowed to 'override' controversial judgments. One says: 'If a right or freedom is fundamental, how can it be right to allow any legislature, however democratic, to override it? It should be remembered that many of the most objectionable laws passed in Nazi Germany were passed, at least in the early years, by a democratically elected assembly.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We are aware that there have been some internal difficulties within the commission.' COMMENTARY by Dr MICHAEL PINTO-DUSCHINSKY . My background gives me a unique insight into the reality of human rights. I was born into a Jewish family in Budapest in 1943 and I am lucky to be one of the youngest survivors of the Holocaust. As an infant in Hungary under Nazi occupation, my life was saved when a deal was done with Hitler’s monstrous henchmen in the SS, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Eichmann. The lives of 20 Jewish families were spared in return for ransom money. I was among those spared, while 20,000 others were put on trains for gas chambers of Auschwitz.It was an experience that led me to fight for human rights all my life, as reflected, for example, during my work during the Vietnam War in the 1960s when I liaised with the International Red Cross to prevent humanitarian abuses. I know what the abuse of human rights really means. It is certainly not the kind of nonsense we hear so much about today – parents smacking children, the eviction of travellers from illegal encampments or the deportation of foreign criminals in breach of their supposed ‘right to a family life’. Yet these are the conflicts that have occupied debate over human rights law in recent years, with the British Parliament endlessly accused of defying the European Court of Human Rights. Human rights: Mr Cameron set up an eight-strong commission which was asked to examine the implementation of a British Bill of Rights . The conflict was seen at its most stark over the question of voting rights for prisoners, something which has been demanded by Strasbourg but overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Commons. It was in February last year after a Commons vote on the matter that David Cameron set up an eight-strong commission which was asked to examine the implementation of a British Bill of Rights, which would reconcile human rights legislation with British law. As a political scientist with a long record in studying the development of democratic institutions, I was asked to be part of this commission, whose chairman is the former civil servant Sir Leigh Lewis. Initially, I had high hopes, believing we could achieve a synthesis between human rights and the democratic will of Parliament. But it has become obvious that some of the predominant members on the commission were not remotely interested in such an outcome. All they wanted to do was uphold the status quo and ensure that the influence of Parliament continued to be ignored. Effectively, the commission has been hijacked by the Liberal Democrats and the grandees of the human rights culture. The views of the Prime Minister and his senior Tory colleagues count for almost nothing. The truth is that the body has taken little trouble to be in touch with the impulses of the British people and it has rejected my proposals for 50 public meetings to be held to discuss the issue. Instead, it will hold just one public meeting in England. It even refused to include a question about the role of the Strasbourg court in our questionnaire. It also wouldn’t ask the public about the Prime Minister’s statement that decisions should be made in Parliament rather than in the courts. That is why my position has become intolerable and I have taken the most difficult decision in my life: to resign from the commission. I had tried strenuously to ensure that the commission gave heed to the views of Parliament, but I have found myself sidelined, bullied, marginalised and ignored. The whole affair has made a farce not only of democracy but also of genuine human rights. It seems that those leading members of the fashionable human rights culture are not really interested in tackling real humanitarian abuses or instances of true political oppression. Instead, they revel in demonstrating the superiority of the British and European judiciary over our elected representatives. Rights rulings: Decisions handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg have been criticised . I find utterly intolerable this perversion of human rights – which treats the issue as nothing more than an arena for political power games. In my work on the commission, I was determined to see that Parliament had the ability to override decisions by the European Court of Human Rights – such as prisoners’ votes or rulings stopping the deportation of foreign criminals. But to my despair, the commission was managed in a manner that ensured the rigid orthodoxy of submission to Strasbourg prevailed – despite my views and those of other Conservative appointees. When I tried to raise the question of Parliamentary sovereignty with Sir Leigh, he not only refused but even took me into a basement room of the House of Lords to warn me that I would be considered a maverick without influence if I persisted in my demand. In the same vein, when the commission, four months after its establishment, put out a paper for public consultation on a British Bill of Rights, it deliberately left out any reference to David Cameron’s statement on the need to uphold Parliamentary sovereignty on key political decisions such as prisoners’ voting rights. This was typical. The opinions of the Prime Minister were treated with contempt while those of his Europhile Cabinet junior colleagues, especially Ken Clarke and Nick Clegg, carried much more weight. In fact, in December, members were summoned to a meeting with Ken Clarke and told to defer any discussion about Parliament overriding Strasbourg and ignore any ‘agitation’ from the Commons on the issue. This meeting was a dramatic illustration of the low priority given to the basis of our democracy – the House of Commons. Similarly, the commission regularly heard evidence from human rights groups, which of course have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, yet proceeded to ignore MPs and peers who wanted to curb the power of the human rights court. This is why I’ve had enough. I can no longer put up with the sneering, contemptuous attitude of the human rights brigade towards the concept of Parliamentary sovereignty. The will of the people is not a form of tyranny or ‘mob rule’, as they condescendingly seem to believe, but is a bulwark of freedom, as is clearly demonstrated by the long, progressive narrative of British history. Our nation was enjoying real human rights long before the Strasbourg court was convened. And, crucially, those rights will only be weakened if an unelected, unaccountable elite holds sway over democratic institutions.",MPs want to look at introducing a 'democratic override' which would allow Parliament to reject harmful verdicts from Strasbourg .
