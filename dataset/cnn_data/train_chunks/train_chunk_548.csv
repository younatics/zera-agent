'There is still . time and hope…but I will need financial help in order to get the right . equipment, physio and resources I need to walk.' The trainee PE teacher has vowed not to be defeated  - and now plans to take part in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Brazil. He plans to achieve this by raising thousands of pounds for equipment for his battle . to walk again. He added: 'However to do this, I need equipment not found in hospitals and top of the range wheelchairs to use while training in and potentially being involved in Rio 2016 Paralympics.' One piece of equipment he needs is called an 'Easy Stand', which helps him stand on his feet and aims to connect the brain back to the legs. He also needs an FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) bike which helps to get the leg muscles working again. The determined student added: 'I realised that there are two things you can do. 'You can be depressed and you don’t get anywhere, or you can be focused and get on and do it.' To donate to Callum's fundraising, visit: callumhalltrust.com .

A plastic surgeon has called for a change to the way a German battalion does its rifle drill after its elite soldiers started developing breasts. Dozens of soldiers in the Wachbataillon unit (Guard Battalion), which performs drill displays at official events, have complained about over-developed breasts on their left-hand side because of the way they clasp their rifles. It is understood the repeated slapping of their rifles against their chests has stimulated hormones, causing a condition known as one-sided gynecomastia. Dozens of soldiers in Germany's Guard Battalion, which performs drill displays at official events, have complained about developing breasts on their left-hand side because of the way they clasp their rifles . It is understood the repeated slapping of their rifles against the same glands in their chests has stimulated hormones to cause a condition called one sided gynecomastia . The Wachbataillon is the Germany's elite drill unit. The Wachbataillon is the largest battalion of the German forces with about 1,800 soldiers, split between garrisons in Berlin and Siegburg. It is made up of nine companies and its primary responsibility is to perform the military honours for the German president, the German Chancellor, the Federal Minister of Defence and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr during state visits or similar occasions. Its soldiers are not allowed to grow beards or moustaches and until recently were only admitted if they were between 5 ft 10 in and 6 ft 4 in in height. The condition has been diagnosed in 74 per cent of the soldiers who have visited German army medics with symptoms. Professor Bjorn Krapohl, director of plastic surgery at the military hospital in Berlin, told the German Herald: 'There is a very significant link between the activity in the Guard . Battalion and the development of the breast on the left side. 'They need to change the way they drill. 'The constant slamming of the rifles against the left hand side of the chest is clearly a significant factor.' Official figures reveal that out of 211 male patients operated on for the condition, 35 were from the elite Wachbataillon. Military officials have said they will research the condition and adapt the battalion's drills if necessary. An army spokesman said: 'The affected soldiers are being medically supervised and treated individually.'

When Bernard Ambrose Dearsley drowned in 1943 after the ship he was serving on was torpedoed, he left a family secret which has taken 70 years to uncover. The British soldier had two wives, one in England and one in Scotland, who were totally unaware of each other's existence. But thanks to a chance encounter, the two branches of the family are set to be reunited this year, and have spoken of their joy at finding each other. Couple: When Bernard Dearsley, right, was presumed dead during the Second World War, he had for 17 years been married to Josephine, left . Bernard was presumed dead after his ship sank in the Mediterranean, leaving behind Josephine, his wife of 17 years. She lived with their three children, Ralph, Cyril and Leon, in Bexley, south London. However, when he was stationed in Dumfries in 1942, he secretly married a second wife, a Norwegian woman named Margaret. Just eight days before the attack which is believed to have killed the Army captain, Margaret gave birth to their son, Robert. Reunion: Bernard's granddaughter Sarah Wilkinson, pictured, is set to meet her secret Norwegian family for the first time ever . Bernard's second wife returned to Norway after the end of the Second World War, leaving two families completely unaware of each other. His descendants are now spread over 3,500 miles and three countries - but they will come together in Croydon in April for the first time. The first inkling the family members had of their secret relatives came when Robert's daughter-in-law found a character called Bernard Dearsley in a novel. She discovered that the book had been written by Bryan Dearsley, Leon's son and Bernard's grandson. Papers: The family had lots of information on the soldier, but did not know about his Norwegian wife . Tragic: The telegram which let Josephine know that her husband was missing at sea 70 years ago . Robert got in touch with his long-lost nephew, and also managed to contact Sarah Wilkinson, Ralph's daughter. The trio are planning to meet at Sarah's home in Croydon to uncover more of the mystery surrounding their late grandfather. Bryan, 50, who now lives in Canada, said he was overcome with emotion when he heard from his Norwegian uncle. 'I immediately responded, and shared what little I knew about my grandfather,' he said. 'We compared the few documents we had, including Bernard's birth certificate and notification of his death, and there was no doubt it was the same man.' Disaster: The soldier was on board the Benalbanach went it was torpedoed in the Mediterranean . And Sarah, 56, said there was no bad blood between the two family branches, despite her grandfather's well-kept secret. 'It is all history now,' she said. 'I think my grandfather did the right thing in marrying Margaret because she had fallen pregnant. Things were different back then. I think people would have expected it. 'My grandmother had a very interesting life so nothing surprises me, but no doubt it's a fascinating discovery. It has certainly made me more interested in my family tree.'","Bernard Dearsley drowned while at sea in 1943 leaving two wives behind .

Spectacular pictures of the Sun's 90-mile high solar eruptions have been captured in the highest ever resolution by NASA scientists. The images of the star's outer atmosphere provide evidence of magnetic 'braids' believed to heat this region up to four million degrees Celsius. They occur when small bundles of magnetic field become wrapped around each other because of the swirling of plasma on the Sun's surface. Highest ever resolution: This incredible image of the Sun's swirling outer atmosphere provide evidence of magnetic 'braids' believed to heat this region up to four million degrees Celsius . The new study published in Nature shows these dynamic 90-mile high structures provide the energy to heat the sun's corona. It is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms at work including a process known as electromagnetic waves that penetrate the plasma and transfer their energy to the constituent particles. But additional heating needed for corona to become superheated is caused by the unravelling and reformation of the magnetic braids. This theory is supported by the observations made by astrophysicist Dr Jonathan Cirtain, of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centre in Alabama, and colleagues. They used the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) launched on a rocket last July that obtained roughly five minutes of data before re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The extreme-ultraviolet telescope looks at coronal plasma with temperatures of around 1.5 million degrees Celsius - and has a resolution five times higher than previously achieved. Coronal braiding in high contrast: The 'braids' occur when small bundles of magnetic field become wrapped around each other because of the swirling of plasma on the Sun's surface . Dr Cirtain said the magnetic braids in an active region of the corona are seen to be reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to 4million degrees celsius. He said: 'It is now apparent there are at least two heating mechanisms in the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona'. 'Wave heating may be the prevalent mechanism in quiet solar periods and may contribute to heating the corona to 1.500,000 Celsius. A collage of solar images from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows how Nasa has captured the solar surface in different wavelengths . Previous images of the sun taken by the SDO craft have captured massive 'solar storms' and magnetic activity on the solar surface . 'The active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000-4,000,000 C - this heat has been theoretically proposed to come from the reconnection and unravelling of magnetic 'braids'. 'Here we report observations of magnetic braids in a coronal active region that are reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy to heat the structures to about 4,000,000C. 'Although our 5-minute observations cannot unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions, the energy available from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed heating.' The launch of the Hi-C sounding rocket: Researchers used the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) launched last July that obtained roughly five minutes of data before re-entering Earth's atmosphere . Space scientist Professor Peter Cargill, of Imperial College London, reviewed the study for the journal and said there is 'a wealth of data' to be analysed even from five minutes of observations. He said: 'The next stage is securing Hi-C, or an instrument with similar or improved performance, on an orbiting spacecraft. 'This spacecraft must also carry a modern extreme-ultraviolet spectrometer - both to complement Hi-C and to provide fundamental plasma measurements of density, temperature, velocities and small-scale turbulence - as well as an instrument capable of measuring signatures of energetic particles, which are known to be a significant product of the magnetic-reconnection process. 'Only with such complete instrumentation can a proper understanding of coronal structures be attained.'","Pictures provide evidence of magnetic 'braids' that play a key role in heating the Sun's atmosphere .

Spain's unemployment rate has soared to record levels with a shocking 55 per cent of young people now out of work and experts warning worse is to come. The jobless total rose to 26 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, equivalent to 5.97 million people according to the National Statistics Institute and up from 25 per cent in the previous quarter. It is the highest level since measurements began in the 1970s as a prolonged recession and deep spending cuts left almost six million people out of work at the end of last year. Crisis: A man waits outside a Madrid employment office. Latest figures reveal Spanish unemployment has reached an all-time high . Over past 12 months 691,700 more people have fallen out of work, the institute said, adding that there were now 1.8 million households in which no one was employed. 'We haven't seen the bottom yet and employment will continue falling in the first quarter,' said Citigroup strategist Jose Luis Martinez. Spain sank into its second recession since 2009 at the end of 2011 after a burst housing bubble left millions of low-skilled laborers out of work and sliding private and business sentiment gutted consumer spending and imports. Unemployment in Spain now stands at a record 26 per cent, higher than any other EU country . Efforts by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government to control one of the euro zone's largest deficits through billions of euros of spending cuts and tax hikes have fueled general malaise, further hampering demand. When Rajoy took office in late 2011 there were 5.27 million jobless in Spain. The economic downturn put an average of 1,900 out of work every day through 2012 and with the recession expected to last at least until the end of 2013, net job creation is unlikely this year. Sorry scene: Over the year, 691,700 more Spanish people lost their jobs, meaning there are now 1.8 million households in which no one was employed . Joblessness has been particularly acute for Spain's youth, with 60 percent of people under the age of 25 unemployed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, the economy shrank at its fastest pace since the recession began, the Bank of Spain said on Wednesday, dragged down by a steep drop in private consumption due in part to a September VAT hike and public wage cuts. Spain is in the throes of its second recession in just over three years following the collapse of its once-booming real estate sector in 2008. Battling to reduce a swollen deficit and avoid a bailout, the year-old conservative government has brought major financial and labor reforms and applied severe cutbacks in wages and spending but so far the economy has shown few signs of recovery. The austerity measures are aimed at lowering the deficit, but are hurting the economy in the short-term, while the reforms will only help growth in the longer-term. That means the economy will suffer more before it recovers. The central bank this week estimated that the recession deepened in the fourth quarter of last year, the economy shrinking by 0.6 percent compared with the previous three-month period. It was the sixth consecutive quarterly contraction. The economy contracted by 0.4 percent in the third quarter. The bank estimated economic activity was down 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period and down 1.3 percent for the whole of 2012. The statistics institute will announce official economic growth figures on Jan. 30, while Europe's main statistics office Eurostat unveils its estimate on Feb. 14.","5.97 million without jobs following prolonged recession and spending cuts .

Ministers should stop promising that controversial road-building and high speed rail schemes will give economic boosts to Britain unless they can present real ‘evidence’ to back up their claims, the UK’s  top transport planners said today. Slashing journey times on the HS2 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the UK economy on the scale ministers were pledging, they say. And they criticised the Treasury for ‘ducking the issue’ of how improvements to the transport system should be paid for – especially the idea of controversial ‘pay-as-you-drive’ road pricing. Slashing journey times on the HS2 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the UK economy on the scale ministers were pledging, it has been claimed . The broadside came in a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin from 32 leading professors of transport  and  the two major professional bodies which together represent more than 3,000 UK  transport planners. The letter to the Transport secretary signed by the 32 top academics says: ’Operating within significant  fiscal constraint, the  Department for Transport is seeking  to stimulate economic recovery, tackle climate change and improve the well-being of the population.’ But it added: ’However, we are concerned that a perception of the economic imperative is leading to a series of  important decisions on all of the major transport modes being taken in the absence  of a coherent and integrated national policy framework.’ While ministers push transport investment as a  way of stimulating economic growth, the professors insist: ‘The evidence base is not  as strong as you, or we , might wish. It to be.’ On road building they note: ’Our cities are simply not equipped to  take further growth in  road traffic and the benefits of  faster journey times on the strategic network risk being  lost in the greater congestion on local  urban roads where the majority of journeys are undertaken.’’ The broadside came in a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin from 32 leading professors of transport . The letter carries the support of the Transport Planning Society and  the Royal Town Planning Institute which together cover the majority of the UK’s  3,000 town planners. Keith Buchan, chairman of the Transport Planning Society (TPS) , under whose umbrella the letter was sent  cited the  controversial HS2 high speed line from London to the Midlands and the North said ministers had promised economic benefits – from faster journey times to  greater investment in business – he said: ’The jury is still out on HS2.’. On building more roads he added :’We do not want to see the UK slipping back into the dead end of  trying to build our way out of congestion. ‘Ministers have to do their  proper homework. The Government’s sums need to be tested more rigorously.’ And on funding such projects it notes: ’No progress has  been made in the debate on  how we should pay for  improvements to the  transport system. ‘Understandably perhaps,  your predecessors and the Treasury have ducked  the issue.’ The planners say they support controversial pay-as-you drive road pricing but accept there is little or no public support, even though revenues from road tax are set to fall considerably as cars become cleaner:’There is a need to find a new way of charging for  motoring.’ The letter echoes a similar one sent in 2002 to then Labour Transport Secretary Alistair Darling in which transport planners and academics  warned ministers of their ‘unrealistic expectations’ .","32 leading professors said the Treasury was ducking the issue of how improvements to the transport system should be paid for .

"PUBLISHED: . 06:20 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:30 EST, 23 January 2013 . Benjamin Netanyahu was today scrabbling to cling to power after his alliance won a narrow victory in Israeli elections. The Prime Minister vowed to seek a 'broad coalition' after the surprise result which saw his right-wing alliance . Likud-Beiteinu lose 11 seats. It is still the biggest party in the new parliament with 31 of 120 seats but the win may not be enough for hardliner Netanyahu to keep his position. The new centrist Yesh Atid (There is a Future) party, led by television personality Yair Lapid, won a surprising 19 seats, leaving Lapid a key person for Netanyahu to woo in coalition negotiations. Narrow victory: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been expected to sweep back into power . The results from Tuesday's elections defied forecasts that Israel's next government would veer sharply to the right as the country faces mounting international isolation, growing economic problems and regional turbulence. Lapid has said he would only join a . government committed to sweeping economic changes and a serious push to . resume peace talks with the Palestinians, which have languished . throughout Netanyahu's four-year tenure. As the results were announced Netanyahu, who called . early elections three months ago expecting easy victory, vowed to form as broad a coalition as . possible. He said the next government would be . built on principles that included reforming the contentious system of . granting draft exemptions to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men and the 'responsible' pursuit of a 'genuine peace' with the Palestinians. Netanyahu told Lapid, who now runs the second-largest party: 'We have the opportunity to do . great things together.' Key figure in coalition wrangling: Yair Lapid, of Yesh Atid . Commentators said that while a broad coalition offered unexpected movement on peace efforts, a coalition joining parties with dramatically divergent views on peacemaking, the economy and the military draft could just as easily be headed for gridlock - and may not last long. Under Israel's parliamentary system, voters cast ballots for parties, not individual candidates. Because no party throughout Israel's 64-year history has ever won an outright majority of parliamentary seats, the country has always been governed by coalitions. Traditionally, the party that wins the largest number of seats is given the first chance to form a governing alliance in negotiations that center around promising Cabinet posts and policy concessions. If those negotiations are successful, the leader of that party becomes prime minister. If not, the task falls to a smaller faction. Netanyahu said: ''I call on the leaders of the political establishment to work with me together, to the best of their ability to form as broad a government as possible that will contain moderate forces from the left and right, the right and the left, so that we will truly be able to bring about real change.' But political experts said forming a broad coalition would not be easy, and would force Netanyahu to make some difficult decisions. Lapid said last week that he would not be a 'fig leaf' for a hard-line agenda on peacemaking. A senior member of his party said Yesh Atid would not join unless the government pledged to begin drafting the ultra-Orthodox into the military, lowered the country's high cost of living, and returned to peace talks. Surprise results: voters, shown here, in this week's elections voted Netanyahu back in but with fewer seats . Good result: Supporters of Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party celebrate at their headquarters in Tel Aviv . Yaakov Peri said: 'We have red lines. We won't cross those red lines, even if it will cost us sitting in the opposition.' Labour, who won 15 seats, making them the third-biggest party, said failed coalition attempts might result in the end of a Netanyahu-led coaltion. Its leader Shelly Yachimovich said: 'There is no doubt we are watching a political drama unfold before our eyes … . 'There is a high chance of a dramatic change, and of the end of the Netanyahu coalition.' The far-right Jewish Home party, led by Naftali Bennett, won 11 or 12 seats, pending final confirmation, making it one of the largest parties in the Knesset. Its leader Naftali Bennett said: 'Today we set up a new home that knows how to protect its residents not only with concrete but with martial prowess and power. 'Our enemies will know that you do not mess with Israel.' The election results surprised Israelis, following recent opinion polls forecasting a more solid hard-line majority and a weaker showing by centrists. Naftali Bennett, leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, greets supporters and activists at a post-election rally . Members of Habayit Hayehudi (The Jewish Home) party react to the announcement of early projections on the election results . Netanyahu may have suffered because of his close ties to the ultra-Orthodox, and perhaps from complacency. Many voters chose smaller parties, believing a Netanyahu victory was assured. Tensions with the United States, Israel's most important ally, also may have helped the shift to Lapid. President Barack Obama was quoted last week as saying that Netanyahu was undermining Israel's own interests by continuing to build Jewish settlements on occupied lands the Palestinians want for a future state. Netanyahu has won praise at home for drawing the world's attention to Iran's suspect nuclear programme and for keeping the economy on solid ground at a time of global turmoil. But he has repeatedly clashed with allies over his handling of the peace process, which has stalled over the issue of Israel construction in Jewish settlements in the war-won West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want Netanyahu to halt all settlement construction, but he says talks must start without preconditions and notes a 10-month slowdown he imposed earlier in his term did not encourage meaningful negotiations. On Wednesday, the Obama administration said the US approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would not change, regardless of the Israeli election results. 'We will continue to make clear that only through direct negotiations can the Palestinians and the Israelis ... achieve the peace they both deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney. The Palestinians viewed the election results grimly. Mohammed Ishtayeh, a senior advisor to President Mahmoud Abbas, said: 'If he brings Lapid into his government, this would improve the image of the Netanyahu government in the eyes of the world. 'But it won't make him stop building settlements, particularly in east Jerusalem.'","Right-wing Likud-Beiteinu still biggest party but lost 11 of its 42 seats .

Recovered: Le Jardin by Henri Matisse was stolen from the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden, 25 years ago . A British art sleuth has recovered a painting by French artist Matisse that was stolen from a Swedish museum 25 years ago. Matisse's 'Le Jardin', valued at about 6 million crowns (£563,700), was recovered by Christopher Marinello, an art recovery specialist at the Art Loss Register in London. 'It is fantastic that the painting has turned up again,' said Kristin Ek, spokesman for the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. 'It was stolen so long ago that really we had almost given up hope.' The painting was stolen in May 1987 . when a thief used a sledgehammer to smash his way into the museum in a . night-time raid, escaping with the canvas moments before security . arrived. The theft was . reported to both Interpol and the Art Loss Register (ALR), the world's . largest international private database of stolen, missing and looted . artwork. According to . reports at the time, several attempts were made to ransom the painting . of sell it back to the museum, but after curators refused to hand over . cash the trail went cold for the next two decades. The . painting was recovered after an art dealer in Britain checked with the . ALR's register before agreeing to handle the Matisse. Once the match had been confirmed, Mr Marinello, executive director at the ALR, negotiated its safe return. 'We are happy the painting seems to be okay and in good condition,' said Miss Ek. 'It was a good start to the New Year.' Mr Marinello would not give details of how he got hold of the Matisse. 'No . arms were broken and no payments were made,' he said, adding the . painting would be returned to the museum through Sweden's ministry of . culture. Mr Marinello also . hailed Lars Nittive, the director of the Moderna Museet in 1987, who . told reporters at the time the painting was too well known to sell on . the open market. 'I commend . the Museum for not giving in to ransom demands a quarter century ago,' he said. 'Stolen artwork has no real value in the legitimate marketplace . and will eventually resurface... it's just a matter of waiting it out.' Rightful home: The painting was stolen from the . Moderna Museet in May 1987 when a thief used a smashed . his way into the museum in a nighttime raid, escaping moments with the canvas moments before security arrived . The Art Loss Register claims to be the world’s largest private database of lost and stolen art, antiques and collectables. Art collectors, museums and galleries register the works in their possession with the ALR, and it works in concert with law enforcement agencies to find and recover any that are lost and stolen. It also offers art dealers a due diligence service which allows them to check whether works they have been asked to handle are in fact stolen. In recent years, the service has been extended to negotiate compensation to the victims of art theft and a legitimising of current ownership. The current ALR, in operation since 1991, is based on the The International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR), a not-for-profit organisation based in New York that began its art theft archive in 1976. Its founding shareholders included major businesses from the insurance industry and art market. Since beginning its operations, the ALR has recovered more than £160million worth of stolen items. The Moderna Museet is still missing a painting by Georges Braque, after a theft in 1993. Stolen art is a lucrative industry with $6-7billion worth of thefts every year, and the current global economic downturn has led to a surge in crimes, according to Mr Marinello. Last year, for example, thieves made . off with paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Monet and other prominent modern . artists from Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum worth tens of millions of . pounds. If thieves cannot collect a ransom from insurers or owners, the art is sold on the black market, often for a fraction of its real worth, or even exchanged for drugs or guns. Over the past seven years, Mr Marinello has been responsible for recovering or negotiating settlements in art theft or title dispute cases worth over £160million. Of the 360,000 objects remaining on the ALR's database, Mr Marinello said there were several he particularly wanted to find. The first is a hoard including paintings by Vermeer, Degas and Rembrandt worth £185million stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990. There is a £3million reward for the paintings. 'Then there is a Rafael stolen by the Nazis in WWII that is pretty nice,' he said. Mr Marinello, however, will have his work cut out. By his admission, only 5-10 per cent of stolen art is ever recovered.","A thief took Le Jardin from the Moderna Museet in Stockholm after smashing his way in with a sledgehammer in May 1987 .

Jamarcus Allen, remembered as an energetic boy who loved superheroes like Spider-man and Batman, first found his father Terrance's pistol last week, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. It was usually hidden in the bathroom of their family home on McKinley Avenue but Jamarcus's older brother Tyree, 18, discovered him playing with it.

The pair were returning from dropping off Tyree at school when it appears Jamarcus accidentally shot himself in the head. Witnesses told the local paper a single bullet hole was visible in the car roof above the passenger seat as well as a pool of blood in the foot-well. Jamarcus was rushed to Akron Children's Hospital but died of his injuries. 48-year-old Allen has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter, felony child endangering, having weapons under disability and tampering with evidence.

A father who lived with a rare disease for more than 40 years without realising was finally diagnosed after a doctor saw him tie his shoelaces. Butcher Ian Redfern was with his daughter Evie, aged six, at The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield, for treatment for her condition Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). Evie was diagnosed with EDS when she was three-years-old - which causes her to bruise and damage her skin easily. Ian Redfern with the shoes that meant he was diagnosed with the same condition as his daughter Evie. Pictured with his partner Nicola Clay . Mr Redfern, 45, was with his daughter for this trip to the hospital when her doctor noticed something unusual about the way he bent over to do his laces - and realised he was suffering from the same condition. Ian had never shown any sign he might carry the hereditary genetic condition until Evie’s doctor, Glenda Sobey, spotted him bending his wrists at an odd angle. Now Ian is hoping highlight the condition after revealing how he was diagnosed for first time. Ian, from Sheffield, said: 'I don’t know what the doctor saw, she just realised I had the same condition as Evie. 'In my life EDS hasn’t been a problem as I didn’t even know I had it, but that’s the thing with the condition it effects different people different ways, there could be lots of people who don’t know they have it. 'We were so relieved when Evie was diagnosed as we knew there was something wrong with her, it was so strange to see the way her skin broke when she was bumped. 'I never expected the doctor to say I had the condition too, I had no clue, it was just so strange especially because Evie’s symptoms were so severe. 'We just see EDS as normal life now where we have to take extra precautions. Although I can’t help but feel responsible for Evie having the condition, in a way it’s nice that we can share it and I can support her through it.' Ian with his daughter and Dr Sobey who diagnosed him after she noticed his wrists were bent at an odd angle . There are several types of EDS which affect just one in 5,000 people. It is a genetic connective tissue condition caused by a defect in the protein collagen, the main building block of the body which provides strength and support. As well as the classic EDS symptoms which Evie has, the disease also commonly causes hyper-mobility, where joint and ligaments are lax. Dr Sobey, lead clinician for EDS at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, spotted Ian tying his shoelaces, noticing his hyper mobility and ran tests. She said: 'It is so rare for someone to live with Classical EDS and not know, the condition is usually diagnosed in early childhood. 'Because the condition is hereditary we always test parents to see if they carry the gene, but I have never seen a case like this before where a parent had Classical EDS but didn’t know. 'There is no cure for EDS but lots of preventions which we put in place. Evie wears special tights to school to protect her legs and because the condition can cause various problems Ian now has annual heart checks.' Dr Sobey and her team of seven run the Sheffield EDS National Diagnostic Service and see patients from across the north of England and Scotland. The team recently ran an EDS awareness day where Evie and Ian met other EDS patients, had specialist assessments and group education sessions. Evie said: 'I really enjoyed the day because I got to meet other children with EDS. Where I live it’s only me and dad so it has been good to see other children like me.' The national EDS service at The Children’s Hospital, Sheffield was set up in 2009 and is asked to see around 200 new patients every year. The centre is the only place in the country with labs where the faulty EDS gene can be detected. Before the service in Sheffield began, samples had to be sent to labs in parts of Europe and America.

Tribunal: Sarah Persad was 'guilty of worse conduct' than the male workers she accused of harassment . A 39-year-old female IT worker who claimed she had to endure an 'offensive and sexualised culture' in the office has had her case dismissed at an employment tribunal. Sarah Persad took her ex-employer Benenden Hospital Trust, in Kent, to Ashford Employment Tribunal for sexual harassment and breach of equal pay laws. Mrs Persad said she was told 'not to be too sensitive and just get on with it' when she complained to the Trust. But her formal grievance was rejected with bosses finding that what she considered to be 'sexually explicit attention and rumours' was no more than 'banter'. She resigned in March last year and made a claim with the employment tribunal that she had been bombarded with lewd jokes, sexual invitations and talk of a sexual nature. She accused one colleague of making remarks about his vasectomy and ejaculation and another of demanding that she made the coffee. The Trust strenuously denied her claims throughout and insisted that she was a willing participant in a culture of banter. During the tribunal proceedings it was revealed that Mrs Persad had sent emails making sexual comments and including images of semi-naked men and women in sexual poses to the male colleagues she alleged were guilty of sexually harassing her. Mrs Persad insisted she had stopped sending such emails by August 2009. The married mother-of-three withdrew her claims on November 19 and the Trust applied for costs. In a separate, costs order hearing, employment judge Mr S G Vowles found that her claim of sexual harassment was 'untenable because she herself was a willing participant and clearly led and encouraged such conduct'. It added: 'Indeed she was guilty of similar and worse conduct.' It was ruled at the costs hearing that this evidence, once disclosed to her, made her continued pursuit of sexual harassment allegations 'unreasonable', concluding she was 'guilty of similar and worse conduct.' Hearings: Mrs Persad must pay former employer Benenden Hospital Trust 40 per cent towards their legal costs . It was also ruled her complaint of indirect sex discrimination had 'no foundation.' Her allegation of unequal pay was . also judged to be 'misconceived'  and based upon a 'wholly unrealistic' job evaluation review conducted by herself, which, if accepted, would . have moved her from being the most junior member of the IT team to being . its director.

It's not the most complex of artistic creations and it certainly doesn't resemble anything British. But artist Damien Hirst has decorated this year's Brit Award trophy with multicoloured polka dots. Superseding the likes of Dame Vivienne Westwood and Sir Peter Blake, he has replaced the Union Jack colours with his signature design. Damien Hirst's artistic creation, left, inspired by his signature design of polka dots and right, the 'blank canvas' trophy that has been awarded to winners in previous years . He is the third creative icon to be asked to stylise the trophy, adding the dots which he has used in many of his well-known artworks. His spots have been applied to numerous canvases and even a car over the years. Hirst said he had been 'honoured' to be asked to give the trophy a makeover. 'It has become such an iconic award, I love the Brits,' he said. The award has been unveiled ahead of tonight's announcement of the Brits shortlists. Tom Odell, the winner of this year's . critics' choice prize, will get his hands on the trophy first when the . 2012 winner Emeli Sande hands over the prize at the launch in London's . Savoy Hotel tonight. Brits chairman David Joseph said: 'Damien is truly one of the most important British artists and his . reimagining of the statue will make winning a 2013 Brits an even more . special proposition.' Hirst pictured left and Sir Peter Blake, right, with his red, white and blue Brit Awards trophy from last year . Last year Sir Blake based the trophy on the three colours of the Union Jack flag, and his artistic creation echoed the swinging sixties, the decade when he first rose to prominence. It was the second year the Brits asked a British creative icon to style the blank canvas trophy, following Dame Vivienne Westwood's success the previous year. Dame Vivienne . draped the statue in a Union Jack, and the trophy had the phrase 'Stop! Climate Change' at the bottom, flagging up the environmental campaign . for which the designer is a tireless campaginer. Hirst's . exhibition at Tate Modern last year was the most popular solo show ever . staged at the gallery, attracting around 463,000 visitors, and helping . the venue to record numbers through its doors. Theme: Damien Hirst's artworks on sale in the Tate Modern shop, including a skateboard decorated in multicoloured polka dots . The gallery on London's Southbank recorded a 9.5per cent increase in visitor numbers, making 2012 the busiest year in its history with a record-breaking 5.3 million people walking through its doors. The Hirst exhibition, which ran from April to early September, featured the artist's diamond-encrusted human skull For The Love Of God,  a rotting cow's head and a shark suspended in formaldehyde. Other highlights of the show, seen by an average of almost 3,000 visitors a day, were A Thousand Years 1990 where flies emerge from maggots, eat from a rotting cow's head and die, and The Physical Impossibility Of Death In The Mind Of Someone Living where a shark is suspended in formaldehyde. Around 1.5 million people visited Tate Britain in Pimlico, central London over the same period, up 4.3per cent on 2011.

"By . Amanda Platell . PUBLISHED: . 18:09 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:36 EST, 25 January 2013 . When I was 16 and had my first proper boyfriend, Derek, my dad drove me to a weekend sleepover party out in the Australian countryside, some 200 miles away. The other girls were out walking when we arrived, so we sat in the twilight under the gum trees and he built a fire while we waited. Dad kept prodding the flames and I could see he had something on his mind — probably the enormous love bites Derek had branded on my neck. When he finally spoke, it was to dole out the best advice I ever received. Amanda Platell said her father Frank, pictured together in 2006, shaped her belief in herself and gave her the confidence to pursue a career in Fleet Street . He said I had to make my own decisions, but that my body was precious and should not be handed over casually. He told me that unless a girl respected herself, no boy or man would ever respect her. I told him that lots of the girls were sleeping with their boyfriends and he replied: ‘Mandy Jane Platell, you are not just any girl.’ That was pretty much his mantra. He told me I was beautiful, when a blind man could see I wasn’t. He told me I was clever and could do anything if I set my mind to it, even though there were far smarter girls than me at school. He told me I was equal to any person, boy or girl, rich or poor, and the only limits in my life would be the ones I set myself. I believed him, and his words moulded my character and changed the course of my life — for there is no more formative relationship for a woman than the one she has with her father. It defines our view of men, and of ourselves. I couldn’t help but remember Dad’s inspirational pep talks this week, as I read the Mail’s serialisation of psychologist Steve Biddulph’s new book, Raising Girls. Amanda Platell said her father's belief means she will walk out of a relationship if a man does not treat her well enough . He argues that a father’s love will set up his daughter for life, and claims that if fathers fail to raise their daughters properly, they will be cast adrift in the modern world — a world where girls are vulnerable to unhappiness, stress, abusive relationships, drugs and teenage pregnancy. My own dad somehow instinctively knew all this. He knew that a girl’s self-respect and self-esteem comes from her father’s love. He showered me with affection, taught me to be independent and encouraged me to be as boisterous as my brothers, Cameron and Michael. In short, he was the perfect father. Yet, while Biddulph was correct to point out the terrible effects of bad fathers on girls, he neglected to mention the downside of having a wonderful dad — that a girl can spend the rest of her life searching in vain for a man who measures up to him. I, 55 years old and single (but dating) should know. The man I married (and then divorced), and the two men I was engaged to, all disappointed me: by not treating me as well as my dad treats my mum, and has always treated me. Steve Biddulph says that if a father asks for and listens to his daughter’s views and opinions from an early age, she’ll develop the sense that she’s both intelligent and worthwhile. Dad always asked me what I thought about things. If I ever gave the grumpy teenage response ‘who cares?’ he would tell me to use my brain, not to be lazy. That was a sin in our house. It was also my dad who gave me the self-confidence not to settle for second best when it came to men. So when I found my husband was cheating on me, just a few years after our wedding, I had no qualms about divorcing him. I was a self-reliant, successful journalist by this point — another thing which can be traced back to my dad. When I was about ten, Mum went back to work to help with our school fees. It was clear we were struggling financially. Squeezed between my two burly brothers in the back of the car, I said I could move to the local school as it didn’t matter what education I got, I’d just get married and some man would look after me. I’ve never seen my father so angry. He slammed the brakes and said: ‘Never, ever say that again. You are equal to the boys in every way.’ Those words were seared on to my conscience and I remembered them many times as I carved out a career on male-dominated Fleet Street in the Eighties. Yet while I love my career, earning my own living and being independent, I’m sure this has made some men I’ve dated feel insecure. It wasn’t that I didn’t need them, it’s just that they didn’t feel I did. Add to this the financial security a career has given me, and it’s little wonder that I’ve left relationships when the men I was involved with didn’t treat me as well as my father did — with constant courtesy, love, respect and playfulness. My dad taught me that romance is important and costs nothing. He would often arrive home with a bunch of roses for Mum that he’d picked from our neighbour’s gardens on his way back from the bus stop. He’ll turn 87 this year, and Mum 85 — yet he still says she’s the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world. He doesn’t see the wrinkles, just laughter lines. ‘It’s in her eyes,’ he still says, ‘that’s where beauty lies.’ When I was growing up, my dad always insisted that the way a boy dresses is a sign of his respect for you. Pity the poor hapless chap who turned up at our front door in surf shorts and a vest to take me out and was told to come back when he was dressed properly. My father never raised his hand to my mother, nor his voice, and thereby set a standard by which I would judge other men. About a year into a relationship at university, a boyfriend of mine got drunk, became abusive and called me a ‘f***ing bitch’, among other things. Of course, he was sorry afterwards, but I knew from what Dad had taught me that it was wrong and that the relationship had to end. If he didn’t respect me, how could I respect myself? This was a message Dad had hammered home to me frequently during my teenage years. On one memorable trip, he got hold of a campervan and the two of us travelled south to beautiful beaches, listening to Jimi Hendrix and Neil Young, chatting away in the car about everything and nothing — but mostly about boys. It was on one of these trips, sitting outside in the campsite heating up a tin of braised steak and onions over an open fire, that I told him my boyfriend, Craig, was going to dump me if I didn’t have sex with him. I was 17. I told him I didn’t feel ready and we talked about that. Dad reminded me again that my body was precious. He told me that if Craig really loved me he would wait. He didn’t. Amanda Platell parents Frank and Norma meeting The Queen in Perth, Australia. She said her father still says his wife is the most beautiful woman in the world . I thought of Dad’s wise advice again when I read Steve Biddulph warning that many fathers distance themselves from their daughters when they reach puberty, handing responsibility for girls’ emotional well-being to their mothers. That’s a mistake my dad never made and they were the years that truly cemented our relationship. While he was open with his emotions when I was growing up, my dad is a real man’s man. I have only ever seen him cry three times: when his mother died, when my brother died, and in the car on the way to my wedding. On that day, they were not tears of sadness but of passage. He knew he was handing over his beloved daughter to another man and an uncertain future. Even when my marriage failed, my father was a constant  source of comfort. He never lectured me — he only offered words of consolation. As an adult, I’ve stayed incredibly close to Dad, despite living on the other side of the world. Some men I’ve been with — mostly the insecure ones — resent the closeness we still have, as if they must be the only man in my life. Having such a great dad may have been a hindrance to my romantic happiness — but the other thing Dad taught me is optimism. That the glass isn’t just half full, it’s overflowing. And that’s how I see the future. I haven’t found Mr Right yet, and am reluctant to settle for Mr Right Now, but I’m still looking and hoping. Thanks Dad.",Amanda Platell says her father Frank's encouragement gave her the confidence to pursue her career and walk out of bad relationships .

A hospital allowed a pregnant woman to take her pet dog into a maternity ward so it could watch her give birth. Managers justified the extraordinary action by saying that Barney, who is believed to be a Labrador, was a certified 'therapy dog' and had a 'calming presence'. But the unusual presence on the labour ward in Bristol was criticised amid claims that no special cleaning took place after the two-hour birth. Fury: St Michael's Hospital in Bristol allowed a pregnant woman to bring a dog into the maternity unit to watch her give birth . The dog is said to have been allowed entry to the maternity ward after his owner submitted a form requesting he attended the birth at St Michael's Hospital. Managers said Barney regularly visits wards to comfort patients in his role as a therapy dog. 'Calming': The dog, a labrador similar to this one, is a certified 'therapy dog' according to St Michael's Hospital (file picture) But a source told the Sun: 'Nurses and doctors were appalled but someone at the hospital had given the woman permission so the dog stayed on the labour ward. 'This is the first time any of the hospital’s staff can remember such a thing happening. 'They’re now worried that other women will be allowed to do the same because a precedent has been set.' Managers insisted that approval had been sought from infection control experts and that a thorough cleaning was done after the birth. Sarah Windfield, head of midwifery at the hospital, said: ‘Barney is a certified Pets as Therapy dog and with his owner regularly attends to patients in hospital. 'PAT dogs are examined and passed on health, temperament, suitability and stability grounds and patients can benefit from their calming presence. ‘His owner made the request to us for Barney to be present when she gave birth as a therapy dog, not as a pet. 'Having first sought the approval of our infection control expert, we agreed to Barney sitting nearby in the delivery room.’ It is understood that Barney stayed for the birth, along with the woman's partner and a midwife, before the family took their newborn child home.","St Michael's Hospital in Bristol said the dog had a 'calming presence'

A former senior Army female officer has said that women soldiers should not be allowed to fight on the front line because they are not fit enough. Major Judith Webb also said that the prospect of women dying in direct combat would be too shocking for the public to handle. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'By opening it up to women, are women shooting themselves in the foot? 'Because they are not going to be able to meet those standards. Fitness worries: Women make up around 12 per cent of officers in the British Armed Forces and 9 per cent of other ranks, but former Army major Judith Webb doesn't believe they should fight on the front line (file picture) Opposition: Judith Webb, pictured left in her days as an Army Major, says that women are not up to the exacting physical standards of front line warfare. MP John Baron, right, says men are more physically suited to the role . 'The British public still do not accept women should be in such roles. Major Webb, who was the first woman to lead an all-male field force, told the programme that the standards of fitness expected of new recruits had already been lowered to allow more women into the Army. She added that expected standards for men were likely to fall further in order to meet what women can do. Although she doesn't believe that women should serve in combat roles, Major Webb, formerly of the 28th Signal Regiment in Germany and Cyprus, believes that women are suitable for driving or medic roles on the front line after they proved their worth in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Her comments came after the United States Government yesterday lifted a ban on women soldiers serving on the front line. Strong views: Shadow Defence Minister Jim Murphy has called for a rethink of policy which stops women soldiers fighting on the front line . Defence Secretary Leon Panetta and General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that anyone qualified should get the right to fight regardless of their sex. The move could open 237,000 roles to women. But the Ministry of Defence said yesterday that it has no plans to follow America's lead and review its own policy on women soldiers from the UK fighting on the front line. Conservative MP and former captain in the Royal Fusiliers John Baron said that men are perhaps better suited to combat roles than women physically. Tory MP Patrick mercer added that women serving on the front line is not practical. But Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy urged the Government to review its policy on women’s role in warfare. The US decision is ‘highly likely’ to influence policy here, a defence source told The Times. Mr Murphy told the newspaper: ‘Women are already making an important contribution on the front line, including in Afghanistan. Time has now come to look again at the role of women in close combat. ‘The US Government decision that women can be deployed in combat has implications for all forces. We in Britain must maximise everyone’s talent and courage for our military and so should look again at UK policy.’ The policy which currently prevents women from applying for certain frontline jobs must be reviewed within the next four years. Women across the Armed Forces already work on the front line as medics, intelligence officers and fighter pilots, among other roles. Change: US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, left, and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Martin Dempsey pictured lifting a ban on women soldiers heading to front line warfare . Service: US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta acknowledged that 152 US women had died in Iraq and Afghanistan (file picture) They will also soon be able to serve on submarines. A 2010 review of women’s role in combat concluded that inserting women into small frontline units who spend weeks in enemy territory, sleeping and eating together in the field, would not be a wise move. The US decision to create greater equality was signed by outgoing Defence Secretary Leon Panetta on Wednesday, who acknowledged that 152 US women had died in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said: ‘They serve, they’re wounded, and they die right next to each other.

These incredible portraits were created . by an artist who fired bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets . of aluminium at point blank range. Walton Creel began using the innovative technique to shoot images of various animals but has now decided to make portraits of people which he says requires more detail, and skill. His work involves painting 4ft by 4ft sheets of . aluminium white and taking them into the forest near his home, where he . fires up to 3,500 bullets through them. Skill: Walton Creel came up with his innovative style of art when he created . images of various animals with his gun shots - but now shoots portraits of people . Innovative: Mr Creel makes the pictures (right) by firing bullets from a .22 calibre rifle through sheets of aluminium at point blank range (left) Talent: The artist's work - including this picture of a rabbit - requires a large amount of preparation and concentration . Imaginative: Mr Creel said he came up with the unusual style of art after growing up around guns in his native Alabama . The holes create an outline of the person and the surrounding paint peels off to form a dot-to-dot style picture. He uses a smaller rifle in some areas of his work to add definition. Mr Creel originally fired his rifle at canvas but found the bullets were too destructive as they tore it to shreds. However, . he now faces the danger of a richochet or bullet malfunction when . standing immediately in front of the reinforced aluminium. Owl: Mr Creel said he uses the gun 'less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images' The 38-year-old says his artwork 'deweaponises' the gun he received from his dad as a Christmas present aged 15. The self-taught artist was inspired by the hunting and gun culture in his home town of Birmingham, Alabama, United States. Creel said: 'I grew up in the south-eastern US where the culture is tied to guns and outdoor sports in general. 'I wanted to incorporate guns into my art for quite a while, but was never quite happy with any of my ideas. 'I use the gun less as a rifle and more as a power tool to systematically create points in my images.' On average each portrait takes around 12 hours to complete, with preparation and design work adding extra time. The artist plans to design and create a further eight portraits which will then feature at an exhibition once completed. He . added: 'The main difference in the people and animals images is we can . recognise individual humans whereas animals are more generic. 'With a specific person I have to make sure the image actually captures my subject's likeness. I end up spending a lot of time on subtle details that may only consist . of three or four bullet holes to make sure everything is right.' Wren: Look closely and you can see the hundreds of bullet holes needed to create this stunning image of a bird . Beauty: Mr Creel started off by firing at canvas, but found the bullets simply shredded the material so he turned to metal instead.

Aside from spotting the odd dirty pigeon, living in the city is far from an ornithologist's dream. But town-dwelling nature lovers can now bring a touch of the countryside to their homes thanks to an new rooftop box bird box. Designer Klaas Kuiken, 28, made the box from terracotta clay so that it blends into a regular tile when it goes on the tiles of a house. Ornithologist's dream: Klaas Kuiken's tile bird house is made from terracotta so that it blends in with city dweller's roofs . It may not look like the most comfortable nesting spot for a bird, but hidden underneath the tile is a cosy basket that is strong enough to stop the bird getting through into the roof. Mr Kuikenwas inspired to create his innovative bird box to encourage more birds into urban areas after reading that sparrow numbers were steadily decreasing. Although originally designed for sparrows, other birds have been known to use the boxes since bird lovers started snapping up the special tiles. The bird box is attached to the tile using strong glue which is tough enough to resist extreme temperatures and strong winds. Mr Kuiken, from Sneek, in Holland, said: 'I spent some time trying to figure out a solution to this problem. 'After a little bit of research I discovered the sparrow often finds it difficult to find a nesting spot. 'This is because its old favourite spot tucked in under roof tiles does not exist much anymore because of new building regulations.' Cosy: The terracotta exterior of the birdhouse might not look like a comfortable home for a bird, but underneath its hard exterior is a nest . The 8in tall bird box roof tiles have proved popular in Holland and are available across the world by ordering online. The bird box only comes with one type of roof tile at the moment, but Mr Kuiken is busy working on different designs. The boxes should only be put up on the north or east of the house to ensure they are not in direct sunlight. But Mr Kuiken says that heat from the sun shouldn't have any damaging effect on the birds. He said: 'Since I invented this I have heard a few people say you will end up with boiled eggs because of the sun. 'But this is the place the sparrows used to use as nesting spot and that's why it's such a good spot. It makes total sense. 'You have to be careful with the placement of the box. For example it has to be on the north or east side of the house so it will be out of the sun and not heat up too much. 'Having said that birds know exactly where to find a good spot to nest and if they think it it will be too warm, they will not go in. It is as simple as that.' The tiles cost just under £100.","Designer Klaas Kuiken's tile bird houses are being snapped up in Holland .

Sir Peter Ustinov's son says he is 'close to bankruptcy' after losing the latest round of a long-running court battle over his father's estate. Igor Ustinov claims the renowned actor intended to leave him the royalties to his work, and is fighting to claim the money from Sir Peter's third wife. But yesterday a High Court judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to launch a case in the UK, and said she was 'appalled' at the money wasted on the family feud. The 56-year-old sculptor faces a bill of £114,000 in legal costs after his bid to get his hands on his father's riches failed. Mr Ustinov, the actor's son by his second wife, has been fighting his stepmother Helene in the Swiss courts since Sir Peter's death in 2004, arguing that a will he wrote in 1968 should be honoured. Although that case is still ongoing, he launched a parallel action in Britain aiming to capture the rights to the actor's intellectual property and royalties. His lawyer Ian Meakin argued in court that 'overarching' lifetime trusts set up by Sir Peter had put the rights to his work out of reach of his widow, leaving his assets in the hands of his children. The whereabouts of those rights and royalties - which were said to have been put into an offshore structure by Sir Peter decades before his death - have not been confirmed. The barrister argued that Mr Ustinov's research indicated that two Swiss lawyers control the alleged trusts - something which they vigorously deny. Mr Meakin asked the judge to transfer the part of the legal row concerning the trusts to the jurisdiction of the English courts. Inheritance: Sir Peter Ustinov died near his home in Switzerland in 2004, aged 82 . Mrs Justice Proudman accepted that Sir Peter had set up 'tax efficient structures under which he could receive royalties for his creative endeavours, namely writing and acting'. But she said that there was 'no evidence of any actual trust', ruling that Mr Ustinov was unable to prove that his father's money was intended from him. 'Mr von Ustinov can't say who are its beneficiaries and what are its terms,' she said. 'His claim is the most fragile claim imaginable. Nor is there any evidence of any trust governed by English law.' The judge suggested that the sculptor's intention was to use the legal process to obtain documents which could prove his claim. She concluded that to hear part of the case in the UK would lead to 'risks of inconsistent findings and irreconcilable judgements'. Highlight: Sir Peter in Spartacus, one of the biggest hits of his glittering decades-long career . Speaking outside court, Mr Ustinov said that the costs of the long-running case had exhausted his funds, and insisted that his father intended him to receive his inheritance. 'I was very close to my father - when he died I was holding his hand and I felt like he had asked me to put some order into his affairs, but it has been very hard,' he said. 'Now I'm close to bankruptcy and I don't know what to do. Nine years I've been fighting and I didn't inherit a penny yet.' He added: 'This action was not really against my stepmother or my sisters, it was about the fact that my father saved up money and rights for years and now they are not available to the family. 'These trusts contained the rights and royalties to everything he wrote, his film rights and everything. It's a very sad story because the family have no way of getting hands on them.' Relatives: Sir Peter's daughter Tamara, left, and her husband Malcolm Rennie, right, lamented the cost of the case . His half-sister Tamara said: 'It's one of those funny situations which arise in families sometimes. I can't begin to imagine what it has cost.' Her husband Malcolm added: 'Peter was a wonderful man and I loved him very much as a son-in-law, but being successful at such a high level as he was, everybody wanted a piece of him. 'I would be surprised if there is anything left in the estate - it has probably all gone to the lawyers.' Sir Peter, a double Oscar winner, was born in England but moved to Switzerland in 1960 and lived there until his death.","Sculptor Igor Ustinov claims father put film royalties into trust for children .

After losing a presidential election it is only natural to enter the prescribed period of soul searching, followed by the question: 'What if thing's had been different?' But rather than accept their lot and strive to fight harder next time round, some Republicans want to change the electoral rules in a bid to make it easier for them to win in four years. On Wednesday, Virginia's Republican-controlled Congress proposed a bill that would allocate electoral votes by congressional district, instead of the current winner-take-all system. What could have been: If the system had been based on proportional representation and allocated electoral votes by congressional district, Mitt Romney would now be President . The current system: Barack Obama was elected President in November by 332 electoral votes to 206 . Indeed, under such a system Mitt Romney would have won last November's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes. In . Virginia, for example, President Obama would have claimed just four of . the state's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election, rather than all of . them. Senator . Charles W. Carrico Sr. sponsored the bill saying his rural constituents . in Grayson feel 'that their voices are not heard' in general elections, . adding: 'The last election, constituents were concerned that it didn’t . matter what they did, that more densely populated areas were going to . outvote them.' So close: Under such a system Mitt Romney would have won last November's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes . He said only in Maine and Nebraska are votes awarded based on turnout in each congressional district. But . critics have labelled it the 'sore losers' bill', arguing that it would . produced a 'skewed election' where a candidate could win the popular . vote in a state but still lose a proportion of electoral college votes. What if? In Virginia, under the Republican's proposed new system, President Obama would have claimed just four of the state's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election, rather than all of them . Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is urging people to sign a petition against the bill. In an open email, he wrote: 'We can't sit silently by as they try to manipulate the democratic process for political advantage. Under the current electoral college system, the candidate who wins the popular vote does not . necessarily win the election. Each . of the US's 50 states has a number of electoral votes based on its size . - the largest, California, gets 55 votes while Wyoming has just three. Every four years, Americans head to the polls to choose their preferred candidate for President and Vice-President. In all but two states (Maine and Nebraska), the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state wins ALL that state's electoral votes. The first candidate to reach a majority 270 votes out of 538. But Republicans in Virginia say the system is unfair. They want a . system that works more like that of Nebraska and Maine, where electoral . votes are allocated by proportional . representation. It means the candidate with the most votes in each of those states wins . two electoral votes, for their two Senators, before the remaining electoral . votes are doled out by congressional district. 'We can't let them attack the very democratic institutions and rights that others have sacrificed so much to gain - just because they don't believe they can win in a fair election fight.' Similar changes are reportedly also being considered in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. They, like Virginia, all helped vote Obama into the White House in the past two elections but are controlled by Republicans at the state level. But the proposals have not been welcomed by all corners of the Grand Old Party. Louisiana's Republican Chairman Roger Villere said: 'The Electoral College has served the country quite well.' 'This is coming from states where it might be an . advantage, but I'm worried about what it means down the road. This is a . system that has worked. That doesn't mean we can't talk about changes, . but we have to be very careful about any actions we might take.'

Britain would quit the European Union if a referendum was held now, a surprise new poll revealed today. In the wake of David Cameron’s high profile speech on giving voters a say on severing ties with Brussels, research showed 40 per cent of people now back an exit while 37 per cent want to stay in. The Populus survey would translate to a 53-47 vote in favour of leaving after other factors, such as likelihood to vote, were taken into account. Scroll down for video . David Cameron reassured business leaders at the World Economic Forum that Britain was not turning its back on Europe, but more people now back the idea of quitting Brussels . It is a marked turnaround from other surveys this week which suggested more people wanted to stay in the EU. Mr Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain within the EU but only after negotiating a fresh settlement, clawing back powers from Brussels. The Conservatives are to start drawing up legislation now to hold a referendum, which would be staged after the next election but before 2017. According to the Populus/Times poll, Mr Cameron’s long-awaited speech has done little to help his prospects of securing a Conservative majority at the 2015 election. Three quarters of supporters of the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party said they were unmoved by the speech, and 17 per cent said they were less likely to back the Tories in future. Just 8 per cent of UKIP supporters said they were no more minded to back Mr Cameron. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Cameron sought to reassure business leaders that Britain was not ‘turning our backs on Europe’. But he told them Europe was being ‘out-competed, out-invested, out-innovated’ and must be transformed into an engine for growth. The PM discussed the proposals in a 15-minute meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has indicated she is open to a ‘fair compromise’ with Britain. Nick Clegg said he was 'none the wiser' about how the PM's plans to claw back powers would actually work . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he is ‘still none the wiser about exactly what this great re-negotiation means’. In an interview with The House magazine, he said: ‘It was a well-crafted speech and obviously very well delivered. But in terms of the content, look, the Conservative Party will obviously ride away with headlines about the referendum today. My own view is that it will be a tactical victory today for a strategic mistake tomorrow.’ Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband sought to clarify his own position on Europe, after appearing to rule out an in/out referendum in the House of Commons. He said: ‘I am being clear. I do not think it makes sense, now, to commit to an in/out referendum years ahead. ‘And the reason why it does not make sense is clear from what the priority of the British people is. Their priority is jobs and growth and living standards and I've got to say what I think the right priority is and I do not believe now it makes sense to commit to an in/out referendum.’ In an interview with CNN, Mr Cameron insisted the Government was not planning to ‘storm off’ if its calls for reform were not met. ‘We're not putting a list of demands on the table and saying we'll storm off if we don't get them,’ he said. ‘What we're saying is we should in Europe have changes that will benefit all of the countries of the European Union, but which at the same time will, I think, make Britain more comfortable with her place in the European Union.’","40% back exit compared to 37 per cent who want to stay in European Union .

Any music lover of a certain age will remember proudly swinging one of these iconic carrier bags on their arm after their Saturday morning visit to a record shop. After hours of trawling the shelves for the latest single on 45 inch vinyl or cassette tapes, teenagers would rush home to their bedrooms and listen to the eagerly awaited tracks. But as the world of internet downloads and online stores took over the music industry, the traditional record shops and their iconic bags have almost become a relic of the past. These pictures show a collection of 1970s shopping bags from some of the biggest record stores in Britain - many of which are sadly no longer in existence. Record shop bags were a big thing in the 1970s, when every High Street had a record store. Pictured is HMV's popular bag . A retro record bag shop for Parrot Records, which traded in Ipswich, Colchester, Chelmsford and Braintree . Our Price was a prominent chain of record stores seen on all High Streets. It was founded in 1971 but went to the wall in 2004 . Familiar ones includes Our Price and Soul Jazz Records - one of the few stores still in business. There is also HMV, which will soon join the list of closed stores after going into administration after nearly 100 years of trading earlier this month. The shopping bags were commonplace in a world where teens were only ever destined for one place on a Saturday morning - the record shop. Grasping hard-earned pocket money, they would head for HMV, and if it didn't have what they wanted, Our Price was next on the list. Although still a permanent fixture of the High Street, WHSmith no longer sells CDs . The epitome of cool: Carrying around a bag full of newly-purchased records was considered a cool fashion accessory . The Musique Boutique, pictured left, had a store in Piccadilly Circus while Roy Hurst Records, pictured right, was popular with teens in Wigan . Andy's Records was founded in 1969 in Felixstowe, Bury St Edmonds, and continued trading right up until 2003 . As the stores themselves have disappeared over the years, their carrier bags have become collector's items and attract hundreds of bids on eBay from music lovers. This rare collection of bags are a stark reminder of how the evolution of the music industry has impacted on Britain’s high streets. The increased popularity of websites like Amazon and Play.com has impacted heavily on our high streets. Despite a proud history of being the most popular record store, HMV has struggled over the past few years from fierce supermarket and online competition. Its flagship store and the first ever HMV - His Master's Voice - was opened by the Gramophone Company on Oxford Street in 1921. A bag from Soul Jazz Records, a British record label which started in the 1990s and still trades from a store in Soho in London . The bags came in many different shapes, styles . and forms.

Over the years, the company went from strength to strength and stores were opened in almost every town across the country. Everyone in Britain would be able to recognise its logo of the dog Nipper . listening to a cylinder phonograph - painted by 1899 by Francis Barraud. But the music and film retailer was not quick enough to embrace the shift to shoppers buying their movies and albums over the internet. Now the nation’s last specialist record and CD retailer has been forced to call in the administrators. EMI, the record company which signed The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Coldplay and which owned HMV until 1998, has already been sold to foreign buyers and broken up. Very soon the only place where record store shops still exist will be online. A red and white retro record bag from the Slough Record Centre in Berkshire . Harlequin records and tapes had branches throughout London and the Home Counties . Bygone era: Independent records stores such as robins records in Norwich are a thing of the past . Changing times: Keith Prowse records is another High Street chain to go under when buying records in stores gradually became replaced by online downloads . Punk rockers: Stiff Records was founded in 1976 and was best known for its punk rock music. But as the punk rock era passed, so did the record label's popularity and it closed in 1985 . Long history: The nation's last specialist record and CD retailer - HMV - has gone into administration almost 100 years since it was first founded in 1921 .","Nostalgic images include carrier bags from HMV, Our Price and WHSmith .

Outside court: One of Paveet Landa's relatives, Chamkh Singh (pictured), 42, has been charged with kidnapping Paveet Landa's friend Harjinder Singh . The mother of a young Sikh nursery nurse threatened to kill her daughter’s secret lover unless he revealed where she was hiding, a court heard today. Paveet Landa, 20, ran away from her home in Ilford, east London, with her boyfriend, Ramanjit Singh, 21, to avoid an arranged marriage. Mr Singh was found by members of her family at a temple in Southall, west London, trying to book their wedding for the next day in August 2012. He told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court he was grabbed by three of Ms Landa’s relatives and stopped from running away, before her mother demanded he say where her daughter was. Speaking through a translator, Mr Singh said she had told him: 'Tell us where the girl is because if her paternal uncles came they are very angry and they can kill you. Even if they have to go to prison they are not bothered because they will take revenge. You tell us now.' He added: 'Her mother said that even if you run away to India we will not spare you.’ Mr Singh, who gave his evidence behind a screen, said Ms Landa’s older brother also made a throat-slitting gesture towards him. He described how he was able to telephone the police, and the family eventually allowed him to leave the temple when the officers arrived. The following day more members of Ms Landa’s extended family allegedly kidnapped her friend Harjinder Singh at knifepoint in a bid to find out where she was. Ms Landa told police she knew her family would not accept Ramanjit Singh because he was from a different caste, was from India and could not speak English. She told the trial: ‘I knew they . weren’t going to accept him. As much as people say they aren’t going to . rely on caste being a problem, I wouldn’t say that. Trial: Ramanjit Singh, 21, told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) that he was grabbed by three of his girlfriend Paveet Landa's relatives and stopped from running away . ‘I’ve . grown up in that area and I know as their child what it’s going to be . like. I knew that they weren’t going to accept Ramanjit. A child knows . how their dad is and how everyone is in their family.’ Ms Landa, who later married Ramanjit Singh, said her family arranged for her to marry another man, Vikram Shari. ‘Obviously it was an introduction from my . auntie but they all arranged it,’ she told the jury. ‘They all decided . together, my mum, my dad and my grandmother.’ 'I knew they weren’t going to accept him (Ramanjit). As much as people say they aren’t going to rely on caste being a problem, I wouldn’t say that' Paveet Landa . But the wedding was postponed after her grandfather died so she decided to elope with her boyfriend. He told the court: ‘It was a mutual agreement with the two of us that we have no other way out. We have to run away from the house.’ Ms Landa’s father Balvinder Singh, 42, mother Rani Landa, 42 and brother Lakhanpal Landa, 21, are charged with falsely imprisoning Ramanjit Singh on August 30. They have also been charged with kidnapping Harjinder Singh by force the following day. Relatives Hemat Landa, 40, Chamkh Singh, 42, Kamaljit Singh, 33, and a 16-year-old who cannot be named face the same charge. Balvinder is also accused of making a threat to kill Harjinder Singh and unlawful possession of a knife. All the defendants plead not guilty. The trial continues.

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 05:37 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:44 EST, 24 January 2013 . Police were accused of exaggerating falls in crime last night as official figures showed dramatic drops in burglary, car crime and vandalism. The national crime survey showed overall crime fell by more than 8 per cent last year to a record low. Police recorded crime figures showed a similar fall, of 7 per cent. Strange: The line on this Government graph show the rate of crime according to the British Crime Survey, and the bar chart shows crimes recorded by police, which is much lower . But the Office for National Statistics said police figures may have exaggerated the fall in crime in recent years. Officials said police were under ‘informal pressure’ to meet crime reduction targets and so may have downgraded some crimes so they were not reported. This could lead to a burglary being reported as criminal damage or low-level vandalism as anti-social behaviour, they said. Police recorded 400,000 fewer offences over five years than those reported in Crime Survey for England and Wales, a survey of more than 40,000 households seen as more accurate because it is not linked to police figures. Labour called for an inquiry into whether fewer crimes were being recorded as a result of cuts in police funding. But the Association of Chief Police Officers insisted there were other reasons to explain the discrepancy. Douglas Paxton, Deputy Chief Constable of Staffordshire, said officers may have been ‘over-zealous’ in how they recorded crime when new standards were brought in ten years ago. He added that more crimes were dealt with informally by neighbourhood policing teams. Questions: Experts have said the police's recording of crimes may be lower than they should be - as low-level crime may be dropping off the system . The CSEW shows that crime has reached its lowest level since records began in 1981, despite sharp cuts to police funding. In what will come as good news for Home Secretary Theresa May, the national crime survey found there were 8.9million crimes committed in the year to September 2012 – 820,000 fewer than a year earlier. The Office for National Statistics said it expected crime to fall even further in future as yesterday’s numbers were the start of an ‘emerging downward trend’. 8.9 million incidents of crime, down 8%* . 1.8 million incidents of vandalism, down 14% . 653,000 incidents of burglary, down 11% . 1.1 million vehicle-related thefts, down 11% . 468,000 bicycle thefts,up 2% . 1.4 million household thefts, up 5% . 3.6 million household crimes, down 4% . 551,000 thefts from the person, down 7% . 1 million thefts of personal property, down  8% . 1.9 million incidents of violence, down 12% . 1.8 million personal theft, down 6% . *according to the British Crime Survey . It showed that burglary was down by 11 per cent, including an 18 per cent fall in break-ins in which the intruder entered the property. Theft from vehicles was down 11 per cent. Overall, violent crime was down by 12 per cent – with the number having halved since 1995. The murder rate fell 10 per cent to 551, its lowest since 1978. Statisticians said the fall in house and car break-ins was linked to improvements in home security and car locking and alarm systems. But so-called pickpocket thefts rose 6 per cent, due to thieves targeting expensive iPods and iPhones to sell on overseas. Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne said: ‘Police reform is working. We have swept away central targets, reduced bureaucracy and these figures show forces are rising to the challenge of doing more with less.’ Forces are no longer judged on a Labour target for bringing offenders to justice which critics said encouraged the police to solve easy crimes to improve their clear-up rate. John Flatley, of the ONS, said: ‘[With] some lower level crimes there is a judgment call to be made as to whether the incident attended to by the officer is actually a crime in law or a low level incident that would not get into the crime figures. ‘It’s possible in an era of targets to cut crime and pressure on officers to see a reduction in crime that their judgment will sway more to including that in the lower level category.’","There were 8.9m crimes in 12 months to September - the lowest ever according to the official British Crime Survey .
Nearly all crime is down apart from street theft, as criminals are targeting smartphones, iPods, iPads and bikes .
But separate crime figures recorded by police show an even bigger drop, which experts say shows that have 'overstated' improvement .

A nurse was jailed today after being found guilty of crashing her caravan in a drunken stupor as she set off on a weekend camping holiday. Mother-of-two Andrea Hughes, 47, had been drinking Bacardi before she crashed the caravan into the kerb outside a pub, ripping two wheels off the caravan. She was still drinking rum when the mechanic she'd called arrived, and when police got there she 'basically fell out of the car', a Kia Sorento 4x4, and was unable to hold a conversation with them. Hughes, who has been a nurse for 28 years and now faces losing her job over the incident, was today sentenced to 12 weeks in prison and banned from driving for three years after being found guilty of drink-driving. The incident happened last October as Hughes towed the family caravan from her home in Macclesfield to a campsite in Astbury, near Congleton, Cheshire, for a weekend break with her boyfriend, mother and sister. As she drove along Congleton Road her caravan hit the kerb, causing two wheels to be ripped off, at about 3.45pm, Macclesfield Crown Court heard at a trial earlier this month. She called out a mechanic but when he arrived an hour later he realised she was drunk when he smelt alcohol on Hughes' breath and saw her holding a tumbler of spirits. Kate Marchuk, prosecuting, said: 'The . mechanic saw her sitting in the passenger-side seat of her car with the . keys in the ignition but the engine was not running. 'She seemed not fully with it and . when she spoke again, he smelt alcohol on her breath. He saw her . struggling towards the caravan and coming out carrying a tumbler . containing about two-and-a-half inches of clear liquid. 'He asked her to give him the glass. He smelt the liquid, realised that it was some sort of spirit. He threw . it on the ground and called the police.' Miss Marchuk said Hughes was . struggling for balance when the police officer arrived. She was also . said to be struggling to keep her eyes open or hold a conversation. No previous convictions: Andrea Hughes, with bag, is shown arriving at Macclesfield Magistrates' Court . The prosecutor added: 'She nearly fell over, she had to hold on to the police officer for balance.' PC Neil Jones told the court: 'She . basically fell out of the car. She was unsteady on her feet and we had . to hold her up to make sure she didn't fall over and hurt herself.' The police officer had been so . concerned about her condition he took her to accident and emergency at . Macclesfield Hospital - but she was diagnosed as being drunk and was . discharged when nothing else was found to be wrong with her. An inital breath test showed Hughes to be just over the legal limit but tests taken at the police station two hours after the crash showed she had 146mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. At Macclesfield magistrates court Hughes denied drink-driving but was convicted after a trial. She looked shocked today as she was sent to prison for 12 weeks. She was also banned from driving for three years and now faces the loss of her job. Home: Andrea Hughes admitted having two Bacardi and Cokes before setting out from Macclesfield to Astbury . The court had heard how in an interview the day after the smash, Hughes said she had been travelling on holiday when her caravan wobbled and swerved, so she pulled into the next lay-by. She said she couldn't remember the mechanic attending the scene. Hughes told police she had had coffee and a biscuit at 10am before drinking two Bacardi and cokes at around 12 noon.  She said her high breath test must have been influenced by what she drank after she crashed outside the Chain and Gate pub in North Rode. There was no alcohol in the caravan, although there was a bottle of rum found - which she said must have been from a previous trip. During her trial on January 15, Hughes claimed that she had drunk most of a bottle of rum whilst she waited for the mechanic because she was devastated at damaging the caravan, which she said was her and her boyfriend's 'pride and joy.' She said she had drowned her sorrows because she feared he would be angry since he was supposed to be driving to the campsite, but was late home from work. She insisted she was under the limit when she was driving. In mitigation, defence lawyer Hojol Uddin said his client, who had no previous convictions, faced losing her job and home, which she shares with her children, aged 21 and 16. He added: 'It is a low level of seriousness - there was no accident, there seems to be some sort of collision but no evidence that a collision took place. There were no other vehicles involved in the incident or any pedestrians. 'Her children are reliant on their mother - it will impact her financially which could potentially see her losing her home.' But Susan Armstrong, chairwoman of the bench, said: 'This was an extremely high reading. 'Your car was towing a caravan and was involved in an accident and an aggravating feature of this case was the time of day at which there was a high level of traffic about on the busy road. 'You decided intentionally to drink alcohol and drink it before you set off. There was a potential harm to other road users.'","Andrea Hughes, 47, was heading to nearby Cheshire campsite for weekend .

Samsung is claiming victory in the war of the mobiles after its large-screen Galaxy outsold the Apple iPhone. In the crucial run-up to Christmas, the South Korean company shifted 700,000 handsets a day worldwide, selling 60million in the final three months of 2012. Apple sold 47.8million iPhones in the same period – a disappointing figure that saw more than £35billion wiped from its stock market value.

Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5 have been battling for supremacy after . launches last year – with analysts saying the former’s screen size – . 4.8in to 4in – was a key advantage. The new iPhone also costs more – up to £700 if bought outside a pay-monthly contract compared with £500 for the Galaxy.

Industry . experts claim Apple has become too focused on high-end, high-cost . products that consumers cannot – or do not want to – pay for.

In a statement, . Samsung said the ‘furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone . market last year’ would be tempered by ‘intensifying price competition’ and a ‘slew of new products’. The . company’s profits between October and December rose 86 per cent to a . record £5.2billion, with revenues rising 19 per cent to £32.7billion. ‘Samsung’s . got a broader product line-up and Apple appears to be struggling in . pushing iPhone volumes aggressively,’ said financial analyst Lee . Se-chul, from Meritz Securities in Seoul, where Samsung is based. ‘Smartphone shipments will continue to grow, even in the traditionally weak first quarter,’ he concluded.

Two alleged thieves carrying a stolen 17ft bright red canoe managed to trick police into letting them go - after telling them they were using it to go sledging. It is understood police officers stopped the pair after a neighbour reported the theft from a garden in Edinburgh on Monday. However, they were allowed to go on their way after the officers were assured they had been given permission to borrow the canoe to use on the snow. Norman Maver said it was 'ridiculous' that the two alleged thieves were allowed to go on their way after telling officers they were using the canoe to go sledging . The 17ft red canoe was reported stolen from the garden in Edinburgh during a snow storm . The owner Norman Maver called the apparent misunderstanding ‘ridiculous’. He said: ‘They came out responding to a call about a bright red, 17ft canoe that had been reported stolen. ‘It’s a hundredweight and usually takes a few people to shift it. ‘[My neighbour] called the police but when they arrived [they were told] they had permission to go sledging in it and that was that. ‘They just let them go on their way. ‘I don’t know about anyone else but I have never seen a 17ft canoe going sledging before. It’s insane. ‘For the police not even to take names when they are on a call about a stolen canoe is ridiculous.’ Mr Maver said the canoe has been stored in the same place for 30 years and has never been taken before . The father-of-two went to a police station the following day to file a report the theft where he discovered the incident had been dismissed as a misunderstanding. Mr Maver said the canoe was ‘irreplaceable’ to him and had owned it for 30 years after being given it by an old friend. The canoe was later recovered and Lothian and Borders Police said a 16-year-old boy had been arrested and charged in connection with the alleged theft. The spokesman added: ‘He is scheduled to appear in court at a later date. The canoe has been recoved and will be returned to its owner.’ The canoe, which has now been recovered, was given to Mr Maver by an old friend and he said it is 'irreplaceable' Mr Maver said: ‘It’s just so frustrating, it’s the sentimental value to me. I have no idea how much it’s actually worth. I did give it a new paint job though last summer, and that cost me £250.’ He said an inspector had visited him to apologise. He said: ‘His exact words to me were “I’m here to eat humble pie” ‘I just can’t believe it happened. It’s just you couldn’t make it up.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Police stopped the alleged thieves after neighbour reported theft .

A foolhardy walker has been pictured nearly being swept into the ocean after getting too close to 40ft waves. The reckless thrill-seeker risked his life on Wednesday by clambering over a craggy headland to get a better view of the ocean in Cornwall's Newquay resort. Within seconds he was forced to cling on to the rocks, cowering as walls of water weighing thousands of tonnes smashed into the coast. Terror: A walker was nearly swept into the sea in Cornwall when trying to get close to the waves . Close shave: The walker escaped unharmed, but coastguards have used the images to warn others about the dangers of the sea during stormy weather . Coastguards have used the images to warn other locals and visitors about the dangers of spending time on the coastline during stormy weather. Witnesses to the shocking spectacle told how they feared the man was about to be swept out to sea. They described him desperately hanging on until the waves subsided. Officials said the pictures should remind those looking to get a glimpse of severe weather that they should be cautious about how close they get to the action. Clinging on: The unidentified walker was forced to hang on to the rocks to avoid being blown away . Matt Pavitt, coastguard sector manager for North Cornwall, said people failed to realise that a single cubic metre of water weighs a tonne. 'I doubt anyone would like a one-tonne bag of water swung at them,' he commented. 'It's incredibly dangerous. 'We don't want to be the fun police, we just want to instil a bit of common sense. It's incredibly impressive to watch the power of the ocean but you have to treat it with respect. 'Less than a foot of water will knock you off your feet, so at the height we're talking about here you've got no chance of trying to stand up against it if it breaks over you. 'Our advice is to watch the waves from a safe distance, otherwise you're putting yourself in danger - and those who come out to rescue you.' Danger: Many thrill-seekers enjoy watching large waves, but they should beware of the power of the sea . The images were captured by Paul Terry, who was on his way to beach to take photos of surfers riding the monster waves. The photographer said: 'There were two people sat up by the headland, quite a way back, watching the spray. 'Then the guy in the green jacket decided to try and get as close as he could. All of a sudden a huge wave came in and he had to duck out of the way behind the rocks. 'It's pretty dangerous and a lot of people seem to do it. If people get swept off then it can be a huge drain on resources, the coastguards and the RNLI. 'People need to be careful.

A man who streamed live football matches through his computer and charged thousands of people to watch it avoided a prison sentence today. Gary Goodger was only 16 when he started illegally streaming Premier League matches to a website he set up, and undercutting prices charged by official broadcaster, Sky. He used a huge satellite dish, seven computers and nine satellite decoders to run the 'freelivefooty' website from his home in Lower Earley, near Reading. Reading Crown Court: Judge John Reddihough gave Gary Goodger, now 24, a suspended prison sentence . Thousands of viewers worldwide were believed to have tuned in to the illegal website, paying through a PayPay online account set up by an accomplice. Today, in a court case described by copyright enforcers as 'groundbreaking', Goodger, who is now 24, was convicted of his illegal soccer streaming and given a suspended prison sentence. Sitting at Reading Crown Court, Judge John Reddihough heard that prosecutors were unable to establish how much financial damage the operation caused the broadcaster. His accomplice, Jack Bannister, allowed his Paypal account to be used by Goodger to process some of the money the enterprise brought in. Both Bannister and Goodger, who met for the first time at court, were convicted by a jury after a trial. Judge Reddihough told Goodger: 'Companies in this country, such as the broadcasters in this, and the Premier League, are entitled to their copyright and entitled not to have other people using it illegally, as you did. Premises: Gary Goodger used to run his business from his home in Lower Earley near Reading . 'The trouble is that ultimately in cases like this it will be the consumer that ends up paying because if there are less people using it then the prices have to go up. 'The fact, I'm told, that there are a number of other websites and enterprises conducting the same illegal operations, does not help you. 'If anything it calls for the courts to impose deterrent sentences.' The Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) launched an investigation on behalf of the Premier League and supplied evidence to the Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit, who arrested Goodger and Bannister in November 2010. 'This is a ground-breaking case, proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence.' Kieron Sharp, Federation Against Copyright Theft . They sent a number of 'cease and desist' notices to the website on behalf of the Premier League but Goodger's activities continued. Investigations showed that Bannister had processed the money through his PayPal account, and both men were subsequently charged on June 27 2011. At the end of a six-day trial Goodger was convicted of communicating a copyrighted work to the public in the course of a business. Bannister, 23, of Burnley, Lancashire, was convicted of transferring criminal property. Kieron Sharp, FACT Director General, said: 'This is a groundbreaking case, proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence.' Detective Constable Lisa Child, from Thames Valley Police's Economic Crime Unit, said: 'Goodger is believed to have made tens of thousands of pounds through illegally streaming football matches to subscribers to his website, although no exact figure is available due to the complexity of the investigation.' Alexander Stein, defending Goodger, said in mitigation: 'It is very difficult to know if people would have subscribed to Sky rather than freelivefooty.com but at the time of these offences Sky was not available online anyway. 'I accept they could have subscribed to Sky on the television.' Official broadcasters: Goodger undercut Sky when he illegally streamed the football matches (file picture) He said his client's service had also streamed matches that were not available on Sky, adding: 'So it is difficult to know if Sky lost anything.' Mr Stein went on: 'This website started in 2005 when he was only 16 and even when he was arrested he was only 20 years old. 'He is a young man and he has acted naively and that is how he should be treated.' He said Goodger was currently working as a mechanic. Guy Mathieson, defending Bannister, told the judge: 'He had nothing to do with the computing, the streaming, the running of the website, the setting up of the website, the administration of the website. 'He only became involved in November 2009 and his PayPal account was stopped in August 2010 and the website continued with subscriptions. 'So it was running long before he got involved and was running after he stopped.' He said his client had not tried to hide his identity but had allowed his account, his girlfriend's and his father's accounts to be used despite suspecting that something was not right. 'I bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young.' Judge John Reddihough to defendant Gary Goodger . Some £26,000 passed through his account although he was only left with around £3,000, from which various bills also had to be paid. When Mr Mathieson told the judge that the latest Sky worldwide football rights package had been sold for £5.6bn, meaning his client's actions had little impact, the judge replied: 'I'm not sure that's a good argument because if other people are doing it, a deterrent sentence should be imposed.' The judge told Goodger: 'I bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young. 'I have no doubt at all that you were soon aware that what you were doing was illegal and ignored correspondence that pointed out to you that what you were doing was illegal. You carried on and you made not vast profits but some significant gain.' He passed a six-month jail term, suspended for two years, and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay £1,750 towards the prosecution costs. He also ordered that all of the equipment used to run the website be forfeited. The judge then told Bannister: 'I do accept that your role was very subsidiary but you did allow your PayPal account to be used for subscribers to make payments. 'Despite your suspicions you continued to provide the account to be used for it and a considerable amount of money did pass through it, from which you were paid some relatively small amount.' He ordered Bannister to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work and pay £500 pounds towards the prosecution costs.","Gary Goodger set up his 'freelivefooty' website when he was just 16 .

But in the last 25 years St Helen's church in Eston, Teesside, had been virtually destroyed after being repeatedly targeted by vandals and thieves. Local campaigners decided drastic action was needed and decided to dismantle the church, brick by brick, and rebuild it 40 miles away in County Durham. After 15 years, St Helen's church has been rebuilt brick by brick 40 miles away in County Durham . St Helen's church in it's original location in Eston, Teeside where it had stood for 900 years . The church had been virtually destroyed by 1998 after vandals illegally demolished the vestry and stole stonework and valuables . The 15-year project is now almost complete although the church has not yet opened to the public due to a lack of funds. Each individual brick of the church was removed from the building and numbered in 1998. At the time historians at the Beamish Museum declared an 'amnesty' in an attempt to have returned as much of the original stone as possible, much of which had been stolen. It took four labourers a month to dismantle the church and transport it to a site near Georgian Pockerley Manor, owned by the charity. The blocks were stored on palettes, whilst the remaining rubble of the church was taken by skip. The church was moved more than 40 miles from its original home in Eston, Teesside, to a site owned by the Beamish Museum in County Durham . Each individual brick was removed and numbered when labourers demolished the church in 1998 . The exterior of the church has now been completely rebuilt but it has not been opened to the public due to a lack of money . It took four labourers a month to dismantle the church and transport it 40 miles away to its new home in County Durham . The bricks were kept in a field while the Beamish Museum, which funded the project, waited for enough money to become available to complete the move. The decision to transport the church followed years of vandalism, including a fire which destroyed its roofs. The vestry was illegally demolished while stonework and furnishings, such as the font and medieval cross were stolen. The Tudor stained glass was smashed out and in the mid 19th century a cast iron chancel window was taken for scrap. By 1987 St Helen's was in a serious state of disrepair and in 1998 Durham County Council and English Heritage gave permission for the grade II listed building to be de-constructed and rebuilt by Beamish. The exterior of the church has now been completely rebuilt but it has not yet been opened to the public due to a lack of money.

When finished the grounds of the church will house an 1828 hearse, believed to be the oldest in the country. Curator of the museum, Jim Rees, said: 'The rebuild was entirely funded by ourselves and it was the lack of money or any grants towards the reconstruction which had meant that so much time had elapsed since we took it down. 'The delay in final completion is due to having run out of funds for the project. 'This does not unduly worry me as the lovely new roof and gutters are on, so it is coming to no harm. 'It still needs plastering in the nave, flagstone floors throughout, doors and windows, which will be made by our own joiners, and Georgian box pews installing, once we find some. 'All the original woodwork was of course destroyed in the fire. The last parochial service at the church was held in 1962 but there are hopes one might be held again in the future . 'Outside we need to do a lot of landscaping; more flags, the church yard wall and a 'Hearse House' to house our 19th century hearse, which I believe to be the oldest anywhere. 'The uncertainty of raising the money means that at present we are unable to set a date for public opening, although all visitors to the museum can at least view the outside of the building now.' According to registers, St Helen's served as a parish church from medieval times, until 1884 when a larger one was built nearby. In 1889 St Helen's became a cemetery chapel but with rapid population growth it became a parish again in the early 1920s. The last parochial service was held in the church on December 30th 1962 before it resumed its earlier role as cemetery chapel, the last funeral was held around 1985.","St Helen's church in Eston, Teesside, has stood since the 1100s .

A powerful celestial explosion first observed over a century ago has been painstakingly reconstructed as a time-lapse video. Astronomers first spotted GK Persei in 1901 after a thermonuclear explosion made it suddenly one of the night sky's brightest objects, and it has not stopped growing since. Now, using images captured from telescopes in the Canary Islands, European researchers have created a time-lapse film of the supernova's continuing expansion. Firework supernova: The remnants of GK Persei, which was first seen exploding in 1901 and has not stopped growing since with this unusual firework display-like pattern . They have also constructed a three dimensional map of the remnants left behind by the blast which revealed that, contrary to expectations, it is still growing as fast as 620 miles a second. Their findings have just been published in the Astrophysical Journal. Situated just 1,300 light years from Earth, relatively nearby in cosmic terms, GK Persei is also known as Nova Persei 1901 after a strong thermonuclear eruption spotted on its surface on the February 21, 1901. On that day astronomers observed how its brightness suddenly increased to such an extent that it became one of the brightest stars in the skies. Supernovae happen when the core of a massive star collapses under the stress of its own gravity. The explosions cause bursts of radiation that can briefly outshine an entire galaxy, and drive huge shockwaves into the surrounding space which sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a supernova remnant. But the astronomers watching GK Persei were surprised to find that the explosion left behind remaining material that was rather unusual. It was made up of gaseous knots, which become visible in 1916. 'From then the visual spectacle has been similar to that of a firework display seen in slow motion,' said Miguel Santander, researcher at Spanish National Observatory and coauthor of the study. After patient work to gather images from Isaac Newton Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, researchers were able to measure the movements of more than 200 knots. They calculated the radial velocity of the remnants using the Doppler effect to determine whether they are getting closer or moving further away. In this way they were able to create a 3D map of the nova and analyse its dynamic. A 3D view of the remnant of Nova Persei 1901 (the green arrow points towards Earth): It shows that the stars remains are still moving as fast as 620 miles per second . 'Such data are rarely available in astrophysics because as a general rule apparent expansion or, in other words, in the layout of the sky, the majority of objects cannot be seen,' said Romano Corradi, from the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. Lead author Tiina Liimets, of the Tartu Observatory in Estonia, said their findings show 'that the gas seems to be moving further away in a ballistic or free manner and is hardly slowing down, contrary to what was thought in previous studies.' Until now it was thought that the gas from the explosion would slow down 'significantly' due to the large quantity of matter in its path that the star has expelled previously. However, its speed has remained between a range of 600 and 1000 km/s . Long before the explosion in 1901, more than one hundred thousand years ago, GK Persei had already undergone a massive transformation from a red giant to a white dwarf. This process expelled its external layers forming a planetary nebula, which is a giant gas cloud within which the nova is now growing in 3D.","GK Persei first spotted going supernova in 1901 after it suddenly became one of the sky's brightest objects .

David Cameron pulled off the seemingly impossible last night with his historic EU referendum pledge. It not only united Eurosceptic Tory big beasts and Britain’s business leaders, but even won the support of  Germany’s Angela Merkel. He sent shockwaves through Europe as he declared Britain rejects ‘ever closer union’, the founding principle of the European Union, and gave a guarantee of an in/out vote on our membership if he is prime minister after 2015. Scroll down for video . David Cameron delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relationship with the EU, saying he would campaign to stay in the union if they returned key powers to Westminster . Mr Cameron vowed to campaign for Britain to stay in – as long as Brussels agreed to renegotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship with key powers returned to Westminster – but added: ‘I say to the British people: This will be your decision.’ He has set himself the Herculean task of persuading other EU leaders and Brussels eurocrats to back his calls for reform against strong opposition from the likes of Spain and Italy. Though he said renegotiation would  not begin until the next Parliament, he  will now come under pressure to  spell  out more precisely his repatriation demands. Mr Cameron insisted that a referendum to be held by the end of 2017 would be a deal-breaker in any future coalition agreement with the Lib Dems. While it had been trailed for months, the Prime Minister’s announcement left Labour in chaos as Ed Miliband told MPs he did not want an in/out referendum, only for other senior figures to insist later that he might. Labour leader Ed Miliband made it clear that he did not want a referendum - despite some members of his party suggesting they might want one . In direct contradiction of his leader, . shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘Never say never.’ And . another Labour frontbencher, Caroline Flint, said of Mr Miliband’s . statement: ‘This is our position today.’ In a sign of potential tension within the Coalition, however, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said ‘years of uncertainty’ caused by a future referendum would hit jobs and growth and this ‘was not in the national interest’. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, the Cabinet’s Eurosceptic standard-bearer, told the Daily Mail that Mr Cameron’s long-awaited speech on Britain’s future in Europe was ‘bloody marvellous’. ‘This is a seismic moment,’ he said. ‘The Prime Minister shows real leadership compared to Ed Miliband, who has now confirmed that come the election Labour will campaign against a referendum and against giving people a choice. ‘If you want a referendum, you have to vote Tory. If you don’t want one, you vote Labour.’ Angela Merkel opened the door to negotiation . Boris Johnson said the Prime Minister was 'bang on' John Cridland said the EU needed reform . In an article for the Mail, former defence secretary Liam Fox – another leading light among Tory Eurosceptics – says Conservative MPs have ‘waited a long time’ for a prime minister to deliver such a ‘hugely significant message’ and promise the British people ‘a definitive choice through a referendum’. Mr Cameron’s speech was hailed as . ‘bang on’ by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who had ‘no doubt’ the British . people would vote for the kind of renegotiated membership the Prime . Minister envisaged. ‘What . most sensible people want is to belong to the single market but to lop . off the irritating excrescences of the European Union,’ he said. He . added: ‘There are a lot of other countries around that want to see . reform. I think it’s going to be much simpler than people expect to get a . better deal.’ Conservatives Liam Fox and Iain Duncan Smith both hailed the Prime Minister's 'hugely significant speech' Downing . Street was delighted and surprised as Chancellor Merkel, Europe’s most . powerful figure, responded to Mr Cameron’s speech by opening the door to . a renegotiation of Britain’s membership terms. ‘Germany, and I personally, want . Britain to be an important part and an active member of the European . Union,’ she said. ‘We are prepared to talk about British wishes but we . must always bear in mind that other countries have different wishes and . we must find a fair compromise. We will talk intensively with Britain . about its individual ideas.’ The public remains deeply divided over whether Britain should quit the EU, according to recent polls. But the latest surveys suggest that support for leaving has faded as the debate over the issue has intensified. A . YouGov survey at the weekend found that 40 per cent of people would now . vote to stay in the EU compared to 34 per cent wanting to quit – the . first time since the 2010 election that most have said Britain should . not leave. As recently as November, 51 per cent said they wanted to quit and just 30 per cent wanted to stay in. By . contrast, Italy insisted the EU ‘only wants willing members’, while . France offered to ‘roll out the red carpet’ for businessmen it claimed . would lead an exodus to its shores if Britain left the EU. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius . told Mr Cameron: ‘You can’t do Europe a la carte... to take an example . which our British friends will understand, imagine Europe is a football . club and you join; once you’re in it you can’t say, “Let’s play rugby”.’ But Britain’s leading . business groups backed the Prime Minister’s stance, while 55 business . chiefs – including the heads of the Stock Exchange, Diageo and Standard . Chartered – signed a supportive joint letter. John . Cridland, director general of the employers’ group the CBI, agreed with . Mr Cameron that ‘closer union of the eurozone is not for us’, and said . the Prime Minister ‘rightly recognises the benefits of retaining . membership of what must be a reformed EU’. Mr . Cameron, who was forced to postpone his speech last week because of the . Algeria hostage crisis, set out a hugely ambitious vision of a . transformed EU. Casting himself as a modern-day heretic, . he said ‘nothing’ would be off the table when he presents demands for . the repatriation of a swathe of powers if he wins the 2015 election. He cited EU regulations on employment, the environment, social affairs and crime as among ‘so many areas’ where he wanted to ‘examine whether the balance is right’. He suggested the ‘principal reason’ for Britain’s membership of the EU was ‘our participation in the single market and our ability to help set its rules’ – suggesting he wants a return to something like the Common Market Britain joined in 1975. He said he wanted to challenge the central tenet of the EU – the commitment in the founding Treaty of Rome in 1957 to create an ‘ever closer union’. ‘We understand and respect the right of others to maintain their commitment to this goal. But for Britain – and perhaps for others – it is not the objective. 'And we would be much more comfortable if the treaty specifically said so, freeing those who want to go further, faster, to do so, without being held back by the others,’ Mr Cameron said. He said he wanted a new EU treaty, saying he believed one would be necessary to create the closer economic and political union for eurozone countries fighting to save the single currency. But he insisted that even if negotiations were opened, he would be prepared to follow the example of Harold Wilson, who asked for changes to Britain’s membership terms outside a treaty ahead of the 1975 referendum. He said his aim was to ensure Britain remains a member of a more ‘open and flexible’ EU, saying even if Britain left it would remain ‘for many years our biggest market, and forever our geographical neighbourhood’. But in a warning directed firmly at Mrs Merkel, he said the EU would be ‘greatly diminished’ by a British exit. ‘An EU without Britain, without one of Europe’s strongest powers, a country which in many ways invented the single market, and which brings real heft to Europe’s influence on the world stage, which plays by the rules and which is a force for liberal economic reform, would be a very different kind of European Union,’ he added. Mr Cameron was unclear about whether he would campaign in favour of a No vote in his referendum if he failed to secure his demands. ‘Who goes into a negotiation hoping and expecting to fail? That is not the approach I take,’ he said. Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said he could not envisage his party agreeing to a referendum if the Conservatives failed to win a majority at the next election and wanted to form another coalition.","Chancellor Angela Merkel responded to Mr Cameron’s speech by opening the door to a renegotiation of Britain’s membership terms .

Lloyd Blankfein risked a fresh public backlash by saying he stood by the move to delay huge payouts until after the top rate of tax was cut from 50p to 45p. The chief executive of the investment bank claimed opposition to the idea amounted to ‘criminalising every right-thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way’. Two weeks ago Goldman Sachs was forced to abandon its plan to delay paying out bonuses to help bankers avoid the 50p tax rate. Bank of England boss Sir Mervyn King branded the idea 'depressing' and accused bankers of mis-judging public anger at the damage caused by the financial crash. The investment bank had considered waiting to award equity bonuses deferred from previous years, due to pay out this month, until after April 6. It would have meant tax on the payouts would have been paid at the 45p rate instead of the 50p rate for high earners. But at the eleventh how the bank's Comp Committee pulled the plug on the plan. Unrepentant, Mr Blankfein insisted people should not be subjected to opprobrium for responding to incentives in the tax system. A plan by Goldman Sachs to delay the payouts of deferred bonuses until after April 6 was dropped two weeks ago . ‘We don't go out of our way to put our businesses in the most expensive jurisdictions. Do we go out of our way to put them in the least expensive? No, we think of quality, we think of standard of life, being able to attract and recruit,’ he told BBC Radio 4. ‘If all of a sudden, in addition to the rules that generate certainty for people, the signposts become so amorphous and so loose and so subject to second-guessing, you're making everything uncertain and it's very hard to organise your affairs in a sensible way. Bank of England chief Sir Mervyn King said bankers had to realise they 'can't just exist on their own' ‘I'm not saying that you are . exculpated from any pressure merely because you meet the rule of law - . we've never said that, we don't live that life. ‘But . I would say are you going to hold people up to public opprobrium . because a house they could have sold in January instead they sell in May . because there was a profit to be made on that house because the selling . price was higher than the purchase price? ‘If you do that, you are going to criminalise every right-thinking person who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way. ‘We are a public entity, we live on the goodwill of the public, and so we adapted to what we perceived as criticism. We stand by our original idea and we stand by the revision of our plans.’ When news of the plan to delay bonuses first emerged, outgoing Bank of England government Sir Mervyn launched a devastating attack on attitudes . in the City. He accused the super-rich of thinking it was . 'exciting' to use a loophole which could cost the taxpayer millions. 'I . find it a bit depressing that people who earn so much seem to think . it's even more exciting to kind of adjust the timing of it to get the . benefit of a lower tax rate which they will benefit from in the long run . to a very great extent,' he told the Treasury Select Committee. Sir . Mervyn, who will stand down as Bank of England Governor in June, said . City firms had to consider the reputational damage the move would cause. 'I . think it would be rather clumsy and rather lacking in care and . attention to how other people might react and , in the long run, . financial institutions, like all large institutions do depend on good . will from the rest of society, they can’t just exist on their own.'","Lloyd Blankfein said he stood by the idea of delaying bonuses until the 50p top rate of tax had been cut to 45p .

It may sound like the sort of education many parents could only dream of for their children. But this is the reality for one little seven-year-old girl in China who is the only pupil in her entire school. Zhang Siqi is one of a few students living in rural China who have ended up being taught completely alone in school after their thriving villages turned into ghost towns. Lonely: Zhang Siqi, aged eight, sits alone in a classroom at the school in Nanou, south-east Fujian Province . One-on-one tuition: Siqi is taught by sole remaining teacher at the school, Zhang Wanjia . It comes as more and more villagers are abandoning their countryside homes in a desperate attempt to try and find work in the cities. Siqi's school - located in Nanou in the south-eastern Fujian Province - is just one of many to have been left with no children to teach following the mass exodus. Once it would have held taught dozens of pupils living in the small but thriving community. But as villagers deserted the area, the school was eventually forced to close in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students. It only reopened last year when Siqi, then seven-years-old, was admitted. Lively pupil: Despite being the only child in the entire school, Siqi doesn't appear to mind too much . Count down: But four new pupils will be attending the school with Siqi next year . Siqi was born with a missing spinal disc . and needs extensive family care. Because of this it was decided that . the local school was her best choice as it's very close to her home. Now she attends the school every day to be taught by the sole remaining teacher Zhang Wanjia. He follows the national curriculum - even playing basketball and jogging with Siqi during PE classes. Once a week they hold a national flag raising day with Siqi standing alone in the schoolyard to sing the national anthem. Singled out: Siqi is one of many pupils who have ended up being the only pupil in rural schools after villagers have left their homes to find work in cities . Nap time: The school was closed in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students until Siqi joined last year . Warming up: Siqi is taught the national curriculum - so her teacher Zhang Wanjia also teaches her PE . But Zhang, who has been teaching for 35 . years, said that while the one-student teaching looks easy, it is . actually is very tiring and lonely. Two player game: Zhang Wanjia challenges Siqi to a game of basketball . He said: 'When I am alone in the office, I don't even have a person to chat with.' Siqi's mother is a migrant worker in Zhangzhou city while her father and grandmother work in a local tea garden. 'She . is very considerate,' said Siqi's 76-year-old grandma. 'She often stops . me from going out to work, saying I am too old and it's dangerous for . me to work outside.' But, in a sign that migration to the cities may be reversing, Siqi can take heart that next year she will have some classmates as four new children will be starting at the school. But she is not alone in being the only pupil to an entire school. Last week, the Mail covered the story . of eight-year-old Hu Yang who is the only pupil to attend his . elementary school in, Fujian Province, China. His . three-storey school building was built in 2005 and boasts 24 classrooms . - all of which are empty apart from the one where Yang receives his . lessons. Two years ago . the school had 80 students which dropped to 17 last year. But now there . is just Yang, who sits alone at a solo desk in the middle of an empty . room with a concrete floor. His . teacher Zheng Zhixiong said: 'Although we have only one student, we . teach him strictly with the plan made by the education bureau. 'He is a . good student and as teachers we also feel less pressure' Torn apart: Siqi lives with her father and 76-year-old grandmother in the village. Her mother has moved to a city for work . Home time: Siqi waves goodbye to her teacher Zhang Wanjia and a security guard . Running all the way home: Siqi manages to keep herself entertained despite having no children her own age to play with . He added: 'We try our best to let him feel the same as in other schools. As some day he may leave and join in another school.' Mr Zheng explained that the students had either quit school or had gone with their parents to the cities look for work. One of the last pupils to leave was Yang's 13-year-old sister. Fujian Province is a mountainous province in the south-east of China. It has a population of around 35million. Many people are forced to move away from the area where they were born to look for work in cities. Single student: Hu Yang is the only pupil at his school in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, where two teachers attend to his every need . Industrious: The eight-year-old was once one of 80 pupils at the institution but all the others have left . Wide world: Many of Yang's fellow students have moved away when their parents went to look for work . Hopeful: His teachers say that Yang may eventually go to a normal school where there are other students .","Zhang Siqi is the only pupil at a school in Nanou, south-east Fujian Province .

This is the terrifying moment a dedicated community doctor was brutally attacked and run over outside his surgery by a gang of thugs. Dr Srinivas Rao Dharmana was closing up his practice in Liverpool when a masked gang of five set upon him demanding his Rolex watch and keys to his Audi. The GP struggled with the robbers and was stabbed twice - which included him being slashed across the face. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Vicious: These CCTV images show the terrifying moment a gang of thugs brutally attacked a dedicated GP just as he left his surgery in Liverpool . Horrifying: Dr Srinivas Rao Dharmana was closing up his practice when the masked gang of five set upon him. He was stabbed twice, saved only by his thick coat . After attacking Dr Dharmana on the ground, the gang then drove the doctor's black Audi TT at him. He was thrown onto the bonnet as he attempted to stop them just after 7pm on Wednesday outside his surgery on Queens Drive in Walton. The brave medic has said he refuses to let the 'nightmare' stop him doing his job, and returned to work the day after the brutal attack. Dr Dharmana, 42, said: 'It's been a nightmare. I just came out of the surgery after the last patients had left and they were waiting. 'They grabbed me and asked for my watch. I tried to battle them off but they tried to stab me twice.'Luckily they didn't manage to because my thick coat stopped it going through.

'When they drove at me it was terrifying and I was completely shocked by the whole thing. I thought they were going to kill me. 'I normally have a carefree attitude when shutting up the surgery so it's been a real shock to the system.' The doctor, who has worked at the surgery for seven years, returned to work on Thursday after having hospital treatment on his face. After the attack, he also had to have an X-ray on his knee after one of the thugs tore ligaments in it after kicking him to the ground. Nasty: The gang were first pictured on CCTV entering into the grounds of the practice . Planned: The gang waited until Dr Dharmana, 42, walked out of the surgery . He added: 'I'm very cautious now when I'm in the dark alone, but I am not letting them scare me or stop me doing my job. I don't want them to think I was scared. 'They can't drive me away from my job and from helping the community here.' The father-of-two from Hightown, Merseyside, now hopes CCTV will help police track down the gang. He said: 'They were clever because they had covered their faces with balaclavas so I don't know how much help the footage will be.

Warned: Nick Clegg has been told by MPs that succession reform may open a Royal Pandora's Box . Nick Clegg was accused of ‘opening a Royal Pandora’s Box’ last night over plans to change the laws of succession to the throne. The Deputy Prime Minister told the Commons that rules giving precedence to men and the ban on heirs marrying Roman Catholics belonged to a ‘bygone era’. The change will mean that if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first child, due in July, is a girl, she would ascend the throne even if she had brothers. But MPs said the Succession to the Crown Bill was being ‘rushed’ through Parliament. Tory MP Nicholas Soames, a close friend of Prince Charles, said the proposals came from the ‘good wheeze school of Government’ and had not been properly thought through. Mr Soames, a grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, warned of the ‘unwanted, unintended consequences that often flow from tinkering with legislation of this type and could damage the crucial relationship between church and state’. He suggested removing the Catholic marriage ban might make it more likely that a Catholic would eventually succeed to the throne - sparking a constitutional crisis. This fear is also said to be shared by Prince Charles. Fellow Tory Ben Wallace said an oversight in the legislation could create a financial crisis for a future female monarch as she would not inherit the £350 million Duchy of Lancaster estate if she had a younger brother. Mr Wallace said the proposals would ‘disinherit the monarch’. The DUP’s Ian Paisley said it was ‘utter folly’ to introduce a measure to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Catholic, warning MPs the Bill opened the ‘Royal Pandora’s Box’. ‘We ought to be minimising points of potential crisis, not creating the certainty that there will be a crisis,’ he said. ‘We will create a potential set of circumstances where a future heir will have to make a choice between faith and throne, and such a choice, to discard a closely held faith for position, I believe simply creates another simply unjust choice that a person will have to make.’ Changes: The reform of the law will mean that the first-born child to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge due in July will ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl . Labour’s Paul Flynn questioned why the Bill was being rushed through. He said that by retaining the ban on a Catholic becoming monarch, the Bill ‘strengthens the prejudice of the past by not allowing all citizens the chance to become monarch’. He accused Mr Clegg of tinkering’ with the constitution, warning that the changes contained the ‘seeds of future problems that will be obvious in the years ahead’. Critic: Conservative MP, and friend of Prince Charles, Nicholas Soames . But Mr Clegg insisted the changes were necessary to bring the monarchy into the 21st century and end the system of primogeniture, which he said was based on the ‘supposed superiority of men’. He said: ‘The current rules of succession belong to a bygone era. They reflect old prejudices and old fears. ‘Today we don’t support laws which discriminate on either religious or gender grounds, they have no place in modern Britain and certainly not in our monarchy, an an institution central to our constitution, to the Commonwealth and to our national identity too.’ Mr Clegg told the Commons that the 16 Commonwealth countries only agreed the Bill in writing just hours before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced they were having a baby. He said he was ‘sympathetic’ to calls to alter the rules for the inheritance of hereditary titles. But he said it was vital to keep the changes simple so that they would be accepted by the other Commonwealth nations. Mr Clegg said the ban on Catholic marriages were part of historic anti-Catholic laws that had mostly now been swept away. ‘Catholics couldn’t vote, they were excluded from all professions and public offices, they couldn’t go to university, couldn’t teach, couldn’t be the guardian of a child, couldn’t buy land with a lease of more than 31 years, couldn’t own a horse worth more than £5,’ he said. Mr Paisley joked he would not refer to the time when Catholics suffered widespread discrimination as ‘those Halcyon Days’. MPs backed the law without a vote.","Change means Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's firstborn would ascend the throne - even if it is a girl and eventually had brothers .

And yesterday, the American tennis legend and his wife, model and actress Brooklyn Decker, were both overcome by emotion as he lost in four sets to Juan Martin del Potro in the tournament's fourth round. Wearing a grey Andy Roddick Foundation T-shirt and a black leather skirt, the Battleship actress kept her eyes . hidden behind a pair of black sunglasses. Emotional: Brooklyn Decker sheds a tear as her husband Andy Roddick plays his last professional game .

'The . last five games was hard,' Roddick said after the match. 'Once I got down that break I . could barely look at my box. I'm a little overwhelmed right now.' The seventh-seeded del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, won 6-7 (1), 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-4 in a match spread over two days.

More people would vote to stay in the European Union than exit for the first time since David Cameron became Prime Minister. Downing Street today announced Mr Cameron will deliver his long-awaited and much-trailed speech on Britain’s’ EU membership on Wednesday. He is expected to promise a referendum on severing ties with Brussels. As the debate about Europe rages, a new opinion poll shows that the number of voters who want to remain part of the EU has suddenly overtaken those calling for withdrawal. In-out question: For the first time since David Cameron became PM more people would vote to stay in the EU than leave, according to a series of opinion polls by YouGov . In the latest YouGov survey, people were asked how they would vote if there was a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. Forty per cent of people said they would vote to remain while 34 per cent would vote to leave, according to the poll carried out on January 17 and 18. It is a dramatic reversal of opinion since November last year when 51 per cent said they would back withdrawal while just 30 per cent wanted to stay in. The shift in public attitudes to Brussels comes after months of speculation about Mr Cameron’s long-awaited speech on how he wants to claw back powers to London. It suggests the widespread public debate has focused the minds of voters on the merits of remaining in the EU. Mr Cameron today met Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip in Downing Street and briefed him on his long-awaited Europe speech . Labour's lead over the Conservatives has been slashed to just five points, according to an ICM poll released today. The survey for The Guardian put Ed Miliband's party on 38 per cent (down two points since a similar poll last month), David Cameron's Tories on 33 per cent (up one), with Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats on 15 per cent (up two) and the UK Independence Party on 6 per cent (down one). Labour's advantage is the narrowest recorded by ICM since August last year, and follows a period in which the party has consistently racked up double-digit leads over the Conservatives. It is likely to spark speculation that Mr Cameron's standing has been boosted by his handling of the crises in Algeria and Mali and by reports he is planning to offer an in/out referendum on future British membership of the European Union. (ICM Research interviewed 1,001 adults between January 18 and 20.) YouGov's Peter Kellner said: 'As . always with sharp movements in public attitudes, we shall not know for . some time whether we are seeing a blip or a trend. 'Britain . and the EU has been the top domestic political news story for the past . fortnight. Maybe, when it recedes from the headlines, views about the EU . will revert to their normal ""peacetime"" default position in which the . centre of gravity lies somewhere between scepticism and hostility.' Last . week a separate YouGov survey showed half of people would vote to stay . in the European Union if Mr Cameron succeeds in negotiating a new . relationship, repatriating powers to Westminster. He had been due to deliver the speech . in Amsterdam on Friday but it was called off at the last moment as the . PM reacted to the Algeria hostage crisis. He will instead deliver it in central London on Wednesday morning. However, . extracts released in advance showed how he will use the speech to warn . EU leaders that Britain could leave the 27-nation bloc if three key . concerns are not resolved. And . there is growing speculation that he will announce an in/out referendum . to be held after the 2015 general election, but rule out legislation . during this parliament. Mr . Cameron today briefly met Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip in . Downing Street, and was expected to brief him on the contents of the . speech. He has already . spoken to European leaders including Germany’s Angela Merkel, French . President Francois Hollande and Dutch PM Mark Rutte. When . Mr Cameron outlined his plans to Barack Obama on Thursday night the US . President warned Britain must remain part of a 'strong European Union'. The . US President used a call to London to stress the EU's role in spreading . 'peace, prosperity, and security' around the world. Downing Street was . forced to deny a rift, insisting the call was 'friendly'. The survey will be a welcome boost to Mr Cameron on the eve of his speech when he is expected to promise voters a say on continuing to remain part of the EU . Mr Cameron will use his speech to warn that Britain could ‘drift towards the exit’ from the EU unless there is real change in Brussels. He identified the crisis in the eurozone, the challenge of economic competitiveness and the issue of democratic legitimacy as key issues which must be resolved in negotiations on the future shape of the EU. Asked why Mr Cameron would now be delivering his speech in London, his spokesman said: ‘We were planning to give it in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, that didn't prove possible and Wednesday morning in London fits better with the Prime Minister's schedule.’ The spokesman added: ‘There is a debate going on across the EU. There is also an active debate going on here in the UK. The Prime Minister's speech will be reflecting both those aspects.’ Former defence secretary Liam Fox (left) and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles have both seen Mr Cameron's speech and given it their backing . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today he had seen Mr Cameron's speech and was ‘very happy’ with its content. Asked whether the Prime Minister could quell unrest over Europe among his backbenchers, Mr Pickles said: ‘I think so. I think there is a willingness and a desire to come together.’ Earlier this month, Mr Pickles said he hoped Britain could remain a member of the EU, but suggested it should not do so ‘at any price’. Former defence secretary Liam Fox, a leading Tory Eurosceptic, said yesterday that he was ‘broadly satisfied’ with what he has been told. ‘If that is the speech that is finally delivered, a great many of us will think that it's a speech that we've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver.’ Labour's Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, said: We understand and support the Prime Minister’s decision to cancel his speech on Friday because of unfolding events in Algeria. 'The truth is the reason this speech has now been delayed for over 6 months is because David Cameron simply doesn’t know what to say. 'The gap between what his backbenchers demand and what the country needs has literally left him speechless, stranded between national and party interest.' David Cameron said it was vital . Britain never forgets the events of the Holocaust as he signed a . memorial book to commemorate the lives of those killed in the genocide. The . Prime Minister met Auschwitz survivor Freda Wineman, 89, who said . future generations should continue to honour those who died at the hands . of the Nazis. Mrs Wineman, from Lyon in France, has . previously spoken of how she was separated from her mother for the final . time by Dr Josef Mengele, dubbed the Butcher of Auschwitz. David Cameron signs the Book of Commitment ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day as Holocaust survivor Freda Wineman looks on . Mr Cameron wrote: 'We commemorate the lives lost in the European Holocaust and think also of those killed more recently in Rwanda, Cambodia, Darfur and Bosnia.' Today, Mr Cameron said: 'It must be very harrowing to bring all those memories back.' Mrs Wineman replied: 'It is very necessary. We must remember and we must never forget what happened.' They were joined in Downing Street by representatives of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which works to raise understanding of the atrocity.

In an unlikely sequence of events, TOWIE's Lauren Goodger has emerged as the celebrity with the wardrobe women most wish to emulate. The reality TV star has been responsible for the sale of most 'copycat' outfits at one particular shop, followed by maths whizz Carol Vorderman, presenter Melanie Sykes, and fellow Essex girl Amy Childs. And the shop in question? Hybrid, an Essex fashion boutique which supplies clothes to celebrities based in the south of England, which may explain why TOWIE's Sam Faiers and Hollyoaks' Gemma Merna made the list ahead of more traditional sartorial icons such as the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham. Lauren Goodger, left, and Carol Vorderman, right, topped the list of women whose clothes British women most wish to emulate, according to research by Essex fashion boutique Hybrid . According to the fashion outlet, more female shoppers have been snapping up dresses she has worn than any other star. Other celebrities who have a dramatically positive effect on sales are former Countdown brainbox Carol Vorderman, model Melanie Sykes and former TOWIE girl Amy Childs. It also emerged Waterloo Road actress Chelsee Healey has completely the opposite effect, along with Lauren's TOWIE co-star Gemma Collins. Hybrid saw reductions in sales after the two women wore their clothes. Another TOWIE star, Billi Mucklow, also has a detrimental effect on dress sales - as does Desperate Scousewives star and self-proclaimed 'man-eater' Layla Flaherty. Melanie Sykes, left, and former TOWIE girl Amy Childs, right, are two of the women who cause spikes in sales of clothes they have been seen wearing, according to Essex boutique Hybrid . Former page three girl Nicola McLean is another celebrity who does nothing for the clothes she chooses, according to the statistics. Danielle Bigaignon, from Hybridfashion.com said: 'Girls relate to celebrities who they look up to or aspire to be like. 'We feel the female celebrities who wear our designs are those who are portrayed as very down-to-earth, confident and at ease with their shape. 'Lauren Goodger, for instance, is in the media regularly exposing her fuller figure, and girls look up to her for that. 'She has inspired girls to embrace their curves and not to have body hang ups which stop them living their life. 'This has in turn boomed sales of dresses worn by Lauren in particular, as girls feel they are the designs that will help them look as good as her.' 1.     Lauren Goodger, 26 . 2.     Carol Vorderman, 52 . 3.      Melanie Sykes, 42 . 4.      Amy Childs, 22 . 5.      Sam Faiers, 22 . 6.      Gemma Merna, 28 . 7.      Charlotte Jackson, 33 . 8.      Katie Piper, 29 . 9.      Charley Bird, 23 . 10.    Maria Fowler, 26 . 1.      Chelsee Healey, 24 . 2.      Gemma Collins, 31 . 3.      Billi Mucklow, 24 . 4.      Layla Flaherty, 29 . 5.      Nicola McLean, 31 . 6.      Chloe Sims, 30 . 7.      Imogen Thomas, 30 . 8.      Josie Gibson, 27 . 9.      Jodie Marsh, 34 . 10.    Kate Thornton, 38 .

Ms Bigaignon added that Carol Vorderman has inspired the slightly older woman to also embrace their figures, teaching them that 'you are never too old to wear a body-con pencil dress which can make you look and feel fabulous'. She added: 'She is a great example of someone who has preserved their youth and gives Hybrid a wide target audience with ladies of the older generation sporting Hybrid to work, events and functions.' Also on the winning list were TOWIE'S Sam Faiers, 22, and Gemma Merna, 28, who plays Carmel Valentine in Hollyoaks.

Clothes worn by Imogen Thomas, left, and Chelsee Healey, right, do not sell well . But Chelsee Healey was joined in the hall of shame by TOWIE'S Chloe Sims, model and TV presenter Imogen Thomas, and Big Brother star Josie Gibson. Danielle Bigaignon added: 'Celebrities such as Chelsee Healey are renowned for having very bad taste in fashion. 'Regardless of her wearing a Hybrid dress or not she has these negative connotations which she hasn't shaken off yet. 'When Chelsea was spotted in Hybrid it had no impact on sales at all as we feel girls wouldn't naturally look to her for style inspiration.","Research done by Hybrid boutique in Essex .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 06:32 EST, 21 June 2011 . The woman whose terminally-ill grandchild was taunted by another mother on Facebook claimed today she is being subjected to a fresh wave of online abuse. Rebecca Rose, of Michigan, whose grandchild Kathleen Edward is dying from Huntington's Disease and whose plight sparked a national outcry, has complained of more abuse to Trenton police. Mrs Rose told Trenton Patch her daughter (Kathleen's aunt) 'can’t even sit outside without (being called) a retard' and she has received more nasty messages. Unhappy: Rebecca Rose, left, whose grandchild Kathleen Edward is terminally ill and was taunted by Jennifer Petkov, right, says she is still being targeted . It follows criticism of neighbour Jennifer Petkov, known as the 'Devil of Detroit Street', who previously admitted taunting seven-year-old Kathleen. Terminally-ill: Kathleen Edward, seven, is dying from Huntington's Disease . Mrs Petkov, 33, and her husband Scott had posted a photo of the terminally ill schoolgirl on Facebook above a set of crossed bones. Mrs Petkov was forced to move home in February and apologised for what she did after attracting international condemnation. Now Ms Rose has given police documents showing more nasty Facebook posts that were allegedly made by the Petrov couple, reported Trenton Patch. One post she submitted in a complaint said: 'Detroit St. Party, When that kid dies, cause boys and girls it’s to happen.' Another post on her Facebook page said: 'Dead and gone, only a few more hours till party time, I’m going to visit a grave and take a p***.' One post came a day before the anniversary of the death of Kathleen’s mother, Laura Edward, 24, who died from Huntington’s in June 2009. A police report said Ms Rose was 'crying and extremely upset' by the latest messages, reported Trenton Patch. She has served Personal Protection Orders against the Petkov couple, which say they are not allowed to communicate with her. Horrifying: An image created by Jennifer Petrov on Facebook of Kathleen Edwards's face superimposed on to a skull and crossbones . But police said while Ms Rose was . writing a witness statement she said 'I can’t take it anymore' and ran . out of the police station in tears. Kathleen . is in the last stages of degenerative disease Huntington's and Ms Rose . said doctors believe she may die within a year’s time. Mrs Petkov was forced to move house in February after she was sentenced to 18 months of probation for assault and battery. She had allegedly tried to run over a neighbour's friend with her car as she was crossing the road last October. Speechless: Another Facebook grab shows an image created by Jennifer Petrov of Kathleen's mother Laura in the arms of the Grim Reaper . It is believed the nasty comments . began over an unanswered text message relating to a party held by Ms . Rose, reported Trenton Patch. Ms Rose is understood to have . received a text message when she was holding a birthday party from Mrs . Petkov, who asked if her children could come over. But because she did not respond to the text message fast enough, the feud is said to have begun. The dying girl’s father Robert . Edwards, 26, made an appeal to the Petkov family last October to leave . them alone and make no more comments about their daughter. 'Death Machine': The truck that the Petrovs used to tow a coffin before the Edwards's house - after hearing that Laura Edwards had died . ‘The police told us they were shocked that we haven’t gone over there and beat the hell out of her,' he told the Detroit News at the time. When Mrs Edwards died the Petkovs drove a pick-up truck up and down the street, adorned with a coffin and carrying the slogan 'Death Machine'. Mrs Petkov also posted a mocked-up picture of Mrs Edward in the arms of the grim reaper at one point. Asked why she escalated the ugly feud, Jennifer Petkov said it was for 'personal satisfaction' and 'because it burns Rebecca Rose's a** raw'. But she later apologised after receiving international condemnation. Kathleen’s family were contacted by dozens of people from countries including Britain and Germany after a video report of the story went viral.","Jennifer Petkov admitted making taunts last October .

Cradled in his arms, Barry McCarney is caught on CCTV desperately trying to bring his girlfriend's dying daughter back to life. But the haunting footage, captured in Erne Hospital, in Northern Ireland, disguises the horrific reality of what has just happened. McCarney is no desperate father giving the kiss of life to his 15-month-old step-child. Instead, he is the perverted monster who abused Millie Martin so badly that she died of her injuries. Yesterday, a judge sitting at Dungannon Crown Court branded the 33-year-old's crimes despicable. He described the December 2009 murder as 'almost beyond understanding.' Scroll down for video . Guilty: McCarney, pictured with his 15-month-old victim in his arms, was found guilty of her murder by a unanimous verdict . Jailed: Barry McCarney pictured at A&E department of the Erne Hospital with Mille Martin in his arms on the evening she was admitted, she died from head injuries the following day . Horrific: Millie died in hospital a day after she was admitted with devastating injuries . Behind bars: McCarney will find out what minimum tariff he must serve in the new year . McCarney, from County Tyrone, met Millie's mother Rachael Martin just three months before the little girl's death. He quickly eased his way into the family home in Enniskillen which allowed him access to Millie. During a ten-week trial, the court heard how he had physically and sexually abused the toddler until she was left with a number of fatal injuries, including the head wound that killed her. A pathologist found that Millie had suffered 21 cracked ribs, seven of which were old, while the rest had happened in the ten days before her death. Multiple bruises were also found on the youngster's body along with a clearly visible oval shaped bump on her forehead. During the post-mortem examination, the pathologist found injuries to her  abdomen caused by punching or prodding which would also have been fatal. Millie had also been sexually assaulted.The prosecution described the attacks on her as vile and sadistic. Tragic: Barry McCarney, left, was jailed for killing Millie Martin, right, pictured just days before her death . McCarney blamed Millie's mother Rachael, claiming at trial that she had inflicted the injuries on her own daughter and that he was sickened by her death. Speaking only through his barrister, he alleged that Ms Martin did not want social services involved because she had done these 'terrible things' herself. But in a case . with no forensic evidence to suggest who inflicted Millie's injuries, . the jury rejected McCarney's claims and accepted that Ms Martin had . unwittingly let a monster into her home, taking just three hours to . reach a unanimous verdict. He was found guilty of murder, sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm. Ms Martin sobbed as she was cleared of allowing her daughter's death through willful neglect. She was heard to say that justice had been done for her daughter. McCarney's relatives shouted 'innocent' as they left the courtroom. Meanwhile Ms Martin's family issued a statement saying the family would now be able to grieve properly as a result of the verdict. They described the last three years as a 'waking nightmare' and described McCarney as a 'disgusting individual'. They also questioned why Ms Martin was ever prosecuted in the first place. Her brother, Matthew, speaking on behalf of the family said the police decision to prosecute her was 'shocking' at a time when she should have been left to grieve for Baby Millie. McCarney will be sentenced in the New Year. Neil Anderson, head of the NSPCC, said Millie will be remembered as the victim of 'one of the most horrific cases of child abuse Northern Ireland has ever seen'. He added: 'One clear message from this deeply disturbing case is the need for vigilance among healthcare professionals, family, friends, neighbours and the community as a whole. 'It is vitally important that everyone who has a role in working with and caring for children is aware of the signs of abuse. It is also essential that having recognised the signs of abuse that appropriate and timely action is taken.'","Barry McCarney was jailed for life at Dungannon Crown Court for the murder of Millie Martin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 7 August 2011 . Carlos Slim, the world’s richest man, lost about $6.7 billion in the last week. The Mexican billionaire’s stock portfolio, measured in U.S. dollars, has dropped about 9.5 percent since July 29 and is valued at about $64.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a 7.2 per cent slide in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. No time for smiling: Carlos Slim, right, lost $6.7 billion in the last few days. The world's second richest Bill Gates, left, didn't have the best of weeks either . Mr Slim, 71, has taken a hit as Mexico’s benchmark IPC index dropped 6.4 per cent and the peso slid 2.3 per cent against the dollar on concerns that the flagging U.S. economy will hurt demand for assets in its southern neighbour. The removal of three of Slim’s companies from the IPC index has made matters worse for the billionaire. 'He’s been particularly hurt by those companies leaving the IPC,' said Leon Cabrera, a trader at Mexico City-based Vanguardia Casa de Bolsa. 'It reflects the nervousness out there. It’s part of being in the market.' America Movil SAB, the biggest wireless carrier in the Americas and Slim’s largest asset, has declined a relatively benign six per cent this week. Its Telefonos de Mexico SAB unit has been Slim’s only gainer in Mexico, rising 11 per cent on the parent company’s offer to buy out minority shareholders. Sweating all over the world: A capital market expert wipes his brow in Frankfurt on Friday as he watches billions of dollars disappear in the global market meltdown . The Standard & Poor’s index extended its decline on Friday, falling 0.1 percent at close. The IPC rose 1.1 percent, and America Movil gained 1.1 percent. The drop in America Movil, which has fallen 20 per cent this year as regulators seek to put a dent in its 70 per cent share of Mexico’s mobile-phone market, is an opportunity for investors to buy stock in a solid company, Cabrera said yesterday in a telephone interview. Even measured in Mexican pesos, Slim’s holdings have dropped about 7.3 per cent this week, a bigger decline than the broader Mexican market. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores SAB, the Mexican stock exchange operator, said on August 2 that it would drop Slim’s Grupo Financiero Inbursa SAB, Inmuebles Carso SAB and Grupo Carso SAB from the IPC index as part of an annual rebalancing. Inbursa, Slim’s financial services firm, slid 8.2 per cent this week, while Inmuebles Carso, a real estate firm, declined 11 per cent, and Grupo Carso, a holding company with retail and construction units, fell 14 per cent. Slim was named the world’s richest man for a second year in a row by Forbes magazine in March. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, second and third on the magazine’s list, have had better weeks, at least for their biggest holdings. Gates’s Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) dropped 6.3 per cent this week. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) slid 3.9 per cent. Arturo Elias, a spokesman for Slim, declined to comment in an email.","Mexican tycoon's stock drops nearly 10 per cent .

"By . Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 18:11 EST, 28 November 2012 . A morbidly obese woman, dubbed the 'half ton killer' after being charged with her nephew's murder, showed off her dramatic weight loss today as she broke her silence on the ordeal. Mayra Rosales originally told police she had accidentally killed . two-year-old Eliseo by rolling on top of him . while babysitting four years ago. However her 1,100lb frame became her defense - as investigators proved she was so heavy she could not have committed the crime. Rosales, from Texas, said on Tuesday that she despised the nickname. She appeared to have lost a significant . amount of weight in photos posted on her . Facebook page. Comments from supporters suggested that the 31-year-old had her stomach stapled . earlier this month. WARNING: Graphic medical images . Dramatic: Rosales has lost significant weight from her 1,100lb frame since she was acquitted of murder in 2008 after undergoing a series of surgeries . The truth at last: 'Half-ton killer' Mayra Rosales broke her silence today (left), saying she forgave her sister Jaime despite almost taking the fall for her nephew's murder . The medical evidence at Mayra's 2008 . murder trial in Texas revealed she had covered for sister Jaime who beat . her son to death with a hairbrush. Rosales, . 31, broke her silence on Tuesday to say she forgives her sister and has . 'nothing against her' even though she had allowed her to take the fall. Rosales appeared on chat show Anderson via satellite from Houston, Texas. When host Anderson Cooper asked why she had forgiven her sister for the brutal murder, Rosales said: 'She's still my sister and I love her.' The morbidly obese woman was charged with murder in March 2008 after she covered for Jaime when Eliseo was taken to hospital as a result of head injuries. When it was proven by the defense that Mayra could not have committed the crime, her sister went on the run. A few months later, Jaime was . persuaded to return to Texas where she stood trial. Pleading guilty to the lesser charge of causing injury to a child, Jaime was sentenced to 15 years in jail. She will soon be eligible for parole after serving two years. Her three other children are now being cared for by their grandmother. Not going anywhere: Mayra (pictured with her husband Bernie) told police that she killed her nephew by accident by rolling on top of him while babysitting . Rosales was found innocent after . doctors revealed that the . boy could only have died from a blow to the head - which could not have . been struck by Rosales because she was too big to lift her arm. In 2008, shortly before Eliseo was murdered, Mayra and her husband Bernie had moved in with her sister Jaime in Sullivan City, Texas. Jaime had agreed to be a full-time carer when Mayra became so large she struggled to walk. However despite the fact that Mayra was . almost entirely bed-ridden, Jaime would often go out, leaving Mayra in . charge of her four children. Killer: Mayra Rosales said today that she still loved her sister Jaime (left) despite the fact she beat her son Eliseo (right) to death with a hairbrush after he misbehaved . 'I was more of a mother than Jaime,' Mayra has previously said. In March 2008, Mayra witnessed her sister hit Eliseo Jr. ‘Jaime . was giving my nephew breakfast and he didn’t want to eat,’ Mayra said. ‘I told her if he was crying he wasn’t going to eat, but she got mad, . got a brush and hit him on his arms, legs and head which left a bump.' Later that day, Eliseo Jr began suffering breathing problems and Mayra called an ambulance. Jaime . phoned her sister from the hospital, sobbing that police would not . let her see her son unless she told them who had hurt him. Manpower: It took ten men to remove Mayra in a removal truck from her sister's home in 2008 . Jaime begged Mayra to tell the authorities she was responsible for the injuries. In a move she would come to bitterly regret, Mayra accepted. Rosales said she did so to help her sister so that she would not lose her other children. ‘I . told the investigators that I rolled over to the edge of my bed to . where Junior was and my hand slipped and I fell on him with my hand. I . fell. I was the one to blame. But only by accident,' she explained. When her two-year-old nephew later died, Mayra Rosales was arrested and charged with capital murder. At her trial, the court heard that the fatal injuries sustained by . the boy were consistent with a blow to the head and could not have been . caused by someone falling on him. 'It would have required her to have . to swing her arm to strike the child on the head but she could never . move her arm in that manner,’ said Mayra’s lawyer Sergio Valdez. ‘We . knew that her size was her best defence because she couldn’t move her . arm.' Years of treatment: Mayra Rosales posted this image on her Facebook after undergoing weight loss surgery earlier this month . Despite the physical impossibility of . Mayra committing such a crime, the authorities had to conduct a full trial, . with Mayra as chief suspect. Months . went by before a courtroom was found that was large enough to . accommodate Mayra, and doors and walls had to be removed to fit her in. The stress of the case caused Mayra's . health to deteriorate to the point that she had to be admitted to a . hospital for the super-obese. When a regular ambulance was too small to transport her, a . removal truck had to be used. ‘I . began retaining more water in my legs and they got so hard,’ she said. ‘The skin is so stretched out that it hurts. It feels like my legs are . going to pop like a balloon. 'Sometimes the sores open up and water oozes . out. I wondered if we should amputate.' She added: 'Sometimes I got mad. I tried not to show . it that much because I didn’t want anyone feeling bad for me. 'It was . like I was in prison, with chains holding me there so I couldn’t move.’ Abusive: Jaime Rosales was found guilty of causing injury to a child and sentenced to 15 years in jail.

A man Oregon prosecutors described as 'evil' has been found guilty of multiple felonies stemming from his 'methodical' plot to kill the father of his grandson. Lester 'Earl' Reger, . 57, of Ontario, found guilty of attempted aggravated murder, . conspiracy to commit murder, felony possession of a firearm and assault . in the second degree. Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norris described Reger's horrific plot including a plan to turn his garage into a 'death chamber'. Scroll down for video . Death chamber: Reger had covered his garage in plastic wrap to hid the evidence . Evil: Prosecutors called the Reger's plan 'diabolical' 'It was the entire methodical plan. It was the plastic. It was . packing the car so that they'd have room for the body,' Norris said. Reger was sentenced to 11 years in . prison. Reger, his wife Erlene Reger and . two men, plotted to lure Ramon Fry into the Regers' garage where they would murder him. Erlene was found guilty of her part that month and is now . serving a 90-month prison sentence. The garage had already been plastic-wrapped so they could hide the evidence. 'In 26 years of violence, very few things have scared me as much as . walking into that garage that night,' Norris said. 'It was a death chamber.' Reger faked an arm injuring so he could hide a gun in a sling. Then he asked Fry if he could do him a favor. Guilty: Reger was sentenced to more than 11 years . By his side: Reger's wife Erlene is already serving 90-months for her involvement in the plot . 'They ask him to pick these three little pieces of wood up [from . under a work bench], and when he was down there picking those up, the . defendant Earl Reger put the 25-caliber gun up to the back of his head . and pulled the trigger and tried to execute him,' Norris told KTVB. Regers thought Fry was abusing . their grandchild despite investigations by multiple agencies clearing him. The shot didn't kill Fry who began to run, while Reger again fired at him. Fry was able to escape before they murdered him. 'Once Ramon Fry was dead, they would have taken the plastic down, . wrapped the body up, they had duct tape and additional plastic . available,' Norris said. 'They had a change of clothes laid out in the garage. They . also had a change of clothes in the car.' Another defendant, Todd Mulvaine, had already dug a grave on his own property to hide Fry's body. Hearse: The Regers already had a grave waiting to bury Fry's body . Mulvaine has also been found guilty of charges stemming from his involvement. 'This was so methodically planned. But for the fact that the first . shot didn't kill him, they might have gotten away with this,' Norris . said. Reger had testified in his own defense, claiming the garage was plastic wrapped to refinish and spray furniture. He also claimed Fry was the one who brought the gun into the garage. 'Next thing I know, I see a pistol in his hand and it goes off. I . grabbed the gun from him and he tackles me. As I'm starting to go down, I . put the gun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger,' Reger told jurors. Reger claimed he was on his back with Fry above him, and that he then fired on him again. 'Probably the best thing I ever heard was when I called the victim . yesterday and told him, 'We're going to sentence at 10:30 tomorrow . morning. Can you make it? And if you can't we'll reschedule.' And he . just said, 'You know these people have taken enough from me. I have my . son tomorrow. You sentence him and tell me what happens,'' Norris said. Watch video here .","Lester Reger, .

India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Tuesday by one of the five men charged with the gang rape and murder of a student in a bus to shift the case out of the capital on grounds that the atmosphere was too surcharged to ensure a fair trial. Last month's assault on the 23-year-old woman on a New Delhi bus triggered an outpouring of anger and grief and calls for swift punishment for the five men and a juvenile who will be tried separately. One of the accused, Mukesh Singh, approached the Supreme Court urging the trial be held anywhere but New Delhi, saying both the police and the judiciary were under intense public pressure on the case and that a fair trial was not possible. Charges: A police van arrives at a court i Delhi carrying the five men accused of attacking a 23-year-old woman on a bus . Protests: Women gathered outside the court with banners stating 'No dress is an invitation to rape' A bench headed by the Chief Justice . Altamas Kabir will hear the petition on Tuesday, Singh's lawyer, Manohar . Lal Sharma, said on Monday. The petition came as a fast-track court took up the case against the five men who face the death penalty if convicted of the assault on the woman, who was on her way home from a movie, accompanied by a male friend. The two were lured into the bus and beaten. The woman was so badly assaulted that she died in a Singapore hospital two weeks later. The five men, who were produced in court on Monday, will plead not guilty, according to their lawyers. Two defence lawyers said their clients had been tortured in custody to give confessions. Police have declined to comment on the allegations. Media circus: A.P Singh, lawyer for one of the accused, speaks to journalists about the hearing . V.K. Anand, a second defendant's lawyer, also spoke to the press: One of the defendants has said that the level of attention means they will not get a fair trial in Delhi . A.P. Singh, a lawyer for Vinay Sharma, one of the accused, said that he had moved an application in the court, asking for a bone test for his client, claiming he was a juvenile and that he should be tried separately. Sharma's age according to the police charge-sheet has been given as 20. Under Indian rape laws, anyone below the age of 18 has to be tried by a court dealing with juveniles and if convicted has to be sent to a correctional home rather than prison. The jail sentence is also a maximum of three years. Police are already trying to reconfirm the age of an alleged sixth member of the group who has given his age as 17. The attack has so incensed ordinary Indians that some have demanded that anyone above the age of 16 should be treated as an adult. Another defence lawyer, V.K. Anand, said he had moved an application urging the court to make its hearings open to the media. Under Indian laws, a rape trial is usually held in camera to protect the identity of the victim. The case was adjourned until Thursday, when the court will hear arguments over the charges that the police have brought against the five men, all friends who allegedly went on a joy ride on Dec. 16, looking for women. Once the court has heard the arguments, it will frame the charges against the men and at that point it will ask if they plead guilty. If not, the trial will proceed.

Chelsea hope new TV camera angles will help Eden Hazard escape with a three-match ban after his fracas with Swansea ball boy Charlie Morgan. As the FA’s disciplinary chiefs examined the evidence - with a decision expected on Friday on whether Hazard will receive an extended ban - the focus sharpened on Morgan’s role in the ugly episode. South Wales Police had been reluctant to become involved, but their hand was forced after three members of the public made complaints about the Chelsea winger’s tussle with Morgan at the Liberty Stadium. Flashpoint: Chelsea's Eden Hazard clashed with the teenage ball boy who is lying on the ball . Grabbed: Hazard reaches for the football as the ball boy writhes on the ground . VIDEO: See Eden Hazard's apology to Chelsea TV immediately after the match . The 17-year-old student is the son of . Martin Morgan - a Swansea director, the club’s biggest shareholder and, . with a £42million fortune, one of the financial forces behind their . rise to the Barclays Premier League. Not surprisingly, the Welsh club have . decided to take no action against  Morgan Jnr, who retreated to the . family’s £1.5m mansion in Carmarthenshire yesterday. As he did, many . people inside football took Hazard’s side and criticised the teenager, . who had boasted on Twitter before the Capital One Cup semi-final second . leg how he was an expert at wasting time. ‘The king of all ball boys is back making his final appearance #needed #for #timewasting’ he posted. His Twitter page also contains . photographs of a millionaire lifestyle which includes first-class air . travel, broken champagne bottles, designer labels and staggering bar . bills. It all supports the notion he may be . the richest ball boy in the Barclays Premier League, the heir to a . family fortune built on a travel business and boutique hotels who is . even wealthier than many of the players. Morgan has worked as a Swansea ball . boy since he was 12 and said he had been called up by his father for . Wednesday’s game because some of the regulars could not make it to the . game because of the snow. The ball came his way with 10 minutes . to go and with Swansea still holding their 2-0 advantage from the first . leg. He refused to hand it back to Hazard, rolling on to the ball and . smothering it with his body until Hazard kicked it clear. Anger: Swansea's Ashley Williams (centre) is held back as he tries to confront Eden Hazard (off camera) Sending off: Chelsea's Eden Hazard (#17) receives a red card from referee Chris Foy for violent conduct . Chelsea claim another ball boy had . appeared to be wasting time 10 minutes earlier. Hazard was again close . to the action and remonstrated with the referee. The FA’s disciplinary team spent . yesterday studying replays of the incident from different camera angles, . including one which appears to show Hazard made fairly clean contact . with the ball. Footage shown at the time, together with the dramatic . reaction of the teenager, suggested Hazard had administered a hefty boot . to Morgan’s ribs on the way to the ball. Helping hand: Chelsea's Demba Ba (right) checks on the ball boy after he had clashed with Eden Hazard . Boast: The 17-year-old earlier wrote on Twitter that he was 'needed for timewasting' Former Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat . Nevin branded Morgan’s actions ‘disgraceful and unacceptably brattish’, . and claimed the ball boy was ‘acting’ when he claimed to be hurt. ‘He’s . only got one job and that’s to give the ball back,’ Nevin told BBC . Radio 5 Live. ‘And what does he do? He keeps the ball.’ Fulham manager Martin Jol said he . would have done the same as Hazard. ‘I can see why he did it,’ said the . Dutchman. ‘The boy shouldn’t lie on the ball and play rugby with it.’ Wealthy: Charlie Morgan (left), the ball boy who . was kicked by Eden Hazard during a League Cup game last night, is the . son of multi-millionaire businessman Martin Morgan (right) Property: The self-made tycoon is the owner of the luxury Morgans hotel in Swansea, pictured . Boasting: Charlie posted a picture of a broken . bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne on his Twitter page, as well as one . of torn-up betting slips . Many professional footballers tweeted . in support of the Chelsea player, with Michael Owen assailing Morgan’s . reaction as ‘scandalous’. Rather than basking in the glory of . reaching their first major final after beating the European champions, . Swansea were on the defensive yesterday. Vice-chairman Leigh Dineen . said: ‘We don’t line up the ball boys and ask them to waste time. 'The . boy went to pick up the ball and he fell over. He didn’t hold on to the . ball for a minute. It happened over about 20 seconds. Travelling in style: Charlie put up this picture of himself in Virgin Atlantic's upper class . Destination: The teenager on holiday in Las Vegas, in another picture he posted to Twitter . 'Had it been 2-0 to . Chelsea, I don’t think Hazard would have been anywhere near the ball. But I don’t think Hazard deliberately went to kick him.’ Swansea first-team coach Alan Curtis added: ‘We never gave them instructions to slow the game down. It’s never been the case.’ Hazard was sent off by referee Chris . Foy for violent conduct, which will carry an automatic three-match ban, . ruling the winger out of games against Brentford, Reading and Newcastle. Pricey: A photo of the Louis Vuitton store in Las Vegas which Charlie put on Twitter . Shared: The teenager retweeted someone else's . £120,000 receipt with the caption, 'This is huge time', and also let his . friends know about the good weather at his holiday destination . Chelsea do not intend to appeal but the FA can opt to pass the case on . to an independent commission if they suspect three matches is . insufficient punishment. They were also gathering evidence from . the match officials and South Wales Police, and spoke to officials at . Swansea to ascertain the ball boy’s version of events. Chelsea hope the video, together with . Hazard’s public apology immediately after the game and his previous . record of good behaviour, can bring the case down on their side. In pain: Morgan (second right) is ushered away from the sidelines following the incident with Hazard . Morgan was invited into the visitors’ dressing room after the game and spoke to Hazard. They apologised to . each other, according to Chelsea’s interim manager Rafa Benitez. The . ball boy and Swansea agreed they would not lodge a police complaint but . the local force had three complaints from the public which they are . obliged to follow. Chelsea, meanwhile, will discipline . Hazard according to their internal procedure and within the PFA limit of . two weeks’ wages, which would be a maximum of £340,000. Striker: Eden Hazard is pictured earlier in the match (left) and winning an award in Paris in May 2011 (right) It was headline . news in his native Belgium. He became the most expensive Belgian . footballer ever when he moved from Lille to Chelsea for £32m last year . and was in touch with friends at home yesterday to insist he had done . nothing wrong. It is not his first brush with . controversy. He was widely criticised when he was substituted after 60 . minutes in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Turkey. Hazard stormed straight . down the tunnel and was later filmed eating a hamburger nearby when the . game was still going on. Hurt: The ballboy (centre) is ushered away from the sidelines following the incident with Eden Hazard . Should Eden Hazard face long ban for ball boy kick? This did nothing for his popularity . but he does not have a reputation for a violent temper. Those who . followed his career in France insisted the ball-boy incident was totally . out of character yet there was a warning from the Belgian FA. Their chief executive Steven Martens . said: ‘It is unfortunate and not something we are proud of.

Trying to earn a living as a twentysomething, Clare Foges could be found driving an ice cream van around Guildford. Today, a mere six years after selling her last Cornetto, she is modestly ignoring all the plaudits crediting her as the main author of David Cameron’s historic speech on Europe. Clare, 31, is said to have been the key No 10 speechwriter behind such memorable phrases as ‘it will be an in-out referendum’ and Mr Cameron’s stirring vow to fight ‘heart and soul’ to keep Britain in the EU. Perhaps this is not surprising, since Clare is also a respected poet who has strong views on the power of public speaking. Indeed, she has bemoaned the decline of rhetoric and the ‘slow sterilisation of public debate’, which, she has said, risks ‘impoverishing politics and perhaps endangering democracy itself’. Scroll down for video . Strong views: Clare Foges has bemoaned the decline of rhetoric and the 'slow sterilisation of public debate' Among those she blames is Gordon Brown, whose speaking skills she once described as ‘prosaic, spouting a dull catalogue of platitudes delivered with auto-pilot gravity’. However, she has heaped praise on Margaret Thatcher for boldly entering No 10 for the first time as prime minister in May 1979 and launching her premiership with a quote from St Francis of Assisi (‘Where there is discord, may we bring harmony; where there is error, may we bring truth; where there is doubt, may we bring faith; and where there is despair, may we bring hope.’) A winning way with words: Clare Foges on her way to work at no 10 . Clare has also despaired of what she calls ‘antiseptic oratory’: where high-profile politicians ‘must toe an invisible line when speaking in public’. She says the result is ‘political speech cleansed of anything remotely contentious, anything colourful, anything impulsive, anything that might be deemed offensive to anyone’. Clare joined Cameron’s team four years ago. The only political speech writer in his inner circle, she crafted the first draft of this week’s Europe speech at the end of last year. The text went through dozens of rewrites as it was passed around the No 10 team. Then, in early in January, Clare added the last rhetorical flourishes. Crucially, she understands Cameron’s instincts and vocabulary — to such an extent that colleagues have described her as ‘the Prime Minister’s larynx’. Because of her dark hair, she has been mistaken several times for Samantha Cameron when entering and leaving No 10. (Incidentally, like Home Secretary Theresa May, Clare is well-known for her love of leopard-print shoes.) In a rare interview before the last . general election, she spoke about the dynamics of her working . relationship with Mr Cameron. ‘I’ve picked up on how David talks just . through listening to him,’ she said. ‘I . find it quite easy to get his tone. He’s really straightforward and . clear about what he wants from his speeches. And he’s funny, too.’ Clare went on to say that a ‘career highlight’ was when the PM used one of her jokes in a speech. Working for Cameron, she says, is ‘friendly and buzzy, nothing like the TV satire The Thick Of It’. As . a ‘special adviser’, Clare earns a taxpayer-funded salary of £63,000 . and is a rare creature in Cameron’s Downing Street operation, which is . mainly staffed by public school-educated types. A . devout Christian, she went to a comprehensive school, gaining a First . in English at Southampton University, followed by a Masters in Poetry at . Bristol. After university, she set up her own Christian clothing company and designed the jewellery herself. The crucifix at the centre of the . recent controversy over British Airways banning a female employee from . wearing it over her uniform was Clare’s design. Working for Cameron, Clare says, is 'friendly and buzzy, nothing like the TV satire The Thick Of It' Clare joined the Conservative Party in . 2003, when Tony Blair was prime minister and at the height of his . leadership. The Tories were not only unpopular with voters but were also . embroiled in yet another civil war following the overthrow of party . leader Iain Duncan Smith. Clare . is on the same traditionalist wing of the party as Mr Duncan Smith, . with her beliefs forged as a young girl when she watched her mother, a . foster parent, care for children in their family home. She . has said: ‘I used to think about what happened to the children when . they left care, and how the State works in terms of welfare. Many of my . views were closely allied to how the Conservatives think.’ Straightforward: Clare has said David Cameron (pictured speaking to the assembly of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland) is 'clear about what he wants from his speeches' 'The Prime Minister's larynx': Clare understands Cameron's instincts and vocabulary. She crafted the first draft of this week's Europe speech at the end of last year . Her Christianity is very important to her and she is described as a ‘down-to-earth, social conservative.’ As well as speech-writing, her duties include helping with Downing Street correspondence. After the death of the Camerons’ six-year-old son, Ivan, in February 2009, it was Clare who dealt with many of the sympathy letters sent by members of the public. One mother, who had also lost a child, described the reply from No 10 (written by Clare) as the most ‘moving’ letter she had ever received. An accomplished poet, Clare won second prize in the online MAG Poetry competition in 2011 with a poem called Bank Holiday (inspired by a visit to a military show). In a blog on the competition page, there was no hint of her day-job. It simply read: ‘Clare lives and works in London.’ While . she never mixes socially with David Cameron outside Downing Street, she . is on call every other weekend and attends speech-writing sessions at . Chequers. Clare joined Boris Johnson's campaign to be London mayor, and was then hired to be part of his team . It was while selling ice creams that the seeds were sown for her political career. She took a part-time job with the Tory MP John Hayes, who was a key figure in the Cornerstone Group, whose members support traditional values and oppose gay marriage. She later joined Boris Johnson’s campaign to be London mayor, and was then hired to be part of his team at City Hall. In due course, a friend told her that a job was available with David Cameron, who was then leader of the Opposition. After four interviews she was selected. Boris Johnson was desperately disappointed to lose her. A few years ago, she set out her beliefs about what was important in political speeches. In an article  for ConservativeHome  website, she lamented the death of rousing political speech making. Referring to her hatred of ‘antiseptic oratory’, she said it had many causes. She believed it was the ‘natural successor to spin’, and she attacked politicians for their reluctance to use rhetoric in case they were seen as ‘pretentious’. Traditionalist: Clare is on the same wing of the party as Iain Duncan Smith. Her beliefs were forged as a young girl when she watched her mother, a foster parent, care for children in their family home . She said: ‘So, though no less educated than Gladstone or Churchill, they appeal to the lowest common denominator. ‘Like . private school kids shedding their blazer at the bus stop to look cool, . they shed the heavy mantle of their education to emulate — and . hopefully appeal to — an imaginary “everyman”.’ She also complained about the way the political class has devised its own language that means little to those outside the Westminster bubble. Thus people are called ‘disadvantaged’ instead of ‘poor’; ‘vulnerable’ instead of old or disabled; communities are in need of ‘cohesion’; government must be ‘joined-up’. ‘When a politician’s rhetorical range is limited to a narrow, muted vocabulary and uniform understatement,’ she added, ‘their listeners hear “blah”. Antiseptic oratory breeds apathy. Part of a politician’s job is to excite people — to engage them in the issues and encourage them to vote.’ As a result, this absence of integrity and oratorical skills offered a great opportunity for David Cameron. Her comments were made more than five years ago but they still resonate today. Lucky man: Cameron (pictured walking away after making a speech on holding a referendum) is fortunate to have Clare behind him . ‘David Cameron will only  convince the electorate that the Conservatives are the natural  party of government if he rouses the sleeping “whole-souled,  sentimental equipment” that is  the heart of British Conservatism,  and to do this he must scorn  antiseptic oratory for a style  that is both more grand and  more genuine.’ She urged politicians to abandon cliches and to ‘trust in the imagination and intelligence of the British people’. Above all, she urged Mr Cameron to ‘be brave enough to speak with the safety-catch off’ — which is precisely what he did on Wednesday in delivering the speech of his life on Europe. With the Downing Street Bard, Clare Foges, behind him, David Cameron is a very lucky man — and is clearly armed with the rhetorical weapons to vanquish any foe,  whether they are on the Tory backbenches or in the corridors of Brussels.","Clare Foges said to be key No.10 speechwriter behind phrases such as 'it will be an in-out referendum'

Australia is sitting on oil reserves that could be worth trillions of dollars and make the region the largest producer of shale in the world. Consultants' reports suggest that as much as 223 billion barrels of oil is contained in the outback of South Australia, but it is not clear whether extracting the oil is commercially viable. Linc Energy told the stock exchange that between 133 billion and 233 billion barrels of shale oil is trapped in the rocks of its 16 million acres of land in the Arckaringa Basin. Liquid gold: Between 133billion and 23 billion barrels of shale oil is believed to be trapped in the rocks in the Arckaringa Basin (above) in Australia . But despite the huge reserves it is thought that only 3.5billion barrels, worth an estimated $359 billion or £227 billion can be retrieved. Linc Energy chief executive Peter Bond has said that the find could change the face of the world's oil industry, potentially surpassing the world's current largest oil producer Saudi Arabia. He told ABC News: 'If you took the 233 billion (barrels), well, you're talking Saudi Arabia numbers. 'If Arckaringa plays out the way our independent reports have shown, it's one of the key prospective territories in the world at the moment. Worth exploring: If the company can extract the entire find the country would become one of, if not the biggest, oil exporter in the world . Location: Despite the huge reserves it is thought that only 3.5billion barrels, worth an estimated $359 billion or £227 billion can be retrieved . Australia currently produces around 180 million barrels of oil a year and is said to have reserves of around 3.9 billion barrels of crude oil. South Australia's mining minister Tom Koutsantonis said that it is too early to say whether the oil can be tapped. Shale oil is extracted from the ground by the process popularly known as fracking - which involves extracting oil reserves from underground by a process of hydraulic fracturing of shale rock using high pressure liquid. The process makes it more costly to extract shale oil than crude oil. It is believed that it would cost £200 million to fund production in the area. Should the latest find be successfully extracted, it would make Australia a net oil exporter at least. If the company can extract the entire find the country would become one of, if not the biggest, oil exporter in the world.","Up to 223 billion barrels of shale oil have been found in South Australia .

'Wicked': Derrol Flynn used disguises and elaborate lies to con her elderly victims out of their money . A conwoman who posed as an undercover police officer to trick pensioners into handing over more than £20,000 has been jailed for eight years. Serial fraudster Derrol Flynn, 40, convinced one of her victims she was being 'recruited' for an specialist undercover police investigation into banks. But the elaborate scam was just a ploy to get innocent Diane Bastin to part with her money in the belief she was assisting an important police investigation. The elderly woman was driven around Birmingham and ordered to purchase electrical items, cash cheques and take out loans. Flynn, who was thought to be working as part of a gang, had such a hold over the 68-year-old that she refused to speak to genuine police officers for fear of breaching the Official Secrets Act. Jailing Flynn, Judge Gregory Dickinson described the scam as 'wicked' and 'despicable'. He said: 'I can only come to the conclusion that you are a menace to elderly members of the community. 'Only when you are locked up are they safe from you. These were serious offences and they were wicked. 'You took the items and she was left with the debt. Such was her bewilderment it took police officers a good while to convince her they were the genuine article.' Birmingham Crown Court heard that Flynn was a serial con artist who used a number of ruses, posing as a nurse and other respectable workers, to dupe pensioners out of cash. In another case, in June last year, an 85-year-old woman was conned into handing over her £3,000 life savings, kept for her funeral, after Flynn produced identification 'proving' who she was. Behind bars: Flynn was jailed for eight years at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to burgle and commit fraud . Flynn, 40, of Bordesley Green, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and conspiracy to burgle. Niall Skinner, defending, told the court she had shown remorse for the first time in a long career as a criminal. Flynn was jailed for eight years for conspiracy to burgle and six years for conspiracy to commit fraud to be serves concurrently. DCI Sarbjit Johal, who lead the investigation, said: 'She was wicked and preyed on the most vulnerable members of our community. 'Flynn has a history of offending against the old and infirm and the length of sentence reflects the despicable nature of these crimes. 'Anyone affected by bogus burglary should contact their local police, station to report it as soon as possible. 'We know how believable these burglars can be and would therefore encourage anything suspicious to be reported to police. 'A number of victims in these offences were traumatised not only losing money but also the fact they'd been duped, it is clearly not their fault these people are skilled and are very convincing. 'Flynn showed no remorse at all throughout her police interviews and we are very pleased that she will now be behind bars for a considerable time.'","Derrol Flynn, 40, used respectable disguises to trick her elderly victims .

Perhaps the chance to enjoy some high-octane water sports? Well, what about a holiday that promises to turn back the clock – to help your wrinkles soften, your skin brighten and make you look years younger by the time your return to Heathrow? Welcome to the latest thing to hit the travel world: the anti-ageing holiday. A break with a difference: Marianne traded chocolate and alcohol for vegetable soup in Austria . Forget 'starvation vacations' or yoga holidays – this holiday promises to make you look younger and I, for one, am in desperate need. You see last year was a slog. For whatever reason life didn’t seem to go my way and after 12 months of no holiday, non-stop work and some minor home dramas, I woke up one day feeling - and looking - about 10 years older. It was as if I’d hit some sort of tipping point, my face looked older over night. The wrinkles deepened, the shadows under my eyes got darker, and I appeared to have a permanent frown on my face. For the first time in my life I started to throw money at all sorts of anti-ageing serums and potions but I couldn’t see any difference. If anything, they made me spotty. And so I did what any sane woman would, I ran away. The Viva Mayr Clinic is a famously strict spa-cum-medical centre in Austria, which has earned a cult-like following from celebs who swear by it to lose weight, fast. Its no frills regime of Epsom salts (to clear out the system), vegetable soup and spelt bread might not be fun but it’s certainly effective. Royal approval: The Duchess of York, pictured her with her daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, is a big fan of the Viva Mayr clinic . But the doctors who run the clinic claim this spartan diet does more than drop the pounds, it also drops years. The theory is simple. Most of what we eat in day-to-day life – or at least most of what I eat – is prematurely ageing us. Sugar – one of the mainstays of my diet – is the very worst. It makes collagen and elastin in the body become more rigid which makes skin lose that bouncy, youthful appearance. In fact, last year research found there is a direct link between how much sugar you eat and how old you look, with scientists saying that the damaged caused by sugar really start showing at the age of 35. Exactly my age. Oh dear. As for alcohol, caffeine and fast foods – well, they’re creating damaging free-radicals, which are extremely ageing, both in terms of your appearance and to the health of your body.  By removing these from our diet you can see dramatic results. But it’s not just what we eat but how and when we eat that can age us, according to the clinic’s director, Dr Harald Stossier, who in on a one-man mission to teach us all to chew. At the clinic every itty bitty mouthful of bread you put into your mouth has to be chewed 40 times because the doctors believe that if we don’t chew food thoroughly our bodies cannot absorb the nutrients properly and gulping food down puts our system under huge stress. Spartan: Her new regime included plenty of Epsom Salts and pint-sized meals . Finally, at the Mayr calories are dramatically restricted to give your digestive system a break – I’m on about 700 calories a day. It might sound drastic but many experts now believe that fasting is the key to looking and feeling younger. A ground breaking Horizon documentary which aired last year, showed convincing proof that eating as little as 500 calories two days of the week, can reduce your chance of cancer, heart disease, diabetes – all of the health problems associated with an ageing body. But boy it’s hard. While holidays begin with a spot of sunbathing and dozing, mine involves lying in my pants while my tummy gets poked and prodded by a stranger – a daily abdominal massage to help digestion. Next comes a battery of tests to assess everything from my hormone to levels of vitamins and minerals. The tests confirm I am very deficient in the sunshine vitamin D (very common in colder countries) which affects energy levels and immune system  and that my body has problems making serotonin. 'Do you find your mood goes up and down?' asks my doctor. Yes! Soothing: Daily trips to the Viva Mayr's sauna and regular massages helped Marianne get glowy skin . Lighter life: It might not be for everyone, but Austria's Viva Mayr clinic gets real results . But worst of all, my levels of free-radicals are much higher than average. I ask my doctor why and he says it’s a combination of stress, modern polluted life, my diet… the list goes on. In order to look and feel younger I need to get these down – which Dr Stossier says can be done in about three to four weeks of very healthy eating – lots of veg, no caffeine, alcohol or sugar, and no eating late at night. My first day of vegetable soup, sheep’s yoghurt and bread isn’t as bad as I’d thought it would be. The novelty of counting my chewing keeps me distracted and I have enough food still in my system to keep going (I had, of course, eaten double in the run up to the holiday, in preparation). By day two, however, I am so hungry I start searching the bottom of my handbag for any old bit of chocolate or mint I can find – (I find two almonds and am overjoyed). By day three the withdrawal of sugar and caffeine makes me feel light-headed and spaced out. The daily Epsom Salt cocktail we have to drink every morning make me run to the toilet more in a day than I usually would in a week. The regular abdominal massages only make the problem worse. By day four I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck – my body doesn’t know what has hit it. I start to get desperate for any form of sugar. Eating my lunch of watercress soup with a teaspoon, I feel ready to crack. By day five, I do crack. I know that just outside the clinic gates there is a souvenir shop which I’m convinced must sell chocolate. Looking good: The end result, says Marianne, was well worth all the vegetable soup . After lots of pacing my room I decide I’m going to go for it. I sneak into the shop and, like a robber casing the joint, I look around for any form sugar. I pick up a Bounty bar - practically fruit! - and walk to the counter. My heart is racing as I reach into my pocket to pay – but I can’t find the tenner I’d put in there. I look in my other pocket. Nothing. My money must have fallen out on the walk. I walk away and go back to a dinner of clear broth eaten with a teaspoon. I want to cry. But then the next day something magical happens – I wake up on day six and I feel good. Great even. I look at the mirror and bright, sparkly eyes stare back at me. I notice my skin, which is usually flaky, red and slightly spotty looks smooth, and plump and glowing. Just as I seemed to age overnight in London, the years seemed to fall off me overnight at Viva. It sounds over the top I know, but it was true. Another guest, a woman I’d shared a taxi with from the airport, even comments. 'You look completely different,' she says. 'Honestly, you look about ten years younger.' She was exaggerating of course, but who cares? I become a convert. By the time I leave, on day seven, I vow never to eat another chocolate bar and to eat every bit of food not just forty times but one hundred times! My body will be a temple! I will turn back the hands of time! It hasn’t lasted of course. Two weeks after returning, the odd bar of chocolate has crept back in, and a life without wine isn’t one that I could ever envisage. But friends are still commenting on how well I look. One colleague, who spends hundreds in the quest to turn back the clock with the help of various potions and the odd bit of Botox even asked what I’ve had done. When I told her nothing, she didn’t believe me. 'You must be doing something different,' she said. 'Yes, I’m chewing.' Now that’s a cheaper alternative to a fancy new anti-ageing cream.","Viva Mayr Clinic in Austria is a favourite of Sarah Ferguson and other celebrities wanting to lose weight and years quickly .

The reality show American Idol could be sued for racism after NINE black former contestants have mounted a legal challenge amid claims they were forced off the show. The singers said the production company plotted to remove them from the competition in a bid to boost ratings. The claims came to light after New York attorney James Freeman asked the U.S. Equal . Employment Opportunity Commission for permission to sue Idol and FOX on behalf of his clients. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick are facing a legal challenge from nine former black contestants of the show . Contestant Jermaine Jones was confronted by producers after failing to disclose his criminal record . His legal challenge is backed by Jaered Andrews (Season 2), Corey Clark (Season 2), Donnie Williams (Season 3), Terrell Brittenum (Season 5), Derrell Brittenum (Season 5), Thomas Daniels ﻿(Season 6), Akron Watson (Season 6), Ju'Not Joyner (Season 8) and Chris Golightly (Season 9). The lawyer said he became concerned about the show's treatment of black contestants after competitor Jermaine Jones was disqualified in March last year over an undisclosed criminal record. An episode of the singing competition saw the 25-year-old confronted with the revelations on camera by two of the show’s executive producers, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick. At the time, he told them: 'I was nervous, I didn’t want to get judged. I didn’t want to get penalised for anything that happened in the past.' Jaered Andrews and Corey Clark are among the former American Idol participants to sue the show . Donnie Williams and Thomas Daniels have also signed the legal challenge against the show producers . But the producers said it was out of their hands, adding: 'We’re not allowed to have anyone with an active warrant against them, and you have four.' Jones' experience was similar to that of Corey Clark, who was disqualified for hiding his arrest record during the second season in 2003. Freeman said all of the nine other people who had been publicly disqualified from the show were black. As part of their application, contestants are asked to disclose whether they had ever been arrested. In his letter, Freeman questions whether it was legitimate for producers to ask potential competitors to disclose their criminal records, claiming this violated employment law as applicants were essentially applying for a job. Twin brothers Derrell and Terrell Brittenum left the show after outstanding police warrants against them were revealed . Ju'Not Joyner and Chris Golightly are among the more recent black contestants to back the legal claim . He added American Idol had humiliated black Idol contestants on national . TV - making them unfairly appear to be violent criminals, liars and sexual deviants - and creating 'destructive stereotypes'. Freeman's investigation also claimed the contestants who had been disqualified for their criminal records had not been actually been convicted at the time of their expulsion from the programme. He said: 'Yet their personal and professional . lives remain permanently and severely impaired by [the show's] continuing . violations of our nation's laws.' Responding to the claims, Mr Lythgoe said he was 'shocked' by what he said were 'ridiculous' allegations. He told TMZ: 'We treat everybody the same ... no matter the race, religion or sex.' 'I think we've always had a . fantastic share of talent from contestants both black and white ... I don't . think I've ever seen racism at the show.'

As if Highgate cemetery in north London with its gravestones and lonely walkways were not scary enough, now a rare species of giant spider has been discovered lurking in its lightless vaults. Staff at London Wildlife Trust came across a population of the Meta bourneti, or orb weaver spiders, when working on a bat survey in December. The identity of the spider, which requires darkness so total that even night is too bright for it, was confirmed by Edward Milner, Spider Recorder at the London Natural History Society. The rare orb weaver spider spans 30 mm across - including all eight of its legs - and shuns any form of light . The spiders - among the largest found in Britain - were discovered in the vaults of the Egyptian Avenue at the cemetery. Sometimes known as 'cave spiders', the Meta bourneti, or orb weaving spider, is found in places of complete darkness, including cellars, ice houses - and now vaults in graveyards. But although the adult spiders shun the light, baby spiders, or spiderlings, actively seek it out. This means that they can emerge from their dark birthplace and find new spaces to colonise. The spider is about 30 mm across, including its legs. That makes it comparable to Tegenaria gigantea (the large spider often found in the bath) and is probably slightly larger. The trust said that the spiders, which (including their legs) measure 30mm across, could have been living undetected in the vaults for at least 150 years. The sealed vaults, which are designed to hold up to 12 coffins, are the perfect breeding ground for the shy spiders because they are so rarely opened, said the trust. Egyptian Avenue is at the heart of the cemetery. It consists of 16 vaults on either side of a broad passageway, which is entered via a great arch. The vaults were bought by individual families for their sole use. The orb spiders are not the first rare . species to be found at the cemetery: London Wildlife Trust said that . researchers have found 227 other species previously unrecorded at the . graveyard. Highgate cemetery, with its spooky graves and monolithic structures, was created in 1836, along with other graveyards around London, in an attempt to deal with the growing problem of how to dispose of the capital's dead . The grand north London cemetery is the final resting place of such diverse luminaries as Malcolm McLaren (left) and Karl Marx, a founding father of Communism . Highgate is one of the seven great burial grounds created in the 1830s when London became so overcrowded that there was little room left to bury the dead. Highgate attracted a varied clientele and over the next 20 years became one of the capital’s most fashionable cemeteries. It is the final resting place of notables as varied as the writers Christina Rossetti and Douglas Adams, as well as TV star Jeremy Beadle, Malcolm McLaren, who discovered the Sex Pistols, and Karl Marx. Burials are still carried out at the cemetery, which sees up to 70 funerals a year. Despite their alarming size, meta spiders help us by eating woodlice and small insects. The cemetery isn't the only place the spiders have been found in Britain: researchers have found males of the species close to the ancient oak trees of Sherwood Forest, which suggests that they had made the dark, damp spaces within the trees themselves their home. The spiders have also been found in the New Forest, as well as in Essex, Somerset and Wales. They have also been found in Europe and in Romania. Tony Canning of the London Wildlife Trust said: 'The discovery of this important spider population in the heart of London shows just how valuable cemeteries such as Highgate can be in providing refuges for wildlife.'","Orb weaver spider needs darkness so total that even night is too bright .

Modern militaries have all manner of weapons at their disposal from nuclear submarines to heat-seeking missiles. But 400 years ago technology was rather more limited and armies had to make the very best of their resources - in whatever shape or form they may take. One such quest to steal a march on the enemy led to the publication of a whacky manuscript from 16th Century Germany which even considered using cats and birds to bomb opposing forces. Animal arsenal: This drawing from a 16th Century German weapons manuscript shows how cats and birds were considered as possible delivery systems for bombs in warfare . Called Feuer Buech, which translates from old German as Fire Book, the 235-page treatise from 1584 contains a drawing of a feline and his feathered friend with 'rocket packs' strapped to backs as they ran and fly past a castle. It's not clear whether they were actually used, but animals have for centuries been deployed in warfare, often to deliver messages or for transportation, but sometimes as weapons. At the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty, which ruled China between 960 and 1279, monkeys were thought to have been employed in a battle between rebels of the Yanzhou province and the Chinese Imperial Army. They were clothed with straw, dipped in oil and set alight before being set loose into the enemy's camp. Crazy contraptions: This sketch, from the 1584 treatise, shows exploding bombs hovering over a cauldron . Explosive document: The dossier is entitled Feuer Buech, which translates from old German as Fire Book . In the 16th Century, a German . artillery officer once presented a plan to use cats to spread poisonous . gas among enemy soldiers, although it was never enacted. And much like miners used canaries to . warn of gas leaks, the British employed around 500,000 felines to warn . of lethal fumes during World War One. In the Second World War, the U.S. military experimented with bat bombs, which consisted of a casing that . contained a Mexican Free-tailed bat attached with a timed explosive. The . idea was for the casings to be dropped from an aircraft and release the . bats which would then roost in eaves and attics before the timers went . off.

By that time, around $2million had been spent on the project. More recently, donkeys have been used by insurgents to detonate explosives in Iraq and Afghanistan. But . the use of animals was never really that widespread if for no other . reason than nature's notorious unpredictability, which is never a . reassuring quality where explosives are involved.

Prince Albert of Monaco and his wife Princess Charlene today accepted an offer of damages from the Sunday Times over a story which suggested she was reluctant to marry him. Mark Thomson, representing the royal, said the article - published two days after the wedding - accused the prince of having the his bride's passport confiscated at Nice airport to prevent her from fleeing Monaco. The July 2011 article alleged Charlene, 34, was reluctant to marry the 54-year-old prince after discovering the existence of a third love child. Libelled: Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene . of Monaco have accepted an offer of damages from the Sunday Times over a . story which alleged she was reluctant to marry him and he had . prevented her fleeing the country . It further claimed that she agreed to go through with the wedding for the sake of appearances in return for payment, with a view to obtaining and annulment after a seemly interval. 'None of these allegations are true,' Mr Thomson told Mr Justice Eady at the High Court today. He said that the newspaper had admitted that they were untrue and accepted liability for making such defamatory claims in the article, entitled 'The full filthy Monte' and 'Curse of the Grimaldis'. It had apologised and confirmed it would pay the couple damages, to be assessed at a later stage if not agreed, and reimburse their legal costs. The newspaper article was published just days after Prince Albert and Princess Charlene were wed in a lavish ceremony at his palace in the principality that was headline news across the world. Mr Thomson said it also falsely alleged Prince Albert had turned a blind eye to corrupt activity by his courtiers and done nothing effective to curb the activities of mobsters and money launderers in Monaco. It also made the false claim that he had granted residency to foreigners on the request of advisers or friends for fear of their disclosing embarrassing secrets about his love life.

Support: County Kerry Councillor Danny Healy-Rae who has proposed that permits be granted to those living in rural communities, allowing them to drive after 'two or three drinks' Support is growing for the introduction of drink-driving permits on rural Irish roads as a second council is set to hear a motion on the proposal. Councillors in County Kerry have already backed a change in the law that would allow drinkers in rural areas to drive . after having 'two or three drinks'. But despite widespread criticism of the proposal, originally put forward by pub owner and Independent councillor . Danny Healy-Rae, a councillor in another county has expressed support. Independent Galway councillor Michael Fahy said he would raise the idea at the next sitting of his council's policy committee. He disagreed with the assertion that more lax rules would lead to more road deaths, saying: 'We don't want to see people drunk, we're only talking about up to three pints. 'This would have to be monitored, maybe by the publican or through some sort of stamped card system.' Mr Healy-Rae's suggestion that a permit system would help prevent 'depression and suicide' was widely condemned. He also claimed that people in rural areas were 'travelling very minor roads … with very little traffic' and 'have never killed anyone.' The motion was passed by Kerry county council, in south-west Ireland, on Monday by five votes to three, with the remainder of the councillors either absent or abstaining. Rural: Mr Healy-Rae claimed that people in rural areas were 'travelling very minor roads ¿ with very little traffic' and 'have never killed anyone' Three of those who voted in favour of Mr Healy-Rae's proposal are also believed to be publicans. The approved motion will now be considered by Minister for Justice Alan Shatter who will then decide whether or not to take the issue up with government. Mr Healy-Rae claimed his proposal would bring back a social outlet for lonely people in rural areas that has been lost after more strict drink-drive laws were introduced. In his proposal outline he wrote: 'To ask the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation to allow Gardaí to issue permits to people living in rural isolated areas to allow them to drive home from their nearest pub after having two or three drinks on little used roads driving at very low speeds - to be issued at the discretion of the local Garda. 'This would greatly benefit people living alone looking at four walls and restore some bit of social activity in local pubs and may also help prevent depression and suicide.' Ireland has a chronic drink driving problem. 18,851 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2007. A total of 18,053 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2008. That’s an average of around 347 drivers arrested each week for drink driving in the Republic of Ireland. Ireland is ranked among the highest alcohol consuming countries in the EU (Health Research Board, 2007) He told the Irish Independent: 'They're travelling in very minor roads, often on tractors, with very little traffic and it's not right they're being treated the same as the rest of the travelling public and they have never killed anyone. 'The only outlet they have then is to take home a bottle of whiskey and they're falling into depression and suicide for some of them is the sad way out,' he added. Road safety chiefs attacked the 'off-the-wall' motion that would serve only to drag the country back to 'a much darker day.' The head of Ireland's Road Safety Authority, Noel Brett, expressed disbelief at the proposal. He said most of the country's deaths and injuries from road accidents were in fact in rural areas. 'There is very strong evidence which makes an irrefutable link between the consumption of alcohol and impairment,' Mr Brett said. 'On that basis it is unthinkable that we would go back to a system that sought to increase our drink-drive limit,' he said. 'We have made substantial progress in Ireland in reducing deaths and injuries on our roads, particularly in rural areas which are hardest hit by road fatalities and injuries. 'I think we need to proceed with that and continue with the life-saving policies that we have in place.' Describing the motion as 'off-the-wall', Mr Brett paid tribute to Irish motorists for a sea change in attitudes and behaviour towards drink-driving that had made a significant dent in road deaths over recent years. 'That is what is saving lives and proposals such as this bring us back to a much darker day,' he said. Labour councillor Gillian Wharton-Slattery said she did not want to be associated with the motion. 'Depression causes suicide. It’s not caused by not being able to go to the pub. There’s more things in Kilgarvan than going into your pub,' she told Mr Healy-Rae. Figures show 161 people lost their lives on Irish roads last year, a record low . Independent councillor, Cllr Brendan Cronin (Ind) said Mr Healy-Rae was representing the interests of publicans on the council. Conor Cullen, spokesman for Alcohol Action Ireland, said: 'Those in rural areas who may be suffering from isolation will not benefit from putting their lives and the lives of the other members of their community at risk by drinking and driving. 'We need constructive solutions to help those people, such as greater investment in community resources, and socialising is an important part of this, but alcohol does not have to be.' Mr Cullen added that alcohol will exacerbate, not alleviate, mental health difficulties such as depression or anxiety. The drink drive limit in Ireland was tightened in 2011 and is now in line with European levels. Latest figures show 161 people lost their lives on Irish roads last year, a record low at 25 fewer than 2011 and 51 less than 2010. The new Irish Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) limit is 50 milligrams (mg) for all drivers, and 20mg for specified drivers, defined as learner or newly qualified drivers (for a period of two years after passing their driving test) or professional drivers (of buses, goods vehicles and public service vehicles).","Danny Healy-Rae's motion passed by Kerry County Council by 5 votes to 3 .

The world-renowned Sterkfontein Caves is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world. It is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as 'Mrs Ples', and an almost complete hominid skeleton called 'Little Foot', dated 2.3 and 4.17 million years old respectively. A. Sediba was also dated at two-million-years-old so it looks like man and fox were just as well-known to each other as they are today. The discovery of the ancient mammal remains were made on Tuesday by teams from the South African universities of Johannesburg and Witwatersrand. The new fox fossils consist of a mandible and parts of the skeleton and can be distinguished from any living or extinct form of fox known to science based on proportions of its teeth and other aspects of its anatomy.

'The evolutionary history of foxes (Tribe Vulpini) is muchless well understood than that of the larger dogs of the Canisgroup,' the researchers wrote. Dr. Brian Kuhn from the University of Witwatersrand, head of the Malapa carnivore studies, said: 'It's exciting to see a new fossil fox. The team say the animal they found was relatively small.

A collision of black holes - or neutron stars - could have been responsible for a blast of radiation that struck the Earth in the Middle Ages. But our medieval ancestors - and the planet - had a lucky escape. A new study by a team of German scientists suggests that the blast of radiation that hit the Earth between the years 774 and 775 was caused by the collision of two 'compact stellar remnants' such as black holes, neutron stars or white dwarfs. The collision of two black holes between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from us would have caused a very short but very intense blast of energy, say researchers in Germany . When this happens, say astronomers Valeri Hambaryan and Ralph Neuhauser of the Astrophysics Institute of the University of Jena in Germany, an intense blast of energy is released in the form of gamma rays, which are the most energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes visible light. These huge bursts of energy are, however, very short: they last less than two seconds. And, suggest the scientists, this massive collision of heavenly bodies happened a very long way away from Earth - between 3,000 and 12,000 light years away from our Sun. That means that by the time the radiation arrived at our home planet, it would have been absorbed by our atmosphere, and there would be no obvious signs of the massive event that had happened far away in the universe. If the gamma ray burst had been much closer to the Earth, it would have caused significant harm to the biosphere,' said Dr Neuhauser. That explains why there are no records of any unusual sightings in the sky from that period. Other big celestial events were recorded: the appearance of Halley's comet in our skies in 1066 was recorded for posterity in the Bayeux Tapestry. Halley's comet features in the Bayeux Tapestry that commemorates the Norman invasion of England in 1066 and the Battle of Hastings . Researchers had suggested that an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that describes a 'red crucifix' that was seen after sunset might have been a supernova. A black hole is a region where gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape - not even light. But a black hole is far from empty - it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York. These giant black holes can collide: Once they come so close that they cannot escape each other's gravity, they will merge to become one bigger black hole. Even when simulating this event on powerful computers, we cannot fully understand it. However, we do know that a black hole merger would produce tremendous energy and send massive ripples through the space-time fabric of the universe. However, that dates from 776 - too late to have been a visible result of the collision between the black holes thousands of light years away. But although our medieval ancestors weren't aware of the vast celestial event, it did leave its mark on our planet. Last year researchers in Japan found that some ancient cedar trees had an unusual level of carbon-14, a radioactive material that can be used to date artefacts of up to 50,000 years old. And in Antarctica there was a spike in levels of a form of beryllium, a rare element. Both of these unusual concentrations were found to date from between 774 and 775 - precisely the period in which the intense blast of energy would have hit the Earth. Fortunately, such events are very rare. Dr Neuhauser says that we are unlikely to experience such an event any time soon. Carbon-14 dating techniques suggest that only one occurence of a huge blast of radiation hitting the Earth has occured in the past 3,000 years - the one our eighth-century ancestors lived through. But our modern lifestyles mean we are much more vulnerable to such an event. Says Dr Neuhauser: 'Even thousands of light years away, a similar event could cause havoc with the sensitive electronic systems that advanced societies have come to depend on.'","Blast of radiation left traces in Antarctic ice and ancient Japanese trees .

Award: Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, received an honorary doctorate from the University of York . The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been awarded an honorary doctorate following her long fight for justice. Doreen Lawrence was praised for her 'tireless campaign against racism and inequality', as she received the award at the University of York. After 'devoting a large part of her life to social justice', Mrs Lawrence was praised for bringing about changes that 'allow people to live without fear and discrimination'. She has tirelessly campaigned against racism following her son's murder in 1993. Stephen was just 18 when he was stabbed to death by a gang of white thugs at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London. His mother bravely fought for justice and last year Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, were convicted of the murder. Mrs Lawrence, 60, was today awarded the honorary degree by Dr Rowland Atkinson from the university's Department of Sociology. Dr Atkinson said: 'Doreen's campaigning has brought . changes to policing, civil rights and attitudes to race to allow people . to live without fear and discrimination. 'Doreen's work has challenged prejudice and promoted the vision of a positive community in her son's name. 'It takes great courage to condemn such behaviour.' In the years after her son's death, Mrs Lawrence founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. She also sits on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a patron of the hate-crime charity Stop Hate UK. Campaigner: Mrs Lawrence said she was 'very emotional' receiving the award and described education as 'the most precious gift that we can give our children' Accepting the award, Mrs Lawrence said: 'I see education as the most . precious gift that we can give our children.' She said that institutional racism had inspired her to set up the Stephen Lawrence Charitable . Trust to help 'black and ethnic minorities achieve their ambitions'. She said: 'Today has been very emotional for me. I . find myself choking up when I try and speak about what a great honour . this is.' 'I feel that all the work I have done over the years has truly been recognised and that is very special. Reward: Doreen Lawrence with her Women of the Year award last year. She described the recognition of her work as 'special' Change: During her acceptance speech she said: 'I feel like some things have changed since then and I believe there is now more awareness surrounding racism and inequality' 'When Stephen was killed I felt like no one was interested in his case. That made me push even harder for change. 'I feel like some things have changed since then and I believe there is now more awareness surrounding racism and inequality.' Sadness: Referring to Stephen's ambition to study architecture, she said: 'I was never able to enjoy that and I feel a part of me is still missing' The doctorate is the latest in a long line of awards that Mrs Lawrence has received for her campaigning. In 2003, she was awarded an OBE for services to community relations and last summer was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony of the . Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban . Ki-moon. Last year, she also received a special award at the Women of the Year award, as well as another honorary doctorate from the University of East London. There was also place for sadness in Mrs Lawrence's acceptance speech as she reflected upon Stephen's ambition to study . architecture at university before he was murdered.

"Designer's kit to rival Stella McCartney for Team GB and Ralph Lauren for U.S. Italian flag colours ignored as designer ditches red and green for boring blue . By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 06:50 EST, 11 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:40 EST, 11 May 2012 . When Stella McCartney revealed her Olympic kit designs for Team GB, she was widely criticised for changing the colour of the Union flag to predominantly blue. But if you thought her style didn't truly reflect the flag the team are representing, then Giorgio Armani's designs for the Italian 2012 squad will be even more of a disappointment. The fashion supremo has unveiled his 50-piece Olympic collection in Milan, and the majority of the kit fails to incorporate the nation's flag colours of green and red. Instead, the minimalist collection is made up of white and navy items with a small Olympic rings and 'Italia' logo. Sea of navy: Italian designer Giorgio Armani, centre, with members of Italy's Olympic squad in the sports suits he has designed . Spot the colour: Athletes at the launch in Milan show off little of the colours in their nation's flag . The collection includes a plain navy polo shirt, all-white and all-navy sport jackets and navy track suit bottoms. The trainers are also in a minimalist design in shades or white or navy with just a hint of gold in homage to the colour of medal it is hoped the athletes will bring home. All the items are emblazoned with Emporio Armani's EA7 . sports label logo. The designs were modelled this week by 15 of the 280-strong Italian Olympic contingent, including five-times medallist fencer Valentina Vezzali, one of Italy's . best hopes in the summer games. The sport suits will be worn by the athletes at the London 2012 opening ceremony on July 27 and around the Olympic village, but not to compete. Although at first sight the country the . athletes are representing will not be instantly recognisable by their kit, Armani insisted it is patriotic. Medal hopeful: Fencer Valentina Vezzali gives the kit the thumbs up and reveals the patriotic lining featuring the first line of the national anthem . Going for gold: Diver Tania Cagnotto, left, models the shorts and a gilet while water polo player Matteo Aicardi dons a rare piece in the collection featuring the red and green from Italy's flag . 'I am very patriotic. And what is more patriotic than the Olympics?' he said at the launch of his designs. 'The . fact that I have been chosen (to design these outifts) is a recognition . to the value of what I do. Fashion represents a great Italian flag for . the whole world and it is a beautiful idea to combine it with sports,' he added. On closer inspection, there are hints . of the Italian flag in his design with some of the polo shirts . featuring a tiny flag on the cuffs and one T-shirt having green and red . sleeves. Praise: Giovanni Petrucci, left, who heads Italy's Olympic Committee, said team Italia would definitely look 'the most fashionable' in London this summer thanks to Armani's designs . But viewers have to look very close to see Armani's most patriotic touch - the first sentences of . Italy's national anthem have been by embroidered in gold on the inside lining of the uniform jackets and . on the back of polo shirts collars. Wearing his trademark black T-shirt . and black trousers with white tennis shoes at the kit launch, Armani, . 77, revealed how he feels to be contributing to the Olympics in the . style-stakes, along with McCartney, who teamed up with Adidas to design . the GB kit, and Ralph Lauren, who again kits out the US squad in 2012. 'I am very honoured to participate . with these great colleagues. This will be the most fashionable Olympic . Games ever,' Armani said.

McCartney's Team GB designs will be worn by the squad during competition, while High Street chain . Next have designed their formal wear. McCartney was criticised for not including . enough red in the designs and changing the union flag to white and blue. But she defended her style saying 'it actually uses more red and shows more flag than any Team GB kit since '84.' She added: For me it’s one of the . most beautiful flags in the world and it was important for me to stay . true to that iconic design but also to modernise it and present it in a . contemporary way. Ultimately, we wanted the athletes to feel like a team and be proud with the identity we created.' The competition: Stella McCartney was criticised for turning the union flag blue in her designs for Team GB . Preppy: Ralph Lauren has kitted the U.S. team out in his trademark style . Meanwhile, Next's formal range for . Team GB is in a plain style like Armani's, with dark navy suits and ties . for the men and navy skirts with a cowl neck top for the women. They . have however incorporated the union flag into the top in gold detailing. Giovanni Petrucci, who heads Italy's .

On the back of her monumentally successful 'mummy porn' trilogy, Fifty Shades Of Grey, sales in sex toys used by the main characters have spiked by an explosive 400 per cent. Luxury Swedish brand Lelo, distributors of high-end sex toys, have reported that sales of their Kegel Luna Beads pelvic floor exercise system have increased dramatically in the past two months. The Grey effect: Sales in LELO love beads have skyrocketed by 400% thanks to EL James' trilogy . The sex aid, similar to the 'geisha balls' used by the books' central character Anastasia Steele, has also flown to the top of Amazon.com's list of best-selling 'sexual wellness' products. The company attributes this new success to the erotic books, which contain scenes putting products like Luna Beads in the spotlight. Furthermore, Britain's biggest online retailer of sex toys lovehoney.co.uk has reported that their £8.99 nipple clamps have now become the most popular type of bondage toy sold on their website, beating out traditional bondage items like handcuffs and blindfolds. In March they sold just over 200 pairs - in June they sold a staggering 1,214, a leap of 400 per cent. Sales of the website's own love balls are also up 400 per cent since March, and sales of whips - which also play a big part in the books - have more than doubled: in March they sold 300, in June 671. Similarly, their £14.99 satin wrist restraints are up from 350 pairs in March to 595 sold in June. Tie me up: lovehoney.co.uk have reported that wrist restraint sales are up from 350 pairs in March to 595 in June .

'Most of these new customers are first time buyers. 'The split is around 60 per cent women, 40 per cent men. 'But we think there are a lot of couples who are experimenting after the female partner has read the book. 'They're buying stuff together for role play in the bedroom. 'Up and down the country British couples are recreating the sexual adventures of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey! 'But what's really interesting is that we're seeing the buying behaviour change as a result of the book. 'A lot of first time customers especially appear to have been excited and emboldened by the book and are experimenting.' Ouch: Sales of whips at lovehoney.co.uk have doubles in the past few months . LELO’s version of the ‘Ben Wa’ or . ‘Geisha’ balls, used by the novel’s leading lady, are high-quality 'love beads' which are worn to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.

One customer review of the beads on Yahoo! says: 'If your typical sex toy is a Ford, the LELO line offers you the Ferrari… What separates Luna Beads from other Kegel exercisers or Ben Wa’s is easy -- it gives you a versatile experience.'

'If you can't beat them, join them', goes the saying. And British women are certainly living by that mantra when it comes to their height. We may be some of the shortest ladies in Europe, but we're compensating by wearing the highest heels on the continent, according to a new study. Following in the footsteps (literally) of stiletto-mad celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Cheryl Cole, British women are now tottering around on an average heel height of 3.3 inches. That's almost one whole inch more than the petite women of France who, favouring a heel of 2.4 inches, wear only the fifth highest shoe in Europe. Hot on the heels of the . Brits, preferring an average height of 3.2 inches, are the women of Spain, while Danes wear . 3 inches and the Germans 2.7 inches. The study comes as British women are revealed to now be among the shortest in Europe, with the average 18- to 29-year-old measuring in at 5ft 4ins (163cm). Our German counterparts are tower over us by five centimetres, at 5ft 6ins, while the Spanish are just one centimetre taller than us. The heel brigade: Victoria Beckham, left, and Cheryl Cole, right, are just two celebrities rarely seen in anything less than a three-inch heel . Perhaps in a bid to tower over continental counterparts, a quarter of British women brave stilettos of between four and six inches high. And even though Victoria Beckham has . admitted to suffering from bunions because of her dedication to the . high-heeled cause, three per cent of UK ladies still admit to preferring . heels loftier than than six inches. The average British woman is also suffering according to the survey, with 65 per cent saying they have experienced significant pain because of their shoes. It seems we are prepared go through it because, according to psychologists, appearing taller makes us seem more confident, successful . and even intelligent. Psychologist, Emma Kenny said: 'A . tall woman is considered more assertive, confident, richer, capable, . successful, independent and even more intelligent than those who are . shorter. 'Perception is . incredibly powerful and it makes sense that the feedback we receive from . the way we are treated by others will reinforce our choices. 'British . women are ambitious and if putting on a pair of six inch heels . increases their career prospects the savvy individual will do so.' Within Britain, the height of heel women prefer to walk in is dependent on location. Women in the north-east were found to be wearing the highest heels in the UK - an eye-watering 3.46 inches. They were followed by Londoners in 3.37 . inches, the West Midlands at 3.35 inches, Scotland at 3.28 inches and . the women of east England in heels of 3.25 inches. As many as 65 per cent of British . women say they have suffered a significant amount of pain as a result of . their choice of footwear, but a staggering half of these were prepared to endure the agony, which is compared to toothache and earache. Size matters: We may be among the shortest women in Europe but we are trying our best to walk tall by wearing heels of, on average, 3.3 inches . Rachel Long, from London, said she was prepared to suffer in order to look good. The . 35-year-old office clerk added: 'Heels make me feel more confident and . attractive, and I feel the higher they are, the better. 'It does mean my feet are suffering a bit but I’m prepared to go through it.” The study of 3,792 women, conducted by foot care brand Compeed, also found the shorter the person, the higher the heel. Step up: British women wear the highest heels in Europe, followed by Spanish, Danish, German and French girls . Lorraine Jones, from the Society . of Chiropodists and Podiatrists added: 'I recognise that with fashion . as it is, wearing foot-friendly shoes is not always easy. However, wearing fashionable shoes occasionally is fine. 'There . are plenty of easy foot care treatments available that can help treat . feet at home and avoid a trip to the podiatrist’s clinic. 'With healthy feet, a woman can stand as tall as she wants in the highest of heels.'

She is the reality TV star and daughter of Arcadia tycoon Sir Philip Green who has branched out in a design career of her own. And now Chloe Jade Green's rise to fame as fashion designer is heading for new heights with a promising new collection for autumn/winter 2012. Chloe, 21, has expanded her range, which was previously only heels, to feature scarves, fashion-forward jewellery, flat shoes and boots. Those heels are still sky high though... Speaking at the launch of the collection last night, she said: '[It] introduces a rocky edge, mixing up textures of mesh panelling and intricate laser cutwork.' Chloe Green at the press launch of her new AW12 collection for Selfridge's and www.topshop.com at London members' club Sketch last night . 'The 15-piece collection sees the introduction of the signature charm print etched onto the jade green soles. 'In addition the range has been . extended to jewellery with coordinating designs, contrasting delicate . chains with leather, spikes and tough utility pieces.' A twist on the signature Louboutin . red sole (and a reference to her famous surname), the bottom of Green's . are all a shade of green. While . in previous seasons Green's heels have been pointy stilettos, this season she's . gone for a more trend-focused chunky version for AW12, all of which feature a . pretty botanical graphic on the soles. At the launch last night, to which various members of the press were invited, Chloe wore a black lace maxi dress with studded leather sleeveless biker jacket - and chunky biker boots from her own collection. Unlike her usual star-studded launches this was a low-key event with neither her famous father nor celebrities in attendance. CJG is available exclusively on www.topshop.com and in Selfridge's, with prices ranging from £75 to £195 for shoes and boots, £75 for scarves and £25 to £60 for jewellery.

The designs of the shoes are at once pretty and urban, which is a good place for Chloe to be. The collection as a whole seems to be more . perceptive of her target market of girls in their late teens. A far cry from the glittering, metallic . and neon creations in her first collection, these more sophisticated designs are refreshing. The heights of some of the platform heels we love are still eye-watering though, to the point of wondering how dangerous it is to walk in them, which is a shame. The scarves are feminine yet edgy with great screen prints and lovely muted colours that would go well in any pretty goth's closet. The jewellery is also outstanding. We love the spiked cuff bracelet and the collar-like necklaces - both of which would complement a lot of what's already in our wardrobe.

Environmentally minded shoppers can toss their fishing rods in the air and jump for joy as Tesco reveals plans to supply sustainable fish. Thanks to soaring demand, the supermarket giant is set to crank up their range of 'alternative varieties' by a third, from 40 to 60, and become the first major UK retailer to stock fresh cuttlefish and octopus. The Catch of the Day scheme aims to take the pressure off non-sustainable fish, and particularly the 'big five': cod, plaice, haddock, salmon and prawns. As part of their drive to encourage more people to eat sustainable fish, Tesco is stocking fresh cuttlefish . The 'big five' fish, comprising prawns, left, salmon, right, cod, plaice and haddock, makes up 75% of Britain's total fish consumption . Consumption of these breeds makes up 75 per cent of total fish consumption in the UK. Under the scheme, Tesco will now offer the widest range of fish on UK high streets. Among the new, sustainably caught seasonal lines being brought in are fresh cuttlefish, fresh octopus, Dover sole and fresh squid. Other new lines that will be sold by the supermarket as they become available are wild turbot, black bream, Witch soles, brill, grey mullet and anchovies. All of the new fish varieties will be caught in and around British coastal waters, particularly in the south west of England. Fish counter staff at Tesco have . undertaken a training course on the new varieties so that they can offer . customers preparation tips. Fresh octopus can now be found at the Tesco fish counter, as part of their Catch of the Day scheme . Fish and chips as we know it today, left, which is often made from non-sustainable cod, right . Tesco fish specialist Gary Hooper said: 'Through the Catch of the Day initiative we aim to offer customers far more choice than they've ever had before so that they can buy alternatives to the big five species – cod, plaice, salmon, haddock and prawns – and help take pressure off endangered species. 'Last year we launched a training programme for our fish counter staff in order to encourage and advise customers about trying new species of fish which has already proved a great success. 'We think that given more choice and encouragement such as preparation and cooking advice many shoppers will be ready to try something new. 'This move will also benefit British fishing fleets.' Tesco’s campaign to encourage shoppers to try new fish varieties is already showing strong results. Over the past year the supermarket has seen the huge year on year sales rises for fish caught from sustainable sources.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley modelling her first ever lingerie collection called 'Rosie for Autograph' designed in partnership with Marks & Spencer . She is earned her fortune thanks to her phenomenal figure and her passion for lingerie. But Devon-born model, actress and now designer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 25, has revealed she didn't always have the assets she does today. In fact, she earned the nickname Tit-lips at school, because she had more padding on her mouth than she did on her chest. Discussing the new line of lingerie she has designed for Marks & Spencer, the Victoria's Secret Angel said she was given the moniker during her younger years because she had big lips and no cleavage. Happily for her career, those days passed, and Rosie - who has modelled underwear for brands including Chantal Paris, Agent Provocateur and Monsoon - is these days very well-known for her fine feminine form. 'It wasn't a plan. It's just naturally my look, I guess,' she explained to Stylist. 'I felt really empowered doing lingerie shoots. 'Lingerie is the ultimate feminine buy and I love the feeling it gives women, the empowerment. I love that it's for women only and then men afterwards.' Rosie had been approached by other brands to design a line of underwear, but none of them felt right for her to put her name to. Then along came Marks & Spencer, to whom the model felt a very personal connection since it was the shop where she had, despite her Tit-lips nickname, bought her very first bra. 'I love Marks & Spencer: it's so iconically British. Everybody shops there, it doesn't matter whether you've got a massive income or not. It just told a nice story for me. I brought my first bra there.' Rosie said she bought her first ever bra at Marks & Spencer, which motivated her to design a range for the company . Rosie's range of 1920s-inspired underwear for M&S, comprising a 33-piece collection, went on sale last month and the pieces have proved to be extremely popular. She said: 'To find inspiration for the collection I trawled my favourite vintage shops and flea markets in London, LA and Paris. 'I found a treasure trove of gorgeous clothes and ornate pieces of jewellery, as well as pictures and patterns in old design books and fashion magazines. 'I was particularly drawn to the opulent elegance of the Twenties.' Rosie, who is dating British actor Jason Statham, 45, delighted her 117,612 Twitter followers recently by posting pictures of herself modelling her various newly released designs. Rosie modelling her M&S lingerie during a shoot, left, and tweeting a picture of herself in some, right .

She is the fair skinned fashion blogger whose time on reality TV show Made in Chelsea has made her synonymous with on-screen drama and friendship faux pas. But now Rosie Fortescue is ready to be taken seriously and is using the positive (and the negative) comments to make her mark on the fashion world. With her highly successful fashion blog At Fashion Forte about to be launched as a smartphone app and a place on the panel of styling website Just Fab, Rosie has the fashion world at her feet. Made in Chelsea star and blogger Rosie Fortescue is focusing on her true passion for fashion . 'I always watch Gossip Girl and 90210 and you can never find out what outfits the stars are wearing so I set up my blog so viewers can access the outfits I wear on the show. 'I get lots of comments and questions about what I wear and also what make-up I use for my pale skin so I wanted to create something accessible for viewers. It's all so exciting and happening so fast,' she told MailOnline. The star firmly established herself on the e4 show but after putting herself in the public eye and showcasing her drama filled life for millions of viewers every week, the 22-year-old has finally learnt to deal with the public negativity. She said: 'Twitter has calmed down a lot. There are often offensive comments but we've all learnt to be strong and tolerant and now we deal with it. No stranger to the spotlight, Rosie is now on the panel of styling site Just Fab and has plans to turn her blog into an app . 'We have realised that the people who write that stuff are just looking for a reaction.' But one thing Rosie is constantly complimented on, by both viewers and her co-stars, is her immaculate sense of style. 'My style isn't very girly. I love tailoring, structuring and lines. You'll never catch me in puffy dresses, they don't suit me. 'But I've learnt what does look good one me, I know tailored trousers suit me and blazers. I love sexy pointed heels and you don't need to get your legs out to look sexy, it's all about how you feel in an outfit,' she said. She particularly rates frenemy Millie Mackintosh's style. 'I think Millie dresses the best in the show. I think she and I have a similar style, we are both obsessed with hats.' She really reates co-star Millie Mackintosh's style and says they both love hats . And as for the boys, she loves Mark Francis' style but think Ollie Proudlock is the one who can pull any look off with ease. But one co-star whose fashion footsteps she won't be following in is Louise Thompson- who recently unveiled a clothing line with Goddiva. 'I don't think I'd do what Louise did. I am very specific about who I'd work with. If I did a collaboration I'd want full input and because I love fashion so much I'd never just take any opportunity that comes my way.' Instead, Rosie is focusing on developing her app and relishing in an (almost) drama-free season of Made in Chelsea. A love of fashion clearly runs in the family and her twin sister launched an underwear line called Cheek Frills . 'This season is really fun. It's nice to be removed from the drama, I was only involved before because I was supporting Louise. 'The . dynamics have changed and my friendship with Millie has been a natural . progression, we hang out outside of filming and have lots of mutual . friends,' she said. One . girl she won't be forging a firm friendship with is newcomer Lucy . Watson who recently caused a stir by refusing to attend Rosie's dinner . party with Jamie Laing and later showing up with his friend Andy Jordan. 'I don't have an issue with Lucy, we just aren't friends. I didn't know her before and I'd say were not at all similar,' said Rosie. Rosie recently stepped out with a male friend but says she is a private person and wouldn't bring a boyfriend onto the show . While her co-stars are busily . immersed in on-screen love triangles and drama, Rosie believes that love . should be something saved for when the cameras stop rolling.

His mother said: 'We will never do the lottery because we are already the luckiest people alive. 'I think when even the doctors are saying ""we don't know how he is still here"", you know your son is special. 'I never expected him to come back from any of his operations, but here he is.'

The toddler suffers from the rare Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder which puts him at risk of cancer and other illnesses. His parents were repeatedly told to expect the worst, and due to his fighting spirit, now describe him as their 'little miracle'. Mr and Mrs Davidson found out about Olly's condition when he was in the womb. The odds were stacked against Olly but now he is back at home and learning to walk . Doctors had to operate immediately after he was born to correct his stomach, and it wasn't until 15 days later that he could be held by his parents. Mrs Davidson, a full-time mother, remembers gazing at her newborn baby as he was treated in an intensive care unit. She said: 'We were told he was very poorly and to expect the worst.

After a few weeks, Olly made it home, but because of his condition, his tongue grew unusually large and it led to severe breathing difficulties. In November 2011, his father Kevin, a chef, had to give his nine-week-old son CPR and the youngster was rushed to hospital for surgery and placed on oxygen. But during a routine scan in March last year, the family received another devastating blow. Olly had a tumour on his liver and would need to start chemotherapy the next week. He had the tumour, and a quarter of his liver, removed during a seven-hour operation but he suffered peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdomen wall, straight after. The odds were stacked against Olly but now he is back at home and learning to walk, however because of the syndrome, medics will need to keep an eye on him for years to come.

'Misled': The £86 Breastlight device, which claims to help women spot the first signs of tumours, has misled thousands of women the advertising watchdog has ruled . Thousands of women have been ‘misled’ into buying a torch which claims to detect breast cancer, the advertising watchdog has ruled. The £86 Breastlight device – which is sold online and in Boots – claims to help women spot the first signs of tumours. More than 20,000 of the torches have been sold worldwide since they were launched in 2006. But in a ruling published today, the Advertising Standards Authority said the website which advertises and sells the devices is ‘misleading’ and ‘irresponsible’. Cancer charities are also concerned that women are using the torches as a ‘substitute’ for breast screening and subsequently getting ‘false reassurance’. On the product’s website, manufacturers PWB Health describe the torch as an ‘earlier breast cancer screening device’. Women are advised to use the device in a darkened room and shine the red light of the torch on their breasts which enables them to see under the skin. Veins and blood vessels appear as dark lines and any tumours may show up as shadows. The manufacturers claim to have carried out trials on 300 women showing the torch successfully detected cancers in two thirds of cases. They also say that 80 per cent who have used it felt ‘more confident’ afterwards. But the ASA has today ordered the manufacturers to change the website and remove such claims. In a statement, the watchdog ruled: ‘The ad must not appear in its current form.

A scandal-hit hospital where thirsty patients were forced to drink out of vases and others left to sit on their own excrement has paid out more than £1 million in compensation for 'inhumane and degrading' treatment. Human Rights solicitor Emma Jones, who . is part of a legal team representing more than 100 victims of alleged . abuse at Stafford Hospital, said today that Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation . Trust paid out the significant sum to patients or their families. The news comes a month ahead of the publication of the report of the public inquiry into the serious failings at the trust. More than 100 victims of alleged abuse at Stafford Hospital have received part of a £1m payout after receiving 'inhumane standards of care . Inquiry chair Robert Francis QC said the report will be published in January. The £11 million inquiry, which was commissioned in 2010, is examining what went wrong at the trust between January 2005 and March 2009. In 2009, a separate highly-critical report by the Healthcare Commission revealed a catalogue of failings at the trust and said ""appalling standards"" put patients at risk. Between 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected in a three-year period from 2005 to 2008, the Commission said. In February 2010, an independent inquiry into events at the trust found it had 'routinely neglected patients'. Human Rights solicitor Emma Jones fears similar treatment may be occurring at other hospitals . Ms Jones said patients were left to sit in faeces for extended periods of time and food and drink were purposefully put out of reach with thirsty patients who forced to drink water out of flower vases. She said: 'Having visited the families of those who died, or victims who survived the horrors of this hospital, you cannot help but become angry and extremely worried that this is happening elsewhere, with the same excuses being given and blind eyes being cast to what is torture of the most vulnerable in a place where care should be the single most important feature. 'We believe that care in some hospitals is so bad it continues to breach the European Convention on Human Rights. 'We await the report into Stafford Hospital and hope that change does come to what is still a healthcare system to be proud of and which remains the envy of the world, but it needs to continually improve and learn lessons from when things go wrong and have the systems in place for these issues to come to the surface and not be buried under bureaucracy or, even worse, disguised for financial benefit.'","Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation .

And Prince and Princess Michael of Kent received a pair of seriously impressive bent-knee salutations from author Leonie Frieda at a launch party to celebrate the writer's new historical book. The royal pair looked most amused as Ms Frieda - who is close friends with the couple - crouched as low as her indigo satin strapless dress would allow as she greeted them at Kensington Palace in London last night. Hit the floor: Leonie Frieda crouches low as she curtseys for Prince Michael of Kent at the launch party for her new book, The Deadly Sisterhood, at Kensington Palace . The Swedish-born author was celebrating the launch of her book The Deadly Sisterhood, which is based upon the lives of eight Italian Renaissance women, one of whom - Catherine de Medici - is an ancestor of Princess Michael. Ms Frieda, 56, a former model who is divorced from music producer Nigel Frieda, attended the regal event with her daughter Elisabeth. Princess Michael of Kent, 67 - whose name is Marie Christine - and Prince Michael of Kent, 70, are the parents of Freddie and Gabriella Windsor. Prince Michael is a grandson of George V and Queen Mary. On your knees: Leonie Freida greets her old friend, Princess Michael of Kent, with a supremely respectful curtsey . The ancient art of curtseying - a show of respect to the Royal family - hit the headlines in February when a set of rules was revealed regarding to whom the Duchess of Cambridge should be curtseying, and when. The official guide for Kate is that if the Queen enters or leaves a room, Kate curtseys; if Camilla appears and is with Charles, William's wife should also curtsey to her. But if Charles is absent but William is present, then Kate outranks Camilla, who should curtsey to Kate. This is because William outranks Camilla in terms of the lineage, which means that effectively so does his wife while he is present. If neither William nor Charles is there, then Kate curtseys to Camilla because, woman to woman, Camilla is her senior in the Firm. In the case of Princess Anne, born a princess, and Princess Alexandra (the Queen's cousin and granddaughter of George V), both these women have royal blood in their veins and therefore are more important than Kate - unless William happens to be around, in which case she's more important than them. Sophie Wessex, being married to a royal junior in rank to William, has to curtsey to them all. As for Prince Andrew's daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, they out-rank Kate - but not when William is in the room. Old pals: Princess Michael of Kent, in red, greets writer Leonie Frieda at her book launch last night . The Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips - who always conforms to Royal protocol when meeting her grandmother - said in 2008 that few people know how to curtsey anymore. Cherie Blair famously refused to curtsey to the Queen on a visit to Balmoral in 1997 . 'I curtsey to her every time I see her,' the 27-year-old told Majesty magazine. 'The thing with my grandmother is she is still my grandmother and she's very approachable, but she's also from an era where that was how it was done. 'But there aren't many people who know how it's done. I know because I have grown up with it.' When Zara collected her MBE in 2006 she jokingly showed others the correct way to greet the Queen.

But thanks to the life-saving actions of neighbour Barbara Osborne, the 19-month-old is back on his feet. Lifesaver: Kyle with his mother Donna High, right, and neighbour Barbara Osborne, left, who brought the little boy back to life after he stopped breathing while playing with his brothers and sisters . Ms High, 31, said: 'He was playing, but when he doesn’t get his own way he holds his breath. We’re used to it and I blow on his face when he does it. But this time I couldn’t bring him back. 'If Barbara hadn’t been there I don’t know what I would have done. I was panicking and I thought there was no chance. 'I thought he was gone. It was the worst day of my life. I would never want anybody to have to go through that. 'I need the world to know how thankful I am to her. I know paramedics were on the scene a short time after but it was her that saved him.' Kyle stopped breathing as he played with his twin brother Kaiden and sisters Kelsey, 11, Ellie-Mae, eight, and Shelby, six. Ms High added: 'He just went grey and floppy in my arms.' Ms High raced out of her home at Brambles Farm, Middlesbrough, last Tuesday, looking for help and ran to her friend Ms Osborne’s house.

Just 40 minutes later he was back to his usual ‘cheeky . and mischievous’ self . She said: 'I wasn’t thinking properly. I was traumatised. I ran out the front door. Usually there are people all over but there was nobody around. 'I ran to my neighbour’s house screaming. I shot him to my friend’s mum and she told me to phone an ambulance.' It was while Ms High was calling for help that Ms Osborne brought Kyle back to life. The 57-year-old said: 'Donna came running in screaming: ‘My baby is dead’. He was blue there was nothing there at all. I think adrenaline just kicked in and I got on with it. I checked his mouth to check he wasn’t choking and then gave him mouth-to-mouth. 'It seemed like a long time but it was probably only like three or four minutes.' She said Kyle came round momentarily before going ashen again so she carried on resuscitating him until he started making gulping and swallowing noises. Paramedics arrived on scene a short time later and took Kyle to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Just 40 minutes later he was back to his usual ‘cheeky and mischievous’ self. Ms High is now waiting on test results to see if there are any medical reasons that could have caused Kyle to stop breathing. She added that if it wasn’t for Ms Osborne she doesn’t believe Kyle would have survived. 'A lot of people would have been too scared and would not know what to do. It was so lucky that she was there. My kids are my life. Flowers or a card are not enough, how do you thank someone for saving your son?' Ms Osborne said it was due to first aid training she got as a teaching assistant that she knew what to do. She said: 'Everyone was panicking and didn’t know what to do.

A one-year-old girl in China is suffering from a rare skin disease that makes her look like an old woman. Yuxin Xiaoli is thought be suffering from cutis laxa, a rare connective tissue disorder in which the skin becomes inelastic and hangs loosely in folds. Yuxin Xiaoli is thought be suffering from cutis laxa, which is a group of rare connective tissue disorders in which the skin becomes inelastic and hangs loosely in folds . The little girl’s face is covered with wrinkles, and the skin on her cheeks hangs. The skin on her body is even looser. Her 23-year-old mother Yang recalls her daughter’s skin was loose when she was born. ‘We didn't pay much attention, as we thought all kids were like that,’ she said. 'She looks like an old man,' said her grandmother Cao Niu (pictured). 'Last time I took her to visit a doctor, and another child was scared and cried heavily' She added that pregnancy check-ups hadn’t indicated anything was wrong. 'And she was a 9lb baby – a big one,’ she said. Now 18 months old, Yuxin’s condition is deteriorating. 'She looks like an old man,’ said her grandmother Cao Niu. ‘Last time I took her to visit a doctor, another kid was scared and cried heavily. ‘I am reluctant to take her out, as people stare at her like an alien.’ The little girl¿s face is covered with wrinkles, and the skin on her cheeks hangs. The skin on her body is even looser . Yuxin also has congenital heart disease, pneumonia and asthma, and spends much of her time at the children’s hospital in in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province. Her hair has to be kept short so doctors can administer drugs through an IV tube and injections into her head. In the past year, the family spent more than 80,000 Yuan (around £8,000) on her treatment. Despite her declining health, Yuxin’s family say she is a lively child. ‘She is quite active and smart and she imitates others’  facial expressions quickly,’ her grandmother said. Cutis laxa is a disorder of connective tissue, which provides structure and strength to the muscles, joints, organs, and skin. It is a rare disorder, thought to affect about 200 affected families worldwide. The term 'cutis laxa' is Latin for loose or lax skin, and is used to describe skin that is sagging and inelastic. The skin often hangs in loose folds, causing the face and other parts of the body to have a droopy appearance. Extremely wrinkled skin may be particularly noticeable on the neck and in the armpits and groin. Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. The disorder can cause heart problems and abnormal narrowing or tearing of critical arteries. Those suffering from the condition may suffer from other internal problems such as hernias. During childhood, some people with cutis laxa develop a lung disease called emphysema, which can make it difficult to breathe. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa can range from mild to life-threatening.","Yuxin Xiaoli thought have rare disorder in which the skin .

Antibiotics are not effective in treating children’s coughs caused by the common cold and may even slow recovery down. These were the conclusions of Italian researchers, who looked at the treatment of 305 children suffering such coughs. Of the children, one group received antibiotics only, while another received combination of antibiotics and cough-suppressing medication. The rest of the children received nothing at all. They found those treated with both cough medicine and antibiotics recovered quicker than those just given antibiotics. Children treated with both cough medicine and antibiotics recovered quicker than those just given antibiotics, who hate the same rate as those who were given no treatment . But those given only antibiotics recovered no quicker than the children given nothing. The study was presented at annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians this week. Lead author Francesco de Blasio, of the University of Bologna, said GPs often wrote prescriptions for coughs to ‘pacify parents’. He added: ‘However, antibiotics show very little effectiveness at treating cough due to your average head cold.’ ‘Few drugs are as effective as cough suppressants, and antibiotics are no more effective in relieving cough than the use of no medication.’ NHS guidance states that antibiotics are not used to treat coughs because they are only effective in killing bacteria, not viruses. Therefore, unless you develop a secondary bacterial infection, such as pneumonia, antibiotics will not usually be advised. Indeed, although antibiotics may not be an effective therapy for cough, they can be useful in treating underlying infections that may produce cough, said Dr de Blasio. ‘But this does not mean they should be overused. ‘Using antibiotics as a treatment for cough without suspected infection is unnecessary and can be harmful. Repeated use of antibiotics, especially when they are ineffective, can lead to adverse allergic reactions or a resistance to the medications.’","Cough medicine is the best treatment for coughs caused by a common cold, say Italian researchers .

The middle-classes have seen the sharpest increase in numbers of children with nut allergies . Parents who keep their homes obsessively clean could be causing their children to develop life-threatening nut allergies, researchers claim. In the past 20 years the number of British children with the condition has doubled – with the sharpest increase among the middle classes. Scientists say their findings support the theory that youngsters from wealthier families have a  weakened immune system because they live in cleaner homes. Their study examined 8,306 patients, 776 of which had some  form of reaction to peanuts, and  the findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American  College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. Lead study author, allergist Dr Sandy Yip, said: ‘Overall household income is only associated with peanut sensitisation in children aged one to nine years. ‘This may indicate that development of peanut sensitisation at a young age is related to affluence, but those developed later in life are not.’ Researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities. ‘While many children can develop a tolerance to food allergens as they age, only 20 per cent will outgrow a peanut allergy,’ said ACAAI president Dr Stanley Fineman. Nut allergies commonly cause breathing problems and occasionally result in death through anaphylactic shock. Reaction: Researchers also found that peanut allergy was generally higher in males and ethnic minorities . Last year, researchers at Edinburgh and Maastricht universities studied records from more than 400 GP practices in England between 2001 and 2005 to determine the number of patients with an allergy. The study showed more than 25,000 people in England have been diagnosed with a nut allergy at some point in their lives. It also found that children from a more affluent background were twice as likely to have a peanut allergy compared to their poorer counterparts. One British child in 50 has a peanut allergy – double the proportion of two decades ago. The majority of allergic reactions to nuts are mild, with hives, eczema and vomiting the most common complaints. Until 2009, the Food Standards Agency warned women to avoid peanuts in pregnancy and while breastfeeding if there was a family history of allergies. The advice was later altered after a major review of scientific evidence showed there is no clear link between eating peanuts at a young age and developing an allergy in later life.","In the past 20 years the number of British children with nut allergies has doubled .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 15 July 2011 . Sportswear guru: Sports Direct owner and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley . Two thousand shop staff at Sports Direct were celebrating yesterday after landing a shares windfall worth on average more than £43,000 each for beating sales and profits targets. Sports Direct, founded by former squash coach Mike Ashley 29 years ago, has hit its target for the second year in a row, with profits up 25 per cent for the year ending this April. This means its staff are set for a shares windfall worth more than twice their average salary of £20,000. It is believed to be the largest shares bonanza of its kind ever to be handed out to shop staff in Britain. While other high street stores are struggling, the company - whose boss also owns Newcastle United - has surged ahead with its business. Staff at the discount sportswear chain, which also owns Sports World, Lillywhites and brands including Slazenger, Lonsdale and Dunlop, who are entitled to the share pay-out are those that have been on the payroll for two years. Each will receive an average £30,960 share payout, and in addition will net a bonus payout for meeting the previous year’s target, which means they will each pocket an average total of £43,860. The company’s share price has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  The firm grew its retail sales by 6.6 per cent, with revenues up 10.2 per cent. The only drawback is that they will have to wait until July next year if they want to cash in their shares. The company has revealed underlying profits of £200.4 million in the year until April - topping its target of £195million. Mr . Ashley, who set up his first shop in Maidenhead, Berkshire in 1982 and . now has approximately 350 around the UK, devised the scheme two years . ago to help improve the chain's trading performance. The . company's shares scheme is said to be more generous than those run by . rival chains such as John Lewis, Tesco and Asda, who offer cash bonuses. Booming profits: Sports Direct, founded Mike Ashley 29 years ago, has hit its profits target for the second year in a row . But executives say it is partly the reason why they have become so successful. Sports Direct’s chief executive, Dave Forsey, told the Independent: ‘This has been an excellent year of growth for the group in what has been a challenging retail environment. ‘Key to this growth has been the success of our employee bonus share scheme, which we introduced to focus on the whole group on our ambitious growth targets.’ An analyst at Singer Capital Markets, Matthew McEachran, said the boost in sales of between £15 million and £20 million in the last year was partly influenced by the World Cup. Sports Direct plans to open or relocated 15 to 20 outlets over the next year in the UK, including one at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford – conveniently close to the London 2012 Olympic site. It also currently has eight stores throughout continental Europe and plans to expand that number to 17 within the next five years. ANALYSIS By DAMIEN GAYLE . Mike Ashley, a former county squash coach, opened his first sports shop in 1982. Twenty-nine years later, he controls the UK's dominant high street sports retailer. Although Sports Direct is now a publicly traded company with annual revenues brushing £1.5billion, Ashley still holds around 71 per cent of the stock, making him one of Britain's richest men. Ashley's rise to wealth has been achieved by a mix of hard work, business acumen, and ruthless operating. As a banker said of him before Sports Direct's debut on the London Stock Exchange: 'He [Ashley] likes to park his tanks on peoples' lawns.' Biggest sporting goods retailer: . Sports Direct also owns Sports World, Lillywhites and brands including Slazenger, Lonsdale and Dunlop . Ashley's business with a single store in Maidenhead in the early Eighties, trading as Mike Ashley Sports. As the decade progressed, he opened several more sports and ski shops around London, reaching three outlets by 1990. Funded by the profits from these shops, an injection of private money and a 'pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap philosophy', the chain expanded quickly. By the end of the Nineties, with 100 UK stores rebranded as Sports Soccer, Ashley finally made the switch from sole trader and incorporated the business as a limited company. A perennial outsider, in 2000, Ashley turned whistleblower on industry rivals. He handed the Office of Fair Trading evidence of meetings held by sports retailers to fix the price of football shirts. According to reports, at the meeting Dave Whelan, the founder of JJB Sports, told Ashley: 'There's a club in the north son, and you're not part of it.' Allsports, JJB, JD Sports and Blacks Leisure were later fined millions by the OFT. He then embarked on a series of takeovers which shot his business into overdrive. In 2002, he bought prestigious Piccadilly Circus sports shop Lilywhites, and was accused of turning it downmarket. Uncowed, he moved into sportswear manufacturing two years later, buying Dunlop Slazenger for £40million, closely followed by acquisitions of outdoor gear manufacturer Karrimor, iconic hat maker Kangol, boxing brand Lonsdale and tennis brand Donnay. His acquisitions, mainly at hefty discounts from distressed buyers, showcased his ruthless business style, but broadened the scope of his sports retail empire. Deals with Umbro, Matalan, Blacks and even archrival JJB helped Ashley cement the Sports Direct brand and give it a firm foothold in the consciousness of sporting consumers. Lillywhites store in Piccadilly Circus, London: Ashley was accused of taking the prestigious sportswear retailer downmarket . Ashley's parent company, Sports World International, finally debuted on the London Stock Exchange on February 27, 2007, valued at £2.5billion. A year later, it was revealed that Ashley also held a 12 per cent stake in John David Group, parent of JD Sports. He is thought to hold stakes in a number of his rivals. Last week, Ashley signalled an attempt to take Sports Direct upmarket with an announcement of a tie-up with fashion retail chains USC and Cruise. The company agreed to take an 80 per cent stake in the chains, run by Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, for £7million. Both stores specialise in expensive designer leisure brands like Ugg boots, Adidas Originals and the £300-a-pair True Religion jeans.","Profits up 25 per cent at sports wear retailer .

It was deafening.’ In an interview with music magazine NME, Sir Paul – who was singing live but accompanied by a prerecorded backing track – spoke of his embarrassment over the gaffe at the end of the four-hour show. He had recorded his voice with the backing music before they went on. The idea was that when they went live, he would sing over it, with the effect that his voice would then come across twice as strong and reach round the whole stadium. For whom the bell tolls: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins ringing the 23-ton bell to officially mark the start of the Olympic games in London . But with the bell chiming, Sir Paul . missed his cue and began singing late, creating a two-bar delay between . his voice and the backing track. He explained: ‘We prerecorded a playback in case all hell broke loose, but I said, “We wanna do it live.” ‘We were live, everyone was there, the world was ready and this bloody great bell goes off. And I forget I’ve gotta wait for it, so I go “Hey Jude .  .  .”, and someone presses the playback. ‘So there’s me on the backing track, and actual me; two of us singing.’ It seems Sir Paul is still a little confused – as a video of the performance shows that he did indeed start singing after the backing track. He added: ‘The drummer wouldn’t look at me because he was in hysterics and I was thinking, “What have I done?” ‘There was no stopping, it was the Olympics.’ Afterwards, millions took to Twitter and website forums to comment on the glitch, some calling for the 70-year-old pop legend to hang up his microphone. One wrote: ‘To see a colossus laid low by his failing powers is the stuff of Greek tragedy – but it’s doubly tragic that it should happen in front of a worldwide audience.’ Others described the performance as ‘cringe-inducing’, with another adding: ‘Time to Let It Be.’ Ironically, the mistake came just weeks after Sir Paul joked in an interview about the prospect of making just such a high-profile gaffe. He said: ‘Generally I don’t [get nervous]. But having said that, you never quite know. ‘You can do something such as the Jubilee or the Olympics and get the old collywobbles. ‘Oh God, that’d be good, wouldn’t it? Make a mistake at the Olympics!’ Last month it emerged that the Olympic bell, which was cast in Holland, had been dumped in a storage area in London’s Docklands. Olympic organisers LOCOG had promised it would remain at the Olympic site for 200 years after the Games. It is due to be returned to the site imminently.

Kate Winslet is at the centre of an embarrassing row over drug legalisation, after her name was used to endorse a campaign run by her boyfriend’s uncle, Sir Richard Branson. The Oscar-winning actress appears in a 17-second YouTube clip alongside Sir Richard to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary made by his son Sam which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs, and supports a campaign of the same name. Miss Winslet, 37, who lives with Sir Richard’s nephew Ned Rocknroll, does not appear in the documentary but features in the black-and-white promotional clip saying: ‘I’m Kate Winslet and I’m breaking the taboo.’ Black and white: Kate Winslet has appeared in a YouTube video to promote Breaking the Taboo, a documentary which sets out the case for decriminalising drugs . Sir Richard Branson runs the campaign and appears alongside the actress in a 17-second YouTube clip . The film, released next week, includes contributions from former US President Bill Clinton, and is understood to argue that the current approach to drugs has failed and highlights countries where decriminalisation has been successful. Asked by The Mail on Sunday on Friday to clarify which aspects of the campaign she supported, sources close to Miss Winslet – who won a Best Actress Oscar for her role in The Reader in 2008 – said she was happy to promote the film and encourage debate, but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs. Hours later, Miss Winslet’s name and photograph were removed from a list of supporters on the campaign’s website. The campaign is being run in conjunction with the film and suggests ‘solutions’ to the ‘war on drugs’, including proposals to ‘fully legalise and regulate the drug market’ and ‘decriminalise all drugs’. Miss Winslet said she was happy to encourage debate but was not calling for the legalisation of drugs . It was later claimed Miss Winslet’s name had been included on the  website without her knowledge or permission. Last night the YouTube clip remained on the Breaking the Taboo website, with sources saying the actress’s involvement ‘starts and ends with [the YouTube] gesture of support for the film’. A source said: ‘There was a  mistake, she shouldn’t have been  on there. We’ve had her taken off. ‘She doesn’t support all the things on that list, she supports the film. ‘Kate got involved with the film because of her relationship with Sir Richard’s nephew, Ned. Kate does not, and never has, used drugs. Her support for the film is because she supports the film’s attempt to open the debate on alternative and more effective ways to end the misery that the drug trade causes.’ A film insider added: ‘There is  a very distinct feeling that any suggestion Kate supports the legalisation of drugs would have a very negative impact on her career.’ Miss Winslet was among more than a dozen stars, including Sting, historian Niall Ferguson and John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, listed as supporters of Breaking the Taboo, which calls on governments to ‘end the war on drugs’. The campaign is run by the Beckley Foundation – the drug charity behind Channel 4’s recent Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial – in association with Sir Richard’s Virgin Unite foundation  and his son Sam’s film company Sundog Pictures. Its mission statement says: ‘The policies of prohibition create more harms than good.’ It adds: ‘We must seriously consider shifting resources away from criminalising tens of millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens and move towards an approach based on health, harm reduction, cost-effectiveness and respect for human rights.’ A spokesman for the Bransons admitted Miss Winslet’s name had been used in error, but stopped short of issuing an apology. She said: ‘Kate Winslet has been supportive in joining the viral campaign for our documentary. Kate should only have been featured in the film/viral section, where [the video clip] now sits – this was rectified as soon as we realised the error.’ Big names: The campaign is supported by a host of famous faces including Yoko Ono and Sting . The row looks set to cause acute . embarrassment for Miss Winslet and her boyfriend of 15 months, . Mr Rocknroll, 34, who works in  marketing and ‘astronaut relations’ for .

A police officer who was named 'Trooper of the Year 2007' for making more than 200 DUI arrests could see her cases overturned after she admitted violating standard procedure. Lisa Steed . admitted in court this week that she had removed her microphone during a 2010 DUI stop so her superior wouldn't know what she was doing. This is not the first time Steed's actions on DUI stops have got her into trouble. In 2009, a shocking police car dashcam recording . caught her tasering a terrified man after he refused to get out . of his car asking to call his lawyer. The man was later found to have been sober. A Facebook group has been set up calling . on the police to fire Steed called; 'End Abusive Police: Fire UHP . Officer Lisa Steed.' It has over 120 supporters. Scroll down for video . Steed, pictured in court on Tuesday, admitted to the violations at a DUI hearing for a man she had arrested . 'The cumulative facts may well have a significant ripple effect across every case she's touched,' Salt Lake City attorney Joseph Jardine told ABCNews.com. 'This could become the basis for overturning multiple convictions in the past.' Jardine is representing Theron Alexander, who said Steed violated procedure when she administered a breathalyzer test before a field sobriety test in March 2010. 'The credibility of an investigating . officer is paramount. If you can't trust the cop at their word, there's . very little left that you can trust with an investigation,' Jardine . said. Steed was reprimanded after a 2009 incident in which she was captured on a police dashboard camera tasering man who asked to call hi lawyer, pictured . The motorist, Ryan Jones, can be heard screaming in agony as she zaps him, pictured. He was later awarded $40,000 by the state . Steed admitted that she had removed her microphone and left in in the patrol car during the incident so she could perform an unauthorized action, according to ABC News. 'She specifically stated [Tuesday] that she took the microphone off so her superior wouldn't know what she was doing,' Jardine said. 'We're concerned that she may have a tendency to stretch the truth when it suits her purposes. Our objective is to probe her credibility.' Trooper Steed's statements came while she took the witness stand in the DUI court case. Steed, pictured on Tuesday, was named 'Trooper of the Year 2007' for making more than 200 DUI arrests but now see her cases overturned . Steed's attorney Greg Skordas told ABC that the incident is not a reflection of his client's credibility. 'It doesn't affect her credibility. It affects the way she does things, her ability to follow instructions,' Skordas told ABC. 'It doesn't mean she's dishonest.' Skordas claimed that Steed was simply trying to give the motorist that she had pulled over 'the benefit of the doubt' by skipping straight to the breathalyzer test and not having them get out of the car. 'It wasn't anyone she knew. I think she was just being overly sensitive,' Skordas said. 'There wasn't any bad intent. It was one of those, no good deed goes unpunished.' A Facebook group has been set up calling on the police to fire Steed called; 'End Abusive Police: Fire UHP Officer Lisa Steed' Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim . Gill said his office has been investigating several dozen pending DUI . cases involving Steed after complaints arose. The 2009 taser recording showed the officer shouting at Ryan Jones to get out of his car, when he asked to call his lawyer first. She quickly  threatens him with a taser saying: 'If you don't get out now, you're getting tasered in two second.' She then threatens to get a police dog to 'rip him out of the car'. Jones can be heard calmly saying, ""Ma'am, please don't shoot me with a Taser,'. However, Steed ignores his plea and zaps him as he is sitting in his car. He can be heard screaming in agony in the recording and then begging her not to do it again before he is zapped a second time. When Jones was eventually tested, his blood alcohol level was a 0.03, well below the legal limit. The case was settled in November 2011 when the state paid Jones $40,000 without admitting wrongdoing. Of the case, Skordas said, she was reprimanded and had moved on.

Warning shot: Prime Minister David Cameron told the BBC's Andrew Marr that Britain would be ready to fight another war to protect the Falkland Islands . Britain is ready to fight another war to protect the Falkland Islands, David Cameron warned today. After months of rising tensions over the future of the islands, the Prime Minister made clear for the first time that Britain is prepared to mount a repeat of the 1982 conflict if they are threatened. Asked if the UK would fight to keep the Falklands, he replied: ‘Of course we would. ‘We have strong defences in place on the Falkland Islands. That is absolutely key - we have fast jets stationed there, we have troops stationed on the Falklands. ‘I get regular reports on this entire issue because I want to know that our defences are strong, our resolve is extremely strong.’ Mr Cameron insisted that despite defence cuts, Britain would be able to defend the islands again, as Margaret Thatcher did in 1982 at a cost of more than 900 lives - 255 of them British servicemen. ‘At £35 billion a year, we still have one of the top five defence budgets in the world; and we’ll go on having that scale of defences and we’re actually re-equipping our armed services in a very, very effective way,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. A war of words over the future of the Falklands, known to Argentina as Las Malvinas, has erupted since the re-election of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as the country’s President. The fiery Argentine leader attempted to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands in an encounter at a recent G20 summit. To her fury, the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to accept it, insisting she should respect the views of the islanders who want to remain British. Frank discussion: Mr Cameron, right, discusses the Falklands Islands with Andrew Marr, left, on BBC1 this morning . Role model: Mr Cameron, right, says that he would be willing to follow in former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's (left) footsteps and fight for the Falklands Islands . Last week, as her popularity at home plummets, she published an open letter to Mr Cameron claiming that Argentina had been ‘forcibly stripped’ of the islands and demanding negotiations over sovereignty. Srong opinion: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been very outspoken about the Falklands and has demanded negotiations with Mr Cameron . The letter was timed to coincide with the 180th anniversary of what Argentina claims is a British occupation. Buenos Aires has been further infuriated by the British government’s decision to name a large section of territory in Antarctica after the Queen. It has been accused of ‘intimidating’ British cruise ships near the Falkland Islands. Six incidents have occurred in the past two months where protesters or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted vessels bound for the islands, the Government said. They include officials refusing entry to Argentine ports or delaying ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking shipping company offices and cruise itineraries either altered, or abandoned, to appease locals. The Falkland Islands administration has responded to the tensions by calling a referendum, to be held in March, which is expected to see an overwhelming majority of residents vote in favour of retaining the present status as a British overseas territory. Lord West, the former head of the British Navy, said Mrs Kirchner was behaving in a ‘very stupid way’ over the islands, . He insisted that he did not think any military action was imminent from Argentina, despite her sabre-rattling, but warned the situation could escalate. 'It would be laughable if it wasn’t for the fact that these things sometimes lead to really nasty things,’ Lord West told Sky News. History: Steel helmets abandoned by Argentine armed forces who surrendered at Goose Green to British Falklands Task Force troops during the Falklands War . ‘I lost 22 of my boys down there and we do not want through stupidity and this sort of silly nonsense ending up in that position again. 'At the moment the Argentineans are incapable of and wouldn’t want to do a military action, but that can change very quickly.’ Dr Barry Elsby, of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, said: ‘We are not a colony - our relationship with the United Kingdom is by choice. ‘Unlike the Government of Argentina, the United Kingdom respects the right of our people to determine our own affairs, a right that is enshrined in the UN Charter and which is ignored by Argentina.’","Prime Minister David Cameron spoke on the Andrew Marr programme .

With their showstopping Olympic appearance and glitzy new West End musical, the Spice Girls are  as hot today as they were in their Nineties heyday. And now the most successful female group ever are set to re-form for a new album and tour – but without the reluctant Victoria Beckham. Instead, the remaining four members could hold auditions for a new ‘Posh Spice’ –  through a major TV talent hunt to rival X Factor. Scroll down for video . Snubbed: The Spice Girls are set to reunite for an album and tour but Victoria Beckham has decided not to join her ex-bandmates. The other four members could hold auditions for a fifth member . A source said: ‘The girls are going it alone without Victoria. They are keen to get back together and were trying to work out if they could do it as a four-piece. I think they know this is the last chance for them to get the band going again. ‘But the Spice Girls as a foursome is not going to get them another record deal or sell out big venues. They need an extra cherry on the cake. And the cherry on the cake would be if they replaced Victoria. ‘And that leads to the next question: who do they replace her with? At the moment it’s all being done in a very cloak-and-dagger way and not through official channels.’ Indeed, spokesmen for Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton, Mel Chisholm and Mel Brown either declined to comment or could not be reached for reaction. Beckham’s publicist said: ‘Victoria respects all of the girls and will always support them all personally and professionally.’ Possible replacement: A source said the four remaining members need 'an extra cherry on the cake'. Sugababes star Heidi Range, left, has been mooted as a possible replacement . Beckham, who has forged a more successful solo career than any of her former colleagues, kept her distance from the rest of the Spice Girls at the first night of their musical Viva Forever! on Tuesday . She arrived late, missing a photoshoot with the rest of the group and delaying curtain-up, then left the after-party earlier than the others. The reunion plan is being spearheaded by Halliwell, who was  the first to leave the group in  1998, at the height of their fame.  She is understood to have been  performing private showcases for record executives in a bid to drum up interest. She is said to have compared the planned reunion with Take That’s hugely successful decision to  re-form without Robbie Williams in 2005 (although he later rejoined). Take That never used a substitute for Williams, but the Spice Girls are considering either a reality TV series to find the ‘new Posh’ – or recruiting a singer with more experience of the music business. Five become four: Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown posed together at the premiere of the Spice girls musical in London, without Posh who turned up separately . Family support: David and Victoria Beckham with their children Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn arrived together at the London premiere. Victoria later appeared on stage in the band's original lineup . Sugababes star Heidi Range, 29, has been mooted as a possible replacement. The band source added: ‘At the moment they’re thinking who, out there, who’s been in a another band, could “be” Victoria. There would be interest in a television series, but I think they’re keen on someone with industry experience rather than discovering a new star.’ Sources say the girls will announce plans to re-form within weeks. They split in 2000, after releasing their farewell studio album Forever, but reunited for a world tour in 2007, which netted them £10 million each. The move may also trigger commercial wrangles about whether the remaining band members will be able to use the Spice Girls name without Beckham’s involvement and whether the new fifth member with have the right to use the ‘Posh’ title. In 2002 Beckham attempted to block Peterborough United FC from registering their long-standing nickname, The Posh, as a trademark. Separated: While the foursome arrived at the premiere looking happy, Victoria Beckham met fans alone on the red carpet . The star could also be entitled to a slice of any profits from a new Spice Girls tour as co-writer of many of the band’s hits. And she is one of five partners of Spice Girls LLP, which Companies House documents describe as being involved in ‘activities of its members associated with their previous live performances’. Each of the Spice Girls could make £3 million if the Jennifer Saunders-scripted Viva Forever! becomes a hit. The show – which coincidentally revolves around a TV talent show – received a cold reception from critics, with one describing it as ‘a prize Christmas turkey’, but it has already taken £4 million at the box office. Interest in the Spice Girls, who formed in 1994 after answering an advert in performers’ newspaper The Stage, will be further heightened by a 90-minute documentary to air on ITV on Christmas Eve, featuring interviews with all five members. Another band source said of the possible reunion: ‘They all have existing work and family commitments. As you’d expect with the biggest girl band of all time they are always receiving ideas and offers.’ Viva Forever!: The musical, featuring Spice Girls songs, tells the story of a four-girl group called Eternity who feature on a talent contest .

Labour's Denis Macshane quit the Commons in November after a damning report by the standards watchdog recommended he be suspended for a year . Police have launched a fresh probe into the expense claims of former Labour minister Denis Macshane who was forced to quit Parliament over claims he faked invoices. Scotland Yard is to look again at the 64-year-old’s claims after a damning report by parliament’s standards watchdog said his case was the ‘gravest’ it had seen which had not been dealt with by the criminal law. The Standards and Privileges Committee examined the way the former Europe Minister made up invoices worth £12,900. ‘The bills were signed with a “nom de plume” purporting to come from a general manager who did not in fact exist,’ the MPs said. In July last year police dropped the case, amid claims evidence was covered by parliamentary privilege and could not be used in court. But committee chairman Kevin Barron said that while the letters between Mr MacShane, former MP for Rotherham, and the Commissioner were privileged, the faked invoices were not. Today a Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that following an assessment of the report published by the Standards and Privileges Committee and following liaison with the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police is reopening the investigation.’ Between 2005 and 2008 Mr MacShane submitted 19 invoices from a body called the European Policy Institute (EPI) for work including ‘research and translation work as agreed’ and ‘research and translation consultancy’, the committee report said. But the EPI had ‘no formal structure’. Names given on letterheads for general manager, an acting director and four associate directors were old friends of Mr MacShane. The organisation had no office and there had never been any salaried staff. The bank account was controlled by Mr MacShane himself, the report found. As a result Tory MP Philip Davies wrote to the Met saying that the committee’s findings were ‘astonishing and raise serious questions about whether Mr MacShane is guilty of criminal behaviour’. 2004: A visit to Madrid to inspect how Spain's new Government would impact British politics. 2005: January: Trip to Switzerland to meet MPs. Summer: Trip . to France and the Netherlands     ahead of referendums on EU treaty . followed by a visit to Warsaw ahead of Poland joining the EU. 2006: February: A visit to Poland to report on the country's politics. March: A visit to Berlin. Spring: Two visits to Switzerland to meet diplomats followed by trips to Paris and Pristina. 2007: Spring: A trip to France ahead of Presidential election. May: France again. November: A trip to Berlin, Paris, Frankfurt and Genoble. 2008: December: A trip to Warsaw for EPI meetings. Mr Macshane announced he was quitting as an MP in November after the Standards and Privileges Committee banned him from the Commons for a year. He said at the time: ‘I regret my foolishness in the manner I chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the Prime Minister's personal envoy in Europe.’ The Crown Prosecution Service said it was working on the case with the police. A spokesman said: ‘On consideration of the report published by the Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges, we have looked again at this case. ‘We have continued to liaise with the police in relation to this and have now provided them with further investigative advice.’","Met Police announces it will look again at former Rotherham MP's claims .

Ed Miliband was last night accused of trying to cover up a donation from a controversial banker who has faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood. Sir Victor Blank – the former Lloyds TSB chairman blamed by shareholders for the bank’s humiliating £21 billion taxpayer bailout – gave £10,000 to Labour just days after Mr Miliband made a major speech attacking bankers’ behaviour. Sir Victor paid the money by bidding at a Labour fundraising auction for a set of handwritten team talk notes by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. The £10k donation: Former Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank, left, paid £10,000 for handwritten team talk notes by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, pictured right, at a Labour fundraising auction . The notes, prepared for the 2011 Champions League Final against Barcelona, had been secured by Tony Blair’s former spin chief Alastair Campbell, who is a friend of Sir Alex. Sir Victor did not attend the auction in July but used a proxy bidder to buy the lot for £10,000. The Labour Party recorded the bid in its donations register – but said that it had come from Rothschild bank. Last night a Conservative MP called on the Electoral Commission to investigate whether Labour leader Mr Miliband had attempted to cover up Sir Victor’s donation. Under Electoral Commission rules, all such successful bids have to be included on the public register of donations. Labour declared the donation – from ‘Rothschild Private Banking’ – on July 25, two weeks after Mr Miliband had given a speech in which he attacked the behaviour of financiers and pledged ‘to build banks that serve the people, not just themselves’. Investigation: A Tory MP has called for the Electoral Commission to investigate whether Ed Miliband attempted to 'cover-up the donation' after it was registered as being from 'Rothschild Private Banking' Sir Victor incurred the wrath of Lloyds shareholders when he agreed to Gordon Brown’s request to save the ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) by mounting a takeover in September 2008. The former Prime Minister – who made the suggestion at a drinks reception which has subsequently been dubbed ‘the most expensive cocktail party in history’ – said that competition rules would be relaxed to allow the deal to be rushed through. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Electoral Commission over why the donations was 'misregistered' Disastrously, shares in the newly formed Lloyds Banking Group soon plunged by 90 per cent. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is now investigating the circumstances behind the merger and is expected to report in the spring. Last year, activists representing 800,000 Lloyds shareholders joined MPs in calling for Sir Victor to be stripped of his knighthood if he is censured by the FSA. Their demands came after Fred Goodwin, the former boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland, saw his knighthood forfeited for his role in the bank’s near collapse, a move backed by Mr Miliband. Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he had written to the Electoral Commission to ask why the donation had been misregistered. In his letter, Mr Bridgen says ‘the public will want to be assured that the Labour Party did not purposefully cover up his donation to avoid negative media coverage’. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It beggars belief that Labour – whose failure to regulate the banks helped cause the biggest bust ever – are now taking cash from the man who broke Lloyds, leading to a multi- billion-pound taxpayer-funded bank bailout. By either reckless incompetence or deliberate misrepresentation Labour hid the fact that Sir Victor Blank gave Ed Miliband’s Labour Party thousands of pounds last summer. ‘Which failed banker will Labour be taking money from next – Fred Goodwin?’ A source close to Sir Victor said that the ex-banker had bid for the team talk because he was a keen  collector of sporting memorabilia. ‘Someone bid on his behalf, and the cheque was sent by Rothschild because the bank manages his private trust. That is clearly why the mistake happened.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘This was an administrative error by the Labour Party which we have already corrected with the Electoral Commission,’ adding that it was now recorded as a personal donation by Sir Victor.","Former Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank paid £10k for Man Utd manager Sir Alex Ferguson's team talk notes at Labour fundraising auction .

The Coalition was accused of attempting to 'bury bad news' last night after belatedly publishing a  dossier acknowledging that it has failed to meet dozens of promises. A 119-page audit lists all 400 pledges made when the Government was formed in 2010, and assesses its progress on each. The document was produced as an annexe to the Coalition's 'mid-term review', which was published on Monday, but was not mentioned during a joint appearance by David Cameron and Nick Clegg on Monday. David Cameron was forced to defend the decision to delay publishing the audit of coalition policies at Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Ed Miliband accusing him of 'broken promises' It only came to light when a Downing . Street aide was photographed carrying another paper, marked . 'restricted', discussing whether or not the annexe should be published. It suggested the release of the audit . should be delayed, given that a focus on broken promises risked . overshadowing favourable media coverage. It also warned that the . document might be seen as 'self-congratulatory', given that it claims . the overwhelming majority of commitments – around 90 per cent – have . been met. The document, published hastily . yesterday after its existence was revealed, admits some failures, but . glosses over others and does not divide promises clearly into those . which have and have not been met. It notes that a planned badger cull had been 'postponed', a free vote on repealing the hunting ban has 'not yet been taken forward', accused rapists have not been given anonymity, and, after pledging to cancel a third runway at Heathrow, the Government is now 'looking at all the options'. The document also concedes that the Government has failed to introduce elections to the House of Lords, increase renewable energy targets and create a single financial crime agency, which were all included in the original Coalition deal in 2010. On marriage tax breaks, a flagship Tory commitment, it restates that the Lib Dems, who object to the move, will be allowed to abstain when MPs come to vote on the issue. Labour accused the Coalition of an 'astonishing' omission as the audit failed to mention George Osborne's pledge in his emergency budget of 2010 to ensure that debt is falling as a share of GDP by 2015-16. Instead, it said the Government was 'on course' to deliver a balanced structural budget by the end of a rolling, five-year forecast period.

The programme focuses on the economic clout of China and its commercial interests, in particular lobbying activity by Huawei, a telecoms firm whose UK activities are under investigation by MPs. The company has spent more than £90,000 over two years lobbying MPs and Ministers. Jonathan Prescott, a property developer, has faced scrutiny in the past over links between his business and his father’s political responsibilities.

Expenses: MP Helen Grant is receiving £20,000 a year for a second home in London, despite living inside the capital's commuter belt in Reigate, Surrey . A Government Minister was at the centre of an expenses row last night for receiving £20,000 a year for a second home – despite living in the London commuter belt where MPs are banned from claiming allowances. Equalities Minister Helen Grant lives in a £1.8 million family house in Reigate, Surrey, which Commons authorities say is too close to Westminster to qualify for the controversial second-home allowance. But Mrs Grant is claiming the maximum amount to cover rent on a London flat because her Maidstone constituency, which is more than 40 miles from the family home, is outside the expenses ‘exclusion zone’. The arrangement has raised eyebrows because the Surrey MP in whose constituency she lives – Tory Crispin Blunt – makes the same journey as Mrs Grant into the Commons, but is barred from claiming the second-home perk. Last night Mrs Grant, who was recently reprimanded for altering an employee’s contract to cut his sick pay, said she was ‘fully entitled’ to make the claims. However, the revelations, contained in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary due to be broadcast Monday night, risks tainting the new intake of MPs with the expenses controversy which erupted in 2009. Mrs Grant, 50, who entered Parliament at the 2010 General Election by winning Ann Widdecombe’s old seat, was the first black woman selected to defend a Tory seat. The lawyer, regarded as a fast-rising Conservative star, became a Minister in the September reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of Justice Minister and Women and Equalities Minister. The Channel 4 investigation discovered that Mrs Grant, who draws more than £26,000 a year from the solicitors’ firm she established in addition to her £97,000 pay as MP and Minister, does not have her own home in her Kent constituency. Luxurious: Kingsworthy House, home of Tory MP Helen Grant. It is just 19 miles from Parliament . Plush: The home is worth £1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of Reigate in Surrey .

She has charged taxpayers the maximum £1,666 a month since starting to rent the property in March. Last night, a spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs’ expenses, said Mrs Grant had acted within the rules on second homes. He added that it was ‘up to MPs to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses’. A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said: ‘Mrs Grant’s constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.’ Earlier this month her constituency assistant Tony Williams said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition. Mr Williams’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive. Mrs Grant claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘fairer deal’, but the Commons authorities said his contract should not have been altered.","MP Helen Grant lives in her Surrey home just 19 miles from Parliament .

David Cameron was last night battling to contain his party split over gay marriage after a delegation of senior MPs urged him to reconsider the plans – and two Tories had a ‘toxic’ public argument in the Commons over the issue. The confrontation between fiercely anti-gay marriage MP Sir Gerald Howarth and rising star Gavin Barwell took place in front of shocked colleagues in the Commons Tea Room. One onlooker told The Mail on Sunday that ‘offensive words relating to sexual orientation’ were used – although this aspect of the exchange is denied by the men. 'Frank': Gavin Barwell, left, supports legalising gay marriage while Sir Gerald owarth, right, fiercely opposes the Bill . The row came shortly after the Prime Minister was accused of ‘not listening’ to party anger over plans to legalise same-sex marriage at a meeting with members of the executive of the Tories’ 1922 Committee of backbench MPs. At the meeting on Tuesday, the MPs warned Mr Cameron the party was haemorrhaging support over the issue. Northampton MP Brian Binley told him: ‘The problem is, you are not listening to your core vote.’ Sources at the meeting claimed Mr Cameron replied by saying that ‘nobody will remember this [issue] in 2015’ – when the next General Election is due – and begging the MPs to let him ‘get this out of the way as quickly as we can’. No 10 did not confirm Mr Cameron’s comments last night. More than 100 Tory MPs are expected to rebel when the issue comes to a Commons vote, expected at the end of next month. Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned he risks tearing the Conservative party apart with his plan to legalise gay marriage . Opponents of the measure claim Mr Cameron’s party Whips are using ‘dirty tricks’ in an attempt to avert an embarrassing defeat. One said: ‘Even though it is supposed to be a free vote, there are suggestions the Whips are telling MPs known to support gay marriage that they must be present but allowing those against to stay away if they wish. I’ve been told that there is a parliamentary trip where one pro-MP is being told he must come back, while an opponent is under no such instruction.’ The stormy confrontation between Mr Barwell and Sir Gerald took place earlier this week. One witness said: ‘It was pretty toxic. Howarth was being critical of Barwell’s support for the measure, and Barwell gave as good as he got.’ Last night, Aldershot MP Sir Gerald confirmed that he had a ‘robust’ argument with Mr Barwell. He also acknowledged he was ‘angry’ about the gay marriage Bill, branding it a ‘catastrophe’. However, the former Defence Minister denied using homophobic language. He said: ‘Gavin and I had a discussion. This issue is deeply divisive. It’s pitting friend against friend.’ Croydon MP Mr Barwell, who is an aide to Education Secretary Michael Gove – a key Cabinet supporter of same-sex marriage – said he had a ‘free and frank’ discussion with Sir Gerald. He declined to characterise it as a row or to discuss the terminology used. However, his Tory colleague Alec Shelbrooke said: ‘I’ve heard Gerald had an argument with Gavin in the Tea Room. We have been told it was very nasty.’ Last night, there were claims the Prime Minister had finally realised the depth of anger over the issue. Tory MPs said they had been invited to a meeting with Mr Cameron as soon as the Commons resumes in the New Year that will ‘focus’ on the 2015 General Election campaign.","Supporter Gavin Barwell clashed with anti-gay marriage Sir Gerald Howarth .

Teenagers gathered outside Seventeen magazine's New York office to protest the magazine's fervent use of airbrushing yesterday. 14-year-old Julia Bluhm then hand delivered 25,000 signatures to the magazine's editor-in-chief, protesting its use of Photoshop. During the demonstration, the eighth-grade student and her peers demanded that . editors of the Hearst title 'commit to printing one unaltered - real - . photo spread per month.' Rea teens: Julia Bluhm, 14, stood outside the magazine's Midtown headquarters and led a protest against the industry's fervent use of Photoshop, before hand delivering her petition with 25,000 signatures . Miss Bluhm said during the protest: 'I know much how much pictures in the media have an effect in the self esteem of girls and their body image.' The magazine said it invited Miss Bluhm to its offices after seeing her petition, called Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images Of Real Girls! In a statement yesterday, Seventeen said: 'We're proud of Julia for being so passionate about an issue - it's exactly the kind of attitude we encourage in our readers - so we invited her to our office to meet with editor in chief Ann Shoket this morning.' After talking with reporters at the protest, Miss Bluhm was waved up to the magazine's offices to meet with Ms Shoket. Of . the meeting, Seventeen said: 'They had a great discussion, and we . believe that Julia left understanding that Seventeen celebrates girls . for being their authentic selves, and that's how we present them.

Seventeen responds: Editor-in-chief Ann Shoket (left) tweeted about her discussion with Miss Bluhm (right) after the protest, showing support for the teenagers petition . The teenager uploaded the petition on the campaigning website Change.org, which has now attracted nearly 43,000 signatures - up from yesterday's 25,000 at the time of the protest. Spread through social media, Miss Bluhm's petition gained around 6,000 signatures in ten days. With the help of a press release from a San Francisco PR firm, major news sites and blogs picked up the story and the number quickly grew to over 20,000. 'This is really exciting,' Miss .

Miss Bluhm, who is also a regular . blogger for the 'girl-fueled' activist group Spark Summit, wrote in . her petition that 'those pretty women that we see in magazines are . fake.' She continued: . 'They're often Photoshopped, airbrushed, edited to look thinner and to . appear like they have perfect skin. A girl you see in a magazine . probably looks a lot different in real life.' She also claimed that the constant use of airbrushing by the title has led to low self-esteem levels among her friends. No more airbrushing: The teenager uploaded the petition on the campaigning website Change.org, which has now attracted nearly 43,000 signatures - up from yesterday's 25,000 at the time of the protest . Defending itself: Seventeen magazine said it features real girls and there is no other magazine that highlights such a diversity of size, shape, skin tone and ethnicity . The petition reads: 'Girls want to be accepted, appreciated and liked. And when they don't fit the criteria, some girls like to fix themselves. This can lead to eating disorders, dieting, depression and low self-esteem.' Miss Bluhm, who is also enrolled in ballet classes at her middle school, recalled some of the comments she hears at school, in the petition. They include 'It's a fat day' and 'I ate well today but I still feel fat.' The outspoken teenager also targeted the media, claiming that it 'tells us that pretty girls are impossibly thin with perfect skin.' While such criticism is often voiced and discussed among adults, the words are less commonly heard through children or teenagers. The news comes after Glamour magazine, a competing title, announced that it would take a stricter stand on the representation of women by asking its photographers to refrain from altering images even if requested to do so by the subject.","A petition led by 14-year-old Julia Bluhm has gained 43,000 signatures ."

Vince Cable's wife Rachel wrote an open letter defending Britain's immigration policy and backing her husband's policy of a mansion tax . The wife of Business Secretary Vince . Cable has written an extraordinary open letter defending the UK’s stance . on immigration – and backing her husband’s controversial idea of a . mansion tax. Rachel Cable was responding to  a provocative polemic in last week’s Mail on Sunday by Peter Hitchens, who argued that British society was undergoing an irreversible transformation. Our columnist drew on recently released census data to highlight the decline of the UK’s manufacturing industry, London’s increasing detachment from the rest of the country, the decline of Christianity and marriage and the cultural changes wrought by immigration. Mrs Cable, writing to this newspaper under her maiden name of Rachel Smith, takes issue with Mr Hitchens for speaking of the impact on society of population growth driven by immigration, and the fact that British Muslims have larger families than British Christians. ‘Most of these newcomers are either students or migrants with skills Britain needs,’ she writes. ‘And there are still 12 times more Christians [in the UK] than Muslims.’ But it is in response to our columnist’s claim that London was ‘rapidly becoming a separate nation, as different from England as Scotland or Wales’, partly driven by an influx of rich foreigners, that Mrs Cable broached one of the most divisive policy debates within the Coalition: wealth taxes. Responding to Mr Hitchens’s assertion that the capital now plays host to ‘extremes of wealth and  poverty not known since Edwardian times’, Mrs Cable says: ‘I deplore the widening gap between rich and poor too. One remedy would be to tax them more efficiently. Have you heard of the Mansion Tax? I know a certain politician who advocates it.’ Mr Cable has unsuccessfully tried to persuade his Tory Coalition partners to implement a tax on houses worth more than £2 million. It has been blocked by David Cameron, who fears it would alienate aspirational voters and the party’s rich backers. Vince Cable has advocated a tax on homes worth more than £2million - but it has not been backed by his coalition partners in the Conservative party . Mr Hitchens also noted the ‘accelerating disappearance of marriage’, which he called ‘a  fortress of private life and individuality’. Mrs Cable, the Liberal Democrat’s second wife, countered with her personal experience after her divorce 15 years ago, when she was relieved to discover a thriving community of single people. ‘I remember how surprised and comforted I was to discover this,’ she says. ‘There might be more comfort and joy in marriage. But more private life and individuality? I don’t think so!’ Mrs Cable also recalls a conversation with Mr Hitchens two years ago, during which they discussed their shared memories of Worthing in the Fifties. But while Mrs Cable’s memories of the town where her grandmother lived were unhappy, she said she was left with the impression that Mr Hitchens regarded it as ‘the quintessence of happiness and security’. Addressing Mr Hitchens directly, she writes: ‘Most of us have moved on [from the Worthing of  the Fifties]. Please, please, do so too!’","Rachel Cable responds to provocative column by Peter Hitchens .

George Osborne and Nick Clegg have drawn up secret plans for a £2 billion ‘backdoor mansion tax’ which will clobber prosperous parts of Britain. The Chancellor is ready to give in to Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg’s demands for new council tax bands on homes worth more than £1 million – in return for freezing welfare benefits. But in a damaging Coalition split, David Cameron is resisting the move, fearing he will be accused of another U-turn and of hammering Tory voters in Middle England. The Prime Minister is backed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who is in charge of council tax. He has destroyed computer records of council tax valuations in a ‘scorched earth’ bid to sabotage the plan. Split: Chancellor George Osborne, left, and Nick Clegg, right, back the plan for new council tax bands but face resistance from David Cameron and Eric Pickles . Under the Osborne-Clegg proposals, there would be two or three new council tax bands on homes worth over £1 million. The Liberal Democrats are pushing for one of the bands, applying to properties worth more than £2 million, to target the super rich by acting as a ‘levy’ equivalent to one per cent of the value of their home each year. Such a move would be likely to prove highly controversial because, for example, it would mean that a billionaire such as steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, who owns a super-luxury £250 million house dubbed the Taj Mittal in London’s Kensington, would find his council tax bill rising from the current £2,151.44  a year for the Band H property to £2.5 million. Mr Osborne and Mr Clegg want to unveil the ‘backdoor mansion tax’ and welfare freeze in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on December 5. The Coalition trade-off is designed to show that rich and poor are both being forced to share the pain of clearing the nation’s £126 billion deficit. The two men tried to include a similar tax on expensive properties in the Budget earlier this year, but it was vetoed by a nervous Mr Cameron. No 10 denies the PM has changed his mind about the plan. ‘The Prime Minister is not a fan of property taxes,’ said a well-placed source. But, extraordinarily, other sources claim Mr Clegg and Mr Osborne are conducting their negotiations outside of the formal ‘Quad’, the key decision-making meetings held between Mr Osborne, Mr Cameron, Mr Clegg and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander. This time, with an even more pressing need for Government savings, Mr Clegg and Mr Osborne believe they have a better chance of forcing it through. New bands: Under the Osborne-Clegg plan there would be two or three new council tax bands on homes worth over £1 million . The Tories say a welfare freeze, saving a matching £2 billion a year, is essential to avoid claims that people on benefits are better off than those in work, many of whom have had their pay frozen – or cut. The Lib Dems say they will block the welfare freeze – unless Mr Cameron finally agrees to a form of mansion tax, first put forward by Lib Dem Cabinet heavyweight Vince Cable. Critics of the new council tax bands say the move is inequitable and impractical. It would involve revaluing homes in the current top bands, G and H, but not others. They say this is unfair because the price of homes in the provinces, such as Shropshire or Lincolnshire, has been overtaken by homes in London and the Home Counties, where they have soared since the last council tax revaluation in 1991. Currently, homes are divided into eight tax bands, ranging from Band A (homes worth £40,000 in 1991) to Band H (£320,001 and above in 1991). In London, which would be hit disproportionately hard by the measure, a typical £1 million house is placed in Band G, the second highest, based on its 1991 value of £265,000. The top band, H, starts on average, for houses worth £1.2 million. In the local authority which last year had the highest council tax, Richmond upon Thames, the taxes charged range from £1,062 for Band A properties to £3,188 for Band H. Right-winger Mr Pickles is vehemently opposed to the council tax shake-up. When he took office in 2010, he scrapped the Valuation Office Agency Database, containing house values – which his aides had dubbed the ‘Mansion Tax Database’ – on the grounds of budget cuts. But it was widely interpreted as an attempt to thwart Mr Clegg. He argues that it would be particularly unfair to elderly people on low incomes in big houses and those who have bought homes with hard-earned cash. He also says a revaluation would cost around £260 million, see ‘snoopers’ going into homes to revalue them, and take three years to implement fully, with the first bills going out in April 2015 – a month before the May 2015 General Election. He argues that this would ‘hammer the aspirational vote’ and lead to gross geographical discrimination because of varying regional trends in property prices. Opponents of the move also say that it makes a mockery of vows by Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne NOT to introduce a mansion tax. Target: The type of £1 million-plus home that could be hit by the proposals . Mr Osborne’s allies deny it is a mansion tax, arguing it is ‘an extension of the council tax’. A Tory source said: ‘It is untrue to call this a mansion tax. It will not be popular with some of our supporters but we have always said the well-off will pay more tax. No one could claim we are being unfair on the rich if we manage to freeze welfare benefits. The Coalition is about compromises.’ Mr Clegg sees it as a chance to restore his standing with his party after his U-turn on university  tuition fees. One Lib Dem MP said: ‘A mansion tax would be a legacy Nick could be proud of.’ Mr Osborne told The Mail on Sunday as recently as last month: ‘We are not going to have a mansion tax, or a new tax that is a percentage value of people’s properties. ‘Before the Election they will call it a mansion tax, but people will wake up the day after the Election and discover suddenly their more modest home has been labelled a mansion. We don’t think people who have worked hard, saved up to buy a home, should be clobbered with a mansion tax.’ He dismissed a new council tax band for big houses as a ‘tax snoopers’ charter’, adding: ‘You would have to send inspectors out and it wouldn’t raise much money. I’m not going to let the tax inspectors get their foot in the door.’ The first hint of a U-turn came when Mr Cameron said last month: ‘We are going to take further action to make sure the wealthiest people in our country pay their fair share towards deficit reduction.’ Tory MP David Ruffley told The Mail on Sunday: ‘A freeze in welfare is long overdue but it is wrong for the Lib Dems to use it to demand any kind of mansion tax. David Cameron is right to resist it.’ But fellow MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who runs the Tory Free Enterprise Group, backs the Osborne-Clegg council tax plan. ‘The driving force behind this is that we want to see a benefit freeze,’ he said.","Chancellor George Osborne and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg are backing plans for £2 billion 'backdoor mansion tax'

'Single men in their 40s are single for a reason,' she says . She has been married herself - so knows what it is like to worry your partner might stray. But although divorced Karen Marley, 45, is back on the dating scene, she is determined she will only date men who are already married. The self-confessed serial mistress has had affairs with 50 married men over the past six years - and has no plans to change her habit. 'Married men are better trained,' she said in an interview with the Mirror. 'They have had all their rough edges sanded off by their wives and know how to behave around a lady. And married men are better in bed.' Karen says she has learned that a man who is still single into his 40s is single for a reason: Either he has no social etiquette whatsoever or he’s a player, just looking for his next wrestle. 'A single guy I was on a date with licked his plate in a restaurant,' she says. 'A married man would never do that because his wife would knock his head off his shoulders.' Karen is one of a growing number of women signing up to IllicitEncounters.com, a dating site for married people. Women can join for free but men are charged £134 a month to find a mistress having consciously made a decision to have an affair. Karen justifies her behaviour by saying she doesn't want to steal the husbands away from their wives - she simply wants to 'borrow' them. 'Their wives should be grateful when it’s me their husbands choose,' she says. 'I’m the perfect mistress. I am never going to ask them to leave their wives for me. Most mistresses do, but not me. If I asked him to leave his wife, in every argument from then on he would say: ""Do you know what I gave up for you?"" I don’t ever want to be part of that. 'In fact, when one of my men confessed about me to his wife and told me his marriage was over, I finished our affair. I was horrified. I don’t want to steal someone’s else husband for good, just borrow him for a while. 'I know how to behave as a mistress – and I don’t just mean in bed. I would never ring one of my married men at home at 2am or the weekend because that’s their time with their family. 'I would never throw a hissy fit if they don’t spend Valentine’s, Easter or Christmas with me. We both know exactly what the goalposts are. That’s the beauty of it all.' Karen has been confronted by a couple of angry wives who suspected she was sleeping with their husbands. She insisted that she was merely friends with the men and stopped seeing them immediately. She feels no guilt about her behaviour because she says the men on the site have already made a conscious decision to have an affair before meeting her. 'I am not the reason for their marital problems,' she says. 'Also it costs so much to join, so you get a certain quality of man.' 'When one of my men confessed about me to his wife and told me his marriage was over, I finished our affair' Indeed, despite the current economic slump in the UK, Illicit Encounters have reported that business is booming – with the number of new members up by 27,000 in the last two months. Experts say that that cheating websites are popular because many unhappily married couples simply cannot afford to get divorced in the current economic climate. The stagnant housing market, growing family debt – up 58 per cent to an average of £9,314 per family this year – and the average cost of divorce - £13,000 – are forces behind the wide-spread shift to infidelity. Many new Illicit Encounters members stated on their application forms that they were joining because they were in unhappy marriages that they were unable to get out of in what is now a ‘double-dip’ recession. Illicit Encounters spokesperson Rosie Freeman-Jones said: 'Many couples are now finding themselves trapped in unhappy marriages because they simply cannot afford to divorce. 'It’s not just legal fees. It’s the fact they can’t sell their houses since the market is so stagnant. Worse, some are in a position of negative equity. A surprisingly high number of people who have recently joined have said that they count their marriages as over already and would have already got a divorce by now if they could only afford it. Having an affair is treated almost as a practical, rather than a romantic, decision.' Mistresses like Karen Marley are reaping the benefit from this boom in cheating. Karen insists it is not money she is after. She makes her own living as a writer, and most of her relationships with men on Illicit Encoutners are nothing more than short flings. She says: 'When husbands are on loan to me they almost revert back to being in their 20s because that’s often the last time they dated. We go to the theatre and do all the things married couple no longer do because they’ve already done it. 'I get the good bits of married men. During our time together, it’s the wife who is the other woman.' Karen divorced her husband 11 years ago, but says she is happier flitting from one man to the next rather than finding Mr Right. 'I know married life isn’t for me. But I know that married men have the qualities I am looking for.'","Karen Marley, 45, is divorced - and says she's happier 'flitting around' than settling down .

A man has spoken out on This Morning to tell of his 10 year addiction to Viagra - despite being in his early thirties and never having suffered from serious erection issues. Daniel, who works in the music industry, says he first tried Viagra age 20, when a friend offered him some during a big night out abroad. The group had been drinking heavily, but wanted to take girls back to their hotel room. Fearful of being unable to perform to the best of his abilities, when a friend offered him Viagra, he accepted. Addicted: After first taking it at the age of 20 to enable him to drink heavily and still perform, Daniel found he was relying on Viagra for every encounter . 'My friend said to me, ""I’ve got something - take this."" He . told me what it was and what it would do. We took what we needed to . take and it did exactly what it said on the bottle.' From then on, Daniel says things progressed until he became addicted to the pills - taking them every time he was with a woman - which given his 'eccentric' lifestyle was with unusual frequency. 'I had never really had problems as such,' he says. 'But when you're under the influence, and with the life I lead... a lot of the time you meet women and your mind is on other things - but you meet women who will come back with you and expect something. You need to fulfil that.' ‘I can remember the last time I didn’t have it, but it's always been . around. I feel more comfortable with it around me than if it's not. I’ve . always had it – first started taking when I was abroad – in Amsterdam, . Spain. Whenever we go away we take a stockpile. I used to take a lot . more, but now it depends on the situation and how I feel. If I'm . intoxicated then I’m definitely going to need it.' Daniel says this sort of frequent reliance on Viagra - a crutch for his crotch, as Eamonn Holmes puts it- it very common among his friends, who are also in their twenties and thirties. This Morning's medical expert Doctor Robert Hicks warns that while Viagra is a very safe drug that can help many men and save marriages, taking any medication when it hasn't been prescribed by a doctor and isn't necessary comes with risks and side effects. 'Having difficulty getting an erection is a very common problem when you're tired, stressed, under the influence of alcohol. For a young man with no serious problems, a healthy lifestyle, reducing stress and getting more sleep should provide a solution. Desperate to quit: Dr Robert Hicks says for a young man like Daniel, healthy living, plenty of sleep and stress reduction should cure any bedroom issues . 'That’s what I want to do,' says Daniel. 'Cut everything out – but what comes with my life and the industry I’m in – I have more female friends than male,' he confesses. 'I find it hard to be on my own. And Viagra is always readily available. You can buy it online, or I can call friends. They’re even selling substitutes to Viagra in service stations now.' 'That's where I see the red flag,' says Dr Hicks. When you say that friends are supplying the drug or it is coming from the internet or overseas. 'If you don’t need the medication, the risks outweigh the benefits.' Daniel, who says he has been taking Viagra for 10 to 12 years on a regular basis - and now spends around £1,000 a year on the pills - admits that he experiences unpleasant side effects after taking a tablet - but fears about pleasing his partners prevent him from quitting. 'I'm a great worrier,' he says. 'But now when I take the tablets I can hear my heartbeat and I can feel palpitations,' he says. There's a ringing in my ears too - I'm not sure if it comes from the loud music I'm always around or the Viagra, but it always comes after I take the tablets.' 'Hearing loss is a possible side effect, says Dr Hicks, 'although it is a rare one. The truth is, when used correctly it is a very safe drug. He advises that anyone with erectile problems or concerns about their performance should visit their GP. 'If things haven’t worked on one occasion men can start worrying and develop performance anxiety - but that their first port of call should always be their doctor. Used correctly and when needed, Viagra is a perfectly safe and very useful drug, says Dr Hicks . 'It may mean medication, it may mean psychosexual counselling, it may mean a lifestyle change,' he says. With regards to Daniel, Dr Hicks says that given that everything is in full working order, he should stop taking the tablet. 'His kit works - but he gets a psychological boost from having it on board,' he says. 'Consider not using it - your relationships will be more fulfilling and your health will be protected. 'The Important thing is that we don’t let . people think it’s normal behaviour and put themselves at risk – slim . risk, but still at risk. 'You have to be careful of some of the . herbal alternatives too: some actually have conventional drugs in them – and . that’s why they work.' 'I want to stop it all,' says Daniel. ‘I have had the opportunity to be where I want to be, to settle down. I'm trying to live in a different way, I’m weaning myself off.’ Dr Hicks has the last word: 'Honestly, what really works is leading a healthy lifestyle, have a nice romantic evening, and things are likely to go to plan. If not, don’t be embarrassed, see your doctor. More often than not you can get to the bottom of it.'

IVF treatment early in adulthood dramatically increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer, research suggests. Women who started taking fertility . drugs and went through IVF around their 24th birthday were found to have a 56 per cent . greater chance of developing breast cancer than those . in the same age group who went through treatments without . IVF. But there was no increased risk for . women who started fertility treatments when they were about 40 years . old, regardless of whether they had IVF or not, according to the Australian study . A micro-needle (left) about to inject human sperm into a human egg cell. Estrogen levels are elevated during IVF . The researchers said: 'For younger women there is some cause for concern, because it appears that they may face an increased risk of breast cancer after IVF treatment.' The findings were based on a study of more than 21,000 women and published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Study author Louise Stewart from the . University of Western Australia said younger women might see an . increased risk of breast cancer because they are . exposed to higher levels of circulating estrogen during their cycles of . IVF treatment. In the UK 45,264 women had IVF treatment in 2010. A third of women under 35 successfully had a child as a result . However, she added: 'I don't think it's a huge increased risk that you should worry or panic (about).' The researchers collected information on 21,025 women between the ages of 20 and 40 who went through fertility treatment at the hospitals of Western Australia between 1983 and 2002. They were able to piece together enough data to follow the women for some 16 years to see if they developed breast cancer. Roughly 1.7 per cent of the 13,644 women who only used fertility drugs without IVF ended up developing breast cancer by the end of the study. That figure was about two percent for women who used fertility drugs and underwent IVF - a difference that researchers said wasn't statistically significant. This changed when women were divided into different age groups, with women aged 24 about one-and-a-half times more likely to develop breast cancer if they had IVF alongside other fertility treatments. However, Stewart said they couldn't yet say that IVF was causing the increased cancer risk in younger women, as these women could be different . in some significant way from those who only have other types of . fertility treatment. 'If for example, younger women who . had IVF were more likely to have a specific cause of infertility, and . this was related to an increased risk of breast cancer, then it would . appear that IVF was related to breast cancer when in fact it was the . type of infertility that was more common in women who had IVF,' she . said. Linda Giudice, . president-elect of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, added: 'The development of breast cancer is linked to estrogen exposure and the . longer one is exposed, the greater the risk. 'In an IVF cycle there is a short, . but significant elevation in circulating estrogen, and whether this is . linked to the observations found in the study is not clear at this . time.' The older the patient is the less likely they are to conceive via IVF . The researchers said the study results would reassure women who start IVF treatment in their 30s and 40s. However, they added: 'Women should be aware that delivering their ﬁrst child late in reproductive life, whether assisted by IVF or not, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.' Statistically, younger women have a greater chance of successfully having a baby following IVF. They suggested a follow-up study of women who undergo a greater . range of cycles to see if there's a connection between IVF 'dose' and . breast cancer rate.","Cancer link 'some cause for concern' for younger women trying to conceive .

A mother is facing a desperate wait for a heart to become available for her baby girl who will die without a transplant. Miley Turbitt is at the top of the European transplant list after being diagnosed with the most severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It is a condition rarely seen in babies, which has caused her heart muscle to thicken and prevent it pumping blood around the body. The 12-week-old is currently fighting for survival at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle while mother Sharon Eckert keeps watch by her bedside. Waiting: Sharon with her desperately ill daughter Miley. She hopes every day for a call to say an organ has been found . She is being kept alive with the help of a life-support machine, which carries out the functions that her heart should. If a donor is not found soon, medics at the Freeman fear she will die.Sharon and father Joseph Turbit, are living in hope that they will receive the call from anywhere across the continent to inform them that a donor has been found. Full-time mother Sharon, 38, said: 'We all feel totally helpless. I am here every day and there is nothing I can do to help her and it is worst feeling in the world. 'Every day we are hoping and praying we will get the phone call we want to let us know that a heart has been found for her. This is the only thing that is going to help her now. 'It is really hard for all of us, especially Joseph, as he has had to return to work, but we are all just trying to stay positive for her.' Miley Turbitt was diagnosed with a condition which has caused her heart muscle to thicken and prevent it pumping blood around the body . Mr Turbitt, 52, an electrician, is working away, but phones the hospital every day to check on his daughter’s progress. Doctors first discovered something was wrong when Sharon attended for her 34-week pregnancy scan. When Miley was born at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Hospital, she was transferred straight to the Freeman, where she was monitored for two weeks before being allowed home. Mother-of-three Sharon, of South Shields, South Tyneside, also has five-year-old son, Cole, and 19-year-old daughter Yasmin. She added: 'Because the condition is so rare in babies, no one quite knew what was going to happen. 'But when she was born, she did the opposite of everything doctors thought would happen. 'She was eventually allowed home and she was doing really well. 'But then she was brought back to the hospital a few times, as she was not gaining weight or feeding properly, then things started to get worse. 'I was having to wake her up for feeds and she was sleeping more and more, and she wasn’t looking a healthy colour.' For the past month, Miley has been wired up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine to provide cardiac and respiratory support. Sharon said: 'This time when I brought her in, they decided to keep her in and she underwent an operation to remove some of the muscle from around the heart, but her heart went into failure, and she has been on life support ever since. 'It will be four weeks today she was placed on the machine, and all we can do is sit and wait, and pray a donor will be found in time.' Dr Richard Kirk, a consultant paediatric cardiologist and transplant physician at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital, said: 'This is a condition that is very rare in babies. 'It is so rare, I have only come across a case of this severity once before in my life. 'Miley is being kept alive by an ECMO machine, which has taken over the function of her heart. All we can do now is wait for a donor to come forward. 'But if we do not get one in time, she will not make it.' Miley is at the top of the European transplant list . Dr Kirk told how the hospital receives two to three offers of a heart per year and has sent out the alert across the continent in the bid to save Miley’s life. He added: 'We know when a child dies, it is extremely difficult for parents, and it is even more difficult to ask a parent to then donate their children’s organise. 'But cases like Miley show how vital it is for families to seriously consider organ donation and for people to sign up to the donor register.' Sharon has made a plea for families to sign up to the donor register and help save a life. She said: 'I will be honest, until we have found ourselves in this position, I hadn’t thought too much about organ donation. 'It is such a hard thing to think about for a parent when your child has died, but now we are on the receiving end, we see how important this is. 'It is a really hard situation for us to be in, as we are so desperate for a heart to be found for Miley - but we know for a heart to be found, a baby has died.' Dr Kirk echoed her message saying: 'I would encourage everyone to speak to their families about organ donation, so that everyone knows their wishes.'","Miley suffers from a rare heart condition that stops it pumping blood around the body properly .

After taking tree bark for a decade, 72-year-old Marlene Barnes has no active trace of Crohn's disease in her system . A grandmother claims to have healed herself of a painful bowel condition by eating tree bark. Marlene Barnes, 72, started chewing chippings after 48 years with the bowel condition Crohn’s disease. The inflammatory bowel condition, which affects 60,000 Britons, causes symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue. Now, a decade on, her doctor has confirmed she no longer has an active trace of the illness in her system. Ms Barnes was diagnosed with Crohn’s when she was just 14. 'I’d tried everything to stop it but nothing worked,' said the mother-of-two who had part of her colon removed when she was younger. The inflammation caused by Chron's destroys the tissue of the bowel so badly that surgeons must cut out sections of the intestine. She told The Sun: 'Then I read of bark’s medicinal properties and felt it was worth a go.' She began cutting bark off trees in a park, then dried and ground it up at home. She said: 'I ate hazel bark first and it felt like a dozen ferrets fighting in my stomach. I thought I’d die, but I began to feel better than I’d done in ages. 'I then tried lots of trees to work out which were the real miracle cures. 'It was just trial and error. I nearly poisoned myself so many times but now I feel wonderful.'

A leading concert pianist with a rare form of dementia has been given a cheap plastic keyboard to play on in his care home. Raymond Banning, 60, is suffering from the advanced stages of Pick's disease and his wife desperately wants him to be able to spend his final days at home. The former Professor of Piano at Trinity College of Music in London controls his condition by playing music. Leading musician: Raymond Banning, 60, and his grand piano (rear) in a family photo. He is now in a care home and has been left with a cheap £99 keyboard . He has been forced to play the cheap children's instrument despite complaints from his wife - and having two grand pianos worth £30,000 in his home in Bedford. Lorraine, 48, is pleading for him to be discharged but he will need 24 hour home care because she has a spinal disease and osteoarthritis so is unable to look after him alone. The pianist has performed around the world raising thousands for charity and has taught generations of youngsters how to play. But his world changed in May 2010 when he was diagnosed with Pick's Disease, a rare degenerative condition which is similar to Alzheimer's. He was finally put in Chase House care home in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, last December as his condition got worse. Happy: Mr Banning, a leading pianist, with his wife Lorraine, 48, during a day out. She is fighting to have him brought home . 'Child's toy': The £99 keyboard which has been put in Mr Banning's room in a care home. His wife describes it as an 'insult' His wife, who is also a piano teacher, said he could have just a few weeks left to live and has appointed a solicitor as she fights to have him brought back. She has been fighting the decision to put him into care since last December - and has accused the NHS of using 'delaying tactics' to keep him in care for the last six months. She said: 'Giving him a cheap keyboard is an insult. One of the biggest arguments for him being brought home is his need for music but they came up with this keyboard which I was totally against. Treatment: Mr Banning in his care home. He is suffering from the advanced stages of Pick's disease . 'He has always argued about the best way to make a beautiful sound and would never play a keyboard. 'It is a misunderstanding of who he is. 'I told them my husband does not play keyboards but they did not listen and refused to take it away. He was asked by care home staff if he likes it and he said ""yes"". 'He knows all about keyboard and because of his condition they thought they were asking about music - so he did not understand the question.' Rather than provide him with a more expensive instrument, Mrs Banning wants her husband back home - which she says would be the best possible treatment for him. She has accused NHS Bedfordshire of putting Mr Banning in care because it is cheaper than caring for him in the home - which they deny. The pianist grew up on a council estate and rose to become one of the country's leading performers. He met Lorraine, his second wife, on a piano weekend in Bath in 2006 and they married two years later. Mr Banning does not have any children but has two step-children who he treats as his own. Mrs Banning added: 'His illness is at an advanced stage and he could die at any time. He is in a stable condition but he has suffered fitting and has difficulties swallowing.' 'He has been in a home since December 15 but I want to bring him home so he can be cared for here and he wants to be home. Happy couple: Mr Banning with his new wife Lorraine on their wedding day in 2008. They had met just two years beforehand during a piano weekend in Bath . 'The PCT are refusing to let me bring him back and for the last few months they have come up with reasons why they should delay things. It has been a really difficult time.' Mrs Banning still teaches piano and worked in a childrens' hospice for eight years before she met her husband. The couple have grand piano's made by Schimmel and Kawai in their home. A spokesman for NHS Bedfordshire said a decision on whether the patient should be sent home will be taken by the end of the week. 'NHS Bedfordshire is already providing 24 hour care for Mr Banning. We are now looking at whether we can provide this care at home and are considering the wide range of issues that need to be addressed to achieve this. 'Mrs Banning is aware that we are making our decision this week. This will be based solely on what is considered to be most appropriate to meet Mr Banning’s ongoing healthcare needs, following a very detailed assessment. 'NHS Bedfordshire is responsible for funding Mr Banning’s continuing health care and was not involved in providing him with a keyboard.'

Te'o went to coaches and school officials with his story on December 26. The school commissioned an investigation that it says confirmed Te'o was not involved. Investigators gave their findings to the school on January 4. The university officials said the investigators did not examine cellphone records, emails or other electronic communication to determine the length or extent of Te'o's communication over the past few years with the person claiming to be Lennay Kekua, nor did the university ask Te'o to take a lie detector test. The school informed Te'o's parents about the investigation results on January 5.","Family spokesman says relatives are deciding when and how Ronaiah Tuiasosopo will talk about the prank .

A young amputee hasn't let his disability stop him, learning to tie his shoe laces and play his favourite computer games one handed. Callum Cuthbertson, eight, was born with blood clots in both arms, resulting in his left arm being amputated below the elbow. Then earlier this year he had to wear a cage-like brace, known as an external fixator, on his right arm in a bid to straighten the bone. Nurses have commented on Callum's bravery and positive attitude despite losing an arm . But Callum, from Sunderland, has taken it all in his stride and nurses at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital have been so impressed by Callum, they’ve said they’d like him to show other young amputees what he’s learnt. Proud father Andy, 31, said: 'Now and again it gets Callum down when people stare, but we always tell him it’s because he is so gorgeous. 'He shocked someone once when they asked him what happened to his arm. He simply replied ‘a crocodile bit it off’. 'I tell him all the time that when I grow up I want to be as brave as him.' Medics believe that Callum may have suffered a rare complication at birth, suffering blood clots as a result of mum Jane’s diabetes. Our little hero: Callum with father Andy and the rest of his family who have put him forward for a Child of Courage award . At just 10 weeks old, Callum had life-saving surgery at Sunderland Royal Hospital to remove his arm. Andy, who is also dad to Georgia, 11, Reece, nine and Grace, six, said: 'He is our little hero. His brother and sisters are amazed by him, as is everybody. 'When he had his first operation we thought it was the end of the world, but to look at him now I don’t know what we were worried about. 'When he had his external fixator fitted this year, he was singing before the operation and all the doctors and nurses commented on his character and strength. 'He goes through to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, for his prosthetic and the orthopaedic nurse says she’s amazed by what he can do with his left arm and that if a child was struggling, would we mind introducing them to Callum to show what he has achieved?' In recognition of Callum’s determination his parents have nominated him for a Child of Courage trophy in this year’s Pride of Wearside awards. Andy said: 'We don’t usually put him in the limelight, but we felt like he deserved recognition for everything he’s been through.'","Callum was born with blood clots in both arms .

Laura Bourne, 27, was left a laughing stock when the ride’s safety bar wouldn’t go past her bulging stomach on a family day out. After the embarrassing incident, she made a promise to herself to ditch the junk food - and now she has lost almost 13 stone. Laura Bourne made a promise to herself to ditch the junk food - and now she has lost almost 13 stone after being humiliated at the fairground . Laura, from Birmingham, West Midlands, said: 'My little boy begged me to go on the pirate ship with him so we queued and got on the ride all excited. 'We waited for it to start but there was a problem. The bar made a weird, loud noise and wouldn’t shut past my huge stomach. I had to get off the ride. 'I wanted the world to swallow me up. 'The next morning I went to my GP and asked him to help me lose weight.' Health care assistant Laura has always struggled with her weight but ballooned to a size 26 and nearly 25 stone in August 2010. She said: 'I remember being at school and wearing adults clothes. 'I knew I was bigger but it didn’t really bother me. I was a bubbly person. 'When you’re big, you never think: ""I best not eat that take away."" You just eat it. Laura dropped from size 26 to a trim size 12 after she was too fat to fit on a fairground ride . She once enjoyed gorging on McDonalds and kebabs but has since had to adopt a much stricter diet after weight loss surgery . 'I loved kebabs and McDonalds but a normal size portion wasn’t enough.' Laura has been on and off diets all her life. The most she lost was six stone but the weight crept back on after she gave birth to sons Kai, eight, and two-year-old Zane - plus an extra two stone. Three months after giving birth to her second son Zane, Laura and her partner Craig McIntosh, 29, decided to take Kai to a local theme park as a treat. She said: 'Straight away Kai was going on all the rides. I stood and watched him enjoy himself as I always did. 'I wanted to be join him but as I was a ""big"" girl, I was petrified I wouldn’t fit. Laura has been on and off diets all her life but her weight began to creep back on after giving birth . 'I’d seen someone not fit in a ride when I was a younger and it stuck with me forever. I always said I would never get that big. 'I never thought it would happen to me but it did. 'The guy running the ride kept trying to push the bar down. I had to pretend I wanted to get off. He shouted at me to come back but I knew it was no good. 'Kai was asking what was wrong and he got really upset. When Laura woke up from the operation, the pain hit her but she was happy her new life was beginning . 'It ruined the whole day.' But it was the wake up call Laura needed. She said: 'When my doctor suggested surgery, I was shocked. I didn’t think I was that big. 'I had to step on the scales to see if I qualified and when I did, I almost fainted. 'He said surgery was my only option. I’d tried everything and it hadn’t worked. The yo-yo dieting could affect my health. 'I was 25 and almost 25 stone. I was killing myself and something needed to be done.' Laura was referred to a surgeon who told her she needed a gastric bypass. Before the operation, she had to go on a liquid diet for a month to help shrink her liver - and she shed three and a half stone. Laura said: 'Craig didn’t want me to have the operation. He was worried about the risks but he said he supported my decision. 'I was petrified too. I didn’t want to die and leave my children without a mum but if I carried on going the way I was, I would die anyway. 'When I woke up from the operation, the pain hit me but I was happy my new life was beginning. 'The next few months were hard. I had to get my head around the new eating plan. For the first two weeks, I could only drink fluids. 'Slowly, I started eating food but much smaller portions. 'Eating out wasn’t easy. I had to watch my family tucking into a nice meal while I had soup or a salad but fitting into a smaller dress size felt much better than any food could make me feel.' After four months, she had lost more than five stone. Her partner Craig didn't want her to have to operation because he worried about the risks but supported her decision . Laura regularly works out at the gym and east well, maintaining that surgery isn't the easy way out . Laura, who is now a trim size 12, warns surgery isn’t an easy way out and she has worked hard to maintain her figure. She said: 'Everyday is a battle. I’ve joined a slimming group to take control of what I eat and I go to the gym four times a week. 'I can now enjoy things like other people can. 'I can run around the park with my children, fit in a plane seat without an extension belt, sit on a garden chair without the fear of it breaking and walk up the stairs without getting out of breath. 'I took my sons back to that theme park recently and back to the pirate ship where all this began. 'I felt like I was going to have a heart attack as I sat in the seat. What if I didn’t fit in? 'When the bar came down, I closed my eyes. It was the best feeling ever. I cried, laughed then cried some more.

A British father has received a life-saving kidney from his cousin in America - after he wrote about his plight on Facebook. John Williamson, 42, from Michigan, and Andy Williamson, 44, are now recovering in hospital after undergoing the major transplant surgery. Andy had been documenting his struggle with polycystic kidney disease on Facebook and used an app to update his status and treatments. John Williamson (left) from Michigan, USA, has donated a kidney to his cousin Andy Williamson after hearing about his plight on Facebook . John - who had only met his first cousin twice before - spotted Andy was using the app to regularly check-in to hospital and realised he was on dialysis. John, who works in advertising, got in touch and offered his organ for the transplant. The cousins then met for the first time in 33 years when john flew over in June to see if he was a suitable match for the operation. Thankfully he was, and the three-hour transplant op has now gone ahead at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Speaking today, Andy, of Ashburton, Devon, said: 'We didn’t actually know each other that well, having grown up on different sides of the Atlantic, but we became friends on Facebook a couple of years ago. 'John saw that I was in need of a new kidney, and offered to be a living donor. The operation took place at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, after John travelled to the UK . The operation is said to have gone well and the donated kidney has been transferred successfully . 'It’s one of those things where it’s difficult to find the words. It’s a mixture of gratitude and just thankfulness that he’s come forward to help. 'I know from my previous transplant the difference it makes to me having a healthy working kidney. It’s just indescribable.' John said he had been moved to help after seeing pictures of Andy with his three-year-old daughter Doro. Speaking from his hospital bed, he said: 'As expected I’m a little sore, but in good spirits, I’m glad I did it. 'Andy looks great, he has some recovery to do but he’ll be in tip top shape before long. I’m confident I will recover properly. Andy said: 'I am increasingly realising that an organ donation has a much wider impact than just for the recipient. It's also about the lives of their families and the people around them. It really is a tremendous gift.' 'I feel it has been very worthwhile and the benefits far outweigh the risks. It was something I felt I wanted to do because he’s family. 'In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. I have two young daughters, and I know what energy it takes to look after them. 'I wanted to be able to help Andy get a new lease of life, not just for himself, but for his family, and his daughter in particular. 'By monitoring Andy’s situation - seeing his updates and seeing him check into certain health clinics during his dialysis I felt a connection between the two. 'It was just a feeling in me that told me it was something I should do.' Andy, a musician, was forced to have dialysis every day after a donated kidney failed in 2011. His condition is a hereditary disease which his mother, who also went on dialysis, also suffered from. He was diagnosed at 21 but only started showing symptoms in his 30s and finally went on dialysis at 38. Father-of-one Andy started using phone app ‘Four Square’ on his iPhone in December which allows users to check-in to visited places. Andy said he was playing around with the app while at hospital one day which alerted his Facebook friends, including his cousin John, that he was on dialysis again. Family matters: American cousin John is 3rd from left (in yellow) while Andy is on his right. Andy's dad Ron is standing with baby on back, while John's day is standing far right . Dr Najib Kadi, who completed the keyhole surgery, known as nephrectomy, described it as 'complex'. He said: 'This is a complex surgery, you need to handle the kidney very carefully because it is being used for transplantation. 'The donors are very precious, like any other patient, but particularly because they are people who are putting themselves through surgery to make someone else better.' John’s dad, also called John, was brother of Andy’s father Ron and were two of four brothers who grew up in Glasgow, Scotland. During the early 1960s, John got married to Marie who said a condition of their marriage was to move abroad to get away from her mother. Family tree: The Williamson brothers, (L-R) John (American John's father) James, Bill and Ron (Andy's father) grew up in Glasgow . John and Marie moved to Canada where Andy’s cousin, John, who was one of four children, was born in 1970. The cousins first met when Andy, then aged 11, and his family went to stay in Canada with John, then aged nine, and his family in 1979. John later moved to America with his family in 1981 where he has stayed ever since. The pair did not have any contact for more than 20 years until 2003, when they met at Andy’s uncle and John’s father’s second wedding - but the pair only spoke briefly. Around two years ago they befriended each other on Facebook and used the social networking site to send messages and view each other’s photographs. Andy, married to Suzy, 42, said: 'I am increasingly realising that an organ donation has a much wider impact than just for the recipient. 'it’s also about the lives of their families and the people around them. It really is a tremendous gift.'I guess blood is thicker than water but I know he’s also done it because of my daughter.' Transplant surgeon Andrew Weale said: “It’s pretty amazing that, at the start of the process, this kidney was in another person. 'It’s been removed and has been on ice for an hour and a half and now we’re putting it into his cousin. 'The kidney has gone a lovely pink colour, and it’s producing urine already, it’s wonderful.'","Andy Williamson, 44, was forced to have dialysis every day after developing polycystic kidney disease .

When Charlotte Reeves was diagnosed with breast cancer, she was determined to have whatever treatment she needed to get better. The mother of two had been shocked to be diagnosed at just 39 and feared she would never see her young children grow up. ‘My first thoughts were initially to panic - I was frightened I was going to die,’ said Mrs Reeves, 40, who lives in Lincolnshire with her husband Gary, 48. ‘Once the whirlwind of the diagnosis was over I realised I’d probably need chemotherapy,’ Mrs Reeves, a paediatric nurse, told MailOnline. ‘It sounds silly but one of the aspects of chemotherapy I dreaded the most was losing my hair. Charlotte Reeves wore a revolutionary cap during chemotherapy to preserve her hair . 'To me, losing your hair is an obvious sign that you are having cancer treatment and I also didn’t want to scare the children with my appearance.' But her hair was saved after doctors at the Bupa Cromwell hospital offered her a special cap to wear during chemotherapy which allows 80 per cent of patients to retain their hair during treatment. Hair follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like cancer tumours, they are made up of rapidly growing cells. This is why chemotherapy can lead to hair loss. The Dignicap, as it is known, lowers the temperature of the scalp, so the blood vessels become smaller and less blood flows through them. This means less of the chemotherapy drugs can reach the hair follicle and the hair is not fully exposed to the effect of the drugs. The Dignicap lowers the temperature of the scalp, so the blood vessels become smaller and less blood flows through them . The treatment, which is also available . at the Spire Montefiore Hospital in East Sussex, has been shown in . clinical trials to help eight out of ten women in Europe and Asia retain . their hair during chemotherapy. Mrs Reeves had been diagnosed in June 2011 after noticing a lump near her nipple. She had a grade three invasive tumour – a fast growing type of cancer and  more common in younger women who have the disease. This means less of the chemotherapy drugs can reach the hair follicle and the hair is not fully exposed to the effect of the drugs . ‘After surgery to remove  the lump, my oncologist explained that my chances of survival increased from 90 per cent to 99 per cent if I had chemotherapy as well as surgery,' she said. ‘For Gary and I it was a no brainer – we wanted to do everything we could to maximise my chances of survival. 'For me, chemotherapy was a small price to pay for a higher chance of survival. It would be a long haul, though – five months of chemotherapy, followed by another four weeks of radiotherapy. ‘I can’t deny the cap was uncomfortable to wear; it looked like a water polo cap and contained a gel pack which gradually got colder and colder the longer it was on my head. ‘I would have to have it applied 45 minutes before chemotherapy started and it felt extremely cold as it I was having very cold water applied to my head. It would trigger a typical “ice cream headache” and made me feel a little sick  I had to wear it all through the treatment session and for 20 minutes afterwards – so for about three hours each time.’ The cap was so successful that Mrs Reeves hardly lost any of her hair. Her eyelashes and eyebrows also lasted until the second half of her chemotherapy cycle. ‘My hairdresser couldn’t believe it and my friends kept saying how well I looked,’ she said. ‘ Keeping my hair is a small thing I know – but it enabled me stay positive during treatment and feel normal. She has since had scans showing no evidence of the disease and underwent reconstructive surgery in September. She added: ‘I do feel the Dignicap really helped me psychologically, as it meant I didn’t look physically unwell and that was comforting for the children, too.’","Charotte Reeves, 40, was diagnosed with breast cancer last year .

Liquor baron-turned-business tycoon Gurdeep Singh Chadha, popularly known as Ponty Chadha, was shot dead by his brother yesterday in an bitter property dispute that also ended with the death of the brother and a security guard. Ponty's younger brother, Hardeep Singh Chadha, was killed in retaliatory firing by a security guard accompanying the elder brother. The dispute between the brothers started when their father, Kulwant Singh Chadha, died last year without dividing the property among his three sons - Gurdeep, Hardeep and Rajinder. Tragedy: A body of one of the brothers at the AIIMS mortuary . The wife of Hardeep Singh Chadha is consoled by relatives after hearing news of the killings . The dispute ended in a bloodbath with security guards of both brothers exchanging 40 rounds in the grounds of the Chadha farmhouse at Chhatarpur in New Delhi . According to sources, Ponty had approached the Delhi Police a few days ago requesting security cover as he anticipated a threat to his life from Hardeep. The shootout took place between 11.45 am and 12.30 pm at Chadha's DLF farmhouse-42 in Chhatarpur, where armed men from both the sides fired around 40 rounds at each other. By the time the police reached the spot, Ponty had already been shifted to Fortis hospital in Vasant Kunj, where he succumbed to his injuries, while Hardeep, also known as Satnam, was lying in a pool of blood on the floor. Narender Kumar, a security guard with Ponty, was also injured in the firing and later succumbed to his injuries in a hospital in Gurgaon. In the morning, Ponty along with his security personnel allegedly barged into the farmhouse and locked up all the rooms on the premises. The ownership of the farmhouse - a sprawling 7-acre property - was a bone of contention among the three brothers. Liquor Baron and owner of Wave Infratech, Gurdeep Singh Chadha at his farmhouse . They were supposed to meet and amicably settle the dispute over all their properties at the farmhouse on Saturday. The staff at the farmhouse informed Hardeep, who was at the nearby Chadha property – 21 Oak Drive - about the arrival of Ponty along with his guards. He immediately reached the farmhouse along with his security guards and entered into an argument with Ponty. The argument turned ugly when, according to eyewitnesses, Ponty pushed Hardeep, who took out his pistol and pumped bullets into his elder brother's chest. This triggered a retaliatory fire from Sachin Tyagi, a police security officer accompanying Ponty. Constable Tyagi fired three bullets of which one hit Hardeep who was being escorted by Punjab police personnel. Hardeep tried to escape from the back gate but collapsed inside the house. Constable Tyagi somehow managed to drag injured Ponty out of the house, put him into a Land Cruiser and drive to Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj. Ponty's body was later shifted to AIIMS mortuary. Hardeep's body was also taken to AIIMS for postmortem and other legal formalities. Hardeep's lawyer Gaurang Kanth said he received a call from him around 12.20 pm, telling him that he anticipated ""loss of control of all the properties"" as he was about to meet his brother to settle the dispute. Hardeep asked Kanth to take legal ""proactive"" measures to secure his properties and business interests. Connected: Ponty Chadha picutred here right, with politician Amar Singh and his aides . Family business: Ponty pictured at with his son Monty Chadha at their family home . Kanth described the killings as 'unanticipated' and 'shocking'. He said that a 'reasonable settlement' was being worked out for the past six to seven months and a breakthrough was expected soon. According to Kanth, Hardeep wanted to settle the dispute, collect his share and start his own venture. Ponty Chadha hit the headlines earlier this year when the I-T department conducted raids at 13 of his properties in Delhi - Sainik Farms, Lajpat Nagar, New Friends Colony - and six locations in Noida, Moradabad and Lucknow. The raids, however, proved to be a damp squib as Chadha with his political influence in Uttar Pradesh managed to get information beforehand. Sources claimed that Chadha had emptied the vault raided by the I-T officials and left a silver coin there to show off his connections with politicians and senior bureaucrats of the state. ""We have registered a case and are investigating the matter,"" said Vivek Gogia, special commissioner, southern range. He was known as the man who knew how to handle politicians. Ponty Chadha did not just hobnob with political heavyweights in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, but was so deft at connecting with power that even if the state governments changed, he could turn the tide in his favour. It was this ability to pull the right strings in the political circle that helped him become a business tycoon in a short span of time. During Amarinder Singh's rule in Punjab about eight years ago, Chadha managed to gain control of the lucrative liquor business through ""stage-managed"" auctions. After the political scene changed in the state, his real estate business suffered hurdles - but not for long. With his sharp business acumen, Chadha expanded his liquor business in not just Punjab, but also Rajasthan, Delhi, UP, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. The liquor baron's political links became clear during the wedding of his daughter in February this year. Politicians cutting across party lines attended the function. Punjab's deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, former CM Amarinder and former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala attended the event. So did Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav, former BSP MP Akbar Ahmad and Delhi's education and tourism minister Arvinder Singh Lovely. According to sources,Chadha enjoyed close links with BSP chief Mayawati and started ruling the liquor trade in the state ever since she came to power in UP. SP spokesman Rajendra Chowdhry alleged: ""Chadha benefited the most under Mayawati's rule. Her policy (of awarding liquor licences) was tailormade for him."" In 2010, Chadha bagged five of 11 sick sugar mills sold by the UP government. ""He got the mills for Rs 276 crore, when their market price was Rs 1,000-1,500 crore,"" alleged Rita Bahuguna Joshi of the Congress. It was, however, under Mayawati's predecessor SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav's rule that Chadha's business had taken a big leap. Mulayam had inaugurated his Wave mall-cummultiplex in Lucknow and given Chadha several concessions in the project. The liquor baron was written off by people when Mayawati lost the CM's chair in March this year. But then he appeared at the swearing-in ceremony of current UP CM Akhilesh Yadav the same month. In Uttarakhand, Chadha's links with state leaders came to light in 2010, when he grabbed over half-adozen hydropower projects. Chadha's Chandigarh-based companies bagged the projects despite state government guidelines saying local firms had to be given preference. The allotments were later cancelled after two PILs were filed in the Nainital High Court. Chadha is also alleged to have operated liquor shops in the state.","Eyewitnesses say Ponty pushed brother Hardeep Singh Chadha, who then took out his pistol and pumped bullets into his brother's chest .

The Nursing and Midwifery Council, which regulates the UK's 670,000 nurses and midwives, has proposed increasing the annual registration fee from £76 to £120 . Nurses are facing a 60 per cent hike in the professional fees they must pay in order to work. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which regulates the UK's 670,000 nurses and midwives, has proposed increasing the annual fee from £76 to £120. The regulator faces a significant hole in its finances, something it has blamed on the ‘unprecedented increase’ in the number of nurses and midwives whose conduct has had to be investigated over the past few years. But unions have condemned the move, saying it is ‘inappropriate' to increase fees while NHS workers are in the midst of a pay freeze. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘Nurses across the UK are hugely concerned about the proposed hike in NMC fees at a time when many are struggling financially. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, added:  ‘We have argued that the cost of filling this hole should not fall on our cash-strapped members.’ Today the Government pledged a one-off £20 million grant to prevent nurses and midwives being forced to fork out an extra £44 each just so they can work. A spokeswoman said the money would ‘protect nurses and midwives from the full impact of a proposed registration fee rise of almost 60 per cent’. However it’s thought there will still be some hike in registration fees even if this goes ahead. That’s because the proposed fee rise would raise an additional £29m for the NMC. Even with £20m from the government, it is likely the regulator would still want some level of fee increase to balance the books. Nursing Times understands the Department of Health hopes its intervention could see the fee rise lowed to around £100. The Government has pledged a one-off £20 million grant to reduce the fee hike, but some increase is still expected, possibly to around £100 . Health Minister Dan Poulter said the grant would be used to ‘improve the NMC's performance’ and help the body tackle the backlog of complaints against nurses. He said: ‘Following a period when we have heard of so many terrible abuses in the care of older people and vulnerable patients, it is important that organisations like the NMC are in the right shape to properly perform their job of protecting patients. ‘I am also mindful that, in these times of pay restraint, it is not right that hard-working nurses and midwives are burdened with the full financial cost of improving the NMC's fitness to practise function.’ The NMC Council can now decide whether or not to accept the grant. This will be determined at its next council meeting on 25 October, when a final decision on whether to go ahead with the fee rise is also expected to be taken. An NMC spokeswoman said: ‘Patients must be able to have confidence in the quality of care they receive from nurses and midwives, and we share the Government's commitment to improve nursing and midwifery regulation. ‘We welcome the Government's offer of a grant to give us further options to contribute to the costs of regulating nurses and midwives.’","The nursing regulator wants to increase professional fees from £76 to £120 .

Last week he started Aurora Kinase treatment, a drug which is administered over 72 hours every 21 days via intravenous infusion. The drug is intended to inhibit cancer growth by blocking the enzymes which cause cancer cells to grow. If the treatment is successful, it could pave the way for Charlie to undergo radiotherapy treatment in the future.

'The hope is that in the end we will be able to get rid of the cancerous cells. I don't want to say it will be a cure, because I want to take every day as it comes.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 09:33 EST, 14 November 2011 . Dominique Strauss-Kahn's long-suffering wife appears to have run out of patience with her husband after another sex claim was made against him. Anne Sinclair, 63, reportedly told friends she has decided to leave the former IMF chief following a catalogue of sex scandals in recent months. The shamed French economist was sacked as boss of the fund after accusations he tried to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May. Power couple: Mr Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair, who has it is reported has finally left him . He returned to France after the charges were dropped, and then escaped more accusations of trying to rape a young writer in Paris eight years ago. Police are now probing his alleged connection to an underage prostitution racket at hotels in Lille, northern France. During the investigation, it has been claimed that a corrupt French police officer regularly flew £500-a-night prostitutes to the U.S. for Strauss-Kahn. It is also claimed he took a prostitute to his office at the International Monetary Fund headquarters in Washington and had sex with the Belgian hooker named Jade at a hotel in the U.S. capital. He is then said to have invited the 29-year-old call girl to his managing director's office at the institution where he managed the stability of the world's finances. Until now, Mrs Sinclair has stood by her man in the face of the damaging series of allegations. Recorded: Prostitute Beatrice Legrain allegedly has been linked to Dominique Strauss-Kahn after phone calls between the two were allegedly recorded . Investigation: The Carlton Hotel in Lille, where staff members have been arrested over an investigation into an alleged prostitution ring . Catalogue of claims: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn listens to proceedings in a case against in New York in June . But reports in France suggest Mrs Sinclair has now decided to leave him. Quoting unnamed 'friends', Le Figaro said she was demanding he pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars she spent on his defence in New York. The newspaper said Mrs Sinclair, 63, was tired of the endless 'pathetic' disclosures about the man once tipped as the next President. Friends said Strauss-Kahn has plunged into a spiral of depression over the tide of allegations against him. One told the Journal du Dimanche: 'Now he sits alone at home, biting his fingernails until they bleed.' And another told French daily le Figaro: 'He is a shadow of his former self. In the last few days he has said that he needs to seek treatment. He admitted he was ill.' Allegations: French journalist and writer Tristane Banon accused Strauss-Kahn of a sex attack . French daily Liberation last week published text messages allegedly sent in 2009 between Strauss-Kahn and businessman Fabrice Paszkowski, who is also linked to the vice network. One message sent by Strauss-Kahn to Paszkowski is said to read: 'I'm taking a little thing to the clubs in Vienna on Thursday, May 14. Does that mean you'll be bringing a girl?' Another asked: 'Can you come to a great swingers' club in Madrid with me (and a bit of stuff)?' And a third one apparently discussed plans for a sex party in the Belgian town of Ghent, know as Gand in French. It read: 'OK. Understood. For Gand, you have to tell me what's going on. Is it a club or a private party?' A senior French legal source later said Strauss-Kahn's texts could be viewed by police as encouraging the vice ring bosses to supply girls for sex. The source warned: 'This repeated demand for prostitutes could constitute the encouragement of pimping. 'DSK may then not be interviewed by police as a witness but he risks in the worst case scenario being being held in custody.' Detectives have so far said there is no suggestion Strauss-Kahn had sex with underage girls or committed any offence by sleeping with prostitutes - which is legal in France if the girls are over 18. Mr Strauss-Kahn has branded the claims he had orgies as 'dangerous and malicious insinuations' and insisted he will be able to clear his name.'","She spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on his defence .

When the set of photos apparently showing a naked Prince Harry cavorting in his hotel suite surfaced last night, the initial reaction for many was one of disbelief. Firstly, we thought, wasn't it unlikely that a member of the Royal Family should strip naked in front of camera-wielding strangers? Even if that member of the Royal Family is the notorious good-time guy, Harry? Secondly, we couldn't help but recall those 'stolen' photos taken by photographer Alison Jackson, famous for mocking up unseemly situations using Royal lookalikes. In naked photographs of Prince Harry that surfaced yesterday the young royal wore a distinctive silver pendant that he had worn on numerous occasions before - and is said to have been a love token from Chelsy Davy . Indeed, following the Royal wedding, Jackson staged some fake photographs of a cheeky Prince Harry pinching the bottom of a very realistic Pippa Middleton lookalike. Could these be some well-timed works from Jackson? But on closer examination, we realised - thanks to a very distinctive piece of jewellery - that we were indeed looking at photographs of the third in line to the throne in the altogether. The jewellery in question is a silver pendant with a small amber-coloured stone in the middle, and it was reportedly given to the young royal by his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in the early days of their five year relationship. Harry has been wearing the necklace on and off ever since - the leather thong is frequently seen peeping above the neckline of his shirt - but according to recent reports, the fact that he has returned to wearing it religiously shows the depth of his affection for Chelsy. For her part, Chelsy is said to reciprocate by wearing a blue topaz ring that was a gift from Harry. Love . token: Chelsy Davy, pictured here with Prince Harry in 2007, is said to . have given Prince Harry the necklace when they first started dating . Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas? Quite what Chelsy would have made of the circumstances in which the love token (if it is indeed such a thing) found itself is another matter - but given the length of time that the relationship has lasted, one can assume she is fairly accepting of his carousing ways. The 27-year-old prince's on-off relationship with Chelsy, 26, has spanned seven years in total, and the two are still close. Chelsy joined Prince Harry as recently as 2 May for Princess Eugenie's birthday party at Windsor Castle, and it was reported at the time that the two were in the process of rekindling their romance. The couple split when Chelsy decided that following a Royal lifestyle was not for her - but with Harry wearing the love token so publicly, could yet another rekindled romance be on the cards?

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:01 EST, 27 January 2012 . Withdrawn: Chris Langham was due to appear at a question and answer session at Tonbridge School . Disgraced actor Chris Langham has cancelled an appearance at a top public school after parent fury about his child porn conviction. The sex offender, 62, was expected to host a question and answer session after his new comedy Black Pond was screened. But after a concerned parent contacted the school the actor pulled out of the event at the £31,000-per-year Tonbridge School in Kent. The evening - listed in promotional material sent out last week - was being organised by the parents' arts society at the school's theatre. Married father-of-five Langham was jailed for three months in 2007 for downloading images of child abuse. He downloaded the graphic footage on four separate occasions. Some of the videos were rated at level five - depicting the very worst child abuse. The footage was so repulsive that during his trial a juror was physically ill after viewing it. The Bafta-winning star of BBC sitcom The Thick of It claimed he downloaded 15 images of child abuse as he 'researched' one of his roles. He was originally jailed for ten months but on appeal his legal team successfully argued that his sentence had been 'very tough' and he was released after . serving three months in Elmley Prison in Kent. The actor lives with his wife Christine Cartwright in Cranbrook, Kent, close to the respected school. He is on the sex offenders' register for at least another two years. After being released from hail, he said: 'My life has been ruined but my conscience is clear.' Before his conviction Langham, who also starred in Kiss Me Kate and was a founding . member of the Not The Nine O’Clock News team, was lauded as one of the leading comic actor/writers of his era. A spokeswoman for the school said that the shamed actor had withdrawn and the event on March 16 which will instead feature the film's two directors Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley instead. She said: 'Chris Langham has let us know that he is now not able to attend.' They denied there would have been any risk to children if the actor had attended the parents-only event. 'Tonbridge School have been working with the Multi Agency Public Protection Team in Kent,' she said. 'The assessment in 2007 was there should be no restrictions placed on Mr Langham with regard to unsupervised access to children under the age of 16 and that he is no risk / low risk to children.' She said the school had received only one complaint about the event. Tonbridge School, which charges fees higher than Eton, has 800 boys aged 13 to 18 and is set in 150 acres of Kent countryside and was founded in 1553. They list Sir Peter Tapsell, who is currently the longest-serving MP, historian Dr Anthony Seldon, ITV director Peter Fincham and novelist Frederick Forsyth among their alumni. Black Pond, which also stars comedian Simon Amstell, provided Langham with his first acting job since his release from prison. The actor plays the patriarch of a family who is falsely accused of murder in the dark comedy. The cast have toured the country to promote the film with talks and other actors have appeared in schools. Parents' fury: Langham pulled out of the event at the £31,000-per-year Tonbridge School, Kent, after a complaint was received, a spokeswoman confirmed . The comedian and actor has . made several public apologies for downloading illegal images - and has said he wants to get back to work. Derek Green, director of leading child protection agency Ray Wyre Associates, said it was a 'daft' decision to invite a convicted sex offender into a school. 'It does seem a bizarre choice of entertainment to invite Chris Langham into the school,' he said. 'It's not likely anything untoward is going to happen and the school would put the appropriate safeguards in place but it is inappropriate. He is a man who is still trying to justify his behaviour in viewing child pornography. 'There are so many other people who could appear at an event like this that doesn't involve bringing a convicted sex offender into the school. 'It is good news in one sense that parents have complained but one would have to question what on earth someone was thinking when they decided to invite Chris Langham in the first place.' In an article for The Independent in . October, the film's directors Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley defended . their decision to cast Mr Langham. They wrote: 'Chris was in fact . someone who had made a mistake, who had paid the price and who should be . allowed to move on.' Other speakers who have appeared at Tonbridge School for parents' events include John Simpson, Lord Hurd and Ian Hislop.","Child protection agency say school's decision to invite Langham into the school is 'bizarre' and 'inappropriate'

In cash-strapped times, fashion conscious women must resort to ever more creative measures in order to continue looking their best. And these days a favourite trick is painting the soles of high-street shoes red in order to make them resemble those by celebrity designer Christian Louboutin. Paint it red: All of the shoes sold by French shoe designer Christian Louboutin have the bright scarlet shade of Pantone-18 Chinese Red painted on their soles . The French shoemaker, whose signature is the bright Pantone-18 Chinese Red paint emblazoned on the sole of his every creation, is a favourite among . celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Misha Barton, Blake Lively and . Coleen Rooney. The designer originally added the red sole at the last minute during a fashion show when he decided his shoes needed more 'energy', and painted them with an assistant's nail varnish. But instead of forking out an average of £600 per pair, money-conscious consumers are now buying cheap shoes and tester pots of bright red paint. Homewares company Homebase have reported that sales of Home of Colour tester pots of shocking red colours Flame . and Show Stopper have shot up by 40 per cent year-on-year this week, as . savvy customers have been looking to recreate their own Louboutins at a snip . of the price of the iconic, red-soled designer shoes. Celebrity favourite: Stars including Victoria Beckham, left, and Misha Barton, right, are devoted to Christian Louboutin's scarlet red soles . Claire Stevenson, 24, a PA from Croydon, . wanted her dream pair of Louboutins to wear to her cousin's wedding so confessed to using the DIY trick. She said: 'There was no way I could afford to buy a pair of Louboutin . heels, but I had my heart set on them and felt the pressure to be . fashionable at the occasion. 'I bought a £20 pair of plain black shoes and a tester pot and recreated the designer look at home. I carefully painted the soles, let them dry overnight, and by the next day they were ready to wear. 'I received so many compliments at the wedding about my gorgeous shoes . but I didn't have the heart to confess they were DIY fakes. 'It was such a success I plan on doing the same for another pair of heels.' Scarlet lady: Blake Lively, star of Gossip Girl, is a staunch supporter of Louboutin's heels . Homebase store manager Peter Rooney at London's Acton . branch said: 'While many people tend to look at magazines to get the . right paint colour for walls, we have recently noticed a significant . number of girls in the store colour-matching the tester pots to pictures . of designer shoes in fashion magazines and requesting tips on how to . paint on leather or rubber.' And if you're looking to get that DIY . fashion look, Homebase has provided some handy top tips to get you . started - Richard Johnson, senior paint buyer at Homebase has provided . his advice for achieving the Louboutin look at home. He said: '“Clearly paint is meant for decorating walls rather than shoes, so we are amazed at this new trend that has hit our stores. The tester pots would have enough paint to cover the sole of an average sized shoe, but we would advise people to ensure they do apply it properly so it can achieve a really good visual effect."".' Fancy footwear: Christian Louboutin's shoes sell for an average of £600 per pair . Louboutin is very fond of his red-soled trademark and sued Spanish . brand Zara in 2008, claiming that an open- toed red-soled shoe the shop was . selling for £40 was similar to his Yo Yo style. But a French court ruled Zara’s cut-price shoe could not be . confused with that made by the high-end designer, and last month the Cour . de Cassation – the final court of appeal – upheld the decision. Last year Louboutin accused designer Yves Saint Laurent of copying . his celebrated red-soled footwear when he used a similar theme in his . 2011 resort collection. That lawsuit resulted in a high-court appeal case in the US, the verdict of which is yet to be decided. 1.

Just one year ago she was playing the lame boy in her school's production of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now 10-year-old Isabelle Allen from Eastbourne, East Sussex, is being tipped for Hollywood stardom after starring alongside Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Helena Bonham Carter, Hugh Jackman and Sacha Baron Cohen in an upcoming adaptation of the musical Les Miserables. And Isabelle, who was talent spotted during the school play, has even been chosen as the poster girl for the film, which is expected to be a front-runner for best screenplay at the 2013 Oscars. Scroll down for video . At home: Isalbelle Allen, 10, is the star of the new Hollywood adaptation of musical Les Miserables . Isabelle plays the younger version of Amanda Seyfried's character, Cosette, the illegitimate daughter of Anna Hathatway's character - factory worker-turned-prostitute Fantine. The schoolgirl was spotted in the Moira House School production of The Pied Piper of Hamelin by Jeremy Taylor from the National Youth Music Theatre. Mr Taylor was so impressed with her turn as the lame boy that he persuaded talent agents to let her audition for director Tom Hooper's film version of the world's longest running musical. Parents Elaine and Nigel Allen thought Isabelle might be an extra in the film, but instead she was recommended for the part of Cosette, one of the story's central characters, who is cruelly beaten and abused. Co-stars: Isabelle Allen, 10, on set with actress Anne Hathaway, who plays her mother Fantine, a factory worker who resorts to prostitution . Despite having no professional acting experience, Isabelle ended up beating thousands of children to win the coveted role. She . said: 'When I found out I’d been picked I was so excited. I was jumping . up and down on my bed. But I was also a little scared and nervous, . because I didn’t know what to expect.' Isabelle was quickly expected to stay up shooting scenes as late as 6am, but says that as soon as she got on set the experienced actors quickly went out of their way to make her feel at ease and comfortable. Best pals: Isabelle Allen on set with Hugh Jackman, who plays her father in the new version of Les Miserables . She said Academy Award-winner Russell Crowe was 'friendly' but also 'focused' and 'serious', while Amanda Seyfried offered words of encouragement and was constantly knitting between takes. But it was her on-screen father, X-Men star Hugh Jackman, who immediately took her under his wing. The Australian actor, who has two adopted children, took it upon himself to move rocks away from the set so Isabelle would not step on them, and made sure she was comfortable when not filming. Isabelle said: 'All the famous people were so nice and really helpful - they made me feel relaxed' She said: 'He would joke about what my favourite cocktail was and I'd say it was a water cocktail. He was very funny and would talk in these different voices. 'He tried to persuade the director to let me wear shoes while I was filming because it was cold, but we weren't allowed to. He was very kind to me. 'All the famous people were so nice and really helpful. They made me feel relaxed.' On the back of her film success, Isabelle has landed the same role for the current West End production of Les Miserables. On-screen family: From left, Amanda Seyfried, Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, who play Isabelle's older self, father and mother in Les Miserables . And the youngster has already received compliments on her performance in the upcoming film from her co-stars, as well as personal emails from Hugh Jackman and Amanda Seyfried. She will also get the red carpet treatment when she attends the film's World Premiere in Leicester Square on 5 December, and in New York on 10 December. Offers for new films have already come in, including a Disney role she is not allowed to talk about yet.

"Wanda Matthews, 25, from Bolton, was previously obsessed with pink . But when she gave birth to son Kaiden, she gradually began to redecorate until everything was blue .

Everyone has a favourite colour, but one woman was so addicted to pink that she painted her entire house with the rosy hue. But after giving birth to a little boy she decided to re-decorate her whole house in blue to make him feel more at home. Wanda Matthews, 25, was so addicted to pink that everything in her life from her hairdryer to washing up gloves had the same pinky tint. Out with the old: In her kitchen her pink cleaning products, toaster, kettle and washing up gloves were all thrown out to make way for their perfect blue replacements . Pink palace: Wanda Matthews was addicted to the colour pink and decorated her whole house in the rosy hue . But when she discovered she was pregnant with son Kaiden she decided it wouldn't be fair for him to grow up in her pink palace. Wanda's . cerise wallpaper in her living room was swapped for a flowery sky-blue . print, the hot pink wall paint was covered over with navy, the rose rug . was replaced by a teal one and the crimson coloured cushions on her sofa . are now different shades of aqua. In . her kitchen her pink cleaning products, toaster, kettle and washing up . gloves were all thrown out to make way for their perfect blue . replacements and even her previously girly bowls, plates and scissors . are now hidden at the back of the cupboards while their indigo rivals . are on display. Wanda even featured on TV show Snog, Marry, Avoid? and had a make-under due to her outrageous style and make up. She was addicted to buying clothes, make-up, wigs, accessories and spent a fortune on her appearance every month, often spending hours at a time getting ready for a night out. But since giving birth to her son and becoming a full-time mother, those days are far behind her and she has even dyed her hair too. Wanda, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, whose son is now eight . months old, said: 'When I found out I was having a boy my first thought . was what was I going to do about all the pink. What a difference: Wanda's famous pink loving days are far behind her . Feeling blue: The mother-of-three finally added the colour blue into her home once she discovered she was pregnant with a baby boy and realised he couldn't grow up surrounded by pink . 'I just thought to myself he can't be around all that pink, I couldn't do that to him. 'I . was thinking about what it would be like when he was older and looked . back at all his baby pictures and saw how everything was pink. 'The pink was fine when it was just us girls, but not for him. It did take me quite a while to warm to the idea though. 'The first thing I did was his bedroom and I made it yellow and then I started to add a few blue bits and then more and more. Blue baby: Wanda didn't want son Kaiden looking back on his photos and being surrounded by the colour pink, but her and her daughter's rooms are still pink . 'I think the yellow was to ease myself into the idea of getting rid of the pink. 'And then around Christmas time I started to do the living room blue. I decorated it completely, wall paper and painted it. Little by little: She began by painting some parts of the house yellow to ease herself into getting rid of the pink and it slowly all became blue . 'I got a new blue rug and a new couch and cushions. 'I've always wanted to have a boy but I was sort of expecting a girl, because I'd already had two. 'I wanted a boy, but I didn't want to get rid of the pink.' When . Wanda became a mother to two daughters she remembered how as a little . girl she had dreamed of one day having an all pink bedroom. And . she quickly decided she didn't want her girls to ever miss out on . anything and from that moment began planning every little girls dream - a . completely pink house. But after a brief relationship Wanda . discovered she was pregnant and was shocked to be told at her 20 week . scan that it was a baby boy. Instantly the mother's mind raced as to how a little boy would cope growing up in her bright girly home. Now, that the pink has gone Wanda desperately misses her 'loud' home but believes it is a sacrifice she has to make for her son. The . mother has however kept her own bedroom and her daughter's room as . girly as possible with every single item being a perfect shade of pink - . their own little 'girly piece of heaven.' Wanda added: 'The girls were asking me where all the pink had gone, I think they were a bit upset too. 'They did love it but I explained I got the flowers on the wallpaper just for them and they were happy again. Unexpected: Wanda had always wanted a boy but expected another little girl after having two already . More subtle: Wanda admits that she misses the happy, 'in your face' pink hues but likes the darker and more subtle look . 'Everyone has said they like the new look better, that it's much more toned down but I'm still not sure myself really. 'There's still bits I need to finish off as there's still the odd bit of pink around but I'll be really sad to see it go. 'I do miss it, it's such a big difference now, before it was bright and happy and in your face, whereas now it's a lot darker and more subtle. 'I think it will just take some getting used to. 'I did prefer the pink but I think it's important for him, I can't be taking pictures of him with pink everywhere in the background. 'My bedroom and the girls' bedroom is still pink, it's our little safe heavens.'","Wanda Matthews, 25, from Bolton, was previously obsessed with pink .

It is a central London pied-a-terre with a price tag that only the world's richest can afford to pay. A lavish apartment at the Candy & Candy development One Hyde Park has come up for sale - one of only a handful of properties in the billionaire-friendly block to reach the open market - and it could be yours for a cool £65m. The five-bedroom flat, described on property finding website zoopla.co.uk as 'exceptional', has magnificent panoramic views of Hyde Park and Knightsbridge and has been fitted out to the highest specifications. Apartment C.08.1, marketed by luxury estate agents Aylesford & Co, appeared on zoopla four days ago and is already attracting a flurry of interest. In the literature, the apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of 'pavilion C', on the 8th floor, enjoying some of the city's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property. Panoramic: The spacious living areas have views across Hyde Park on one side and across Knightsbridge and beyond on the other . Opulent: The luxury sitting room has been created by the Candy & Candy interior design team . In addition to the five bedrooms, there are six bathrooms and three extensive reception areas. 'The interior design of Apartment C.08.1 responds both to its unique size of over 9,000 sq ft as well as its extraordinary location,' the description reads. It goes on to detail how the apartment is divided into two wings, with five bedrooms found in the city wing, and all living and entertaining spaces found in the park wing. An 'impressive' 65m hallway stretches from the park side to the city side, connecting both wings and forming the so-called 'spine' of the apartment. The apartment was decorated by the Candy & Candy interior design team and is said to have taken inspiration from 'the two diverse perspectives of London, which uniquely combine in this apartment, to provide a truly modern interpretation of sophisticated and luxurious city living.' The property has reportedly already attracted a number of interested parties from across the globe since going up on Aylesford & Co's website at the end of last week. When contacted, Aylesford & Co preferred not to comment on the sale of the property, saying only that they had received a number of inquiries. They would not be drawn on the price, nor on the apartment's potential to be sold for more or less than the asking price. Airy: The 8th floor living space has views over the treetops of London's Hyde Park . Comfort: With three reception rooms, there is no shortage of places for the eventual buyer of the apartment to entertain . They would say only that it is 'early days' for the sale of the property, and that they were expecting 'a lot of interest'. But while there will be many eager to catch a glimpse of the interior of the opulent development, industry insiders told MailOnline that there will likely be some system in place at Aylesford & Co to prevent the curious carpet-treader from gaining entry just to have a look around. Agencies who have previously represented properties at One Hyde Park agencies have requested proof that any interested party should be able to afford the purchase of the property. It is likely that Aylesford & Co will use a similar system. 'Other agencies who've marketed properties in the building have demanded financial paperwork to stop rubber-neckers getting in. There are so many people who just want to have a look but have no intention of buying, and the other residents at the development are incredibly private people, and some of the world's wealthiest,' they told us. While they refused to confirm details, Aylesford & Co agreed they would be likely to operate some sort of system to ensure that only those with the means to live in One Hyde Park would be shown around the property. The buyer will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor. Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them. Despite being owned by some of the richest people in the world, the flats qualify for lower council tax than people living in an average Band D property because Westminster Council has one of the lowest property valuations in the country. Indeed, with many of the buyers never intending to live at the address, it was reported last year that just nine out of the 62 flats sold in . One Hyde Park - the world's most expensive residential block - had been . registered for council tax. Council records revealed last year that only four owners in the block were paying the full council tax of £755.60 a year, plus £619.64 to the Greater London Authority. A further five were reported to be paying the 50 per cent discounted . council tax owed on a second home, making a considerable saving that . will no doubt boost their already impressive wealth. But with so many of the building's residents based elsewhere, the place has earned . something of a reputation as a ghost town. Subtle decor: The interior of the flat is done in muted tones .

Charlotte Arnold took the decision to abort her unborn baby after losing her first son just weeks away from his due date. She has now developed an extreme phobia of pregnancy . A woman suffering with an extreme phobia of pregnancy had an abortion because she was too scared to have her baby, despite being desperate for a child. Heartbroken Charlotte Arnold, 24, from London, had the termination just weeks eight into her pregnancy. Her phobia was triggered by the horrific loss of her first baby son five weeks before he was due to be born. In . a devastating twist, the young woman had been forced to deliver . the stillborn baby, after doctors said he 'suffocated' in the womb. She is speaking out after a new . report found as many as one in six women could be affected by tokophobia – a severe fear of pregnancy and or childbirth. It even . suggests some sufferers are going as far as inducing miscarriage, . seeking sterilisation or terminating their pregnancy like Miss Arnold . did. The PA said: ‘I know lots of people won’t understand. I was . desperate to be a mother but was simply too terrified to continue with . the pregnancy. ‘As soon as I found out I was expecting I started suffering with anxiety and panic attacks. 'Deciding . to end the pregnancy was one of the hardest decisions of my life but I . knew there was no way I could get through it without having a breakdown. ‘I left the clinic in tears, heartbroken, but also relieved that I didn’t have to go through pregnancy and birth. I really felt like I had no choice. I was petrified. 'I hope this new report helps people understand what women like me go through.’ According to experts there are two main types of the condition. Primary tokophobia relates to childless women who have a morbid fear of pregnancy or birth and have consequently never been able to have children. Secondary tokophobia affects women who have experienced a traumatic pregnancy or birth experience, which leaves them too emotionally scarred to have more children. Miss Arnold said she had always dreamed of becoming a mother and was delighted when she fell pregnant in 2007. Her pregnancy went smoothly, but at 34 weeks she realised she had not felt her baby move for several hours. Because he was usually so active she and partner Mario Ecomomou 30, grew concerned and called their doctor. Miss Arnold had first been forced to bury her son, who died in her womb after she suffered undiagnosed pre eclampsia, in a shallow grave. She and partner Mario then moved him to a family tomb . At the time they were living in Cyprus and just weeks away from moving back to London to prepare. She said: ‘When staff at the clinic told me to make my way in I was more concerned that our baby might arrive early. I didn’t for a moment consider there was anything seriously wrong.’ But an ultrasound revealed devastating news - their son had died. She said: 'I remember the doctor shaking his head and saying ‘he’s gone.’ I didn’t understand what he meant. 'I was due to give birth so where could my baby have gone ? Then it hit me that he meant dead. I just couldn’t take it in.' Unbeknown to her she been suffering with pre-eclampsia, which leads to dangerous high blood pressure, water retention and protein in the urine of expectant mothers. Although the cause is not known, it is though to be linked to the placenta, which provides oxygen to the baby while it is in the womb. She said: 'The doctor matter of factly said my son had most likely suffocated inside me.I was horrified.  Hours earlier we’d been on top of the world planning our future, now our baby was dead.’ Just moments later Miss Arnold was told she would have to deliver her son who they had named George. She said: ‘I was in shock. But I could hear my partner remonstrating, saying that I was in no state to give birth and they needed to do a C section.’ ‘We had to wait in the clinic for an operating theatre to become available. All around me were pregnant women, some in labour. It was heartbreaking.’ Six hours later she was taken into theatre. ‘When I came round I looked down at my empty stomach and just started screaming for my baby. ‘I kept sobbing ""I want my boy, bring me my boy,"" but nobody offered to get him for me.' Hospital staff later brought her her son, but would not let her hold him. Miss Arnold first fell pregnant while living in Cyprus, and her pregnancy had run smoothly, until 34 weeks . She had been nearly full term when she lost her son George. The harrowing experience which followed left her with a condition called tokophobia - which makes her petrified of giving birth . She said: 'I wanted to hold him but they refused so instead I stroked his cheek and held his tiny little hand. And then after a few moments he was gone again and that was it.’ There was no offer of footprints or a lock of hair to cherish as is routinely offered to grieving parents in the UK. Instead, in line with local tradition, their son was to be buried within 48 hours. She said then followed a 'nightmarish experience' in which she and her partner arrived at the cemetery to find there was no plot prepared. Instead Mario was forced to dig his own son's grave helped by a group of local family members with spades. The priest even refused to say a prayer because George had not been baptised. Later that night Miss Arnold suffered a breakdown. The next morning the couple returned to the cemetery to gently retrieve their son's casket themselves and take him to a family plot nearby. They washed the coffin down with bottles water, wrapped it in blankets, before taking it by car to a family plot to lay George to rest next to his late paternal grandfather. This is a scan of George, the couple's stillborn first child. The experience left Miss Arnold so traumatised, she aborted her second child . Weeks later she moved back to the UK to be with family and friends, but was haunted by nightmares and flashbacks. She said: 'I tried to focus on the thought he was resting now, but the nightmares were constant so I started counselling.’ Both Miss Arnold and her partner still wanted to become parents and she even hoped another child might help ease her pain. But when a year on she learned she was pregnant again she was suddenly engulfed by fear. ‘I wanted a baby, but all I felt was terror. My fear it would go wrong again was overwhelming. ‘I was suffering panic attacks, constant anxiety and dread. I was petrified that the same thing would happen again. ‘Seeing pregnant woman or tiny babies would set me off. ‘We’d also been told the pre eclampsia could come back and I just knew then that I couldn't go ahead with the pregnancy. ‘No matter how much I wanted a baby I was simply too frightened.’ Miss Arnold had always considered herself anti abortion, but as each day of her pregnancy passed it started to feel like her only escape from the daily terror. Initially she said was afraid of admitting to her partner that she wanted a termination, scared he would not understand . But in the end her phobia made the choice for her and, supported by her partner, she booked a termination at eight weeks. Miss Arnold said she did not regret her decision: ‘It would have pushed me over the edge. The fear was so great it would have finished me. I did the right thing at the time. After a visit to her GP to discuss her fear of pregnancy, she was prescribed antidepressants, but after several months decided to stop taking them. It’s been three years since Miss Arnold's termination and she said she is now considering trying again after receiving counselling for her phobia. She said: ‘Mario has been a saint he really has but I know he wants us to start a family and so I’m doing my best to get my head in the right place. ‘Some days I think it might be possible. Other days I imagine leaving hospital without a baby again and it leaves me terrified. ‘Maybe the report will lead to women like me being offered more help and support. I want to overcome this phobia with all my heart and I know that I will. It’s just a question of when.’","Charlotte Arnold, 24, lost her first son just weeks before he was due to be born .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:49 EST, 28 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 28 November 2012 . An 11-year-old wrestling fan has proved he's a real fighter after enduring 30 brain operations. Callum Murray has overcome numerous bouts of illness while training to become a junior referee in his favourite sport. The youngster has beaten meningitis twice, overcome a brain haemorrhage, a cyst on his brain and  sudden attacks which saw him black out and stop breathing. Callum, pictured left during a recent visit to hospital, says wrestling is the one world where he has felt totally accepted . In the ring: Callum referees a match between wrestlers Shaun The Hammer Davis and Tyson T-Bone. The wrestling world has got behind his fundraising cause . In January 2006, doctors at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital diagnosed him with Arnold Chiari Malformation. The condition is a malformation at the base of the brain which puts pressure on vital nervous system fluid moving from the brain to the spinal cord. Now a special valve fitted behind Callum's ear helps drain the fluid and keep him alive. He also takes 24 tablets a day to keep his condition in check. Despite six years of operations and staying at three different hospitals brave Callum has found one thing that helps him feel like any other child - wrestling. He loves the sport so much Callum has travelled hundreds of miles to watch it and has had the backing of some of the sport's biggest stars. Now wrestling is helping his determined parents Sharon, 35, and Rob, 36, raise £10,000 to take him for pioneering treatment in the US through fund-raising bouts. The fund stands at just over £7,000 towards taking Callum to the The Chiari Institute, New York, U.S, where he and his family hope to find some answers. Callum has managed to stay positive despite enduring six years of operations . Biggest fans: Callum with his mother Sharon, father Rob and wrestler John Cena, who has helped raise money for an operation for Callum in the U.S . Callum - who has already undergone referee training and overseen junior bouts - said wrestling was the only time he felt totally accepted. The youngster - who lives with his parents in Widnes, Cheshire, said: 'What the wrestlers have done for me is awesome, I want to say thank you so much. 'When I'm older I want to be a referee but if I can't do that a manager or a promoter. I don't like WWE or WWF, I like the wrestling we have in Britain. 'My illness makes me sad because I miss lots of holidays and can't go to school as much and I can't play with other children as much as I'd like.' Mother Sharon said one of the best things for Callum about wrestling was the fact people didn't look twice at him and accepted him meaning he could be himself. Still smiling: Callum has had a valve fitted behind his ear to drain extra fluid from his brain . She said: 'Callum is a real little . fighter, he doesn't want people feeling sorry for him, he's fighting to . have a normal childhood. 'He . can get second glances sometimes because of the scars but when we are . at wrestling no one looks twice and he can just be like any other child. 'Callum . doesn't feel like he's abnormal, he's older than his years, he'll go up . to people in their 20s and 30s and say 'alright buddy'. 2006 . 1) First brain surgery2) Decompression surgery after bone causing pressure grows back3) Emergency surgery to inset a drain after a brain bleed4) Shunt inserted after developing build up of fluid on brain5) Monitoring device inserted to check brain pressure6) An operation to change the top part of the shunt7) Operation to replace shunt from brain to stomach . 2007 . 8) Bottom part of shunt replaced to improve drainage9) Hole opened in brain to re-establish flow of fluid.

'He plays in goal at football, he . loves his Xbox and Playstation, he acts just like any other 11-year-old . and never lets it get him down.' One of the worst moments for Callum . was just after Christmas 2006 when aged just seven he had to fight off a . deadly rare form of meningitus. Sharon said: 'Callum contracted a form of meningitis that just lives in the ventricles of the brain, two parts at the base of the head. 'During the treatment the doctor showed us the fluid from the brain, it should have been the colour of white wine but it was as cloudy as milk because of all the white blood cells fighting the infection.' Father Rob, a former Royal Navy submariner, said there weren't words to describe how brave his son had been in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds. At one stage Callum was blacking out and not breathing almost every week so the Murray's had special 'Keep Clear' road markings drawn outside their home for the ambulance. He said: 'As a family seeing the pain he has been through, not knowing if he was going to make it through operations has been hard, but Callum has been brave for all of us. 'Sharon and I have been in hospital so many times we get other parents coming to us for advice, it's even got to the stage when we have been spelling the name of his condition to some doctors or nurses because we know it better than they do. 'At one stage during Callum's illness they offered for him to be cared for at a hospice, which was really nice, but we knew it wasn't the place for him. 'His attitude is amazing and we are hopeful in America they will be able to offer something perhaps we can't get over here that might be able to help him.' Steven Fludder, from Preston City Wrestling, helped organise a fund-raising event for Callum that raised around £2,000. He said: 'Callum doesn't act any different to a boy his age, he doesn't want attention because of what has happened to him, he just gets on with life, he's an inspiration. 'If Callum wants to be a referee some day in wrestling there's nothing stopping him and I think he should follow his dream. 'I started this wrestling club in August 2011 and Callum and Rob and Sharon have been there since the beginning so it has been nice to give something back.'","Callum has beaten meningitis twice and overcome a brain haemorrhage .

Festive fretting: 17 per cent of us will need to borrow money to put tinsel on the tree this year . If you are worried about putting tinsel on the tree and turkey on the table this year you are not alone. The impact of the recession is threatening to reach Father Christmas this year, with more and more of us worrying about the cost of the festive season causing us to start the preparations earlier than ever. More than one in ten families (12 per cent) started Christmas planning in September in order to combat the financial impact of the festive season. A further super-prepared seven per cent of people even started their Christmas shopping in January this year to help spread the costs. The research, released today by Morrisons, found over half (51 per cent) of people are more concerned about the financial impact of Christmas this year than last. The average household’s monthly outgoings in December will increase by £164.80 as people spend additional money on festive food, drink, decorations, presents and travel. In preparation for Christmas, 17 per cent of people started saving in January; however 32 per cent of people are worried they have not saved enough to cover the cost of Christmas this year. Some people are turning to extreme measures to fund Christmas with 17 per cent claiming they will need to borrow money to help fund their Christmas celebrations. Those that resort to borrowing can expect to spend the next 15 weeks paying off the Christmas bill. Others are trying to avoid getting into debt by selling items to raise funds (13 per cent) or taking on additional work (11 per cent). A quarter of people (24 per cent) are also planning to buy cheaper food to cut back on costs. Christmas come early: More than one in ten families started planning in September in order to combat the financial impact of the festive season . Despite this gloomy news people are still finding ways . to reduce the cost and still have a cracking Christmas and no matter how tight the purse strings there are some . things we just refuse to compromise on: top of the list of things Britons won’t sacrifice is presents for our families and the indulgence of a turkey with all the trimmings. 1. Presents for the family – 66 per cent . 2. Christmas dinner – 54 per cent . 3. Presents for a partner – 45 per cent . 4. Christmas decorations – 42 per cent . 5. Presents for pets – 11 per cent . The research also revealed that Christmas isn’t just celebrated on 25 December . Of those surveyed, 45 per cent said that they will sit down to a Christmas lunch two or three times, with 39 per cent of the UK celebrating before the big day and over half (52 per cent) of families continuing to celebrate Christmas well into January. Whilst this means twice the celebration, it’ll also means twice the cost. Sarah Willingham, founder of Letssavesomemoney.com commented, ‘Christmas is an expensive time of year but it’s important to plan ahead and prepare to avoid getting into debt. ‘There are still two pay packets left before Christmas, so make sure you cover the cost of Christmas across both. ‘Keeping a record of your spending may sound dull and complicated but it’s a really great way to get control, and keep control, of your finances. Christmas may only be weeks away, but there is still time to be savvy with your shopping, cooking and present buying.’ Buy your Christmas food . early, don’t save it all until the last minute. Don't be led astray . with impulse buying either- stick to a list and buy only what you need. Those chocolate reindeer are sweet - but do you need them on top of the 3 . puddings? Make it or bake it! Get creative - hand made cards and gifts show you've put in your time and effort, while home baked goods in decorative wrapping make a perfect (and low cost) gift for colleagues and acquaintances. Start making the Christmas dinner in early December to spread the cost and the workload. Soup for starters and Christmas pudding ice-cream are made well in advance and frozen. Also frozen turkeys are just as good as fresh ones but so much cheaper . If you’re having a big family Christmas with lots of adult guests, have a 'secret Santa' and tell everyone to bring just one grown-up present, setting a maximum price too . Before you start buying presents for your family, have a clear out and sell some of the toys and games that your children don’t play with anymore. You’ll not only be making some money to pay towards the presents, but clearing some space for them too . Why not buy your friends gift cards for Christmas. Morrisons has a Fuel Saver scheme which gives you 1p off every litre of fuel for a £10 gift card, rising to 6p off if you spend £60 . If you go out to work, make a packed lunch every day between now and Christmas. Missing out on those shop-bought sandwiches will save you more than £100 by December 25 .","51 per cent of people are more concerned about the financial impact of Christmas this year than last .

He says he liked her for her great spirit, her feisty rebellious side and the fact that she's 'kind of wild'. But although shamed director Rupert Sanders was talking about the acting qualities of his partner in extra-marital relations Kristen Stewart, he could surely have been referring to his betrayed wife, Liberty Ross. The stunning model and actress has revealed her own feisty, rebellious side in a short film for luxury lingerie brand Damaris. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Her dark side: Liberty Ross, whose husband Rupert Sanders has admitted to cheating on her with Twilight star Kristen Stewart, in a still from a short film made by lingerie brand Damaris . The sultry online video - directed by acclaimed commercial director Johnny Green for Damaris in association with mywardrobe.com - is called Packing Heat. It features mother-of-two Ross, 32, as a gun-brandishing femme fatale who engages in a firearm battle with a second woman wearing pink Damaris lingerie. In heavy, smudged, glittery make-up, Ross parades around a dark house wearing provocative black lacy Damaris lingerie, a short black dress and black stilettos. Quoting Jean-Luc Godard, Green said: 'All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.' Damaris founder and creative director Damaris Evans said: 'When one of the world's most acclaimed commercial directors calls you to make a knicker film for your brand... you say yes! 'Knickers, a gun, explosions… clearly a man's idea, and fantasy… and then Liberty Ross...that tops it off!' Time for reflection: Actress Liberty Ross wearing Damaris underwear in a bathroom, in a still from a short film made by the lingerie brand . Though the video was originally banned by YouTube for, according to Ross, 'its hot model/lingerie/gun content', it is now available to watch on the streaming site. For Liberty herself, a wider range of . roles may soon be on offer thanks to the training she underwent for filming. She said: 'I went to a training centre where they teach actors to shoot for movies.They'd just trained Christian Bale for his Batman role. And I can now shoot pistols, rifles and AK47s.' The video premiered at London's Somerset House during London Fashion Week last September, but interest in it has piqued over the past few days in light of revelations that Ross' director husband Sanders had an affair with Twilight star Kristen Stewart, the star of his new film Snow White And The Huntsman.

A day after Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he should pay more taxes, the multi-billionaire donated $750million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the Global Fund, to which the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already contributed $650million. It gives aid to some of the most underprivileged countries in the world. ‘These are tough economic times, but that is no excuse for cutting aid to the world’s poorest,’ Mr Gates said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Philanthropist: Bill Gates holds medicine while posing next to a cut out of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He donated $750million to The Global Fund today . Continuing the fight: The Global Fund fights AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria through research and treatment. Bill Gates' charity has already donated $650million to the cause . ‘The Global Fund is one of the most effective ways we invest our money every year.’ While the donation will give an immediate boost to the Global Fund, more is needed from governments, which have provided the bulk of the $22.6billion that has been raised by the Geneva, Switzerland-based organization to date for its work in 150 countries. The commitment of governments was shaken last year when the fund reported 'grave misuse of funds' in four recipient nations, prompting some donors such as Germany and Sweden to freeze their donations. Mr Gates, however, played down the problem and praised the fund's transparency, which he said had exposed corruption problems that might well have remained hidden at other organisations. 'If you are going to do health programs in Africa you are going to have some percentage that is misused,' he said. Awareness: The Global Fund was created to fight three of the world's most devastating diseases and seeks to educate people on prevention and treatment . Famous supporters: The organisation has high-profile support from people like U2 singer Bono . The AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria fighter is a magnet to high-profile figures. In the tenth anniversary video, former prime minister Tony Blair, former president Bill Clinton, and U2 frontman Bono are just some of the familiar faces that praise the efforts of the Global Fund. They also add there is much more difficult work to be done in the fight against these diseases. Mr Gates, who is worth an estimated $59billion, said that he agreed that drastic fiscal measures are taken to help the country recover from its crippling deficit. ‘The United States has a huge budget . deficit so taxes are going to have to go up,’ he said in an interview . about his devotion to charitable giving. ‘I certainly agree that they should go up more on the rich than everyone else that's just justice.’ In Switzerland: Bill Gates spoke at the World Economic Forum today at the ski resort of Devos . Mr Gates’ comments to BBC come a day after President Obama addressed the country in his annual State Of The Union speech, in which he argued the need for a tightened tax code that forces millionaires and billionaires to pay what he feels is a more appropriate share of their earnings to the state. The Microsoft founder has dedicated much of his time in the past five years to charitable causes, spearheading African aid projects and encouraging others to spread their wealth. Happy to pay up: Bill Gates said that he agrees that wealthy Americans are not paying their fair share in taxes . State of the Union: Barack Obama addressed Congress in his annual presidential speech last night . ‘I hope we can solve that deficit . problem with a sense of shared sacrifice where everybody would feel like . they're doing their part. ‘Right now I don’t feel like people like myself are doing as much as we should,’ Mr Gates concluded. Mr Buffett, after whom Mr Obama named his proposed tax, is actually the co-sponsor of Mr Gates’ Giving Pledge initiative. The effort targets billionaires and has them agree to give away at least half of their wealth to charitable causes either during their lifetime of after their death. As of last April, 69 people had publically joined the pledge. Mr Obama spoke extensively about the need to place higher taxes on millionaires during Tuesday night’s speech. ‘Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households,’ the President said. ‘Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.’ Guests: Debbie Bosanek (left), the secretary of Warren Buffett, and Steve Jobs's wife Laurene Powell Jobs were two of the people invited to sit with the First Lady . Mr Buffett’s secretary Debbie Bosanek has been a common point of reference during the debate over raising taxes, and she for the first time since the issue was raised, Ms Bosanek herself was seen as she was a guest of the First Lady. Mr Obama made an argument- later echoed by Mr Gates- that the only sensible approach to fixing the deficit and paying for necessary social programs was by focusing on the country’s wealthy. ‘Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else - like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both,’ he said.

But it's never been done by the brave fire-fighting women of Britain's emergency services. Until now. The ladies of the South Yorkshire fire brigade have been even braver than usual, stripping off to take part in a scantily clad photo shoot for a calender to raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Fire Fighters Charity. Smokin' hot! Female fire-fighters strip off for Britain's first ever all-women charity calender to raise money for Cancer Research UK . The women from Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield emergency services have stripped down to their underwear for the first UK female-only fire fighter calendar, Fire Girls 2013, which is being sold on eBay for £6. In the smoking hot photos the women - Fleur Doyle, Jade Styan, Nicole Hallat, Claire Morton, Frankie Salerno, Sally Stark, Sian Nortcliffe and Angie Thrope - are seen posing in their bras holding hoses, leaning across laders, fooling around in the fire foam, hanging out with Father Christmas, wearing hard hats, drinking water and lounging across cars and beside the fire truck. Aged 23 to 54, the women admitted they were nervous at first but now hope the calender will be the first in a series. Miss August - Angie Thorp, 40, a South Yorkshire fire service crew manager - said: 'None of us had ever modelled before. But we all had a really good time. 'We hope it will be the first of a series. We are planning to do a double sided calendar next year with the men on one side and the girls on the other - and Christmas cards. All of us were a bit embarrassed about posing. But the fire men made us full of confidence and we had a lot of help form the guys. 'Our husbands were also very supportive and many of those buying the calendar are male colleagues' wives who want it as a stocking filler for their husbands. All of us did the race for life twice in full kit with breathing apparatus and decided to do the calendar as the next step. 'We are all fire fighters but we are also all normal people doing a normal job.' December: The girls pose in their uniforms alongside Father Christmas and his giant hose, in a calender shoot to raise money for Cancer Research UK and the Fire Fighters Charity . The pictures for the calendar were taken at a fire station in Rotherham, . with the permission of senior officers and involved ladies from . Barnsley, Rotherham and Sheffield. Despite obtaining permission to film on . fire service premises, there was no question of any pole dancing or . other no-hold-barred poses. To avoid bringing the fire service into disrepute the women limited . themselves to stripping off their tunics to reveal their bras or opening . up their coats to show what they wear underneath - when not fighting . fires or checking smoke alarms. To those who might consider this way of raising money for charity undignified, the women said: 'We desperately wanted to raise as much money as we could but also to . maintain our dignity as well - because we have to come to work after it . all!' With only nine girls and 12 months to fill three of the pages are group . shots. But the the calendar has caused such a buzz there should be no . shortage of female fire-fighting buddies willing to strut their stuff . for the 2014 edition.

She blushed: 'At the photo shoot it was a bit daunting to whip our jackets off and expose ourselves in our bras. But once we relaxed the photographer made us feel at ease. It was good fun and we've all become great friends by doing it.

High Street store H&M notched up yet another hit collaboration as Anna Dello Russo's bold gold  accessories line was snapped up in moments by frantic shoppers. Queues formed outside H&M stores from the early hours as shoppers eager to be the first to get their hands on the bold pieces made sure they were at the front of the line. Wristbands were handed out to those waiting to buy the collection, allowing them a 15-minute slot in the store. Unlike with previous collections (like Versace and Marni, where extraordinarily high demand was predicted) no quantity restrictions were placed on shoppers this morning - meaning some shoppers left the store with large bags bulging with the jewelled cuffs, gold-framed sunglasses and brightly coloured statement necklaces. Happy shoppers Lhiag and Louise, both 23, emerge with bags more than they intended on buying . First in the queue at the High Street Kensington branch of H&M were marketing students Lhiag and Louise, both 23, who arrived at 6am. Lhiag . says she was 'happy and surprised' to be at the front of the line. 'Last time . my friends came here for Marni there was such a long queue by 6am,' she . said, adding that she was keen on snapping up the 'green emerald . necklace and the earrings.' Louise says she was at the launch of the Marni . collection herself and, after witnessing the crowds who turned up for that launch, made sure to arrive in good time today - and had already picked out the pieces she wanted to take home. 'Today I'm looking for the orange necklace. The shoes are too much, . too fancy,' she said. Nineteenth in the queue was student . Taima, 24, from Bahrain, who joined the line at 7.20am. 'I also went to . Versace and Matthew Williamson's collaborations with H&M,' she said. 'I want to get the trolley bag for my sister, as it's sold out in the . Emirates.' Louise and . Emma-Kutya, both 21, arrived at around 10.50am. 'I'm expecting lots of . gold, very opulent pieces, statement pieces, bright gold and eccentric . accessories,' said Louise. 'We really like her snake bracelets and some . of the crocodile pieces are quite cute.' Today Lhiag and Louise (pictured) queued outside Kensington's H&M since 6am with coffees and McDonalds only intending to purchase one set of jewellery each but emerged just after 10am with bags full of shopping . Queues formed from 6am awaiting the store's 9am opening; eager shoppers got time-allocation wristbands . While they'd never been to one of H&M's designer collaboration openings before Louise's mother had gone to the Vescace one and encouraged the girls to go. 'It's definitely worth getting up this early,' said Louise. Julia, 23, from London saw a necklace that she wanted in a magazine and arrived early to make sure she'd bag it. 'It was the green emerald-looking one,' she said. 'I'm just here for that. I've never been to one of these before so I hope I get what I want. It's my day off today so I thought I'd risk it.' Scenes at Regent Street, London, were hectic as shoppers fought to get their hands on their wish-list items.

The store was a sea of Anna Dello Russos as face . masks were handed to shoppers adding to the party atmosphere. A giant ankle boot and bracelet from the collection took centre stage in store.

In a story that mirrors the 1961 Hayley Mills film The Parent Trap (and the 1998 Lindsey Lohan remake), a couple are remarrying more than 30 years since their divorce after their daughter reunited them. Bev Worsnop was just 16 when she married her childhood sweetheart Robert Worthington in 1975 in Bolton, Greater Manchester. They split up five years later but finally found love again after their daughter Kelly Worthington, 32, got back in touch with her dad a couple of years ago. It must be love: Robert Worthington and Bev Worsnop are today remarrying, having first married in 1975 but getting divorced five years later . They'll get married for the second time at Bolton Register Office, Greater Manchester, today. Bev said: 'We first met when I had a party in my house while my parents were away. I'd been to the Stag's Head pub in St Helens Road beforehand and met Robert. 'I told him I was holding a party and he said he was going to one too. It turned out it was the same party. We were married at the old Bolton Register Office in the town centre and stayed together for five years. 'I was only 16 and was pregnant, but we both felt we had been too young to get married. We wanted some freedom.' Happy family: Robert Worthington and Bev Worsnop with their daughter Kelly Worthington, now aged 32, who reunited them 30 years after their divorce . However, when their daughter, Kelly from Tonge Moor, wanted to get back in touch with her father, the couple, who live near to each other in Aldersyde Street, Great Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester, were reunited. Ms Worsnop said: 'We had a 30-year gap during which I remarried and then separated again. But Kelly got me and Robert back together. 'She'd grown up living with me, but wanted to make contact with Robert. So I left a note at his home just under two years ago, saying Kelly wanted to get in touch with him. 'Kelly is now over the moon that we are getting married again. There's a lot of catching up for us all to do.'

Determined: Belinda Clayton from Binchester, wanted to join the 'weigh-less scheme' after it was recommended by a friend . A grandmother-of-two was turned down by an NHS weight-loss programme - because she was ‘too fat’. Belinda Clayton, who weighs 16 stones and wears a size 20, tried to apply for a weight-loss scheme through her GP but was stunned to be told it was only for the 'moderately overweight.' The 61-year-old, who suffers fatigue due to M.E, described her rejection from the scheme like a ‘slap in the face with a fish.’ Mrs Clayton from, Binchester, near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, said: 'I was told about ‘Change 4 Life’ by a friend about a month ago. She said that she loved it and it was so successful. 'I went to my GP in Bishop Auckland and we filled in the form and weighed me and he faxed it through and said they would be in touch. 'They rang me up and initially the lady from ‘Change 4 Life’ was quite chatty and encouraging. 'Then she said that my BMI is too high. She said they only offered the scheme for people with a BMI between 30-35 and that mine was too high. 'I said ""so that means I’m too fat for your scheme?"". She kept trying to get me to do an exercise scheme, but in the end I said ""you can’t help me"" and she said ""no, we can’t"".' To add insult to injury, Belinda found out her BMI, according to the NHS website, is 35.07 - which meant she was only just outside the limit for help. Belinda was not told her BMI, but learned afterwards that it was just outside the limit for help. She said: 'The lady did say it was a very close, but 35.07 sounds pretty incredible, especially given that I have long-standing health issues. 'It’s getting so silly now that it’s almost making me laugh. But it’s so frustrating, at the end of the day it was a scheme that I really wanted to be a part of. 'I still think it’s a good scheme. This is ludicrous though, it’s absolutely bonkers. 'It’s some criteria that’s been fixed so firmly, it’s just red tape. The girl I spoke to was so rigid it was like talking to a brick wall.' The 12-week course, Mrs Clayton wanted to join includes group sessions with advice on subjects from diet to activity and changing old behaviours. It is part of the local PCT's contribution to the Change 4 Life programme organised by the Department of Health. Brenda, a mother-of-three was a healthy nine stone and a size twelve when she was younger. However she was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid in her early 40s and little by little the weight began to creep on. The weigh-less scheme is part of the Government's Change 4 Life initiative. However, it is only available to those with a BMI of 30-35 . Brenda, a retired social worker, said: 'I was very fit and we had horses and things so I was on the go all the time. 'Then when I got to my 40s I came down with an over-active thyroid. I started gaining weight in my early 40s. 'I’ve never eaten to excess, if I had eaten what I wanted to I would be the size of a house. 'I don’t eat vast quantities of takeaways or anything like that, I have Weetabix and berries for breakfast and quite often salmon and salad for dinner. 'Everybody has indulgences, my weakness is ice cream but I just don’t buy it anymore, if it’s not in the house I can’t eat it. 'I stopped smoking seven years ago and that didn’t help with my weight either.' In 2001, after suffering a bout of pancreatitis and undergoing a gall bladder operation, Belinda was diagnosed with ME. She said: 'I fell ill with flu in January 2000, and I just never recovered. I was really quite ill for a year, I went to hospital and ended up with pancreatitis. 'It wasn’t until 2001 that I was diagnosed with ME. It’s like being a car that’s run out of petrol - everything just grinds to a halt. 'But I’ve learnt to live with it now, if I feel myself getting tired I know when to pull back. 'I’ve been trying to lose weight quietly for years - but with my ME it’s hard to do strenuous exercise. Mrs Clayton says she struggles with her weight as she also has M.E, which can cause periods of fatigue. However, she tries to eat as healthily as possible . 'I can only do gently exercise, I walk my dog and swim twice a week. Life can be difficult, I do think to some minor extent that I comfort eat. 'If I have a really bad day with the ME I tend to get a sweet tooth and I’ll eat something like bread and jam when perhaps I shouldn’t.' When she heard of ‘Change 4 Life,’ Belinda, who also suffers from a vitamin D deficiency, thought she had found the answer to her problems. She said: 'I’m dyslexic and I didn’t want to have to count points or anything like that. 'I was enthusiastic about ‘Change 4 Life,’ I had built myself up to do it, I was enthusiastic about it, it felt like something I could do.' But after being turned away from the NHS programme Belinda now feels let down and disappointed. Feeling excluded: Mrs Clayton said not allowing her to join the group was 'bonkers' She said: 'At the time I was quite cross, it’s bloody ridiculous, it’s meant to be a scheme to help overweight people but it’s only for thin people. 'I felt quite let down by the NHS, what a bloody stupid scheme. It’s nonsense. 'In a way it’s quite funny, it’s just so silly, but on another level it’s very annoying. 'I thought if I could lose 2 stone then I could get down a dress size and feel better, but now I feel like I’ve been slapped across the face with a herring.' Belinda is now planning to try out Slimming World to lose some weight. A spokesman for NHS County Durham and Darlington PCT said: 'The Primary Care Trust’s Weigh Less Scheme is a pilot scheme and has very clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, which is well documented in professional guidance and patient leaflets. 'This is to ensure that the service offers support to the most appropriate people who would like to lose weight and become more active and we would be delighted to support anyone who wishes to set themselves lifestyle goals through the Health Trainer service. 'Services available include a free County Durham Health Trainer service, free four-week Cook4Life courses to support healthy eating behaviours, a GP Exercise on Referral Service that offers structured and supervised support to people to become more active, Get Active Get Cycling activities, Swimming, Walking for Health and much more.'","Belinda Clayton applied to weight-loss scheme through her GP but was told she was too heavy to take part .

The mother of the world’s first test-tube baby has died at the age of 64. Lesley Brown made medical history nearly 34 years ago  when she gave birth to Louise. Mrs Brown and her husband John had been trying for a baby for nine years when they signed up to what was then an experimental procedure, in vitro fertilisation. She became pregnant at the first attempt, and 5lb 12oz Louise Joy Brown was born by caesarean section at Oldham General Hospital at 11.47pm on July 25, 1978. The event, which gave hope to countless infertile couples, captured the imagination of the world after it was reported exclusively by the Daily Mail under the headline The Lovely Louise. Four years later Mrs Brown, who couldn’t become pregnant naturally because her fallopian tubes were blocked, conceived a second daughter, Natalie, by IVF. Since those pioneering days more than four million babies around the world have been born through IVF, in which a woman’s eggs are fertilised with sperm outside the body and then implanted into the womb. World first: Louise Brown, centre, the first test tube baby in the world. Her mother Lesley, left, has died while her father John, right, passed away five years ago . Proud parents: John and Lesley Brown in hospital with their newborn daughter Louise in 1978 . Mrs Brown’s family announced yesterday that she had died at Bristol Royal Infirmary on June 6, following a short illness. Pioneering treatment: Mrs Brown was the first woman in the world to successfully give birth following IVF treatment . Louise, . who has a naturally-conceived son Cameron, aged five, said: ‘Mum was a . very quiet and private person who ended up in the world spotlight . because she wanted a family so much. We are all missing her terribly.’ Mrs Brown, from Whitchurch, Bristol, . also leaves a step-daughter, Sharon, and five grandchildren. Her husband . died five years ago, also aged 64. The IVF treatment she received was . carried out at Oldham General Hospital by Professor Robert Edwards, who . was awarded a Nobel Prize for medicine in 2010, and Dr Patrick Steptoe. Although other women had been implanted with fertilised eggs, Mrs Brown . was the first to achieve a pregnancy which went beyond a few weeks. Some . feared the baby would be abnormal and it was only after Louise’s birth . that minds could be put at rest. In 2008 Mrs Brown said she had been . so desperate to have a baby she was willing to put up with anything to . give birth. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for Bob Edwards and Patrick Steptoe I . wouldn’t have this family. Breakthrough: Lesley and her husband John at Oldham General Hospital shortly before she gave birth . ‘Louise’s birthday makes me remember . back to when I had her. And looking at all my grandchildren, I think how . they wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for IVF.’ Exclusive: The Mail, July 27, 1978 . Two years ago it emerged that Louise . was actually grown in a jar rather than a test-tube. The glass vessel . was put on public display at Cambridge University. A spokesman for Professor Edwards . said yesterday: ‘Lesley was a devoted mum and grandmother and through . her bravery and determination many millions of women have been given the . chance to become mothers. ‘She was a lovely gentle lady and we . will all remember her with deep affection.’ Professor Edwards’s research . with Dr Steptoe came despite opposition from the medical and religious . establishments and they were forced to seek  private donations to fund . their early work.

'It’s safe to assume that EL James has long ago sold enough copies to repay her seven figure book advance, which means at this point she is earning the standard seven per cent royalty on every $14 (£9) paperback and 25 per cent royalty on every $10 (£6.40) ebook. 'In the last month, James has sold four million paperbacks and one million ebooks, which equates to $2.94m (£1.89m) in paperback royalties and $2.497m (£1.6m) in ebook royalties. In other words $5.4m (£3.47m) in four weeks, $1.35m (£868,502) per week!' Modest beginnings: Fifty Shades Of Grey was orinigally Twilight fan fiction which EL gave away for free . James has also just been paid $5m (£3.2m) from Universal/Focus Features for the film rights to the trilogy, so it really has been quite some year. James, originally a self-published Kindle Direct Publishing author, saw popularity of her book soar online after readers embarrassed to be seen with a hard copy of the racy tome preferred to buy online. The Kindle edition of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ is currently outselling the print book at a rate of more than two to one. Sales of the book, the first in a . trilogy, have overtaken the Harry Potter books and the Da Vinci Code, to . the delight of not only James, but established romance writer Jilly Cooper. Cooper yesterday credited James with reviving interest in the flagging 'bonkbuster' genre, saying: 'Porn was terribly out of fashion before . that book came out. 'While I have heard that it is quite poorly written, I . am delighted that it’s giving a new lease of life to the genre.'

A healthy young woman decided to have her breasts removed because of a family history of cancer. Fiona Luscombe, 23, chose to have a double mastectomy after both her mother and grandfather died following battles with breast cancer. On discovering she was carrying the  same hereditary gene, she made the heart-breaking decision to reduce the chances of developing the disease herself. Scroll down for video . No choice: Fiona Luscombe, 23, (pictured before her operation left) felt she had no option but to have the double mastectomy. She had both breasts removed and had the implants put in at the same time (pictured after surgery right) Miss Luscombe, a nursery teacher, . told how she opted for the surgery after doctors discovered she was . carrying the gene – but said they would not know more until further . scans in seven years’ time. She said: ‘I was devastated, totally gutted and it took a long time to get my head around it. ‘Even though I have the gene I wouldn’t be scanned until I was 30 and I couldn’t wait that long. ‘After I got the result I think I was traumatised but then I became really focused.’ She added: ‘I’ve grown up with cancer . really. I think it’s harder mentally than I thought it would be but I . couldn’t sit on it, I had to sort myself out.’ Miss Luscombe, who is engaged, was . only  three years old when her mother Brenda was diagnosed with breast . cancer, from which she initially recovered. But it returned 13 years . later in her lymph nodes, liver and bones, and the former classroom . assistant died of liver cancer in 2007 at the age of 48. Memories: Fiona Luscombe's painful experiences watching her grandfather Frank Ross, pictured, and mother Brenda suffer cancer influenced her decision to have both breasts removed . Tragedy: Fiona Luscombe's mother Brenda battled breast cancer which later spread to her lymph nodes, liver and bones. She died aged 48 . Yesterday Miss Luscombe,  from . Plymouth, said: ‘I didn’t understand the full extent of it when I was . younger but when it came back Mum was given six months to live and that . was true to the day. ‘She was very organised. She arranged . her own funeral, and she helped us to get through it. Her dad had . breast cancer as well. Mum had it when she was 32 years old. I’m 23. I . just couldn’t risk it.’ Miss Luscombe discovered she was carrying the . BRCA2 gene in October last year – a year after her 26-year-old sister . Jenny, who has returned from working in Spain to help care for her . sibling, had been told she was not a carrier. Rather than wait until she might be . diagnosed later in life, she said there was ‘never any doubt in her . mind’ about having both breasts removed as a precaution. The operation was carried out  at St . Michael’s Hospital in Hayle, Cornwall, nine weeks ago. She said: ‘It . went really well but it was really daunting. Both breasts were removed . at the same time. They removed all of the tissue and put the implants . in.’ Devastated: Fiona, pictured on holiday in 2009, says the operation had tested her relationship with her finace . She said she had already spoken to her fiancé Chris Warn, a window cleaner, about the operation before she took the test. She said: ‘He was around when my mum died as well and so he knew about my family. He was very supportive.’ Her father, Malcolm Luscombe, 63, retired from his fire officer job when Brenda was diagnosed. He said: ‘I think the hereditary . problem goes back beyond her grandfather. It was a shock when he was . diagnosed and just goes to show men can get it too. ‘It was big decision for Fiona to . have this operation – a big step. I’m proud of her for being brave . enough to go through with it.’ BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that have been shown to play a role in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Those with a strong family history . of some cancers are invited to have more regular screening than people . who don’t seem at increased risk. Scared: Former Liberty X singer Michelle Heaton has recently revealed her experience having a double mastectomy after also being told she has the BRCA2 gene . Supportive: Fiona Luscombe's fiance Chris Warn has backed her decision to have a double mastectomy . A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous. Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations. Most of these gene mutations develop during our lifetime. They . can occur due to substances people come into contact with that cause . cancer. Or they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when . copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells. Most . of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It . usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes, so this is . one of the reasons that cancer is generally more common as people get . older. But it is possible to . be born with a gene fault that may increase the risk of cancer. This . doesn't mean you will definitely get cancer. But it means that you are more likely to develop cancer than the average person. Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'. The . first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes . have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their . lifetime.

"By . George Mair . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 18 January 2012 . The haunting facial cast of mass murderer William Burke, taken shortly before his execution, is to go on display later this month. It will be shown alongside Burke’s skeleton at the University of Edinburgh’s Anatomy Museum as part of an exhibition of medical artefacts. Together with accomplice William Hare, Burke carried out at least 15 murders in the 1820s and sold the bodies for use in anatomy lessons. Exhibit A: Dr Gordon Findlater holds the death mask of mass murderer William Burke, soon to go on public display . Last look: The museum also boasts the death mask of Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered gravity, left, and Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott . When the pair were caught, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he confessed and agreed to testify against his former partner. Burke was sentenced to death by hanging in 1829, and then publicly dissected at the Edinburgh Medical College. The dissecting professor, Alexander Monro, dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote, 'This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head.' Edinburgh University's Museum of Anatomy has now undergone a major revamp, and will open to the public on January 28 – the 183rd  anniversary of Burke’s execution. More than 40 masks, created from casts taken in both life and death, will be on display. Historic faces on show will include Sir Walter Scott, Isaac Newton, Shakespeare and King George III. Such masks were popular in the 19th century, when they were used in  the now-discredited practice of phrenology. This postulated that the shape and size of a person’s skull could help explain their mind and behaviour. Other artefacts at the museum include 19th century anatomical teaching models made from wax and wood, as well as a preserved body from the late 1790s, which is exhibited alongside an etching carried out when the remains were embalmed. Ghoulish: Dr Findlater with William Burke's skeleton, which was previously kept under lock and key . Death mask: This plaster cast of Burke's head will be on display along with preserved corpses and pickled brains . Preserved in plaster: The cast came to light unexpectedly in 2009 after being found in a store cupboard at Inveraray jail in Argyll . Visitors to the museum at the Teviot Medical School, which opened in 1884, will also be able to see the  historic anatomy lecture theatre. Gordon Findlater of the university’s anatomy department said: ‘The museum provides a fascinating insight into how anatomy has progressed from the late 1700s to the present day.’ The Anatomy Museum, in Teviot Place, Edinburgh, will be open to the public on the last Saturday of every month, from 10am-4pm, starting on January 28.

But already the British erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey has become the fastest selling book in French publishing history. The astonishing sales figures - of around 75,000 every day - come after the book was panned by French critics as 'crass pseudo-porn' that reads like a Mills & Boon novel. One high-brow reviewer even wrote: 'It's as close to literature as Whiskas cat food is to gastronomy.' But despite the torrent of critical abuse, the 'mummy porn' bestseller by E.L James has now overtaken the Harry Potter novels as France's favorite book. French high street giant FNAC said copies of the novel had been 'flying of the shelves'. A spokesman for FNAC - which accounts for around a fifth of all book sales in France - said: 'It is amazingly popular. We have never stocked a book that has sold so fast. 'We sold 15,000 copies on the day it was released. In some shops there were just none left.' But the scathing views of of critics from major newspapers and magazines have not matched the huge popularity of France's latest publishing phenomenon. Daily newspaper Le Figaro wrote: 'It has no intellectual construction. It is Fifty Shades of Boredom.' The paper compared the book - first released in the UK in May 2011 - to French classic erotic writing by the Marquis de Sade and Anais Nin's The Story Of O. It added: 'Alongside them, this is soda-masochism 'lite', full of insignificant, consensual and cliched content.' Les Inrocks music magazine said: 'It is exposes the cultural gulf between the Anglo-Saxon hypocrisy and the old authentic sado-masochism of the French.' Author EL James posing with the English version of Fifty Shades Of Grey in San Diego . News magazine L'Express wrote: 'The . female character's multiple orgasms are laughably unbelievable. This . crass, pseudo porn might prove to be a massive boost to the sex toy . industry, but it's got nothing to do with good writing. 'This may be what pleases the British public, who can identify with the character Ana's conflict between her ""conscience"" and her ""inner goddess"", but it remains to be seen if the French will regard the book with anything more than curiosity. 'Some couples may say it has helped their sex lives by reading it, but it's as close to literature as Whiskas cat food is to gastronomy.' And the 20 Minutes news website added: 'It's a load of Mills & Boon-style rubbish.' Meanwhile, the French publisher JC Lattes has already ordered 500,000 copies - one of the biggest print runs of any French publishing house in recent years.

A rare condition meant her blood had run directly back into her mother’s circulatory system. Olivia had haemoglobin levels of three instead of the average 18 . The newborn had such a low count of haemoglobin – the chemical which carries oxygen in red blood cells – that it could not officially be classed as blood. She was given less than two hours to live but survived thanks to emergency transfusions which transformed her skin to pink. Yesterday her mother told of her shock at a condition so unusual that it will be written into medical text books. ‘Olivia was my first baby, so I didn’t really know what to expect – but I certainly didn’t think she’d be that colour,’ said 31-year-old Louise Bearman, a barrister’s clerk from Witham, Essex. Full of life: Olivia Norton was described by doctors as 'white and floppy' when she was born . Intensive care: Olivia was treated with blue light phototherapy for neonatal jaundice. Jaundice is caused when the liver is not mature enough to adequately break down the red blood cells . ‘I’ll never forget what the doctor’s notes said – “white and floppy”.’ Miss Bearman said she and her partner .

The condition is known as a . fetomaternal haemorrhage, with severe cases occurring in one in 5,000 . pregnancies. It can be spontaneous or as a result of trauma. Neonatal nurse Sharon Pilgrim said she . had never heard of such low haemoglobin levels. ‘It was a miracle . Olivia survived. She was incredibly pale and had difficulties . breathing.’ Miss Bearman added: ‘It was amazing . when they put the blood in Olivia and she slowly turned pink. The . hospital staff were amazing.

Social media platforms, including Instagram, which has recently taken over Twitter with daily mobile users reaching more than 7.8 million, have played a massive part in women's insecurities and fashion worries. This pressure has caused a surge in the British female population placing the number of social media ‘likes’ they generate after posting a photo of themselves in an outfit as being more important then a compliment from their partner. In fact, 40 per cent revealed ‘likes’ are the number one influencer on their mood and determines if they have a good Saturday night or not. Females polled from Liverpool say the Facebook Fashion Fear (FFF) sets in from Monday lunchtime with 62 per cent revealing they order their next Saturday night outfit by Tuesday at the latest. Leeds girls are slightly more relaxed with the majority saying they are happy to wait until Thursday before worrying about clothes for the weekend ahead. The ladies from Liverpool, where Coleen Rooney hails from, are the most conscious while the Bristolians like Sophie Anderton are the most laid back . Bristol customers were the most laid back with 81 per cent of Saturday night orders made the day before for next day delivery. AX Paris, who carried out the research, found that customers in Scotland and London say they would wear the same outfit more than once and avoid the FFF by mixing up accessories, with the maximum wear being three times for a party dress. Monica Mistry, marketing manager for AX Paris, said: 'A high proportion of our customers are girls looking for the perfect Saturday night outfit, who want to look fashion forward and fresh in the photos that are shared across the many social media platforms. 'Everything we do nowadays is documented online and in the same way celebrities we admire wouldn't be papped in the same outfit twice, it seems neither would our customers. 'We were also interested in the buying behavior of our customers regionally and the report does confirm certain stereotypes, such as Liverpool ladies taking an exceptional level of care and planning their Saturday night look as early as the Monday before.'","80% females buying new outfit for Saturday nights do so due to fear of being tagged twice in the same clothing .

Findings from US research suggest that doing more walking and gardening could help individuals with high cholesterol as much, if not more, than drugs . Unfit people with high cholesterol levels would be better off gardening or going for a walk than taking pills, says a study. Being physically fit cuts the risk of dying by two thirds compared with couch potatoes who take statins. Researchers found that doing  more exercise could help people with high cholesterol as much, or more, than drugs. However, it also found that combining statins with keeping fit could improve survival rates even further. Many experts claim statins should be offered to all over-50s because everyone could benefit from lower cholesterol, but the ten-year study of 10,000 US veterans found that the very fit were 60-70 per cent less likely to die than unfit people on statins. Professor Peter Kokkinos, who led the research at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington DC, said: ‘The fitness necessary to attain protection that is much the same or greater than that achieved by statin treatment in unfit individuals is  moderate and feasible for many  middle-aged and older adults, through moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking, gardening and gym classes.’ Kokkinos and his colleagues assessed the records of 9,700 men and 343 women from Veterans Affairs hospitals in Washington DC and Palo Alto in California. All had high cholesterol levels or other harmful blood fats and were tested to determine their exercise capacity as least, moderate, fit, or high. The researchers found death rates were lowest among those taking statins and who were fit. The higher the level of fitness the lower the risk of dying during the median follow-up period of ten years. The fittest participants, regardless of whether they were taking statins, had a 60-70 per cent lower risk of death. The difference could not be explained by age, body mass, ethnicity, sex, history and risk factors of cardiovascular disease and medications, said the study published online in The Lancet. The fittest participants, regardless of whether they were taking statins, had a significantly lower risk of death of around 60-70 per cent . Professor Kokkinos said: ‘Treatment . with statins is important, but better fitness improves survival . significantly and is a valuable additional treatment or an alternative . when statins cannot be taken.’ Pedro Hallal, of the Federal . University of Pelotas in Brazil, and I-Min Lee of Harvard Medical . School, also writing in The Lancet, said that prescribing physical . activity should be put on a par with drug prescription. They said: ‘The cost of becoming . physically active is lower than that of buying drugs and . moderate-intensity physical activity has fewer side effects.’ Side . effects linked to statins include muscle pain, which can be disabling in . some patients, memory loss, depression, sexual difficulties and . depression. Malcolm Kendrick, a GP, author of The . Great Cholesterol Con and a sceptic of giving statins to people with a . low risk of heart problems, said a recent Austrian study showed that . athletes who wanted to compete could not stay on statins. ‘They often . find they can’t take effective exercise because the statins are harming . their muscles and exercise capacity,’ he said. Natasha Stewart, senior cardiac nurse . at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Statins and exercise can help . combat high blood cholesterol levels and look after your heart. ‘However, this research shows that . the two together can provide a winning combination to further improve . your heart health, with higher intensity exercise possibly offering more . protection.’","Being physically fit reduces the risk of dying by two-thirds, US research says .

Georgie Smith claims she feared for her life after managing to swallow her toothbrush whole . According to The Sun, the 19-year-old from Brighton felt the tooth brush slipping down her throat but couldn't do much to stop it. It was reported that Miss Smith, a student at Guildford University, has no gag reflex. ‘I thought I was going to choke to death and was stunned when I [realised] it wasn’t stuck in my throat and I could breathe,’ she told the Sun. Doctors allegedly told the teen that there was nothing they could do, and she should just wait for ‘nature to take care of things’. I thought I was going to choke to death and was stunned when I realised it wasn't stuck in my throat and I could breathe,' she said . ‘Nobody knows where it is as X-rays don’t show plastic. It could be dissolving in my intestines or may already have passed through,’ she continued. And it seems that toothbrushes may not as innocuous as we thought. According to the latest statistics from the Home Accident Surveillance System, there were 20 toothbrush-related accidents in the past year. Earlier this year there were reports of an Israeli women having a toothbrush removed from her stomach. Bat-El Panker accidentally swallowed the toothbrush while leaning over the tap as she cleaned her teeth and it slipped down her throat. But when she first went to the hospital to have the toothbrush removed doctors didn't believe her as nothing showed up on X-ray or ultrasound scans. It was eventually discovered in a CT scan and removed by using endoscopic equipment. Her doctor Dr. Uri Segel, who removed the toothbrush, said at the time: ‘The lesson learned from this incident is that with all the technology and all our experience, doctors have to listen to the patients.’ And a New Zealand teenager suffered a similar fate while brushing her teeth and running up the stairs. She tripped and fell, pushing it down into her mouth. Her younger brother came to help stop her from choking but the gag reflex caused her to swallow the toothbrush whole before it could be pulled out.","Georgie Smith claims she managed to swallow her toothbrush whole as she has no gag reflex .

Jack Weston struck teacher Ben Staunton twice in the head after a scuffle broke out during a heated local derby. Despite being in agony after the second blow, which he described as having a ‘ten out of ten’ force, Mr Staunton, 34, continued playing until the end of the game. Violence flares: Jack Weston (left) punches Ben Staunton in attack that left the 34-year-old teacher with a broken jaw during a match between Keynsham RFC and Oldfield Old Boys in Bath . Melee: Mr Staunton (pictured centre in the scrum cap) became involved in a scuffle after reacting angrily when he was tackled dangerously (Weston not pictured). Weston joined the fracas shortly afterwards . Only later was he found to have a broken jaw. On Monday Weston, 24, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and was jailed for six months at Bristol Crown Court. The players’ brawl happened as . Weston’s team Keynsham RFC took on rivals Oldfield Old Boys at their . Bath ground in a bad-tempered clash in November in the Bath Combination . Cup. Amy Jones, prosecuting, told the court . that it had been a ‘hotly contested’ match in which there were a number . of off-the-ball incidents. Surrounded: One player had his hand around Mr Staunton's face as the fracas ensued (Weston not pictured) Around 25 minutes into the second . half, violence flared when a penalty kick was awarded after an illegal . tackle on Oldfield substitute Mr Staunton, a teacher at Beechen Cliff . Boys’ School in Bath. Mr Staunton, who had been tackled in the air as he caught the ball, ‘reacted angrily’ and pushed a player away. He was quickly surrounded by four . opponents, one of whom he claimed had a hand around his face and another . who was ‘gouging’ his eye. Weston then ran into the fracas and . punched Mr Staunton twice in the face – the first described as ‘six out . of ten’ in force and the second a ‘full ten out of ten’. Brutal: Weston was jailed for six months after admitting grievous bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court . ‘Almost immediately I felt my teeth stinging,’ the teacher said in a statement read in court. ‘I remember looking at Mr Weston and he had taken a step backwards, he looked ready to go again.’ Weston was sent off by the referee and . Mr Staunton – who played in a second row position – received a warning . yellow card. Immediately after the incident a physio examined Mr . Staunton but found no fracture and allowed him to play on. Following the game, however, the . teacher’s pain worsened, forcing him to visit Royal United Hospital in . Bath where the court heard that an X-ray confirmed his jaw was broken. Andrew Banks, defending, said: ‘Mr . Weston has always said it was something that occurred in the heat of the . moment. It is something he bitterly regrets.’ He told the court how Weston, of . Bedminster, Bristol, apologised to the referee after the game but was . unable to find Mr Staunton to apologise in person. Mr Banks added that his client believed he had grabbed the player and punched him only once. Following the judge’s call for clarification, however, it was accepted that the referee saw two punches. Jailing Weston, Judge Carol Hagen told him: ‘I have no doubt you will never re-offend.’ Keynsham’s Paul Cooper, who was also . sent off during the match, was last month banned from playing for seven . weeks after being found guilty of making contact with the area around Mr .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:52 EST, 9 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:19 EST, 9 March 2012 . A couple is suing a health center for 'wrongful birth' after a prenatal test intended to pick up whether a foetus has Down syndrome failed - and their daughter was born with the condition. Ariel and Deborah Levy, from Portland, Oregon, who have two other children, said in a lawsuit they would have aborted their daughter Kalanit - who is now four - if they had known. They are suing Legacy Health in North Portland, which they claim conducted a botched test, for $3 million - the amount they believe they will have to pay over Kalanit's lifetime for her care. Happy: Kalanit Levy, pictured with her brothers, was born with Down Syndrome after a botched prenatal test failed to spot the condition. Her parents are now suing for the costs of her extra care . Following a nine-day trial in Portland, jurors are now deliberating over a case that could have far-reaching - and questionable - implications for children born with with conditions such as Down's. There are fewer than 10 'wrongful birth' cases in the U.S. every year as prenatal tests are 99.7 per cent accurate - and few parents want to face a legal challenge if they do fail, the Oregonian reported. Yet experts believe there could be a boom in the lawsuits as women in their late 30s and 40s are increasingly having babies and relying on genetic screenings to signal problems, the paper added. Civil engineer Ariel and . dental hygienist Deborah, who say they love Kalanit and intend to give her the same opportunities they have given their sons, were stunned when hospital staff told them she appeared to have Down's. Deborah Levy, 39, told doctors she had taken a test - a chorionic villus sampling, or CVS for short - before the birth and that the results had showed their child would be normal. 'We were told we had nothing to worry about,' Ariel Levy told jurors. Parents: Ariel, left, and Deborah Levy, right, claim they have received death threats for their comments . Sued: The Levys are suing Legacy Health for $3 million as they believe staff botched their prenatal test . But days after Kalanit was born, her mother was taking her to the doctor 'to show her off' and he delivered the blow - a blood test confirmed the baby had Down's. 'It was devastating,' Mrs Levy said. The couple's attorney David . K. Miller claimed in the case that Dr. Thomas Jenkins removed tissue in . the womb from Mrs Levy, rather than from the baby, when he carried out . the procedure at the clinic. The suit points the blame at the doctor . and lab workers who did not realise they were testing maternal tissue, . the Oregonian reported. Tests carried out before a baby is born to determine whether they have any genetic disorders is called chorionic villus sampling, or CVS for short. It usually takes place between the 10th and 12th week of a pregnancy,. The test is not given to every expectant mother, but some factors give rise to it. It is carried out if a woman has abnormal screen results in the first trimester of her pregnancy, or if there is a family history of genetic disorders or chromosome abnormalities. Women over the age of 35 are also encouraged to have the test, as there is an increased risk of Down syndrome. It involves taking tissue from the foetus while in the womb and screening this sample for abnormalities. It also suggests that two later ultrasounds carried out by Legacy showed traits of the syndrome, yet staff failed to recognise these, and assured Mrs Levy her baby would be born normal and healthy. Yet the attorneys for the defense claim Jenkins and the staff followed correct procedures. He suggested the problem was that the girl has mosaic Down syndrome. Whereas most people with the condition have cells containing an extra 21st chromosome, a significant number of Kalanit's cells did not, Jenkins said. Nearly 31 per cent were normal. Yet Miller countered that obviously 100 per cent of the cells taken in the CVS test were normal - as they had wrongly been taken from the mother. He added that tests carried out after Kalanit was born show there is less than one or two per cent normal cells. Reports have previously quoted the lawsuit as demanding as much as $14 million to cover the cost of the young girl's care. The couple has already whipped up a frenzy of . hate and abuse for their comments over aborting their beloved daughter. Miller said they have received death threats, the Oregonian reported. The couple met in preschool, attended the same high school and college and married in 2000. Civil engineer Ariel and . dental hygienist Deborah, both 39, are orthodox Jewish, according to Facebook. Their sons are in third grade and . kindergarten. The boys, shown hugging their younger sister tightly in . photographs, are bright - one has placed in the 99th percentile on . standardised tests. Legal team: Robert Keating (L) said Kalanit has . mosaic Down's, so fewer cells contain the chromosome associated . with the syndrome. David Miller (R) said the clinic took tissue from the . mother, not the fetus . Decisions: Judge Karin Immergut is presiding over the case, which is being deliberated by a jury on Friday . The third pregnancy, when Mrs Levy was 34, was a 'surprise', according to the Oregon paper. Due to her age, the couple was vigilant about testing, undergoing the CVS at 13 weeks. It is believed one in 250 women at that age give birth to a child with Down syndrome. Studies suggest that more than 89 per cent of women choose to abort a fetus with Down syndrome. After their daughter was born with the syndrome, the Levys expressed their fears over her future, including medical and social issues, and whether she would get the required educational support. Experts have told them she will probably not be able to live on her own or support herself, the Oregonian reported. It is estimated she will live until her mid-50s. She is able to speak in two-word sentences which only her parents and a few others understand, according to the Oregonian. Yet the Levys say Karen Gaffney, who has Down syndrome and earned a Portland Community College degree, is a role model for their child.","A prenatal test showed couple's daughter would be 'normal and healthy'

The Alzheimer's Society, which funded the research, said the use of drugs already available could be a cheaper and quicker way of tackling dementia . Everyday medicines could be used in the battle against dementia as developing new drugs is too costly and slow. Experts believe antibiotics, acne pills and other routine treatments already in bathroom cabinets could double as dementia drugs. They said it is time to re-examine medicines already in circulation as cheaper, quicker alternatives to new treatments. Many have multiple effects on the body, so some could be able to ease the effects of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia which affect 800,000 people in Britain. There are only four Alzheimer’s drugs in use which can help relieve symptoms but do nothing to stop damage to the brain. Professor Clive Ballard said: ‘Defeating dementia is one of the biggest challenges facing both  medicine and society as a whole. ‘Developing new drugs is incredibly important but it comes with a huge price tag and, for those affected by dementia, an unimaginable wait.’ Everyday drugs will have passed multiple tiers of expensive safety tests and so could be prescribed for dementia in five to ten years. It can take up to 20 years and £600million to create a drug from scratch. Hopes of quickly adding to available treatments were recently dashed when several promising new ones failed the final stage of testing. So Mr Ballard, professor of age-related diseases at King’s College London, and other experts turned to the possibility of using everyday drugs. Experts believe antibiotics, acne pills and other routine treatments already in bathroom cabinets could double as dementia drugs . They drew up a short-list published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. One of the most promising is liraglutide, a diabetes treatment that also acts on the brain. Others include minocycline, an antibiotic for acne, and acitretin, which treats the skin condition  psoriasis. There is also a family of blood pressure drugs called calcium channel blockers. Some of these medicines cost less than 50p a tablet. Rebecca Wood, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘The idea that drugs for other conditions could fight Alzheimer’s is appealing. ‘But it’s not yet clear that such a drug exists. Alzheimer’s is a complex disease with many risk factors.’ The drugs or classes of drugs identified as potential treatments are: . High blood pressure medications including Nilvadipine, from the calcium channel blockers family. Diabetes medications exenatide and liraglutide, which have been shown to stimulate the brain. Minocycline, an antibiotic used to treat acne. Acitretin, a drug used to treat psoriasis which researchers found modifies the way proteins linked to dementia form.","Alzheimer’s Society said using drugs already available could be cheaper .

The Formula One car in which Ayrton Senna made his breakthrough is expected to fetch £750,000 when it goes under the hammer. The motorsport icon - whose life was recently immortalised for a new generation with the award-winning film documentary called Senna - made his F1 debut in 1984 season, in which he drove this 650bhp Toleman TG184-2 car. And it was the first car to showcase the tragic Brazilian’s extraordinary talent on the big stage, when he finished second in a legendary rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix. Legend: Collectors are expected to flock to the auction of the first ever Formula One car raced by Ayrton Senna . Skills: Senna made his F1 debut in 1984 season, driving this Toleman TG184-2 race car, in which he finished to second in a rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix . In control: Ayrton Senna became a legend for his wet weather abilities, seen here in action during the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix in Monte Carlo . Senna qualified for the race in a lowly 13th, lagging 2.34 seconds behind his future nemesis Alain Prost on pole. But despite his low starting place and difficult conditions, Senna, then 24, raced through the grid and finished second thanks to a number of ‘magnificent’ manoeuvres. Murray Walker, commenting at the time for the BBC, described Senna’s race in the Toleman car as ‘sensational’. The . awful weather led to the race - which was the sixth of the season - . being cancelled after 31 laps with racers collecting half points. Prost was victorious, but had the race been allowed to continue Senna would have stormed past him within a few laps. Tragedy: Senna's astonishing career was cut short when he was killed in a crash in 1994 during the San Marino Grand Prix. His death sparked major safety improvements to cars which had offered little protection . The brave performance launched the rookie South American on to the big stage with one commentator confidently saying he would go on to be a future world champion. He finished his debut season in ninth position with the Toleman helping him to 13 points. Senna went on to win the F1 world championship three times but was tragically killed in 1994 during the San Marino Grand Prix. His first had a tiny 1.5-litre engine but was fitted with a huge turbo to give it a staggering 650bhp. It has been owned by a private syndicate for 16 years and underwent a full restoration in 2009 and is perfect for historic racing and track days. It will be sold at The Spring Sale hosted by Silverstone Auctions on May 16 - and is expected to fetch around £750,000. Silverstone Auctions has been described the F1 car as ‘the stuff of legends’ and a ‘truly unique piece of automotive history’. Nick Whale, managing director, Silverstone Auctions, said: ‘We are thrilled to bring this iconic race car to auction as it’s undoubtedly one of the most important lots we’ve ever offered. Cutting edge: Under the skin, the Toleman Formula One car raced by Ayrton Senna was state-of-the-art in 1984 . Power: The car has a relatively small a 1.5-litre engine but was boosted to a staggering 650bhp with the aid of a huge turbo charger . Down force: The Toleman TG184-2 race car has two rear spoilers to help force the rear wheels into the track as they put down around 650bhp . ‘Senna mania is reaching fever pitch and rightly so as he’s considered by many as the greatest F1 driver we’ve ever seen. ‘It goes without saying that this will be one of the star attractions at the sale as it’s a very rare chance to own a much sought after piece of motorsport and Ayrton Senna history.’ Keith Collantine, editor of leading motorsport website F1Fanatic.co.uk, added: ‘The images of him sliding the Toleman around Monaco, churning plumes of spray from its tyres as he hunted down race leader Alain Prost, are a part of F1 folklore. ‘Almost 30 years later, it looks a crude beast by modern standards but in Senna’s hands it was capable of tremendous things.’ During a career tragically cut short, Senna displayed an unsurpassed talent for racing. The Brazilian scored the most consecutive pole positions, eight in one single purple patch between 1988 Spanish Grand Prix until the 1989 United States Grand Prix. Senna also won the most poles at the same Grand Prix: eight at the San Marino Grand Prix between 1985 and 1991 and again in 1994. Another amazing statistic shows Senna's relentless consistency, scoring the most consecutive starts from front row: 24 between the 1988 German Grand Prix and the 1989 Australian Grand Prix. And to underline the three-times world champion's dominance, he also holds the record for the most races lead from start to finish, with 19 in total.","Motor racing enthusiasts expected to enter bidding frenzy for chance to own Brazilian legend's first F1 car .

Paula Deen, the queen of Southern cuisine, and her brother Bubba Hiers have been accused of sexual harassment and racism in an explosive lawsuit filed by a former employee. Lisa Jackson, the former general manager for the siblings' co-owned restaurant, Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, has claimed the conditions were intolerable. She claimed that Bubba brought 'inescapable pornography' to the workplace, cracked sexist jokes and told Lisa to bring in photos of herself when she was younger, telling her 'you've got nice legs'. Sued: TV chef Paula Deen (left) and her brother Bubba Hiers (right) have been accused of sexual harassment and racism in a lawsuit filed by a former employee of their co-owned restaurant . Jackson, who worked at the restaurant between 2005 and 2010, also accuses the duo of racism, and cites examples of their use of the term n*****. In one, she explains Deen appointed her to handle the catering and staff for Bubba's 2007 wedding and she asked Deen what the servers should wear. 'Well what I would really like is a bunch of little n******s to wear long-sleeve white shirts, black shorts and black bow ties,' Jackson claimed Deen said, according to RadarOnline.com. She continued: 'You know in the Shirley Temple days, they used to tap dance around. 'Now, that would be a true Southern wedding wouldn't it? But we can't do that because the media would be on me about that.' Scene: Jackson worked at the restaurant, pictured, in Savannah, Georgia between 2005 and 2010 . In another example, the lawsuit writes that in front of several employees, Bubba said 'they should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it'. In a third example of racism, the suit claims that black employees had to use a restroom at the back of the restaurant, while white employees could share the customer restroom. Jackson joined the restaurant after the previous general manager, who was male, was fired for having sexual relations with the servers. Deen allegedly said in a meeting: 'If . you think I have worked this hard to lose everything because of a piece . of p****y, you better think again. 'And now I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job.' Family: Bubba allegedly made repeated sexual jokes in front of co-workers. Both are accused of racist remarks . Although Jackson excelled in the job - . doubling profits - she claims the working environment was fraught with . sexism, and complained that Bubba would regularly watch porn in their . shared office. Former employee Lisa Jackson claims that Bubba Hiers and Paula Deen made a number of sexist and racist remarks. They include: .

Bubba: 'They should send President Obama to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico so he could n******-rig it' Paula: 'I'm going to do something I have never done - I am going to put a woman in a man's job' Bubba: (telling Jackson to bring in photographs of herself) 'You have nice legs' 'Bubba Hiers is a frequent customer of pornography web sites and would download and view such sites at work. In the small office he shared with Jackson, it was impossible for her to avoid the pornography,' the lawsuit states, according to RadarOnline.com. At a weekly manager's meeting, Bubba allegedly took along a paper copy of an email entitled 'Why gay marriage should be legal'. It showed pictures of women having sex with women, and was passed around the table. 'No outrage was expressed and no action was taken in response to his behavior,' the suit states. As well as the sexist comments, which the suit notes were directed at more than one employee, Jackson claims there were other sickening goings-on at the restaurant. She claims Bubba told her that two women . at the restaurant were 'fat girls' who shouldn't be wearing skirts, and . he allegedly kissed her and spat on her, TMZ reported. Empire: Deen recently came under fire for not disclosing she was diagnosed with diabetes three years ago . Jackson eventually quit in 2010 because of the conditions and is suing for unspecified damages. She claims that her complaint of sexual harassment and other concerns fell on deaf ears. It will come as more bad news for Paula Deen, who recently came under fire for revealing she has had Type 2 diabetes - a condition associated with diet - for three years. Fellow chefs lambasted her decision to keep the diagnosis quiet, claiming that Deen, whose dishes are often deep-fried or coated in butter, had a responsibility to tell the truth about the potential effects of her recipes.","Ex-restaurant worker claims workplace was fraught with sexism and racism .

Affair: Married police officer David McCann reportedly had sex with his mistress 36 times while on duty . A veteran police officer has been suspended after reportedly having sex with his 'booty call' mistress 36 times while he was on duty. Melissa Kingfield claimed she had regular liaisons with married David McCann as his 'dinner break booty call' and even recorded all their trysts in a personal journal. McCann, 42, a veteran officer with Sunrise Police Department, Broward, Florida, has since been suspended for 200 hours after Kingfield, 30, gave her detailed sex spreadsheet to police. Her diary reveals how the pair shared 'nooner sex' (sex at midday), as well as 'quality time/sex' while McCann was on duty. The pair are said to have met in April 2009, according to an investigator's report, but their romance ended last summer. According . to the Sun Sentinel, Lt William Glennon, an Internal Affairs . investigator, said McCann 'used his position as a police officer ... to . calculatingly and stealthily have a consensual affair with Melissa . Kingfield while on duty.' In a statement made last summer, Kingfield is said to have told Glennon: 'I was dinner break booty call.' She told the Sun Sentinel: ''I felt . like I was blinded by my love for him and I trusted all his excuses. I . felt like I was really taken advantage of. 'I felt conned, manipulated, used. And for what purpose, I may never know.' McCann and Kingfield had a two-year affair lasting from May 2009 until June last year, according to her sex spreadsheet. Sex spreadsheet: Kingfield provided detailed references of all her sexual encounters with McCann . The pair are said to have met at a crime watch meeting in April 2009, where McCann told Kingfield he was having marital problems. Just days after they met, McCann is said to have told Kingfield she was 'perfect and everything he had been searching for his whole life'. The last entry in her journal reads: 'Hugging — No sex still on a break/He says next time we're together we'll have a baby.' The officer, who has worked for Sunrise Police for 13 years, has since insisted he did not have sex with Kingfield while he was working. Investigation: Officials are now looking into the claims that Sunrise Police officer McCann had sex with his mistress while on duty . McCann has since said he 'totally cut off' Kingfield by changing his phone number and blocking her emails. Investigator Mr Glennon cross-referenced her diary against McCann's time card to confirm whether the liaisons happened while he was on duty. However, her account has been dismissed byUnion attorney Robert Buschel as the work of a 'scorned woman intent on revenge.' Buschel told the Sun Sentinel: 'She is a scorned woman and this is a campaign to punish him. 'What kind of woman keeps track of her sexual activities and then turns it in to get a guy in trouble?' Kingfield revealed the affair ended up being a 'nightmare' for her, adding that since their relationship finished 'just the sight of a police car makes me sick and scared'.","David McCann suspended for 200 hours after claims by mistress .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 07:59 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:39 EST, 8 November 2012 . As the first blind person to reach the South Pole on foot, Mark Pollock knows a great deal about overcoming adversity. But when he lost the use of his legs following a freak accident in 2010, even he wasn't sure he could come back from the brink a second time. 'I didn’t get out of bed for six months,' the adventurer told MailOnline. 'And after that I didn't do any exercise in just over a year. I was in a pretty dark place. I wasn't sure I could bounce back.' Back on his feet: Mark (pictured in his wheelchair, left) gets to grip with walking in the Ekso suit (right). He was tethered at first to prevent falls . Yet just a year later he is taking 2,500 steps a day after becoming the first person in the world to own a £100,000 bionic suit. The . robotic legs wrap around Mark's lower limbs and contain electric motors . that power walking. Sensors in the feet detect when he shifts his . weight and sends this information to software held in a backpack, which . then activates the legs. A pair of crutches completes the ensemble, . which help him to balance. Mark, from County Down in Northern Ireland, says the impact of the new technology on his self-esteem has been dramatic. 'When I stand I feel normal again, like I used to feel,' he said. 'Psychologically . I . feel so much better after I’ve been walking in the suit. Plus I can hug . my fiance on her level which is really important,' he said. Mark was paralysed from the ribs down two years ago after falling out of a second-storey window. The accident left him 'in a pretty dark place' for 18 months, before the determination that spurred him to travel around the world and to win two rowing medals at the Commonwealth Games reasserted itself. 'I thought the world had ended went I was blind at 22,' he said. 'But I set myself goals. First I reached my . bedroom door, then the Gobi desert, then the South Pole. ‘I find if I set big and exciting goals it means I won’t focus on . hardships. I also don’t want to let down my . supporters down.' It was thanks to fundraising by his supporters that he was able to purchase his own EKSO robotic suit, after discovering the innovative company at the start of 2012. He travelled to San Francisco where he stood and took a few steps for the first time since his fall. 'It felt like getting up after a long-haul flight,' he said. 'The muscles were very tight.' Mark was the first blind person to reach the South Pole in 2009 (left), he is now using an exoskeleton every day to see if it could improve the help of paralysed patients . He is now taking part in a six-month clinical trial at Trinity College in Dublin to see how walking in the suit affects the health of wheelchair-bound patients, but noted his 'heart and lung function' had already improved. 'I think it's bad for you to be sitting all the time,’ he added. 'All your organs, everything inside you is compressed when you're sitting. That puts pressure on certain organs and can cause heart, bladder, kidney and blood flow issues.' Mr Pollock believes that a combination of training, robotics and medical intervention, will one day return the use of his legs. 'You have to accept where you are. I am in a wheelchair. But the . exciting bit is the hope that something might change and that I can be . part of the solution,' he said. 'I want to see if it's possible to fix myself from the outside in. If it doesn’t work for me I hope it will one day help other . people.’ The Ekso suit (right) can be worn by patients whose lower limbs are paralysed but who have the strength to  transfer themselves to and from a wheelchair. It weighs 23kg with batteries but  'feels like a backpack' according to Ekso's Barry Richards, because the weight is transferred through the frame to the floor. The two high-powered lithium batteries can be detached and charged at the mains in an hour. Motors are located at the hips and knees. Sensors in the feet detect any weight shifting. Software held in the backpack uses algorithms to translate this into movement. A hand held computer is used to adjust the gait, including step height, speed of stride and stride length. The device costs £100,000 and the service charge is £6,000 a year. In the UK there are six 'ambassadors' who use an Ekso suit regularly, and around 60 people have tested it in hospitals. There are three stages of training: . 1) The therapist sets the step length and speed and operate the buttons to move the legs when they see the patient shifting their weight. 2) The patient triggers the steps via buttons on the crutches, while shifting their weight while the physio acts as a spotter. 3) The patient operates the legs solely by shifting their weight. Currently a physiotherapist needs to be on hand while the suit is in use for safety reasons. The company hopes to have a device that can be used without supervision at home by 2014. Barry Richards, clinical specialist physiotherapist at EKSO, certainly believes in Mr Pollock's potential. 'Mark is a unique character, nothing will stop him,' he said. Mr Pollock certainly isn't remaining idle. He is also organising a 10-day trip to Siberia using a especially-customised hand bike. His charitable trust is also running simultaneous night-time running events in London, New York and Ireland to fund his continued rehabilitation and help other disability charities. And while he won't be taking part this time, Mr Pollock won't rule out joining the participants on the starting line in the future. ‘I am exploring the boundaries of what is possible. My desire is to run again,’ he said. Today is the last day you can sign up for the event on November 14.

At school, Zena Williams was called 'cancer face' for wearing a wig to hide her bald patches. And for over two decades she has allowed everyone to believe she has alopecia, the auto immune condition that causes hair to fall out on its own. But now, in the wake of National No Pulling Week, the 32-year-old mother-of-one from Ipswich has bravely revealed she has been pulling out her own hair since she was a child, the result of a little-understood psychological condition called trichotillomania. Zena Williams, aged 11, when she first began pulling out her hair and was left with a bald patch, left, and wearing the wig her mother bought her to stop the school bullies, right. Bald areas of Zena's scalp that won't ever grow back because of the pulling. Tormented by the condition since she was a child, Zena has, at various stages in her life, been left almost completely bald. When, age 11, having removed most of her hair over the course of a single summer, she returned to school wearing a wig, cruel classmates soon subjected her to relentless bullying. But still Zena refused to reveal the truth about her condition, believing no one would be sympathetic to the compulsion which has blighted her life ever since. Zena Williams is now 32 but there are some sections of her hair that will never grow back. She said: 'Hair pulling has been at the root of all my problems throughout my life. It's made me depressed and turned me into a recluse. 'It's made me very antisocial and I can't hold down a relationship. I just want what everyone else has, to have a job and a partner and normal things but I feel trapped in my own head.' Zena's trichotillomania (TTM) began one day at age 11 when, during a class at school, she says she went into 'a kind of trance' and when she looked down at her exercise book, it was covered in handfuls of hair. Zena - pictured, left, with her daughter Amy, six - says her secret obsession has got in the way of her enjoying a normal life. Zena Williams with her daughter Amy and, from left to right, her brothers Chris and Matt Dunnett. She said: 'I didn’t even realise I'd been doing it but I remember that day specifically because I was shocked at the amount of hair that I had pulled out. 'After that, I did it all the time. The summer came and I was pulling every day until I had a huge bald patch on the top of my head. 'I hid it from my mother under a baseball cap but eventually she spotted it and she took me to a doctor who said I had alopecia. 'I thought, ""Okay, I have alopecia. That's what I will tell people"", even though I knew I was doing it to myself I let everyone believe that was the case. Alopecia was a real thing and it was accepted.' Zena, aged 11, when the pulling began, left, and in happier times when the condition was less severe, right. By the end of that summer Zena had barely any hair left on my head. Due to start secondary school, she was terrified she would be bullied for being bald. 'In the end my mother went out and spent her last £50 on a hairpiece for me,' she said. 'It was all she could afford and it fooled no one. 'But instead of being bullied for being bald, I was tormented for wearing a wig.' Zena's early school days were filled with a barrage of abuse from her fellow students for her lack of hair. They questioned why she needed a wig and soon a rumour spread around her school that she had lost her hair through cancer treatment. Before long, Zena became introverted and isolated by the constant jibes. Zena, left, having just given birth to Amy, and right, using a clip to hide the fact she was wearing a wig. Zena, who has a six-year-old daughter, Amy, said: 'I was mortified about going to school wearing a wig but I didn’t want anyone to see what was underneath. 'People would point out that my hair didn’t look real and I tried to shy away from their comments. 'A couple of girls started bringing a camera to school in order to take pictures of me while I was sat in the playground. 'The cancer rumour started around the same time and I remember being cornered while a group of them taunted me, calling me ""cancer face"". It was horrible.' The bullying continued until Zena left school but still she could not resist the impulse to pull out her hair. Eventually, she managed to grow an inch of hair all over her head and gave up her wig. But in resisting to pull, she found herself self-harming with scissors, knives and compasses. Zena Williams and her friend Zoe Chenery who has helped her through tough times. Zena said: 'I blocked out a lot of that time in my life because it hurts too much to remember it. 'By the time I left school I had made a really good friend and she helped me through things.' At 18, Zena began a business administration course and moved out of the family home to live with a boyfriend. But while on the surface she seemed happier, Zena was still battling with her secret obsession. Zena said the hair-pulling would worsen whenever she felt depressed or upset and sometimes she would be left with such massive bald patches she would be forced to wear hairpieces again. Zena enjoying life when the trichotillomania was less severe. She said: 'I always made sure I never plucked from the front of my head so I could wear a wig and then clip the fringe over it to make it look like I had a natural hairline. 'When I split up with my boyfriend it got so much worse and I would have to hide it from everyone. 'The only time I've ever managed to stop pulling was when I was pregnant. I felt so ill throughout the pregnancy I literally didn't have the time to think about it. 'When my daughter was born was the only time since I was 11 when I've had a full head of hair.' Two years ago Zena stumbled across a video on Youtube made by a young girl with TTM, and was shocked to discover that her compulsion had a name. Until that time she had never dared tell anyone about her secret shame, and until today has only shared her condition with her closest friends. She said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw this video made by a girl who had trichotillomania. 'My condition was a real thing with a name and I just burst into tears to discover there were others out there like me. 'Until that point I had always believed it was this disgusting thing that only I did and that no one could ever possibly understand.' Zena previously worked as a care worker, but has been unable to work for the last eight years due to her anxiety and depression issues. Now her hair-pulling has improved, and for the last two years she has avoided pulling from the hair on her head. However, years of yanking out her hair have damaged the follicles in her scalp, and Zena has been left with large bald patches which are unlikely to grow back. Asa result, Zena dyes her hair and scalp black to hide the thinning areas and always wears her hair scraped back to cover up the worst areas. She is currently on a long waiting list to receive cognitive behavioural therapy, which she believes will help her problems. Zena said: 'Now I only pull from the hair on my arms and legs. It relieves the tension but it doesn't give me the same satisfaction. 'Whenever I tell people about my TTM they always say, ""Well, just stop doing it"", but it’s an urge I have no control over. 'I find myself doing it more when I'm stressed and when I'm sat watching TV I find it's best to keep my hands busy as I often don't realise I'm doing it until they are filled with clumps of hair.' TOWIE star Sam Faiers revealed she lost her eyelashes to TTM. Sam Faiers, from The Only Way Is Essex, recently revealed that she lost her eyelashes due to TTM, and it is thought that around four per cent of the population will experience compulsive hair pulling at some point in their lives. Women seem more prone than males, with pulling usually starting around age 12, but it can start later in life too. Zena has found some support through social networking groups and says that simply knowing there are other sufferers out there has given her a great deal of comfort. But she hopes to finally rid herself of the condition for the sake of her daughter. She said: 'I have always been very careful not to do it in front of Amy, but I would hate it if she ever thought it was normal. 'I can never take her swimming because I’m terrified of getting my hair wet and showing my bald patches. 'I would love nothing more than to feel beautiful, have a relationship and give her the family life she deserves - but up until now TTM has held me back. 'Hopefully, if I get some treatment, that will finally change.'

The new breast-checking glove is said to be as effective as traditional breast cancer screening in detecting lumps . Women are being warned not to rely on a £25 glove claimed to be as effective as a mammogram at detecting signs of breast cancer. The manufacturers of the BE gLOVE say it makes detecting lumps much easier during self-examination because it increases finger sensitivity. But breast cancer charities are telling women not to put their faith in the product, saying evidence of its effectiveness is limited. The warning comes only weeks after an advertising watchdog criticised an £86 ‘breast torch’ that manufacturers said could act as an ‘early breast-screening device’. The glove is being publicised in the UK after clinical tests in Italy showed it allowed women to detect the same number of lumps as a mammogram. Its manufacturer, IC Pharma, says the ultra-thin polyurethane glove magnifies finger sensitivity 15 times, making it easier for women to feel hard areas in their breasts. But Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast  Cancer Campaign, said: ‘Evidence that devices of this nature can improve detection of breast tumours is very limited, so we urge women not to use tools such as the BE gLOVE as a substitute for mammograms or for being breast-aware. ‘We encourage all women to check their breasts regularly, know what is normal for them and discuss any concerns with their GP.’ Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It is important that women are not misled when it comes to checking their breasts. We do not advocate the use of these gloves and we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these. The best way for women to be breast- aware is to know their own breasts.’ The BE gLOVE is said to work by reducing friction on the skin, stopping lumps being pushed away by the fingers. A clinical study by Professor  Stafano Varardi, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the University of Rome, compared women doing self-examinations with their bare hands with those using the glove. The company behind the glove says it could help the millions of UK women who have no idea how to perform breast self-examination . Those given the glove detected the . same number of lumps as were identified by mammography, according to IC . Pharma. Women using their bare hands found only 50 per cent of the lumps . revealed by breast screening. Official guidelines advise women to . carry out breast self-examinations each month, but a survey by IC Pharma . showed most check themselves only two to three times a year, and 55 per . cent did not know the right way to look for lumps. Company spokesman Karen Winterhalter said: ‘At the age when women should include breast self-examinations as an essential part of their routine in taking care of their health, it is staggering to see that 55 per cent do not know what they are doing. ‘Whilst we know that nine out of ten lumps found in the breast are not cancerous, it is extremely important for women to check their breasts regularly, so it becomes part of their routine.’ Last month the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that marketing of the Breastlight torch device was ‘misleading’ and ‘irresponsible’.

A brave two-year-old girl who battled with multiple tumours all over her body is to enjoy her first real family Christmas at home. Lily Atkinson, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with the cancer neuroblastoma a week before her first birthday in June 2011. After having the primary tumour removed from her chest, Lily underwent chemotherapy treatment which destroyed nine others and doctors are hoping the last one, on her skull, which is already shrinking, will eventually disappear. First Christmas at home: Lily Atkinson (left) with her mother Angela, father Anthony and sister Grace . Her mother Angela, a learning consultant, 41, said she and husband Jonathan were shocked when the they heard the news. She . said: 'We were devastated - I felt numb when I found out. We weren't . expecting it and when we discovered it was 11 tumours we were shocked.' Despite being home on Christmas Eve last year Lily Atkinson could not see any extended family as her immune system was too weak. Excited: Lily can't wait to spend her first Christmas at home with her family . She underwent eight rounds of chemotherapy at Sheffield Children's Hospital to treat a primary tumour in her chest and ten tumours that had spread throughout her body and to her skull. 'The consultant said she had one on her skull, each arm, each leg, spine, pelvis and chest. 'We were in hospital until Christmas Eve last year - but she's really excited about having a proper Christmas this year.' 'I'm thrilled - it will be nice to have the family round. We've gone a bit mad and got her loads of presents. 'She had eight rounds of chemotherapy and was in for a week each time. She's been in and out of hospital every month since she was diagnosed. 'The lowest point was last Christmas when she developed an infection but they couldn't find out where it was so she had to have a few blood transfusions and was put in an isolation ward because of the infection. We were fearing the worst.' Lily, 2, pictured here during treatment, has had eight rounds of chemotherapy to rid her body of tumours . 'She finished chemotherapy treatment in February and she had another infection after that but it has settled down since then. 'She had the primary tumour removed from her chest and the chemotherapy has zapped the rest. 'Doctors are going to leave the one on her skull which is shrinking to see if it disappears. 'Hopefully in February when she has another scan it will have gone and we're hoping that will be an end to it. She will still be monitored and scanned until she's an adult.' The mother-of-two added: 'We're excited for Christmas this . year - last year she wasn't well. We're going to be at home and see . family and friends - last year we didn't really celebrate it at all.' 'She's really excited for Christmas - her personality has really changed this year.' Putting a brave face on it : Lily has spend much of her young life at Sheffield Children's Hospital . Feeling better: Lily enjoys spending time with her elder sister Grace, four . Mr Atkinson, 42, who works as a retail manager said: 'We were devastated - nothing prepares you for it. Your world just falls apart, nothing can describe it. 'She's not had any treatment for four months and she keeps going back for scans. She has still got one tumour on her skull but the doctors are seeing if that will go away on its own. 'She's put weight back on, her hair's coming back and her skin is a lot better because it was really pale. Looking at her now you wouldn't really know any difference.'

"By . Christian Gysin . PUBLISHED: . 04:13 EST, 25 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:19 EST, 28 May 2012 . One of her rivals nicknamed her the Tadpole – because she’s so petite. Another called Jessica Ennis the Flea because she’s so good at the long jump. Certainly, her lithe form has attracted more than her fair share of male admirers. But yesterday a senior UK Athletics official asserted that the 2012 heptathlon hopeful was ‘fat’ and carrying ‘too much weight’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scrutiny: Jessica Ennis was called overweight in spite of the heptathlete's famous six-pack . The comments came as it emerged Miss Ennis's teammate, Louise Hazel, has also been told she's too heavy. Miss Ennis, a 26-year-old Sheffield-born athlete who has been described as the Poster Girl of the London Olympics, weighs nine stone and is 5ft5in tall. However, her 45-year-old coach Toni Minichiello, who has trained her since she was 11, revealed a ‘high ranking person’ within UK Athletics had made the deeply disparaging remarks about Miss Ennis. He would not reveal exactly who had labelled Miss Ennis fat but admitted such comments were a ‘distraction’ in the weeks leading up to the start of the Games on July 27. Yesterday she said of the remarks about her being fat: ‘It’s definitely a funny one, but it’s not an issue. ‘It’s not something I worry about. It’s not something that’s stressing me at the moment so I can just brush it off and ignore it really.’ Focused: Jessica's angry coach said she did not need be distracted by this sort of 'background noise' ahead of her medal bid this summer . Miss Ennis's teammate Louise Hazel (pictured) said she was also told she was too heavy and said the comments are 'disgraceful' and warned coaches to choose their words carefully . Meanwhile, Miss Hazel told the Guardian: 'I have experienced it first hand, also from people within the organisation that was supposed to be supporting us and I just think to a certain extent it is very disgraceful. 'My warning is that coaches, people in positions of authority, need to choose their words very carefully when they are bringing up a subject like that.' She said young girls could take the comments as a 'real critique of their physical wellness.' Jessica Ennis competes during the high jump competition at the women's heptathlon at the Hypo Meeting in Goetzis, Austria today . Unneeded advice: Toni Minichiello, left, said Jessica, right, did not need to deal with this sort of comment . Mr Minichiello spoke of the pressures of dealing with interference from people in ‘fairly high positions, who should know better’ thinking they were ‘trying to be helpful.’ He said: ‘I get emails, phone calls, text messages and voicemails giving me advice on what I should be doing with Jessica that’s going to make a difference. Beauty queen: Athletics pin-up Jessica recently became the face of Olay's Essentials range . Image conscious: Jess has admitted she never leaves the house without eyeliner and mascara and wears full make-up to compete . ‘It’s a lot of background noise that you can get easily distracted by. I’ve never had any issue with her weight or shape. There are times I’ve wished she was taller – but that’s it.’ Miss Ennis is the current European and former world heptathlon champion and has also previously won the world indoor pentathlon championship. This weekend she is competing in Austria at the Hypo Meeting in Gotzis, which will be her only heptathlon event before the Olympics. Behind the scenes on the Olay ad: 'I love getting my hair and make up done professionally, Jessica admits . In the spotlight: Jessica's coach said she already had enough 'expectations and pressures to deal with' In the past her former heptathlon rival Kelly Sotherton nicknamed her Tadpole because of her tiny frame. Miss Ennis will compete in her Olympic event over two days in early August. She is engaged to long-term boyfriend Andy Hill who works as a construction site manager.

All eyes will be on President Obama at noon tomorrow when he makes his public inauguration address but come the evening the world's attention will inevitably turn to the First Lady and the gown she has chosen to wear to the couple's second inauguration ball. Though Michelle Obama certainly has the knack for getting it right in the fashion stakes, she may want to cast her eye over some of the inauguration dresses chosen by First Ladies gone by. The Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington D.C. has a collection of the First Ladies choices going back 100 years, from Helen Taft to the present day. Donation: Helen Herron Taft, pictured right at her husband's 1909 . inauguration was the first First Lady to donate her gown to the . Smithsonian Museum of American History. Elegant: Eleanor Roosevelt chose this simple floor length number for the 1933 inauguration ball . Rhinestones: Mamie Eisenhower wore a pink full-skirted dress to her husband's inauguration in 1953. The dress was covered in hundreds of rhinestones . The dresses show how different styles appealed in different eras. Grace . Coolidge wore a rare short dress to the occasion while Hillary . Clinton's violet, jewel-encrusted dress worn to the 1993 inauguration is . one of the most elaborate and traditional ball-gowns on show. The . tradition of donating an inauguration gown to the museum began with . First Lady Helen Taft who donated her white silk chiffon dress by the . Frances Smith Company from her husband's 1909 inauguration. Since then every First Lady since has donated their dress from the occasion. In March 2010, Michelle Obama donated the one-shouldered white Jason Wu dress she wore to her husband's 2009 inauguration. At . the time she said: 'When we look at the dress that Jackie Kennedy wore . 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore 100 years before . that, it takes us beyond the history books and the photographs and helps . us understand that history is made by talented people. The dress I . donated today, made by Jason Wu, is a masterpiece. It’s simple, it’s . elegant and it comes from the brilliant mind of someone who is living . the American Dream.' Own designs: Jackie Kennedy did her own sketches . for her 1961 inauguration dress. Ethel Frankau of Bergkorf Custom . Design made the white dress which had a strapless bodice and chiffon . overlay. It was worn with a matching cape, picture right . Keeping it simple: Claudia ""Lady Bird""  Johnson made a departure from elaborate, detailed designs with a simple yellow dress and matching jacket by John Moore worn to the 1965 inauguration ball . Bolero: Pat Nixon opted for a short jacket and . canary yellow dress combination. It was designed for the 1969 . inauguration ball by Karen Stark for Harvey Berin . Recycled: Rosalynn Carter caused some outrage by wearing this long-sleeved dress to the 1977 inauguration because  the First Lady had been seen wearing it previously. It was clearly a firm favorite and did her husband no harm by suggesting she was un-extravagant . The dress catapulted the designer to international fame and earned Michelle Obama full-marks from the fashion pack. Industry . publications have been desperate to correctly guess what the . fashion-forward First Lady will pick this time around  - and to see . which lucky designer she has bestowed with the honor. High Street pieces worn by the First Lady over the past four years, . from the likes of Gap and J Crew, have flown off the shelves and more . exclusive designers have also seen a surge in interest if she is . photographed in their wares. American designer Naeem Kahn is one name that has been put forward this time around. Asymmetrical: Nancy Reagan wore an inauguration gown similar to the one Michelle Obama wore in 2009. The one-shouldered white embellished dress was designed by James Galanos. 'She knew her style very well, and it was always simple and elegant,' Galanos told the Los Angeles Times . Possible clash: Arnold Scaasi designed this gown for Barbara Bush. The designer had already sold three so he called his other clients to ensure they weren't wearing it to the 1989 ball . Purple reign: Hillary Clinton, often criticized by the fashion pack, took on an uncharacteristic glitzy style with this gown for the 1993 inauguration ball . First Lady in red: Laura Bush opted for this eye-catching Michael Faircloth gown for her husbands 2001 inauguration ball . The First Lady wore one of his dresses to a State Dinner in honor of Germany's Angela Merkel at the White House last year and she also wore one of his designs back in 2009. Whoever she chooses, the fashion world say we may be in for something unusual this time around. In the past, second inauguration dresses tend to defy expectations as First Ladies become more comfortable in their own skin and in the limelight. Getting it right: Michelle Obama chose a Jason Wu dress for the inauguration ball in 2009, left. The First Lady started the inauguration festivities in style yesterday opting for a simple and chic white shirt and black trousers. The fashion world has been speculating for weeks over who will design her gown for the balls tomorrow night . Well-received: Michelle Obama's Jason Wu gown from the 2009 inauguration was a hit among the fashion critics. There has been plenty of speculation about who she will wear tomorrow . 'If you look back at many First Ladies’ second inaugural gowns they make more of a statement about the individual rather than the position and the moment,' Kate Betts, former editor of Harper’s Bazaar, told New York Magazine this week. So far Mrs Obama seems to have got her inauguration weekend fashion choices spot on. Looking chic with a new haircut for her husband's new term, she wore a simple white shirt and black trousers to a military family gala last night, offset by a bright and bejeweled belt.","From Helen Taft to Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush, Smithsonian Museum of American History exhibition shows off inauguration ball choices of First Ladies gone by .

Cases of norovirus have reached a five-year high and dozens of hospitals are resorting to banning visits from relatives to prevent its spread. It is estimated that around 900,000 people have been hit by the virus since the summer. Scroll down for video . 1 in 50 hospital beds are 'closed' due to the norovirus . In the past week alone nearly 100,000 . adults and children were struck down with the infection; nearly twice . as many as this time last year. Four in ten NHS trusts – 67 in total – have reported outbreaks among patients. This includes Birmingham City Hospitals NHS trust which has banned visitors from all wards – even those without outbreaks. The cruise ship Oriana is suffering sickness among 1,800 new passengers . Data from the Department of Health . shows that 2,398 hospital beds are ‘closed’ due to norovirus – equating . to 1 in 50 of all available beds. Figures from Firstcare, which . monitors absence rates, show that an average of 5,263 NHS staff are . calling in sick with typical symptoms every day. And during November some 128,800 working days were lost in the NHS due to employees being off with sickness. Four wards at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital have been closed after an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug . It is estimated that 0.4 per cent of the 1.4million workers in the NHS are off sick with symptoms. It is not known what proportion are . frontline staff but they are likely to be in the majority, as they are . mostly in contact with patients. Officials from the Department of . Health insist that the NHS is ‘coping well’ with the outbreak. But . experts said that the high numbers of staff falling sick was putting . extra pressure on already-overstretched wards. Dr Ian Hosein, director of infection . and prevention control at Barking, Havering and Redbridge University . Hospitals in East London, said: ‘There is significant norovirus activity . out there in the community and of course our staff go home, and they . will become exposed. The danger for us is that they could bring it into . hospital. ‘Staff will also catch it on the wards.’ Experts are not sure as to why . norovirus is so severe this year, with the number of cases 83 per cent . higher than this time in 2011. Figures from the Health  Protection . Agency show since July there have been 3,046 confirmed reports – where . the virus has been properly tested in the lab. But as most victims do not consult their GP, the HPA estimates that for every confirmed report there are 288 cases. This implies that 877,000 adults and children have been struck down since the summer. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea, a headache and a  temperature. They usually resolve themselves in a couple  of days. But it can be dangerous in the . elderly or in patients with serious underlying conditions and is thought . to cause around 80 deaths a year.

No, in fact the nation’s top turn off is bad smells. Almost 80% of women said that if a man smells bad, it is their biggest no-no, and unkempt John McCririck was awarded the status of 'most smelly celebrity' by fragrance-conscious voters. The Duchess of Cambridge was voted the nicest smelling celebrity whilst John McCririck the most smelly . Bad smell was rated a bigger turn off than a poor sense of humour (14%) and bad dress sense (1%). It seems like the best advice for people looking for love is to keep on top of their washing with clean, fresh-smelling clothes after laundry-fresh smells came top in a poll of the most attractive smells (48%), followed by perfume or aftershave (32%). The pristine Duchess of Cambridge was the celebrity that voters believed would smell the nicest, with her sister coming in third position below David Beckham. The poll, which was carried out by Surf liquid detergent,  also revealed both men and women find bad breath (38%) and the smell of cigarettes (37%) highly unattractive. David Beckham and Pippa Middleton came in second and third place respectively for their perceived great smell . One man who will be taking this advice is heartthrob and star of The Only Way Is Essex, Joey Essex, who has teamed up with Surf to create the new limited edition scent Surf Summer D’reem. Joey Essex said: 'It’s important to always smell good for the ladies so I’ve created this reem scent, to make my clothes always smell amazing, even after a night out with the lads at Sugar Hut.' Fragrance training consultant, John Ayres added: 'A fragrance or scent on another person that reminds you of a past occasion can evoke incredibly strong and immediate emotions. 'You can form positive or negative opinions of a person almost instantly and if you suddenly smell a fragrance that reminds you of a good or bad time; it can have an effect on your mood too. Joey Essex is creating a reem smell so his clothes smell fresh for his trips to Sugar Hut . By surrounding yourself with things that smell nice or that remind you of a happy occasion, you get little lifts whenever you come across them.' According to the research, one in four (26%) Brits wait until they have worn their clothes at least four times before washing them. Brits also said that the scent of sun cream is the most reminiscent of summer holidays (32%), while over a quarter of Brits (26%) said that the smell of the seaside evokes the strongest memories of great summer holidays.","80% of people turned off by bad smells .

In fact these London 2012 torchbearers are modelling the official gold and white tracksuits they will wear as they carry the flame across the country. While they are supposed to ‘accent the energy of the Olympic flame’, the outfits merely attracted  derision when they were unveiled yesterday, with critics likening them variously to nightwear, nurse’s uniforms and even Sir Jimmy Savile’s tracksuits. Scroll down for video . Dressed to impress: Today five London 2012 Torchbearers, including 99-year-old Dinah Gould, second left, hold torches in the new white and gold outfits unveiled yesterday . It emerged yesterday that for 80 per . cent of its 70-day journey across Britain, the torch will be driven in a . security van rather than carried on foot – with each of the 8,000 . bearers travelling only 300 metres each. However, the short journeys could be . just as well, given their 100 per cent polyester long-sleeved outfits, . which critics pointed out could be uncomfortably sweaty in the summer . months. The outfits, which were created by . sponsors Adidas and made in China, are arguably the third fashion . failure for this year’s Games. The uniforms for the ‘Games Maker’ volunteers are a lurid mix of ‘regal purple’ and ‘poppy red’, and the . trilby  hats and pink jackets unveiled for the London Ambassadors were . compared to Marks & Spencer’s Percy Pig sweets. But Mayor of London Boris  Johnson . insisted he ‘thoroughly approved’ of the gold-embossed uniforms. ‘They . are beautiful  outfits. They are lovely. They  are elegant but not too . austere,’  he said.

Locog, the London 2012 organisers, . said the white tracksuits were decorated with ‘gold shards accenting the . energy of the Olympic Flame at the shoulder and neckline.’ It is hoped . that Stella McCartney’s design for the British team kit, to be unveiled . later this week, will do a better job of bringing some much-needed style . to the Games. Yesterday, 7,300 unsung heroes were . named as torchbearers after being nominated for the contribution they . had made to their community. The remaining 700, expected to include . celebrities, will be revealed later this spring. The oldest torchbearer is Dinah Gould, . 99, who will be 100 when she carries the flame through the London . borough of Barnet. Mrs Gould said she was ‘delighted and honoured’ to be . asked, and will walk the route with her ‘walking stick in one hand and . the torch in the other’. Organisers also released a street-by-street map of London 2012's 8,000-mile Olympic torch relay across the UK and Ireland. Starting . from Land's End on May 19 to as far as the Outer Hebrides and Dublin, . every inch of road it will go on has been plotted so Britons can find . out just how close they can get to the iconic symbol of the Olympic . movement. After being flown in from Greece, the . flame will eventually arrive at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east . London, for the opening ceremony of the Games on July 27. There will be seven island visits . along the route: to the Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, Guernsey, Jersey, . Shetland, Orkney and the Isle of Lewis. The . locations have been confirmed by organisers, taking in famous . sports venues, historic sites and places of outstanding natural beauty.

Olympic Flame will be carried along and the torchbearers for their . community, they can start planning how they might celebrate.' Details on the two-day finale to the . 70-day relay, which brings the Olympic Flame to the lighting of the . cauldron to start the Games are being kept under wraps until closer to . the start of the relay. Proud: Pupils from Cross Flatts Primary School in Leeds celebrate the announcement with Great Britain diver Callum Johnstone, third from left, torchbearers Diane McKenna and Simon Brown, centre, and Councillor Adam Ogilivie, fourth from right . Former . Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards joined London Mayor Boris Johnson for . a demonstration of the torch relay handovers at a school in east London . yesterday morning. Around 70 children from Redlands . Primary School in Stepney wore hats and shook colourful shakers they . made for the run-through in their playground. Former triple-jumper Edwards, said: . 'It's a really exciting day. The torch relay is literally around the . corner and it's all systems go.' Explaining . the moment when the torches are held together to pass on the flame, he . said: 'The kiss is the big moment when the flame is passed from . torchbearer to torchbearer and obviously you have to get it right - you . don't want the flame to go out. Route: The torch will go through the land of Robin Hood, Nottinghamshire, who is pictured with 15-year-old Zena Robinson, a Coca-Cola Future Flame torchbearer, who will hold it in June . 'It's called a kiss. You have to hold . them together for about ten seconds to make sure the flame passes and . then the next runner runs off for their 300m stint.' Mr Johnson said the children from . Redlands Primary will always remember the day the torch goes along the . route near their school. 'I think it's going to be something that they'll keep for the rest of their lives,' he said. 'This is something our city will not do again in my lifetime.' Incredible: The torch will go 8,000 miles calling at some of the UK and Ireland's most dramatic spots including Edinburgh, top left, Dublin, top right, Land's End, below Left, and The Needles on the Isle of Wight, bottom right . Referring . to the oldest torchbearer, Mrs Gould, he said: 'Diana, who's 99, she . remembers vividly the Olympics in 1948, but people like me probably . won't see another Olympic Games. 'It's . not just London, it's people from all around the country of all ages . and obviously I think it's going to be very very wonderful for them.' Unusual ways have been found for some of the torchbearers to complete their relay leg. One will carry the flame on a chair . lift at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, another will skate with it at . the Nottingham Ice Centre and it will be rowed at Henley-on-Thames and . on the River Bann in Coleraine, Northern Ireland. High-flying activities await some torchbearers as the flame will abseil down the Dock Tower at Grimsby and swoop off the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle Gateshead on a zip wire. Demonstration: Protesters attempted to disrupt the Beijing Olympic Torch relay in 2008 by grabbing the torch from TV presenter Konnie Huq . Restoration work to the Flying . Scotsman means that the Scots Guardsman train will now take the flame on . its journey between York and Thirsk. It will also be taken on a skywalk at Croke Park as it visits Dublin on June 6 in its only stop outside of the UK. There will be no international torch . relay - the International Olympic Committee decided to make it a . domestic event only after the controversial Beijing torch relay in 2008 . where protesters used the event to demonstrate against China's human . rights abuses. TV presenter Konnie Huq was caught up in a melee between police and protesters. People also hurled themselves into the path of . the relay in London and campaigners tried to grab the torch or put out the flame . with a fire extinguisher. History: Frank Ede taking the torch from Austin Playford during the relay before the 1948 London Olympics in London . A team of 28 police officers will be . dedicated to protecting the Olympic torch and its bearers during a 8,000 . mile tour of Britain. Commander Bob Broadhurst, the officer in . charge of Olympic policing in London, said: 'I think the biggest threat will be . attention seekers, somebody trying to run alongside and grab a bit of the . glory. 'I'm sure we'll get the odd protest every now . and then up and down the country.' A mock run took place this month to demonstrate . how the police team would deal with various situations if they arose during the . relay. The British authorities do not believe the torch relay will face the same issues the Chinese had to deal with, but have nonetheless chosen a much lower profile route. The teenage son of inspirational fundraiser Jane Tomlinson said today that he is carrying the Olympic Torch on behalf of his late mother. Steven Tomlinson, 14, will be taking his turn on the relay when the torch arrives in Leeds in June. His mother, pictured right running in a triathlon, died from cancer in 2007 at the age of 43, and carried the torch ahead of the 2004 Games in Athens. Mrs Tomlinson inspired thousands of people with her charity challenges while battling against terminal cancer. The NHS radiographer defied experts and spent seven years raising . money for charity through marathons, triathlons, the Iron Man contest, a . tandem cycle ride from Rome to Leeds and a bike ride across America, . from San Francisco to New York. She raised more than £1.85 million and her family have continued to . raise funds for her charity, the Jane Tomlinson Appeal, since her death. 'I’m really excited about being nominated as a torchbearer.' he said. 'It’s a great opportunity to be part of the Olympics. I will be doing it on behalf of my sisters and my mum. It should be a great experience.' She was awarded the MBE for her work in June 2003 and later made a CBE. Last month, her husband, Mike, 50, of Rothwell, West Yorkshire, and daughter, Rebecca, 23, of Tooting, south London, announced they are planning to run this year’s Paris and London marathons and cycle the distance between them.","8,000 torchbearers will take the torch on the 70-day journey that will come within 10 miles of 95 per cent of the population .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 20:20 EST, 1 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:20 EST, 1 November 2012 . Two new drugs that will transform the chances of surviving malignant melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, are to be approved for use by the NHS. Doctors claim ipilimumab and vemurafenib are the first major advance in treatment for 30 years because they increase survival for patients with advanced disease. Ipilimumab extends lifespan by an average of almost four months in trials on patients where the cancer has spread to other organs - who have no other options. But some patients are alive many years later. It's estimated the drugs could help up to 1,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s . It is estimated the drugs could benefit up to 1,000 patients in the UK each year, many of them in their 20s and 30s. The decision is a U-turn by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) which originally rejected their use on the NHS, saying they were too expensive. Top doctors wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron to protest about the proposed ban. Nice says it has since received additional data about the cost effectiveness of the drugs and is recommending them on the basis that the manufacturers will give the NHS a discount. Ipilimumab costs £18,000 for a course of treatment and vemurafenib, also known as zelboraf, costs £1,750 a month. Dr Paul Lorigan, Senior Lecturer in Medical Oncology, the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, one of the leading trial centres for ipilimumab in the UK, said ‘After 30 years of no progress in the treatment of this terrible illness, this represents a genuine step change in the management of this disease.’ Trials show ipilimumab, also known as Yervoy and made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, increases lifespan by an average of almost four months in patients where the cancer has spread to other organs,. But British doctors carrying out trials say up to one in four patients is still alive four years after treatment. Vemurafenib, made by Roche, works in patients who have a cancer-causing form of the BRAF gene, around half of cases. More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die. It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s . Patients in trials lived an average of 13.2 months compared with 9.6 months for patients receiving standard chemotherapy, but other research from US and Australia showed it nearly doubled average survival times to around 16 months. Both drugs have been paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, set up by the Government to make drugs available which are awaiting approval or have been rejected by Nice. The Fund does not operate in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland where the drugs have not been available. Dr Lorigan said ‘If Nice had not approved these drugs and they had been withdrawn, it would have been a disaster. ‘I think patient power made the difference, Nice listened to patients and their families about how little hope there was before these drugs came along.’ Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the London-based Institute of Cancer Research, said ‘We are delighted that zelboraf, which the Institute of Cancer Research helped to make possible, is now to become available on the NHS. ‘It represents a great stride forward in the treatment of advanced malignant melanoma, and is a brilliant example of what new-generation targeted cancer therapies can achieve.’ Gill Nuttall, of the patient support group Factor 50, said ‘This is very welcome news for patients with advanced melanoma, who have waited such a long time for any new treatment options that have the potential to extend life. ‘The important thing now will be for positive guidance to be implemented as soon as possible so that suitable patients can be given a chance to benefit from this treatment.’ More than 10,400 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma each year and 2,000 people die.It is the most common kind of cancer for women in their 20s. Professor Carole Longson, director at the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at Nice, said ‘For many years the treatments available for this condition have been very limited and in some cases restricted to palliative care. ‘Vemurafenib and ipilimumab are breakthrough treatments that can potentially significantly affect prognosis for these patients and we are very pleased that the manufacturers have worked with us so that we are now able to recommend them both.’ Draft guidance approving the drugs for NHS use is likely to be finalised in December.","Doctors claim ipilimumab and vemurafenib .

Those in the North, Midlands and Ireland tend to buy the bigger sizes, while women in the South and Scotland are a little less busty, according to sales figures from Debenhams.

Scroll down for video . How real? Food experts warn that the 'real fruit' many companies claim on their packaging is actually just balls of sugar and soybean oil, mixed with tiny bits of dried fruit . An example is Special K Fruit and Yogurt cereal, with fresh berries on the front of the box. Michael Jacobson, the head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog group, told Today it actually contains 'no berries whatsoever'. Mr Jacobson explained that these berry 'imposters' are in a lot of foods, like blueberry Eggos and Aunt Jemima's Blueberry Pancakes.

Atomic Kitten singer Jenny Frost - who is pregnant with twins - revealed today she was struck down by debilitating morning sickness, just like the Duchess of Cambridge. The 34-year-old pop star and TV presenter, whose non-identical twin girls are due in February, said she spent the entire summer suffering from terrible sickness. Jenny, who splits her time between Ibiza and the UK, said: 'I had to go to the doctor to try and get some medication to keep my food down. Jenny Frost, who is expecting twins, has revealed today that she also suffered severe morning sickness during pregnancy . 'When I was really sick, I couldn’t eat anything but salt and vinegar Squares crisps. 'I’m knackered... I’ve had my head stuck down the loo for most of this pregnancy - the morning sickness was debilitating.' She told OK! magazine: 'The ""glowing"" stage has completely eluded me!' When she announced the news in August, the singer wrote on Twitter: 'So tired,so pukey,so pregnant......so happy! x.' Jenny took to Twitter to open up about the early stages of her pregnancy, telling fans she was 'so pukey' She also added 'it's twins'- the pair are expected in February . Then added to the joy by telling her fans: 'Oh & it's twins!!!!! #arrrrrrrrrrrrgh.' Jenny, who married Spanish scuba-diving school owner Vicente Juan Spiteri last year, already has a four-year-old son, Caspar, with her ex. Jenny, who is expecting twins with second husband Spanish scuba-diving school owner Vicente Juan Spiteri, said she could only eat crisps during a stage in her pregnancy . She was engaged to DJ Dominic Thrupp, but the pair split up after eight years together. The Duchess of Cambridge is currently in hospital being treated for acute morning sickness. While a royal source said the couple and . their families are concerned about her illness, they have been . 'reassured' it is not a dangerous condition for either the the Duchess . or her baby. The couple delighted millions around the world – including their own families – with the happy news yesterday. Jenny already has son Caspar with ex DJ Dominic Thrupp . But as the word spread, the parents-to-be were together in hospital, facing the first hurdle in a much longed for pregnancy. Kate, . 30, who is barely eight weeks pregnant, was taken to the hospital just . after lunch by her husband and immediately put on a drip to stop her . becoming dehydrated. Kate will be staying in hospital for a few more days with Clarence House saying it's the rest she needs . Last night she appeared to be responding well to treatment. Sources said there was ‘no cause for alarm’. However, doctors at the King Edward VII Hospital have taken the precautionary step of keeping her in for the next few days with Clarence House  telling MailOnline this morning that . Catherine is still expected to spend the next few days in hospital, and . requires a 'period of rest'. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a rare condition believed to affect up to two per cent of women in pregnancy and is a severe form of morning sickness. Kate is amongst the 2% of women suffering from acute morning sickness . It tends to be more common in young mothers, women who are in their first pregnancy, and those with multiple pregnancies. Women with HG often lose weight - usually over 10 per cent of their body weight - and feel tired and dizzy. They may also find they are passing water less often than usual, and the main risk is dehydration which can lead to headache, palpitations and confusion. There is also a risk of nutritional deficiencies. Then symptoms are severe, admission to hospital may be needed for observation and to treat dehydration with intravenous fluids. This usually only means a few days in hospital. Unlike most morning sickness, HG usually persists past the first trimester of pregnancy, and typically subsides by week 21 of pregnancy – although it can last much longer. However, leading doctors say that along with more ordinary morning sickness, it is a sign the pregnancy is progressing. Dr Peter Bowen-Simpkins, consultant obstetrician and medical director of the London Women’s Clinic, says: ‘It is almost always a positive sign that the pregnancy is progressing well. ‘The sickness is thought to be due to a rise in hormone levels. It normally occurs during weeks six and eight of pregnancy, when the placenta takes over production of hormones from the ovaries. ‘It generally continues until around 12 or 14 weeks, but if it stops before, it can — although not always — be a sign that all is not well.’ Mark Prigg .","Jenny Frost expecting twins in February .

Cacia Griggs, 26, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, spent her whole 20s as a morbidly obese size 24, but crushing four-year-old Isabelle's bed was the final straw, and she embarked upon a life-changing diet. Just one year later she has lost eight stone, dropped to a size 10, and married her fiance Chris in her dream wedding dress. Cacia said: 'I'd had enough of being overweight. I have a four-year-old daughter called Isabelle and being overweight was having a huge impact on my life' Cacia with Isabelle before losing the weight, left, and on her wedding day, right . Cacia, who works in marketing, had always struggled with her weight, but when even her size 24 clothes were getting too tight and . she realised she desperately wanted to lose weight and wear fashionable clothes like . her friends, instead of being forced to shop in plus-sized stores and . simply buying anything that fitted. Cacia, . whose maiden name was Wilkinson, said: 'I'd tried every diet under the . sun but never had the motivation to continue with it. But . I'd had enough of being overweight. I have a four-year-old daughter . called Isabelle and being overweight was having a huge impact on my . life.' Cacia in her dream wedding dress on her wedding day with her husband Chris Griggs and daughter Isabelle . One night, having asked her . 29-year-old fiance to carry Isabelle up to . bed because she couldn't fit through the stair gate, Cacia followed them . upstairs and lay down on the edge of the bed with her daughter to read . her a story. 'I . heard a loud snap,' she said. 'I'd literally broken the entire side beam of her bed . because I was overweight.  I was devastated.' Cacia had a similar moment of clarity while on her first family holiday with Chris and Isabelle in Turkey last year when she couldn't fit the aeroplane seatbelt around her. Cacia before she lost eight stone, playing with her daughter Isabelle in a swimming pool . She . said: 'I thought I was going to have to ask for a seat belt extension . and the thought of this humiliation made me force the seat belt closed . but it was so tight and uncomfortable, I was relieved when the seat belt . sign was switched off. 'I had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and I should have been the happiest girl in the world, but in reality I was desperately unhappy' 'I knew after that I didn't want to go . on holiday again at that weight and the ever-familiar guilt of knowing . what that would take away from my family made me feel terrible.' Cacia added: 'I . had the most wonderful daughter and fiancé and I should have been the . happiest girl in the world, but in reality I was desperately unhappy . with my weight controlling every thought that I had and everything that we did or didn't do.' Cacia . was also desperate to set a date for her wedding but again kept putting . it off because of her weight, terrified she wouldn't find a dress that . fitted her. Cacia said: 'The thought of subjecting my beautiful . little girl to a lifetime of weight-battling misery and ill-health was . too much for me to bear. In that moment, I knew I had to make a change . and it had to be now' It was a newspaper article that finally shocked Cacia into losing the weight for good. She said: 'The article explained how daughters of obese mothers were much more likely to grow up to be obese themselves. 'It might as well have been written about me and my daughter. She was already starting to copy my bad eating habits, asking for the fizzy drinks and junk food that I was eating. 'I realised the article was a stark warning about the issues that my daughter would be faced with because of me - diabetes, heart disease, and eventually premature death. 'The thought of subjecting my beautiful little girl to a lifetime of weight-battling misery and ill-health was too much for me to bear. In that moment, I knew I had to make a change and it had to be now.' Cacia was able to wear her dream, size 10 wedding dress on her big day . Cacia began the Cambridge Weight Plan in June 2011, swapping her high-calorie diet for soups, shakes and bars. 'My . weight literally began to drop off,' she said. 'In no time at all I was . wearing smaller clothes and was over the moon the first time I brought a . size 16, I couldn't believe it fitted. 'For the first time I began to really believe that I could do this. People started noticing and I fell in love with exercise.' In August this year, Cacia - who has now been crowned . Cambridge Weight Plan's Slimmer of the Year - reached her goal weight of 10 stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 10. 'I couldn't believe it,' said Cacia. 'My entire approach to food has changed, and my daughter's eating habits have radically changed too. 'She never asks for fizzy drinks now, it's nearly always water, and her new favourite thing in the world is broccoli!' Cacia on her wedding day with husband Chris, left, and wearing one of the dresses she would never have fit into before her weight loss . Cacia added: 'My life is so different and . sometimes I feel like I'm someone else. I love shopping, wearing dresses . and skirts. Gone are the baggy tops and my black wardrobe. 'My . fiancé and I also finally set a date for our wedding and on 3 November . we got married. I felt amazing and instead of wearing the size 16 dress . I'd bought as my incentive to lose weight, I ended up wearing a size 10. 'I still have to pinch myself to think that I've come this far.' Cacia says the best thing about losing the weight is being able to lay with her daughter again on her bed instead of sitting on the floor next to her. She said: 'Recently I was reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar to Isabelle and she turned to me and said: ""That was like you wasn't it mummy? You ate too much and got really fat, but now you've turned into a beautiful butterfly"". I burst into tears. Only a four-year-old can say something like that and really mean it. I have truly turned my life and my family's life around and now there's no going back.' Cacia said: 'My life is so different and sometimes I . feel like I'm someone else. I love shopping, wearing dresses and . skirts. Gone are the baggy tops and my black wardrobe'","Cacia Griggs, 26, from Peterborough, weighed 18 stone and was size 24 .

Top tweet: Models wore metallic purple trenchcoats during the Burberry Porsum show finale. Burberry won the social media battle at London Fashion Week this month, generating over 21,000 mentions on Facebook, Twitter and other blogs. But while two thirds of the comments were about the label's clothes, 25 per cent focused on One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles, who took pride of place on the front row beside burlesque star Dita von Teese. Burberry's stellar guest list - including TV presenter and model, Alexa Chung, and Paralympic champion Johnnie Peacock - was a major part of the appeal, according to business information group Precise. The brand enjoyed double the exposure of . its nearest rival, Topshop, whose Unique show attracted around 10,000 . mentions. Unlike Burberry, however, most of the conversations about . Philip Green's label were fashion-focused. In terms of social networks, Twitter was the most popular site for fashion commentators, followed by blogs and Facebook. Burberry and Topshop racked up the . largest number of tweets - with 20,924 and 9,161 respectively - Vivienne . Westwood came next with 3,031, followed by Matthew Williamson in fourth . with 2,228, and Erdem in fifth with 1,402.

'Where once a brand could rely on having a few key editors on-side, today's arbiters of a brand's success or failure are the thousands of enthusiasts who follow them closely. 'This year's exhibitors will doubtless be pleased to know that over 95 percent of the posts we have tracked over the past week were positive.' He continued: 'What also stood out about this year's event was the extent to which the 'front row celebrities' have shaped these conversations – even overtaking the brand completely at times. 'Will such big spikes help these brands cement their reputations with target consumers? Only time will tell.

The novelty Christmas jumper used to be seen as a cringeworthy festive present knitted by a great aunt, and . was regarded by the fashion police as the ultimate crime. But now the festive pullover has done a U-turn and gone from a fashion mistake to a fashion must-have. And it seems that while women are loving their festive knits, men can’t get enough of their woolly . antlers, snowmen and snowflakes either - and it's all thanks to Justin Bieber, Joey Essex and JLS. Trend setters: Justin Bieber, JLS and Joey Essex have all helped boost sales of Christmas jumpers for men . Thanks to the fashion savvy male pop stars, the festive warmers are selling like hot cakes, with 10,000 flying off the shelves in the last two weeks alone at Asda. Research by the store reveals that men can't get enough of the novelty knits with 45 per cent of men buying a festive jumper compared to only 28 per cent of women. Colin Firth kicked off the trend when he sported a jumper in the 2001 film of Bridget Jones’s Diary - although back then it was still seen as a fashion faux pas. Fast forward to 2012 and Justin Bieber, JLS, McFly and Joey Essex have all been spotted proudly sporting the comedy garment. George Brand Director Fiona Lambert said: ‘Christmas jumpers are a fabulous way to embrace the festive season and are now a fashion trend in their own right.

Authors often base their novels on their own experiences, over-heard conversations or eccentric characters they may have met throughout their lives. But one writer has caused offense by keeping her characters too close to home - as she's been accused of basing them on her own neighbours. Friends of novelist Angela Hargreaves, who lives in Eccleshall, Staffordshire, are now refusing to speak to her after private conversations they've had with her and secrets they've confided have allegedly ended up in her book. Art imitating life? Angela Hargreaves has been accused of basing her racy characters on her neighbours . Hargreaves' novel Rotten Row was published earlier this year and its steamy scenes and saucy characters have appealed to readers whose interest in erotic fiction has been piqued by Fifty Shades of Grey. On Amazon, the book is described as containing 'tales of love, death, nostalgic regret, sexual encounters, . romance, marriage, divorce and desperate times but ultimately how . quickly our fortunes can and do change. 'Rotten Row is about the petty spitefulness and complexity of living in close proximity to some neighbours,' it adds. Hargreaves, 57, is now experiencing such complexities with her own neighbours who are outraged that some of her characters appear to be based on them. Emma Williams, 46, a civil servant who has known Hargreaves for ten years, said she believes the character Lucy - described as 'boring' with a 'mundane job' - is inspired by her. She was shocked to find similar conversations to those she'd had in confidence with Hargreaves in the novel. Controversial: But Hargreaves says it's all fictional . 'It’s so upsetting, because it’s my . next-door neighbour. The things I’ve been involved in have now come out in a book. I haven’t . spoken to her since the novel came out and she is no longer a friend,' she told the Daily Telegraph. Another neighbour, who did not want to be . named, said the book had caused 'major problems' and that there have been 'a lot of tears shed'. 'How would you like to . live next to somebody who was writing things that were talked about in . private into black and white? It is unreal,' they told the newspaper. Characters in the novel include a sex-mad florist, a cheating boyfriend and a buxom caterer. There's also a male character described as a 'decrepit old wreck' who chases women and a sex-obsessed widow described as a 'termagant little hag of a woman'. Hargreaves, who lives with her husband and their dogs, has denied that any of the characters are based on her neighbours and said she has been 'quite upset' by the fall out. 'We’ve been crossed off the invitation list for Christmas parties and cards,' she said. She has also taken to Amazon, where her novel has received mixed reviews, to defend her work. She writes in the product description: 'The characters in Rotten Row are fictional and many of the things that happen in the book didn't happen at all. 'I made them up or stole them from the lives of other people that I've met over the years. All have been hugely exaggerated for comic or tragic effect. 'I had a ""I'll use this someday file"" and hoped to one day take advantage of what seemed to me to be a collection of just the sort of comic slightly public episodes that was destined to be used by someone sooner rather than later. 'My fictitious characters live in the fictional village of Upton Green.'","Angela Hargreaves' novel Rotten Row is described as a tale of 'sexual encounters' and the 'complexity of living in close proximity to some neighbours'

For most children, December is an exciting time when they enjoy decorating the Christmas tree and tuck into festive goodies. But for one school boy and his mother it can be somewhat of an annual nightmare. Theo Lester, six, suffers from a range of extreme allergies, which means he can't go anywhere near a real pine tree or bite into a mince pie or Christmas pudding. A bite into one would trigger anaphylactic shock causing his airways to close. Theo and mother Bree with a fake Christmas tree. Both could go into anaphylactic shock if exposed to real pine needles . His mother Bree, from Costessey, Norfolk, suffers from the same allergies. The 37-year-old said: 'Everything kicks off this time of year with both of us. 'Touching a real tree is something he has never done. I would love for him to be able to experience it one day like other kids. 'Having a proper tree is such a lovely thing at Christmas, but unfortunately it is something we will never be able to do. 'I miss them. They are so much nicer than normal ones, and Theo has always wanted to have one, but we can't.' Mrs Lester discovered she had an extreme aversion to pine needles aged ten, while decorating her parents' Christmas tree for the first time. She came out in rashes, her eyes and nose watered heavily and she struggled to breathe as she put the tinsel and baubles up. Over the years she developed extreme asthma and eczema, which is triggered by all manner of household items. Theo and Bree can't go near real Christmas trees and must make their own mince pies as they are allergic to nuts . When Theo was born Mrs Lester and husband Stephen, 39, had him tested for a host of allergies and discovered he had inherited his mother's problems. He could go into anaphylactic shock if he walks into a room where someone was cracking a bowlful of nuts. Little Theo also can't enjoy bonfire night as the smokey atmosphere makes him wheeze if he goes outside. Mrs Lester, a housewife, added: 'I realised he was going to be exactly like me so we had him tested for lots of different things and that's when we found out about the problems he was going to have at Christmas. 'Before he goes round to a friend's house for tea I have to make sure they only have a fake tree. 'He can't eat Christmas pudding or mince pies at school or with his friends because of the nut allergy. We have to make our own. 'He always has an epipen, nebuliser and inhaler with him in case the worst happens and someone has a tree or nuts in their house but we don't want him to be treated differently to any other child.' Mrs Lester and her son dose themselves up on anti-allergy tablets and make sure the heating is off as warmth makes their allergic reactions worse. Little Theo understands why he can't have a real tree at home but still hopes one day he will overcome his allergies and be able to have one. He said: 'I would like a real tree but they make me feel poorly. They make me wheezy, sneezy and itchy.' Father Steve, said: 'Christmas is what you make of it and we always have a special day. 'We make a real event of decorating the (fake) tree and Theo gets plenty of presents. We make sure every December 25 is a happy one.'","Both Theo and his mother suffer from a range of extreme allergies, which make celebrating Christmas a bit of a chore .

Barack Obama has issued a blistering challenge to North Korea over its nuclear ambitions, warning leaders to 'pursue peace' or face the consequences. In one of his starkest warnings to the dictatorship yet, the U.S. president said a failure to embrace international agreements would mean a future without dignity, respect or hope for its people. Speaking alongside world leaders at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in neighbouring South Korea, Mr Obama said the . internationally-alienated nation needs to change its ways or risk 'more broken dreams' and . 'more isolation.' His warning comes amid soaring tensions on the Korean peninsular, after images were revealed of the North's brand new missile launch pad, which its military leaders say will fire an 'earth observation satellite' next month. Scroll down for video . Address: U.S. President Barack Obama gives a lecture as he attends 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies on Monday . But Seoul warned it might blow any North Korean rocket carrying a satellite out of the sky if it violates South Korean airspace as the United States said the launch amounts to a test of North Korea's rocketry. 'We are studying measures such as tracking and shooting down (parts) of a North Korean missile in case they stray out of their normal trajectory', said Yoon Won-shik, a vice spokesman at the Defense Ministry, adding: 'We cannot help viewing (the launch) as a very reckless, provocative act that undermines peace on the Korean peninsula.' Mr Obama also stood by his pledge for a world without . nuclear weapons, declaring flatly that the United States has more than . it needs and could decrease its arsenal without threatening national security. Nuke test site? Images were revealed of the North's brand new missile launch pad, which its military leaders say will fire an 'earth observation satellite' next month . That assessment put him on a . collision course with congressional Republicans who say any significant . cuts would undermine the U.S. ability to deter aggression. In unusually personal terms, Mr Obama said he spoke of his wish for further nuclear reductions as the president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons, as a commander whose country's nuclear codes are never far from his side, and as a protective father eager to erase the threat of nuclear annihilation. Shake on it: US President Barack Obama, left, shakes hands with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev following the conclusion of their bilateral meeting at the Nuclear Security Summit .

'Treaties are binding. Rules will be enforced. And violations will have consequences. Because we refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the world's most deadly weapons.' - President Obama . During their talk, Mr Obama and Mr Hu agreed to coordinate their response to any 'potential provocation' should North Korea launch a satellite. The White House said Mr Hu indicated to Mr Obama that he was taking the . North Korean issue very seriously and was registering China's concern . with the government in Pyongyang. Still, . Mr Obama aimed his most stern remarks to North Korea's leaders, saying the . internationally isolated country needs to change its ways because . continuing down the same path will lead to 'more broken dreams' and . 'more isolation.' His blunt remarks came a day after he . visited the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and . described the experience as akin to witnessing a 'time warp' of despair. 'By now it should be clear,' he said. 'Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the . security you seek, they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you . desire, you are more isolated.'

'I firmly believe that we can ensure the security of . the United States and our allies, maintain a strong deterrent against . any threat, and still pursue further reductions in our nuclear arsenal.' Mr Obama also reiterated his warning to . Iran, which the U.S. and its allies contend is defying its international . obligations by pursuing an illicit nuclear program. Obama said he would . discuss Iran in meetings later in the day with the leaders of Russia . and China. 'Iran's leaders must understand that . there is no escaping the choice before it. Iran must act with the . seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,' Obama said. 'Iran must meet its obligations.' Facing down Iran and North Korea, Mr Obama said a 'new international norm' was emerging to deal with the two nations' intransigence. 'Treaties are binding. Rules will be enforced.

The pictures capture the couple's . awesome surroundings in the jungle and include photographs taken on their . private walks through the Borneo forest as well as images captured while . the Duke and Duchess were flying to the Solomon Islands. The couple travelled into the jungle . to the research station in the Malaysian state of Sabah where they were . hoisted more than 40 metres up into the rainforest canopy to see the . eco-system. They also saw orangutans during their time on the island and Kate captured one of the endangered species in silhouette. The . trip to Borneo took place at a testing time for the couple, in the . midst of the publication of pictures of the Duchess sunbathing topless . on holiday in France. The Duke and Duchess flew over this palm oil plantation on their way to the research station. These plantations are vital to the production of many products used in daily life, from cooking to biofuels . The Borneo rainforest provides natural habitats for many species of birds and animals. Most notably the endangered Borneo Orangutan. The Duke and Duchess were fortunate enough to spot one during their short visit .

They follow the release yesterday of never-before-seen photographs of Prince William in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot. There were red faces at the palace . though as the publicity exercise back-fired as it emerged that sensitive . information was visible in four of the shots. The Ministry of Defence was yesterday . forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of RAF . staff following the embarrassing security blunder. The . pictures, taken by an RAF photographer, had been intended to show off a . ‘day in the life’ of the prince on base as Flight Lieutenant Wales at . RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. This photo of a jungle clearing was taken by The Duchess during her and The Duke's private walk. In rare clearings, when the sunlight does shine though, it creates the most spectacular effect through the architectural structures of the trees and leaves . This photograph was also taken on a private jungle walk. Every tree is itself a kingdom of creatures and plant life with a surrounding atmosphere of light and noise and humidity . Creative Kate, who has a degree in the history of art, is a keen supporter of the arts as reflected in her first Patronages and volunteer activities since becoming Duchess of Cambridge. It is understood her photos were taken on a Canon G12, which retails for about £285. In January she became patron of the National Portrait Gallery and her first official solo engagement without husband William was at a Lucian Freud preview at the gallery in February this year. She has also become a patron of the Art Room, a charity that works with children to increase their self-esteem, self-confidence and independence through art. The charity’s emphasis is on teaching life skills while encouraging children and young people to both relate and engage with each other. Harry Page has worked as a Fleet Street staff photographer on two national titles for over 30 years. In that time he has travelled the world covering major news stories, royal tours & celebrity events. He says: ‘It’s a good first effort and full marks to her for putting them out there and inviting critique, that is very brave as an amateur, but technically they are not brilliant. ‘It looks like the pictures have all been take in colour and then turned to black and white, meaning they lose a lot of impact. ‘She was in a lush rainforest in a beautiful part of the world which would have been filled with amazing colours and shades so to lose all of that is a real shame. ‘Black and white pictures can be more interesting but here it adds nothing to the picture. ‘My least favourite shot is the one of the orangutan – I thought Rod Hull’s Emu had curled up and died on film. ‘But some of the jungle shots are good, and she definitely shows potential. ‘My advice to her is to get some proper lessons from a professional photographer. ‘She is in such a privileged position and will spend the rest of her life travelling around the world with unique access to the most amazing sites, a few professional pointers would enable her to make the most of her potential.'

Jeremy Clarkson once said on Top Gear that the only way young men could afford car insurance would be by chopping off their genitals . Jeremy Clarkson once said on Top Gear that the only way young men could afford motor insurance is if they were to cut off their genitals. But by the end of this year, this measure will no longer be necessary. From 21 December, policy providers will no longer be able to calculate premiums based on a person's gender - because the European Court of Justice has deemed it 'unfair'. And it's women who'll be affected most by the ruling. In fact, industry experts are predicting a 'seismic' impact on feminine purse strings across the country. Currently, female drivers tend to get much cheaper car insurance because assessors consider them 'low risk'. This is not because they necessarily have fewer accidents - men and women do, actually, have the same number of crashes - but because cars smashed up by men generally cost more for insurers to repair. While some people assume it is therefore common sense to charge men more, the reality for safe, responsible drivers like myself - of which we are the majority - is anything but. Just look at the facts. There's a whopping 41 per cent discrepancy between the average annual premium for new male and female drivers, according to Gocompare.com - even before they're on the road. For young men of 17 and 18, the gap is even wider: an epic 88 per cent. Translate this to cash and men pay an extra £1,776 for exactly the same policy as the girl next door (even if she then goes out and crashes her car the following week). This isn't based on anything scientific like driving test score or psychological analysis; it's just about gender. A sweeping generalisation which, for years, was considered 'good' sexism because it favoured girls. Proper Made in Dagenham stuff. But what has made it worse is that men have never been able to prove themselves before getting stung. In addition, it takes years of having a no-claims bonus to even slightly reduce a man's policy, while a woman's could be re-priced from the bargain bin immediately after an accident. But no more. Men and women have the same number of crashes, but cars smashed up by men generally cost more for insurers to repair . Figures from the Association of British . Insurers predict that female drivers will now see a 25 per cent price hike in . their annual policy as the law levels out, while men can expect a 10 per . cent reduction. For the thousands of them who drive carefully and just happen to be 18, the change will be like a lottery-sized win: both financially and politically. For a men's campaigner like me (with, by the way, more than ten years of accident-free driving under my seatbelt), it's also the perfect Christmas gift. You see, while women like Harriet Harman complain about the gender pay gap (as they should), they're remarkably silent on issues like the life expectancy gap - mainly because women have the upper hand. Men currently pay an extra £1,776 for exactly the same policy as the girl next door . This insurance surcharge for men - what I jokingly refer to as the 'penis tax' - is absolutely no different. But it is, dare I say it, complete nonsense. Even though my very first car was a . modest, second-hand Renault 5 which I started driving in 1997, I still . had to fork out more money than a female friend who was bought a brand . new, powerful VW by her father. Even . when one of my sisters had to be cut out of a car after she collided . with a double-decker bus in London, her insurance remained LESS than . mine (even though I had no time to drive because I was working . double-shifts in my weekend job to pay for it). Fifteen . years on, I've still never had an accident - but am coughing up more . money than that girl at college, even though her car got written off . because she was applying make-up while driving. Don't get me wrong, reckless racers . should contribute more if they drive like idiots and put people at risk, . but it's a policy that should apply across the board. That . said, this isn't the fault of women. Far from it - the fault lies with . the system. A lazy, unrefined industry which uses an out-dated, blanket . way to calculate risk without seeing its customers as individuals. Something which, for any business, is always a car crash of an approach. But it managed to thrive for so long because we live in a society that laughs at the so-called novelty of men being discriminated against (just look at those patronising Sheila's Wheels adverts - eugh!). Thankfully, it's all about to change, but it won't be an easy pill for the sisterhood to swallow. Not least because it means the blame for bad driving can no long be placed solely at our door. Gocompare.com's head of motor insurance, Scott Kelly, said: 'From 21 December insurers will be prohibited from using gender in their pricing. 'But, as our survey shows, there has been no equalisation of rates to date, so the introduction of unisex pricing is likely to have a sudden, dramatic impact as insurers seem to be holding off until the last minute. 'Reckless racers should contribute more if they drive like idiots and put people at risk, but it's a policy that should apply across the board' 'We expect that the implementation of unisex rates will see premiums equalised at the higher male rate, rather than at the lower rate for females. 'If that is the case, women drivers will see their premiums rise by just over £300 on average, but for younger age groups the increase could be as much as £2,000.' This might be an eye-watering amount to shell out before Christmas, but ladies, take comfort in the fact that we've been paying these rates since the beginning of time - whether we're good drivers or not. At the very least, you'll now know what it feels like to strive for a blemish-free, no-claims insurance policy. This can only be a good thing. On top of that, you'll also be buying into something that's now equal and balanced. New and improved. After all, you can't put a price on fairness - unless you're an insurer, and then it's about £2,000.","Men currently pay an extra £1,776 for the same policy as women .
