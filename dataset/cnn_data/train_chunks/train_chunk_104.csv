"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took a short tour of Tahrir Square in the Egyptian capital on Wednesday. During the anti-government demonstrations that eventually led to the ouster of long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the square was a rallying spot for protesters who transformed it from a bustling urban center into a fortified campground. The walking tour lasted about 10 to 12 minutes, with crowds of people stopping her to shake her hand. She later met with Prime Minister Essam Sharaf. ""To see where this revolution happened and all that it has meant to the world is extraordinary for me,"" Clinton said. ""It's just a great reminder of the power of the human spirit and universial desire for human rights and democracy. It's just thrilling to see where this happened."" On Tuesday, Clinton issued a strong statement of praise for Egypt's political revolution, declaring she was ""deeply inspired"" by the dramatic change and promising new assistance for America's longtime Middle East ally. Clinton pledged $90 million in emergency economic assistance during a meeting in Cairo with Foreign Minister Nabil Al-Araby. She is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Egypt since the overthrow of Mubarak. ""The United States will work to ensure that the economic gains Egypt has forged in recent years continue, and that all parts of Egyptian society benefit from these gains,"" a State Department statement noted. While in the region, Clinton is also scheduled to visit neighboring Tunisia to express support for that country's revolt.","NEW: The United States is pledging $90 million in emergency economic assistance .

"(CNN) -- Egyptians and activists around the world took to the streets in various cities Saturday to show their support for the protests currently underway in Egypt and to join the call for President Hosni Mubarak to step down. Outside the Egyptian Embassy in London, people rallied, chanted, hoisted banners and demanded change. One sign, written in red ink, read: ""From The Nile, To the Sea -- Egypt Soon Will Be Free! Freedom for Egypt!"" ""People were clearly voicing their anger at President Mubarak's regime but similarly they were also very passionate about their demands for democracy and political reforms,"" said Amedeo d'Amore, who attended the London protest. Demonstrators chanted: ""One, two, three, four, we don't want Mubarak anymore!"" d'Amore said in an e-mail to CNN. Elsewhere in Europe, protesters in Geneva shouted slogans in Arabic, French and English, chanting, ""Get out, Mubarak!"" according to Courtney Radsch, who attended the demonstration there. Radsch sent CNN a video of the protest that showed a crowd of people carrying signs that read, ""Freedom. Social Justice. Democracy"" and ""Free Egypt."" Protests also took place in cities throughout Canada. About 150 protesters gathered outside the Egyptian consulate in Montreal, CNN affiliate CTV reported. In Toronto, a downtown rally drew more than 500 people, it said. Ahmed Khalifa, who helped organize the Toronto protest, said he was encouraged by the protests in Egypt and stressed their significance. ""We are witnessing a great change in history,"" he told CTV. ""It's like the fall of the Berlin Wall. We are watching Egyptian people and Middle Eastern people telling us that 'we want freedom.'

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The Cairo Criminal Court approved a freeze on the assets of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and upheld a travel ban against him Tuesday as the nation moves forward in pressing corruption charges against the ousted leader. Mubarak's attorney, Samir Shishtawi, said he has filed an appeal. Egypt's Supreme Court is considering lifting the secret status that shields Mubarak's accounts and holdings, which could potentially unleash a flood of information. Mubarak, who is believed to be living at his residence in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, is wanted for questioning in a corruption case. Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud issued an order freezing the assets of Mubarak and his family on February 28 and prohibited them from leaving the country. Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife, Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, state-run EgyNews reported. The seizures include ""movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets."" It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from an earlier order. Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as ""fabrications and baseless rumors."" Mubarak resigned February 11 after 18 days of protests against his rule. Egyptian politician Mustafa Bakri, who has led the fight to press corruption charges against Mubarak, said he believes the former president will stand trial. Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than 200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews. ""This is the second stage of the revolution,"" Bakri told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Long a pillar of Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule over Egypt, Omar Suleiman now sits at the top of the pyramid as its de facto president. Under pressure from street demonstrations calling for his ouster, Mubarak named his veteran spymaster to the long-vacant vice presidency in late January. Suleiman quickly became the face of the government's reform pledges, announcing talks with opposition leaders and promising swift reforms. But Mubarak's February 1 announcement that he would step down when his term ends in September failed to satisfy the crowds in Cairo's Tahrir Square and other cities. Attacks on demonstrators by pro-government crowds in the following days failed to dislodge the demonstrators, whose ranks were bolstered when thousands of workers in several industries went on strike Thursday. After a day of intense speculation, Mubarak repeated that he would remain in office to serve out his term -- but he announced that he was delegating power to Suleiman, who quickly urged Egyptians to go home and get back to work. ""We call upon you to unite, and to think rationally and to look forward to the future,"" Suleiman said in a televised speech that followed Mubarak's. But the vice president, whose agents are among the fingers of Mubarak's iron hand, wasn't seen as much of an improvement by opposition figures. ""Mubarak is only one part of this regime,"" human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim, one of the Tahrir Square protesters, said. ""People have been here for 17 days, and they are not for Suleiman either. Mubarak has lost all legitimacy, and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as Mubarak being in power."" And in Alexandria, protesters met the announcement with chants of ""No to Mubarak, no to Suleiman."" A former general who trained under both the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War, Suleiman took over Egypt's Mukhabarat intelligence agency in 1993. He is credited with leading Mubarak's efforts to crush an Islamic insurgency in the 1990s. That earned him the ear of Western intelligence officials thirsting for vital information about regional terrorist groups, and he became a key intermediary in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. ""He is basically your main go-to guy in Egypt,"" former Deputy CIA Director John McLaughlin said. Suleiman has been ""helpful in many arenas,"" including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. McLaughlin said. A 2006 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, disclosed by the WikiLeaks website in January, called intelligence collaboration with Suleiman ""probably the most successful element"" of the U.S. relationship with Egypt. But that relationship is ""a little like being in bed with the Mafia,"" author Ron Suskind told CNN's ""Parker Spitzer."" ""If someone knocks on your door at night and you disappear, Omar Suleiman is probably behind it,"" said Suskind, whose 2006 book ""The One Percent Doctrine"" detailed the Bush administration's post-9/11 counterterrorism policies. ""He is a feared man, and certainly not a man with any legitimacy when it comes to rule of law or any of the principles we prized in America."" In 2002, al Qaeda captive Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi ""was tortured rather dramatically"" by Suleiman's agents, Suskind said, yielding a ""confession"" that Iraq had trained the terrorist group in the use of chemical and biological weapons. His assertion was a key point in the Bush administration's arguments for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but he recanted it once back in U.S. hands. That sort of history leaves an opening for critics to question U.S. support for democratic change in Egypt, Suskind said. ""The fact is, we are allied with the people they're trying to overthrow, and right now the United States hasn't done much to separate those bonds,"" he said. Suleiman had long been mentioned as a possible successor to Mubarak, along with the aging ruler's son, Gamal. A 2007 U.S. cable called his loyalty to Mubarak ""rock solid,"" and some analysts viewed his vice presidential appointment as a way for Mubarak to make a graceful exit. Suleiman is even credited with saving Mubarak's life. On a state visit to Ethiopia in 1995, Mubarak was to have traveled in a normal vehicle but Suleiman insisted that the president's armored Mercedes be flown in from Cairo. Accounts of an assassination attempt on Mubarak vary but it's believed that Suleiman was sitting next to Mubarak when a hail of bullets pinged off the car. The bond forged that day cemented their relationship. But Suleiman's attempts at dialogue with opposition parties were derided by protesters, and the Obama administration criticized the talks for including too few opposition groups. Vice President Joe Biden told Suleiman on Tuesday that Egypt needed ""immediate, irreversible progress"" toward meeting protesters' demands, and leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei said Suleiman and Mubarak ""are twins."" ""This is an act of deception at a grand scale,"" ElBaradei said. Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University, said Mubarak's Thursday speech did him little good. Not only was it too little, too late, he said, but his announcement that he was ceding power to Suleiman was buried in an ""incredibly patronizing"" speech. ""Had he done this a couple of weeks ago, it actually may have done something,"" Brown said. But now, he said, ""All the constitutional, legal tools are in their hands, and it doesn't' do them any good. So I don't think they're sure what to do."" CNN's Matt Smith, Saad Abedine and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","Omar Suleiman, the former intelligence chief, now wields most power in Egypt .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Eight American tourists -- six women and two men -- were killed in a traffic accident Sunday while on a tour bus in Aswan, Egypt, the country's interior ministry said. An additional 19 American tourists and two Egyptians -- the bus driver and a tour guide -- were injured. A total of 116 American tourists were traveling in three tour buses. The interior ministry said the middle bus -- carrying 37 of the tourists -- crashed into a parked dump truck loaded with sand. Video of the crash site showed one side of the bus completely sheared off, with some seats dangling from the vehicle's shell. Dried blood could be seen on some of the crumpled wreckage. Twelve of those injured were taken to Nasser Medical Institute in Cairo, according to the hospital's head, Dr. Bahaa Al-deen Ziad. Two of the crash victims are in the hospital's intensive care unit in critical but stable condition, Ziad said. The 10 others were admitted to the hospital in stable condition and are being examined by doctors with specialties in neurosurgery, orthopedics and plastic surgery, he said. Aswan is a popular tourist site in Egypt located about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away from Cairo. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a statement Sunday saying it was ""deeply saddened"" by the accident. ""The embassy has confirmed that the injured are being moved by military transport to Cairo, and has mobilized staff to identify and to assist those Americans involved,"" the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Khaled Abdel Nasser, son of late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and a key figure during a 1980s Egyptian revolt, is dead, a spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor said Sunday. He was 62. Nasser was battling liver disease and went into a coma two weeks before his death on September 15, said Adel Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman. He was accused of organizing a revolt against Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, signed in 1979, and also grabbed headlines after being tried in connection with the deaths of two Israeli diplomats in Egypt. He was eventually acquitted. The late president's eldest son was an engineering professor at Cairo University and had lived in Yugoslavia.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A northern Italian region has approved a measure to pay women from low-income families not to have abortions. Authorities from the Lombardy Region, on Italy's border with Switzerland, approved the creation of a 5-million euro ($6.1 million) fund aimed at providing help to low-income families, the region said on its website this week. The fund would grant about 4,500 euros ($5,500) a year to a woman who changes her mind about having an abortion because of economic reasons. The woman would receive 250 euros ($306) a month for 18 months, according to the site. ""We want to help the family, maternity, and birth rate, removing the obstacles as much as possible, beginning with those of an economic nature that make it more difficult to choose in favor of life,"" said the region's president, Roberto Formigone. The option of accepting the check will be presented to women in abortion clinics during the consultations they have prior to having an abortion, the site said. The region's health department said economic reasons were the predominant reason that woman have abortions. Critics attacked the measure as ""a short-term solution to a long-term problem,"" according to Italian media. The fund is called ""Nasko,"" a play on the Italian word ""nasco,"" which roughly translates to ""I'm being born."" About 128,000 abortions are performed in Italy every year, according to the Italian Health Ministry. That compares to 195,743 in England and Wales last year, according to the British Department of Health, and 846,181 in the United States in 2006, according to the most recent figures reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"(CNN) -- When Catherine al-Talli was 13 years old, a group of strangers came knocking at her family's home in Syria. It was 1992. Her mother let them in, and feverishly they explained that earlier that day they saw Syrian security forces surround al-Talli's father, a democracy activist, at a bus station. ""They told us that 10 of them, the forces, had their guns out and they were all around my father. They kidnapped him and pushed him into a car,"" she recalled. Though they were just children, she and her siblings knew exactly what had happened. They knew their father risked his life as an activist who opposed the Syrian regime. He was paying for that, and now too would their family. It's hard for al-Talli to talk about her father. Shortly after the regime changed hands in 2000 from father to son, he was released from prison. But al-Talli's father had been tortured, forever scarred and changed. ""This is difficult to talk about,"" said al-Talli who became a human rights attorney and activist, inspired by her father's work. ""It's really hard to find your dad kidnapped because of his doing good."" Until a few months ago, father and daughter were living in Syria. But their activism had made them both targets, and they're now temporarily living in the United States. They watch the horror of their country on the nightly news. On Thursday, the United Nations announced that the number of people killed since protests began this year against the regime of Bashar al-Assad had surpassed 4,000. More than 300 children have lost their lives, and the U.N. reports that children have been specifically targeted, and some tortured to death. According to a September U.N. report, the human suffering behind those numbers looks like this: . Security forces opening fire on a funeral procession in Dar'aa, a city near the border with Jordan; security force snipers on rooftops picking off demonstrators in Damascus; the bodies of those missing, including children, being returned to their families with their bodies torn apart by torture. Water tanks, food supplies, electricity -- everything needed to survive has been targeted by Syrian army and security forces, according to the report. Thousands of people have been arrested. More than 14,000 are reported to be in detention as a result of al-Assad's crackdown on the opposition, Pillay said, and at least 12,400 people have fled their homes to neighboring countries. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay cited a report released Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry which concluded that security and military forces ""committed crimes against humanity"" against civilians. Syria officially denied access to commission investigators but they still managed to interview 223 victims and witnesses, including military and security forces who had defected. Foreign journalists have been blocked from entering Syria. Al-Assad told a British paper that Syria ""will not bow down"" and that any potential foreign military action against his country would lead to ""very dire"" consequences. But the bloodshed and the blocking of journalists and rights workers will not discourage protesters, al-Talli said. ""The Syrian people have known what the price of freedom would be,"" she said. ""They knew it would be very high. ""We know that the rest of the world understands that. They believe that the international community will not let the al-Assad regime commit more crimes."" Al-Talli has participated in demonstrations against al-Assad, including the March 16 rally in Marjeh Square in Damascus when 150 protesters held pictures of their imprisoned relatives. While demonstrating in mid-May, she was detained by security forces who took her cell phone and her professional attorney identification, she told CNN.com. ""I don't them, 'You cannot arrest me without [reason], I'm a lawyer.' They didn't listen."" Al-Talli said she was held in a cell in Damascus for 48 hours in the same government building where he father had spent time behind bars. She believes that because she was a well-known activist and attorney, her case was pushed to a judge and she was released within a week. From May to September, al-Talli went into hiding, sleeping in different places constantly. She felt that the government was constantly watching her and monitoring her cell phone conversations, a tactic that the al-Assad regime is reportedly using to track and thwart opposition strategy. She chose to leave Syria in September and relocated in the United States. She continues to talk with her friends in Syria, all of varying religious and tribal backgrounds. She insisted that it's a falsehood spread by al-Assad's regime that the fighting in Syria is between tribes and religions. ""I have stood next to people of all religions,"" she said. ""I am Christian. I have stood beside Muslims, Christians, Alawis, Druze and Sunnis. This is not about our differences."" Andrew Tabler, an American journalist, scholar and Syria expert, has lived in the country and experienced firsthand the growth of discontent against al-Assad, who become president in 2000 when his father, Hafez al-Assad, died after ruling for 29 years. Tabler's new book, ""In the Lion's Den,"" is an in-depth look at the Assads, as well as a deep-dive analysis of Washington's long fraught relationship with Syria. Bashar al-Assad and his British wife, Asma al-Assad, were perceived for years as reformers, by and large. They touted social-service nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and spoke about reliance on civil society. The NGOs were efforts to stem what the regime understood as a huge threat -- frustration and restlessness among Syria's young population and the lack of jobs and opportunities in the country, Tabler said. ""Determination has been growing for some time. Now, did we expect [the protesting] to go on this long? No. I don't think anyone did,"" he said. Tabler said he believes sanctions imposed recently on Syria will weaken the Assad regime. The European Union stepped up sanctions against the nation's oil industry by blacklisting state-owned firms that oversee exploration and trade. The U.S. Treasury on Thursday sanctioned two government-controlled entities and two high-ranking Syrians, including Mohammad Makhlouf, al-Assad's uncle and father of long-serving financial adviser Rami Makhlouf. Rami Makhlouf is already under U.S. sanctions. Another was Aus Aslan, a Syrian general. Turkey has also imposed sanctions against regime insiders. ""In terms of Syria running out of money, they'll have an impact,"" Tabler said. ""These are comprehensive [sanctions] and they will have a tremendous impact. Will the regime be over tomorrow? Not at all. That's going to take some work and time. But the death toll for November is the highest it has been so far so that means it's getting worse, not better."" During her exile, al-Talli has met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt to stress that the protests will continue until al-Assad's regime ends. In October she joined the Syrian National Council, an opposition coalition created during the 2011 uprising. The Council was formed in Istanbul last month and encompasses representatives of local committees inside Syria and exiled personalities, as well as Islamist and secular representatives. Al-Talli wants to continue speaking out. One day she'll return to Syria. ""We called our revolution the Syrian Dignity Revolution,"" she said. ""We decided as Syrian people to go into the street and get our human dignity back. We will not go back to our homes without it.""","Syrian protester's father was political prisoner when she was a girl .

"(CNN) -- When tens of thousands hit the streets to decry an authoritarian regime -- calling for its overthrow, trying to overrun police, setting fires -- one might expect the arrival of army tanks would be met with fear, consternation and violence. But not in Egypt. The warm embrace that demonstrators gave troops this week illustrated the military's respected and central role in Egyptian society. This fact makes the armed forces potentially a kingmaker in the current crisis, while also showcasing its challenge to somehow re-establish security without undermining its popularity. ""How they behave on the streets is going to matter a whole lot,"" said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank. ""That's going to be the dilemma: Can they maintain the order without antagonizing the public that they need?"" The ascendance began in 1952, when the military helped overthrow Egypt's ruling monarch. Its support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many Egyptians. ""There's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem,"" said Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst, author and fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security. ""The army has done relatively well."" All males between ages 18 and 30 must serve one to three years, as the CIA World Factbook notes, meaning almost every family in Egypt has some personal connection to the military. Still, one of the military's biggest assets in the eyes of everyday Egyptians may be that it is not the widely reviled security force. The U.S. State Department has frequently blasted Egyptian police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights, including in its most recent 2009 Human Rights Report. ""They're held in great disdain by their own population, for very good reason,"" Bergen said. ""They know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason."" This animosity boiled over this week, when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations. On Friday, there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens' attempts to take the Interior Ministry in Cairo, the security forces' headquarters. Just blocks away, in Tahrir Square, it was a very different and far more festive scene: Joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them, sometimes literally. This showering of love on the military, which were deployed Friday to patrol the streets for the first time since the mid-1980s was repeated many times over throughout Egypt. Video footage from Cairo showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks, with no repercussions. Many of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol, with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture. In Alexandria, where at least 2,000 gathered in Raml Square on Saturday, protesters chanted, ""The military and the people together will change the regime."" That said, these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of President Mubarak -- a former hero in the Air Force and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans, including Saturday's appointment of Omar Suleiman (a former lieutenant general in the army) as vice president, the first time Mubarak has tapped someone for that role in his 30 years in power. Experts aren't surprised Mubarak has moved to align himself with the military even more so, recognizing the armed forces' place in Egypt. Still, by doing so, he also created a quandary for the military: Do they back Mubarak, whom they report to? Or do they support the people, having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation? Andrew Pierre, a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president. But the rank and file are a different story, especially if they are called on to beat back civilians. ""They're military people for two years or so, and I don't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets,"" Pierre said, adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens. Through the first five days of the crisis, the 450,000-strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways: refraining from acting against demonstrators, but at the same time vowing to bring order. Still, even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from 4 p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday, there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless. Telhami, though, thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands: behind Mubarak or the protesters. And their decision, many believe, will determine Egypt's future. ""It's all going to depend ... on where the military will be,"" he said.","Protesters have embraced Egyptian troops since they were deployed on the streets .
This is in sharp contrast toward how they've approached the much reviled national police .
The military is well represented in Mubarak's government .
An expert says the military must decide how to keep order without antagonizing the public ."
"(CNN) -- They lined up hundreds strong to touch the dirt. Some fell to their knees, clutching the gritty stuff as though it were a long-lost child. Others lifted it to their lips to savor a taste of the home they left behind decades ago. Exiles -- who face never returning to Tibet as long as it is under Chinese rule -- stood on Tibetan soil this week, fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the Himalayas. Only, this week, they were able to do it in Dharamsala, the Indian hilltown that functions as the de facto capital of the refugee community. The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol, 29, who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation. He did not want to disclose details of the soil's journey, fearful of the repercussions of the act of smuggling. All he would say is that it was a ""complicated process that took 17 months."" Rigdol then spread the dirt over a stage the size of a basketball court and called it ""Our Land, Our People."" He invited Tibetans to walk on his dirt, write on it or pick up a microphone to express themselves. He knew it could never be the same as actually returning to Tibet, but perhaps, he thought, it would spark a sliver of that feeling. He thought of his father on Wednesday when the installation opened and people lined up, many overwhelmed with emotion. The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time. But he fell ill in 2007 and died. A father's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to ""return"" home again. And others like him, who were born outside of Tibet, to finally feel native earth they have never had under their feet. ""There are so many like my father who wanted to return,"" Rigdol said. ""And many more who have never been to Tibet."" Tenzin Dorjee, 31, remembers receiving cell phone texts at 4:30 in the morning when his excited friend first came up with his idea. The message was so long that it got broken into three. ""He was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from Tibet,"" Dorjee said. ""I was blown away. My first reaction was: how is that possible?"" But then Dorjee began visualizing the project and how much of an impact it was sure to have on Tibetan exiles. ""The implications,"" he said, ""seemed historic."" Known as the ""roof of the world,"" Tibet is a remote Buddhist region governed by Communist China. Beijing claims its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries and views the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as a separatist. About 150,000 Tibetans live in exile, a majority of them in Dharamsala, according to their governing body. The Dalai Lama set up residence there after Chinese forces crushed a 1959 Tibetan uprising. The Dalai Lama summoned Rigdol to his residence after the opening of the installation Wednesday, Rigdol said. Rigdol carried with him some of the Tibetan dirt. Using his index finger, the Dalai Lama, wrote Tibet in the dirt and blessed the soil. Meanwhile, monks in their flowing maroon and saffron robes queued up, as did parents holding babies. ""It was very exciting,"" said Tenzing Geche, 22, a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet. He touched the dirt and felt a connection like no other. ""I felt I was back in my own country,"" he said. Tenzing Tfuengue, 17, has never been to Tibet -- he was born and raised in India. He has longed to go to Tibet, feel the air there, drink the water, see the land that possesses his soul. ""Today, (Rigdol) made it a little bit possible,"" Tfuengue said. For Lhadon Tethong, 35, a Canadian visiting family in Dharamsala, the installation was bittersweet. It was completely inspiring at one moment and in another, as she watched elderly Tibetans fall to the ground, sadness overcame her. ""I am normally better with words than this,"" she said, unable to complete her sentence. There was no overt political statement in Rigdol's art, but some Tibetans hoped it would inspire resistance to Chinese rule. China blames Tibetan unrest on the exiled community. But no matter the consequences, Rigdol's art will carry on. The installation will stay up until Friday. But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see.","Tibetans who long to see their homeland were able to touch native soil again .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- As fighting continued in the Libyan cities of Ajdabiya and Misrata Sunday, a rebel spokesman questioned the commitment of NATO's mission there. Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi were bombing Ajdabiya from 40-50 kilometers (25-31 miles) away, Libyan rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN. The loyalists who were bombing the city ""have no problem with the weather conditions there,"" referring to unconfirmed reports that NATO airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions. Gadhafi's forces are using Grad missiles and mortars, ""and sometimes we feel that NATO wants to use any excuse out there so they don't carry out their duties,"" he said. NATO did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about its operations Sunday. Earlier, however, the NATO press office told CNN that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports. The most official report from NATO states that it conducted 142 sorties on Saturday, of which 42 were strike sorties. U.S. allies face unease without U.S. at helm . Meanwhile, in Misrata, six people were killed and 47 injured in Sunday fighting, Abdulmolah said. Misrata remains in control of the rebels, he said, though they are still fighting some 200 to 300 Gadhafi troops inside the city. ""We are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of Gadhafi's death squads,"" he said. The rebel spokesman also criticized NATO's role in Misrata. ""We still need NATO's assistance, but we don't understand what they are up to,"" he said. In one instance, rebel fighters pushed back Gadhafi's squads to a shoe factory, from where they were bombing residential areas in the city, he said. NATO refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility, he said. In the end, the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory, which they burned after abandoning. ""We can't understand (NATO's) excuses,"" Abdulmolah said. ""We want to save our population from being murdered by these merciless death squads. Earlier, an opposition member said loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles. Photographs indicated they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas. The lethal weapons have blown off people's limbs and killed children, the council member said Saturday. The report came a day after Human Rights Watch reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode Thursday night in a Misrata neighborhood. The activist group said it inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings. The Libyan government has denied the use of such bombs, which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians after a conflict ends. In the Lubyan capital, Tripoli, hundreds of chanting supporters waved green flags and pledged loyalty to Gadhafi after thunderous explosionsbelieved to be NATO airstrikes pounded targets in the capital. ""I have a message to NATO and to the United Kingdom and France,"" a man wrapped in a green flag said Saturday night. ""We say to them, we will kill you if you come to our land."" Others chanted, ""go go Sarkozy,"" referring to French President Nicolas Sarkozy. France is one of the nations taking part in the coalition airstrikes. ""Everyone here will die for Moammar Gadhafi,"" a young man said. The supporters gathered at Gadhafi's compound in the capital hours after NATO apparently hit targets in Tripoli and its outskirts Saturday night. Libyan forces reacted with anti-aircraft fire. With no signs of an end to the war, immigrants have scrambled to flee the nation. International Organization for Migration said Saturday that a boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the port cit of Misrata. The area has been bombarded daily by Gadhafi's forces, according to witnesses. Witnesses have reported dire conditions in the city, including food shortages and the fear of pro-Gadhafi snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets. At least 700 people have died since violence erupted in Misrata two months ago, a medical director said. Despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets, Gadhafi remains defiant and has rebuffed global calls to stop attacks on civilians. At a news conference in Benghazi, the deputy chairman of Libya's Transitional National Council appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy. He said 1.5 million Libyans were under attack every day. ""We already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians,"" Abdul Hafiz Ghoga told reporters. ""The international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of. The destruction in Misrata and other cities is unacceptable."" NATO has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians.

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Languishing in a Cairo prison last year, a prisoner noticed that every day, the prison staff would clean the adjacent cell, even though there was no one in it. Why, the prisoner asked his guards, did they do it? It's for Barack Obama, they responded. Because when he loses the election, he'll surely be thrown in jail, so this way, a cell will be ready for him. Every day, the prisoner said, he prayed in his cell that Obama would win. The prisoner was Ayman Nour, a liberal politician who in 2005 ran against and lost to Egypt's aging ruler, Hosni Mubarak, in the country's first multiparty presidential elections. Soon afterward, he was convicted of electoral fraud and sent to jail. He was released earlier this year. Nour said he had received an invitation from the American Embassy to attend President Obama's address to the Muslim world at Cairo University on Thursday. He said he doesn't plan to attend, but will watch it on television. ""That way,"" he said, ""if I hear something I don't like, I can always change the channel with my remote control."" The way that Nour prayed for an Obama victory, but will not go to hear him in person, is typical of the ambiguities in how many in Egypt and throughout the Muslim world view Obama's much touted address to the world's nearly 1.5 billion Muslims.  Watch shopkeepers say what they want from Obama » . On the one hand, at least in Egypt, Obama is the most popular American president in years. Almost everyone you meet is almost starry-eyed over the new American leader. On the other hand, the region has a long history of disappointment with the United States. Egyptian reformists look back bitterly on their experience during the Bush administration, which, after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, launched an initiative to push for political liberalization in the Middle East. In 2005, then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a speech that sent a shockwave through Egypt. Journalist Ethar El-Katatney recalled, ""She said that in the last 60 years, the U.S. pursued stability at the expense of democracy. We all said, 'wow!' "" The mounting American pressure on the dictators, the demonstrations, the rediscovery of long-lost voices raised against authoritarian regimes like Egypt's sparked talk of an ""Arab spring,"" a long-overdue blossoming of freedom and democracy in the political desert of the Middle East. But the Bush administration's passion for Arab democracy cooled dramatically when Egypt's powerful Islamist network, the Muslim Brotherhood, made stunning gains in parliamentary elections in late 2005. And the passion went stone cold in January 2006, when the militant Palestinian Islamic group Hamas was swept to power in democratic elections in Gaza and the West Bank. Sensing Washington's worry, Arab dictators and their ruthless security services saw their chance, and slowly started to squeeze the brave few who had been calling for change. Award-winning Egyptian blogger Wael Abbas experienced the thrill of the ""Arab spring,"" but since then has had plenty of run-ins with Egypt's secret police. He has no illusions about what matters to the United States, Obama's charisma notwithstanding.  Watch how Egyptians are looking for concrete results » . ""It's OK for these countries to be oppressive,"" he said, ""as long as they are allies [of the United States], as long as they are not communists, as long as they allow investment, as long as they allow McDonald's and Hardee's and whatever businesses to be open here. But if they are dictators, [the United States] doesn't care about human rights, as long as they are allies, as long as they keep peace with Israel, it's OK."" ""We have a fundamental problem with America,"" Nour said in an interview at his flat Monday. ""America always takes positive steps, then setbacks happen, and usually America puts its interests above its principles.""  Watch Egyptian youths give their views on Obama's trip » . And this is what Obama may want to keep in mind when he addresses the Muslim world from Cairo. People here are eager for concrete initiatives, not a rousing speech with no follow-up. This is a region that has often had great faith in the good intentions of the United States, only to watch as that faith was betrayed. ""It can't be all rainbows and roses,"" said El-Katatney, the journalist. ""We don't want any more grand promises. Obama talks brilliantly, but we've become a bit cynical.""","President Obama is heading to Egypt to make address to Muslim world .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's attorney general issued an order Monday freezing the assets of former President Hosni Mubarak and his family and prohibiting them from leaving the country. Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud ordered the moves after Mustafa Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than  200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews. ""I submitted the corruption documents on Sunday night and on Monday morning I was called in by the public prosecutor for investigation, and he asked me to rush to his office."" Bakri told CNN. ""The attorney general, himself, went over the documents in my possession and then issued his orders to bar Mubarak and his family from travelling and to impound their assets."" Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, EgyNews reported. The seizures include ""movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets."" It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from a similar one reported last week. Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as ""fabrications and baseless rumors."" But Bakri said the documents he provided to Mahmoud ""are the first solid and concrete evidence on the fortune collected illegally by Mubarak and his family.""

"(CNN) -- Iran has detained six documentary filmmakers on accusations that they worked for the British Broadcasting Corporation's Persian service, activists said on Monday. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran urged authorities to end the ""ongoing intimidation and arrest of filmmakers and journalists"" and called on diplomats and journalists in New York to press President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his country's rights record during his reported visit to New York this week. ""These arrests prove yet again that President Ahmadinejad and his intelligence apparatus have no tolerance for independent filmmakers and journalists,"" Aaron Rhodes, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement. ""If the president expects the international community to respect his right to speak in New York, then he should be forced to explain why filmmakers and media are subject to repression in Iran,"" he added. Citing sources, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said the six documentary filmmakers were detained over the weekend and taken to prison. It said a pro-government news agency accused the filmmakers of working for BBC Persian and spying for the service. The BBC said Monday that no one works for the Persian service inside Iran and noted that the arrests came one day after the service broadcast a documentary on Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. The documentary was an in-house production and none of the detained filmmakers worked on it, the BBC reported. In a news story posted on its website, the BBC quoted its language service chief, Liliane Landor, as saying the arrests are part of the ""ongoing efforts by the Iranian government to put pressure on the BBC."" Also Monday, the Iranian minister of culture and Islamic guidance told the semiofficial Iranian Students' News Agency that the intelligence ministry is responsible for providing details on the filmmakers' case. ""BBC Farsi was a major actor in the disturbances during and after the elections,"" Seyed Mohammad Hosseini told the agency, referring to the 2009 presidential elections. ""It agitated and guided the people in the hopes to create problems for the country. This is why the representative office of the BBC was shut down in Tehran at that time. Those who are working legally in Iran must now pay close attention and be very careful. We do not plan on supporting a network that engages in anti-Iran activities and works against the interests of the country,"" he said. That office of the BBC was reopened and remains open.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Air Force officials called off their response late Friday afternoon at a Tucson, Arizona, base after reports that an armed man had entered an office building, the U.S. military branch said in a statement. Earlier in the day, a U.S. military official told CNN that a gunman was believed to be holed up in a building at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. This precipitated the Air Force to call for a lock-down -- which began at 10:30 a.m. -- ""following the unconfirmed sighting of"" such a man. No shots were ever fired and law enforcement teams are on site, said the official, who had direct knowledge of the situation from conversations with base officials but did not want to be identified. In fact, at 6 p.m., Col. John Cherrey -- who commands the Air Force's 355th Fighter Wing -- told reporters that no gunman or weapon was ever found. He added that the building, where the gunman was once thought to have entered, has been secured after authorities went through it room-by-room. The announcement came about two hours after the Air Force stated that its officials had ""terminated"" their response to the incident. All base personnel were leaving via a ""controlled release."" ""With the help of the Tucson emergency services communities, Airmen were successful in maintaining the safety and security of the Desert Lightning Team,"" the Air Force said, alluding to the name used for Air Force personnel based in the arid southern Arizona locale. Earlier, Tucson Police Sgt. Maria Hawke said in an e-mailed statement that members of the department's SWAT team, hostage unit and bomb squad are near the site on a ""stand-by"" basis in case they are needed. But she said that they are ""not actively engaged in any enforcement, investigative or other activity."" And Manuel Johnson, a Phoenix-based spokesman for the FBI, added that some agency personnel have been dispatched to the base to help, if needed. Shortly before noon Friday, Staff Sgt. Caitlyn Jones confirmed that there was a security situation at the base and that it was on lock-down mode. ""It has been reduced to a single point of entry,"" she said. Borman Elementary School, which is located inside the base, was put on lock down at 11 a.m., said Karen Bynum, executive assistant to the Tucson school district's superintendent. Its 501 students were confined to their classrooms, with all perimeter doors locked. But shortly after 4 p.m., off-base parents were allowed onto the base to pick up students at the school and Sonoran Science Academy, according to a statement from the Air Force. On-base parents were told to ""take the most direct route"" to locations where their children may be. The incident occurs nearly two years after 13 people were killed in a shooting spree at the Fort Hood army base in Texas. CNN's Barbara Starr, Terry Frieden, Tina Burnside and Alta Spells contributed to this report.","NEW: An Air Force official says no gunman was found and the site is ""secure""

"(Parenting.com) -- Brace yourself for yet more stark economic news: babies may be suffering from more diaper rash in this down economy, reports Advertising Age, which is labeling ""America's baby bottoms"" as the ""economy's latest casualty."" Yes, that's right: tiny heinies as the latest economic indicator, according to Ad Age. Here are the hard numbers: the Centers for Disease Control reported that the number of babies ages 2 and under fell 3% last year while disposable diaper sales slipped a whopping 9%. And yet, there was a 2.8% increase in diaper rash cream, despite fewer babies. Parenting.com: How to potty train in one week . The inverse relation between diaper and rash ointment sales started in 2009 but has intensified in the last year, according to data from Deutsche Bank. The average American baby bottom sees 6.3 diapers a day, and with parents shelling out an average of $1,500 a year for diapers, it's easy to see why some might turn a blind eye to a slightly damp diaper (especially when disposable diapers are so absorbent nowadays). Parenting.com: Our favorite cloth diapers . And of course, parents are doing everything they can to meet their families' needs with less money, but is it really at the expense of their tots' tushes? We wouldn't be surprised if other explanations beyond parents skimping on diaper changes included folks making the switch to increasingly popular cloth diapers, others pushing potty training earlier, which Pampers marketer Procter & Gamble suggested, and even just more aggressive marketing efforts on the part of diaper cream makers and retailers.

"(CNN) -- A video purporting to be from a vigilante group whose goal is the eradication of the Zetas cartel from the state of Veracruz, Mexico, has surfaced on the Internet, but its credibility remains unproven. Five masked men dressed in black appear on the video, sitting behind a long table. The spokesman explains that they are a group called the ""Mata Zetas,"" or Zeta Killers. They describe themselves as an ""extermination"" force that works as the armed front ""of the people and for the people."" The speaker says that the group's only goal is to kill members of the Zetas, a ruthless cartel whose area of influence includes the eastern state of Veracruz. Members of the Mata Zetas are prohibited from committing crimes such as extortion or kidnappings, according to the video. The video was released via YouTube days after 35 bodies were found in two trucks during rush hour in the city of Boca del Rio. But is the video really evidence of the birth of a vigilante group in Veracruz? In the video, the speaker does not claim responsibility for the 35 deaths. It is also not the first time that a seemingly grassroots group emerged in Veracruz as a counterbalance to the cartels. In 2007, a group named the ""Gente Nueva,"" or New People, made itself known through menacing notes, web-posted videos, torture and executions and quasi-patriotic rhetoric. The group left notes next to bodies, claiming that the victims were Zetas or supporters of the Zetas. But U.S. officials with knowledge of the group said Gente Nueva was not a vigilante group but a facade for the Sinaloa cartel, which at the time was battling the Zetas and Gulf Cartel in Veracruz. The Zetas and Gulf cartel have since split into warring factions. Mexico's attorney general's office responded with a statement saying that it would investigate the video and any group that tries to take justice into its own hands. ""The only path to reach long-lasting security and peace is through the rule of law and strengthening of our institutions,"" the statement said. In October of last year, another possible paramilitary group surfaced in Michoacan state. A group calling itself the ""Pelotones Omega"" distributed fliers indicating its members would fight against kidnappers, murderers and other criminals.","A group called ""Zeta Killers"" releases a video on the Internet .

"Miami (CNN) -- Kris Rakowski put the dog out late Friday and looked to the skies above his Maple Grove, Minnesota, residence. He saw lights -- a bunch of them. ""They almost looked like fireballs or fireflies, strobing,"" Rakowski told CNN Saturday. The art director, 35, who first began looking for possible signs of a plummeting U.S. satellite around 10 p.m., grabbed his camera. He's pretty sure the photos he submitted to CNN's iReport were pieces of the satellite, which entered the Earth's atmosphere around that time. ""It was a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" he said. NASA said the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite's debris fell to Earth between 11:23 p.m. ET Friday and 1:09 a.m. ET Saturday. The satellite passed over Africa and North America and likely landed off the West Coast of the United States, NASA said. ""The precise re-entry time and location of debris impacts have not been determined,"" NASA said. ""Twenty-six satellite components, weighing a total of about 1,200 pounds, could have survived the fiery re-entry and reach the surface of Earth. However, NASA is not aware of any reports of injury or property damage. "" NASA officials said it's possible the satellite pieces hit the Pacific Ocean. Initial reported sightings of the disintegrating satellite had not proved credible because they were not near the proper track, the agency said. Reports of suspected sightings emerged from San Antonio, where a TV photographer caught images of bright objects darting rapidly in the night sky, and from Hawaii, where Robert Jeffcoat saw what he believed were two chunks from the satellite. Jeffcoat was running errands when the first flying object left a thick, white trail that lingered in the sky for about 20 minutes, he said. A second object followed the same path and was ""massive,"" he said. ""It was like a comet, but smoke,"" he said. ""I'm guessing it landed in the ocean, the way it was going."" Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team in Houston said before the rubbish fell that there was no way to know exactly where the pieces would come down. ""Part of the problem is, the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways, and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry,"" Matney said. NASA said space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back. ""This is nothing like the old Skylab scare of the '70s, when you had a 70-ton space station crashing out of the sky,"" McDowell said. Pieces of Skylab came down in western Australia in 1979. Jeffcoat said he was amazed his home of Paia, Maui, seemed to be an ideal place to watch hunks of a satellite rain from the sky. ""Of all the places in the world where it could hit, here it was, in Maui,"" he said. ""It was quite weird."" CNN's John Zarella, Holly Yan, Phil Gast and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Location of debris is still not determined .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He performed at Ellen DeGeneres' wedding this past summer, and he's as quick-witted as Adam Sandler. Could Joshua Radin be the next great wedding singer? Joshua Radin got a push from old friend Zach Braff, but has been making his own fans. ""No, don't say that,"" the singer-songwriter says good-naturedly. ""Wedding singers play covers and they're usually Motown songs. I don't know any Al Green."" Maybe not -- and Al Green didn't record for Motown, either -- but Radin hopes to put a little love in your heart with his sophomore album, ""Simple Times."" ""It's about my whole life. Every song I write is an honest account of my life. They're sort of like journal entries,"" he says. ""So this one's about falling in and out of love, it's about my friends, it's about my family. It's about the world we live in."" Radin's world has been anything but simple these past few years. Since actor Zach Braff -- a buddy from Northwestern University -- promoted the Cleveland, Ohio-born musician's tunes on the TV sitcom ""Scrubs,"" Radin's vulnerable lyrics and whispery delivery have caught on. Primetime programs like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""American Idol"" also used his music, and before long Radin had a debut album -- 2006's critically acclaimed ""We Were Here"" -- and a reason to hit the road. Radin (who has a loud, hearty laugh for a guy whose songs are pretty melancholy) dropped by CNN's New York offices to talk about how he landed that wedding gig, and some of the unusual surfaces he uses to jot down lyrics. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch Radin cause hearts to melt » . CNN: A lot of your songs are about heartache and heartbreak. Are you sad all the time? Joshua Radin: No, not at all. Just tired. CNN: Why so tired? Radin: Because I play a lot of shows all the time. When you're trying to get your music out to as many people as humanly possible, you gotta go places ... all the time, and talk about it and play songs and you get a little less sleep than you might like. It's cool. But in terms of the heartache I guess I get my sad out by writing songs. CNN: How do you get your happy out? Radin: Hanging out with people I like. CNN: Speaking of people you like, Zach Braff [is] a big buddy of yours ... Radin: Never met him. CNN: Liar! Radin: He's a very close friend and he's been very supportive. CNN: Some might say that without Zach Braff's support you might not have come to the fore as you have ... Radin: I wouldn't even be born. CNN: Do you sort of feel like you are going to be indebted to him for the rest of your life? Radin: No, he's pretty much indebted to me. I mean he got to launch my career (laughs). I'm just kidding. CNN: You sang at Ellen DeGeneres' wedding. How did that come about? Radin: I played her show in January and she came up to me after we soundchecked the song [""Today""] and said, ""That's the song I want to walk down the aisle to."" And I thought she was just being nice, really. And then about two days before the wedding -- I was on tour -- I got a call saying she wanted me to come in and she was going to have her wedding for a very intimate gathering at her house. And she wanted me to play about five or six of my songs ... CNN: The happy ones, I hope. Radin: Yeah, I only have about five or six songs about falling in love. The rest are about falling out of love or about politics or something ... things that maybe wouldn't be great for a wedding. And I'd never played a wedding. [I] had never really gone to any weddings ... but I sang six of my own songs and it was really cool. [There were] about 20 people sitting around a couch in her living room, and Portia [de Rossi] and Ellen were sitting in two chairs right in front of me and I got walked in. I was Ellen's surprise for Portia. CNN: Tell me about the single. Radin: It's called ""I'd Rather Be With You."" It's a little love song. I wrote it about my ex-girlfriend right after we broke up and I was missing her. But the song doesn't sound sad. It's sort of about someone who waits on you a long time to make a decision and then after it's over, how we all want something more ... after it's gone. The video is just me and Katrina Bowden, the actress from ""30 Rock,"" and we shot it on Super 8 so it's real grainy and looks like an old home movie. It was Zach's concept. CNN: You started out as a screenwriter ... Radin: Sort of. I started out as a painter and an art teacher for kids. That's what I studied in school and I taught fifth through seventh grade in Chicago. And then I lived in New York for about six years writing screenplays. And then about four years ago I wrote my first song. CNN: So in terms of expressing yourself artistically, songs are where you feel at home? Radin: At the moment. I like to express myself creatively and it doesn't matter the medium. Whatever medium I choose at that moment, whatever works the best. It's like choosing production on a song; whether [you use] drums or piano or guitar ... you service the song. So in terms of the medium I guess I service the sentiment. If there's something that I really need to say that I can't say by speaking to someone, I usually write it in a song or a letter to someone. I usually can be more honest writing songs than actually talking to people. CNN: What would you say is the best setting to listen to your music? Radin: Driving in the car on a road trip. Riding the subway. Traveling. It's traveling music. CNN: Because you're a traveler? You're a bit of a nomad? Radin: I am and I write my songs usually while I'm walking around. Or in a car. Or in a bus, a plane, something like that. I jot down lyrics wherever I am. Usually it's on a vomit bag on an airplane or something. [I] just look for a pen (laughs).","Joshua Radin's new album is ""Simple Times""

"(CNN) -- The hefty last meal ordered but not eaten by an executed Texas inmate brought a complaint from a state senator and the end Thursday to the practice of special menus. Sen. John Whitmire, chairman of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee, wrote Thursday that he opposed the practice of providing a last meal of choice to the condemned. ""It is extremely inappropriate to give a person sentenced to death such a privilege. One which the perpetrator did not provide to their victim,"" Whitmire wrote. The Democrat, who represents Houston and parts of north Harris County, said ""enough is enough"" after Lawrence Russell Brewer ordered two chicken fried steaks smothered in gravy with sliced onions, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with other ingredients, a large bowl of fried okra with ketchup, three fajitas, a pint of Blue Bell ice cream and a pound of barbecue with a half-loaf of white bread. The meal request also included a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts, a pizza and three root beers. Brewer declined to eat the last meal Wednesday, said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. Whitmire, in asking the state to stop special requests, said he would seek the change by law if necessary. ""I believe Senator Whitmire's concerns regarding the practice of allowing death row offenders to choose their last meal are valid,"" Brad Livingston, executive director of the Department of Criminal Justice, said in statement released Thursday. ""Effective immediately, no such accommodations will be made. They will receive the same meal served to other offenders on the unit."" Brewer, 44, was executed for his involvement in the infamous racially motivated 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Lawrence Russell Brewer ordered extensive last meal and didn't eat it .

Within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family, work and politics, Murdoch had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80-year-old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him. The tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself. Twitter creator Jack Dorsey -- one of only four people being followed by Murdoch -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing ""with his own voice, in his own way."" Murdoch appears to have made his Twitter debut on New Year's Eve with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late Apple boss Steve Jobs, which he called ""interesting but unfair."" These were followed by praise for cinema releases ""We Bought a Zoo,"" and ""The Descendants,"" both produced by Murdoch's Fox Movies. These fueled suspicions that Murdoch's Twitter account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year. ""Could be brilliant News Corp PR operation,"" Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff tweeted after earlier commenting: ""Might be somebody who knows Murdoch, but it's not Rupert (he doesn't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email)."" Others claimed that the voice of the tweets, as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation, were unmistakably Murdoch. ""You can tell by the tweets he's doing it himself,"" wrote CNN's Piers Morgan, a former editor of one of Murdoch's newspapers. A spokesperson for Murdoch's News Corp. confirmed to CNN the account is genuine. The account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at News of the World, one of his most profitable newspapers, illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures. Twitter played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper. Commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in Murdoch's decision to shut the paper down. Murdoch's subsequent appearance before a British parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on Twitter, particularly after his wife, Wendi Deng, pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie. There were echoes of Murdoch's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the ""most humble day day of my life"" -- in New Year pledges which he tweeted in a January 1 message to Dorsey. ""My resolutions, try to maintain humility and always curiosity. And of course diet!"" But there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media. Reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after Deng leapt to his aid once again. The Sydney Morning Herald -- a fierce rival of his Australian publications -- was among news outlets claiming that Murdoch was guilty of ""tweeting-before-thinking"" for suggesting that the British have too many holidays for a ""broke country."" The message was apparently removed, but not before someone tweeting as Wendi Deng implored: ""RUPERT!!! delete tweet!"" A further post on the unverified Deng account later added: ""EVERY1 @rupertmurdoch was only having a joke pROMSIE!!!"" [sic] . Murdoch also follows an account that appears on the surface to be Google CEO Larry Page but is actually run by a man in Virginia. It's not clear whether Murdoch realizes he's not following the real Larry Page. Among other tweets by Murdoch, who also follows Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and Silcon Valley entrepreneur and British businessman Alan Sugar, were an expression of support for Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum.","Rupert Murdoch has notched up more than 45,000 followers after joining Twitter .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The investigation into the suicide bombing that killed 17 people on Saturday suggests it was the work of the Pakistan-based Haqqani network, an Afghan official said Monday. ""We have some contacts and some evidence on the ground and some information about the vehicles used and the people used,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said, stressing that the results of the investigation were preliminary. ""This is another sophisticated attack by the operatives of the Haqqani network, and we are also optimistic to arrest some of their operatives in Kabul in the days ahead,"" he said. However, a spokesman for international forces in Afghanistan, which lost nine troops in the attack, said they have no indications yet that the Haqqani network was involved. ""All we have seen so far is that the Taliban have claimed responsibility. That doesn't necessarily mean that it was them, but we have no other indications,"" said Brig. Gen. Cartsen Jacobsen. ""The case has to be looked at."" Another International Security Assistance Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, added that their intelligence at this point gave no indication of the involvement of the Haqqanis. The Saturday attack killed 13 people in a NATO convoy and four Afghan civilians. Nine of the 13 were American, including five U.S. troops. The blast also claimed the lives of two British civilians, a Kosovo national and a Canadian soldier. U.S. officials have been increasingly vocal about the threat posed by the Haqqani network in recent months, arguing the organization has ties to Pakistani intelligence and enjoys safe havens in the country from whence it is able to launch attacks across the border in Afghanistan. In September, then-U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen called the Haqqani network a ""veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence."" A Pentagon report on the war in Afghanistan released last week said that the ability of insurgents to flee to safe havens in Pakistan was the biggest risk to the effort to stabilize Afghanistan after nearly a decade of war. The report singled out the Haqqani network as one that has carried out major attacks. Founded in Pakistan to fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the Haqqani network has been blamed for killing more than 1,000 coalition and Afghan forces, including attacks on the U.S. Embassy and other targets in Kabul. Pakistani officials have rejected claims that they support the group, but acknowledge that they are in contact with it. This month, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged that U.S. representatives met with Haqqani officials to discuss the possibility of negotiations that would end hostilities.","NEW: ISAF spokesmen say they have no indications Haqqani network was involved .

"New York (CNN) -- As snow fell across New York harbor, Isabel Belarsky said she clutched her mother, Clara, aboard a passenger ship that puttered toward Ellis Island, and wondered what their new lives would bring. The year was 1930. About a week earlier, the 10 year-old girl from what is now called Saint Petersburg, Russia, had embarked on a transatlantic journey with her Ukrainian parents from the French port city of Cherbourg, escaping what she described as Jewish persecution at the start of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. On an island near Manhattan stood the copper colossus that would etch her first memories of the new world. ""It was a wonderful sight,"" she said of the Statue of Liberty, which marks its 125th anniversary Friday. The idea for the monument is thought to have been first conceived at a 19th century dinner party among French aristocrats, historians say, who sought to pay tribute to American liberty. And while the French gift is also widely believed to have at least in part catered to domestic politics, for many it quickly became a symbol of hope and promise in America's post- Civil War period. ""The arrival on Ellis Island is the fulfillment that you know something good is going to happen to you,"" said Belarksy, now a 91-year-old widow living in a Russian enclave of Brooklyn, New York. Her family became part of the more than 12 million immigrants processed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954, according to the U.S. National Park Service. Adjacent to Ellis towers Lady Liberty, measuring more than 305 feet from base to torch. Originally, the statue was supposed to be an Egyptian peasant girl that would have stood at the entrance of Egypt's then-new Suez Canal, historians say, but plans would later evolve into the Roman goddess that would instead adorn New York harbor. ""The sculptor, (Frederic) Bartholdi, was very clever,"" said Edward Berenson, professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University. ""He put (the statue) where he did because its right at the narrows of New York harbor, so he knew that every boat that came into New York would have to come really close to it. People felt like they could reach out and touch it,"" he said. Inspired perhaps by Egypt's colossal statues during his own travels to Cairo, Berenson added, Bartholdi sought to build a monument of his own in a tribute to American liberty and its new found emancipation of slaves. The statue rests atop a sculpted wrangling of broken chains on New York's Liberty Island. Only years later, Berenson argues, did the monument come to symbolize immigration to the broader public, despite the structure's engraved plaque bearing the now famous poem by Emma Lazarus, who asks for the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Like many who made the perilous journey, Belarsky said she had often wondered what kind of life was waiting for her on the shores behind the copper monument. ""It was quite frightening,"" she recalled. ""The three of us, my father, my mother and I, wanted for someone to come with money or to tell us whats next."" And though a U.S. law passed six years earlier had largely restricted immigration, her father, Sidor, had managed to secure three tickets to America by way of a talent scout who visited the Leningrad conservatory where he had performed as an opera singer. ""He had such a beautiful voice,"" she said. Their travel permit, however, was only temporary. Sidor had acquired a six-month visa to teach at Brigham Young University, said Belarsky. Still, the young family would nonetheless settle more permanently in a west Manhattan apartment. And unlike many who eventually returned to their homelands in Europe, the Belarskys decided to leave Saint Petersburg -- then known as Leningrad -- behind. ""Authorities were starting to clamp down and consolidate the social state and Soviet power around Stalin,"" said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. ""As an opera singer, you might not have wanted to start singing Soviet anthems."" So the young family left Russia without plans to return, Belarsky added. And though many immigrants entered the United States through Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami; historians say steamship companies most often cruised into New York harbor, commonly making the Statue of Liberty the first land sighting for new arrivals. ""Everybody spoke of the golden land,"" said Belarksy. ""Come to America where there's gold on the streets, until they came here and they had to live in walk-up tenement houses,"" she said, referencing hardships often endured in overcrowded city buildings. Immigrants also commonly faced unsanitary and unsafe work conditions on docks and in factories as America's need for industrial labor grew. ""If you think immigration is unpopular now,"" said Berenson. ""If anything it was even more unpopular in the 1890s and the first part of the 20th century."" Successive immigrant waves, however, still rushed to America's shores through Ellis Island and past the Statue of Liberty, often buoyed by the prospect of economic opportunity, he added. ""I think it took a while for people to think of themselves as Americans,"" said Berenson. ""For an awful lot of people, what they wanted was to think of themselves as whatever they were originally, and as Americans too."" Anniversary celebrations of the Statue of Liberty will be marked Friday by a series of official speeches and web cams, provided by Earthcam, that are expected stream video footage from the torch. The following day the statue will close for renovations, though Liberty Island will remain open, according to the National Park Service.","Friday marks the 125th anniversary of the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With Manchester United continuing their top form from last season and aiming for what would be a remarkable clean sweep of trophies this year, it's only appropriate that we should profile a blog somehow linked to the Red Devils. Fan focus: The Republik of Mancunia blog is popular with Manchester United supporters. The Republik of Mancunia blog focuses on the Old Trafford club and is updated daily with a keen following among thousands of Manchester United fans. Authored by Manchester-born and raised 25-year-old Scott (who prefers to remain anonymous), the blog began in the 2005-2006 season. Scott, also known as ""Scott the Red,"" told CNN that before starting the blog he had been published on several football sites, and then ""fell into"" creating the Republik of Mancunia web site. ""I love talking about United and I'm an argumentative guy, so getting to write my opinions down about the latest goings on is something I really enjoy doing. ""(In 2005-2006) I was also getting on soapbox about the fact we were not in decline, which the current media at the time seemed to think we were,"" he said. Scott said running a blog was a very difficult and time-consuming task, though he enjoyed the interaction with other fans. ""I imagine if I wasn't in love with the club, I'd have given up on it long before now. It takes up a lot of time and you get people who support other teams having a go at you on a daily basis, sometimes United fans and all!"" Scott said the readership of his blog, and also contributions to his Manchester United forum came from areas as widely spread as Europe, Africa and even as far as Asia and South America -- with a strong base at home in the United Kingdom. ""I find it odd thinking of some lads thousands of miles away and hours apart sat at a computer and reading my latest rant. I like it though!""","CNN's Football Fanzone profiles a football blog every month .

"(CNN) -- Longtime talk show host Larry King says he's joined an effort to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers. ""It would be a thrill of a lifetime to be a part owner, a partial owner, of a team I grew up rooting for as a child in Brooklyn,"" the former host of CNN's ""Larry King Live"" said Wednesday."" ""To go to a ballpark and have an owner's box, to even have a say in a possible trade -- are you out of your mind?"" he asked rhetorically. King says he's part of group of investors interested in acquiring the franchise, despite its apparent financial troubles and unresolved contract issues with Fox Sports. Major League Baseball, which took charge of the team in April, has been embroiled in legal battles over future media rights after baseball Commissioner Bud Selig rejected a $3 billion television deal with Fox. The beleaguered club then filed for bankruptcy in June and has since drawn a number of high-profile buyers into the bidding process after team owner Frank McCourt agreed to sell. A court hearing over the Dodgers' future media rights is scheduled for December 7. King's investor group, meanwhile, is led by insurance agent Dennis Gilbert, who also works as a special assistant to Chicago White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. ""What bigger thrill?"" asked King, a native of Brooklyn, New York, which the Dodgers once called home. The team, formerly known as the Trolley Dodgers because of the maze of trolley cars that Brooklynites once dodged in the streets, eventually shortened its name, then and moved to California, kicking off its first L.A. season in 1958, to the dismay of many New Yorkers. ""The emotional part would be that they'd have to carry me out,"" King said of his possible part-ownership stake in the team.","King says he's bidding as a part of an investor group .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Melissa McCarthy is no longer just a bridesmaid. She's the bride. The ""Mike & Molly"" Emmy winner and ""Bridesmaids"" scene-stealer has some big plans on her plate -- from launching her own plus-size fashion line to getting hockey's prized Stanley Cup (for a movie) -- during what is already a stellar year for her. But none of her professional plans can top her favorite pastime, being mom to her two daughters with actor-husband Ben Falcone: Vivian, 4, and Georgette, 1Â½. McCarthy tells the Hollywood Reporter that being a mother actually helps her feel less insecure about her looks. ""The stupid stuff like what I wear or how I look I can't control, so I just try not to give too much energy to it,"" she says, calling her body a work in progress after giving birth to Georgette. ""At 20, I would have been like: 'Don't they like me? Was it my hair?' At 41, I think the things that define me, I hope, are a lot more than those kinds of petty things."" As for those red-carpet moments, ""Trying to find stuff that's still fashion-forward in my size is damn near impossible. It's either for like a 98-year-old woman or a 14-year-old hooker, and there is nothing in the middle,"" McCarthy wisecracks.

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has unveiled a raft of reforms aimed at restoring credibility to world football's ruling body, which has been hit by a succession of scandals over the past decade of his tenure. Accusations of corruption came to a head in the lead-up to last December's vote to award hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, with two high-echelon officials banned for life. The fallout continued last week as Caribbean Football Union members were suspended and fined for their involvement in the cash-for-votes scandal which saw Blatter's only election rival banned for life before the June 1 ballot. While former Asian Confederation president Mohamed Bin Hammam is taking legal action against that punishment, his former fellow Executive Committee members have agreed to establish three new task forces and a ""good governance committee"" in order to clean up the sport's administration. Blatter revealed at a press conference in Zurich on Friday that he hopes they will be implemented by 2013. ""We've been ambitious in our roadmap,"" the 75-year-old said. ""By 2013 we should have lived up to the requests made by the national associations in 2011. That is the goal we have set for ourselves."" Germany's Football Association president Theo Zwanziger will chair the task force dedicated to revising FIFA's statutes, while Claudio Sulser will oversee any reforms of the Ethics Committee of which he is chairman. The group focused on transparency and compliance will be headed by New Zealand FA president Frank van Hattum and Paraguay counterpart Juan Angel Napout, and German football legend Franz Beckenbauer will continue to lead the Football 2014 task force which began its work in May. The good governance committee will be established at the ExCo's next meeting on December 16-17, and will have representatives from throughout the football world -- such as players, referees, fans, clubs, national associations -- and from outside, including politicians lawyers, marketing partners. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has been involved in an advisory role, but will not be on the committee as Blatter said he wanted to have currently active politicians instead. ""We needed to strengthen the Ethics Committee, so we have a task force which will focus on its independence and how to strengthen it,"" Blatter said. ""What is most important right now, we also need to provide it with guidelines that don't come from football and not from the Executive Committee and members of different confederations or the Ethics Committee, but from the national associations. They wanted to see something being done. ""The transparency and compliance task force will be made up of presidents of national associations, and they will identify the problems with which the national associations are faced with respect to FIFA."" Blatter said the ExCo members, several of whom have faced accusations of corruption in the past decade, were unanimous in agreeing on the proposed roadmap. ""There is only one question mark -- will we be able to live up to the details of it? I feel very happy that the Executive Committee is completely in step with what we want to achieve with the national associations,"" he said. ""We are moving forward with a FIFA that, especially due to the Good Governance Committee, will allow us in 2013 or even before to present an image other than the one we have currently."" Blatter, who said there would be a push to include at least one woman on the all-male ExCo for the first time, revealed that court documents from the 10-year-old case involving FIFA's former marketing partner ISL would be released. FIFA officials Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and former president Joao Havelange were accused of receiving payments from ISL, which folded in 2001. The ExCo will examine the case in December and make the files available to an independent body for scrutiny. ""The court has said there are people involved, but no Swiss people -- only foreign people,"" Blatter said. He denied claims that FIFA was a corrupt organization, but claimed that any large body will always have corrupt elements. ""Some people are corrupt, some people are even more than that, but can you say that all are? At the end of the day in FIFA, which has 300 million participants, you will always find some violence, doping, corruption, you cannot avoid it, but that does not mean that the whole organization is like that.""","Football's governing body FIFA reveals plans to target corrupt activity .

"(CNN) -- As Japan's disaster evolves, so too are the measures taken to mitigate the chaos. One such initiative comes from U.S. military contractor iRobot, which will help Japan's army incorporate robots into their recovery efforts. The company joins at least two Japanese robotics teams on the ground in the quake- and tsunami-ravaged country, one of which operates an 8-meter-long, snakelike robot with a camera. iRobot, based in Bedford, Massachusetts, is donating four ground-based models to the Japan relief effort: two PackBots and two Warriors. The PackBot is an agile, battle-tested unit that's been used for bomb dispersal, recon and other tactical operations. Depending on its configuration, it weighs 45 to 60 pounds and is known for being highly customizable. ""Not every robot works in every situation,"" says iRobot Vice President Tim Trainer, ""so they have to be configured appropriately."" In Japan, the PackBot will be outfitted with HazMat sensors and deployed in areas of nuclear uncertainty, such as the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to search for chemical, biological or radiological anomalies. The larger Warrior model is a 347-pound robot that can traverse rubble or wreckage and carry up to 200 pounds. For this mission, it will be configured with firefighting capabilities that allow it to deploy fire hoses or clear away rubble. It complements the PackBots' agility and scanning capabilities with the muscle to physically neutralize hot zones. Both the PackBot and the Warrior are remote-controlled from a distance of 800 meters (about half a mile). The PackBot transmits data about hazardous conditions to an operator in real time. Because Japan's relief workers face massive piles of impenetrable rubble, the robots might also play a key role in general search-and-recovery efforts, as the PackBot did at New York City's ground zero in the aftermath of 9/11. A dual track system on both units enhances mobility and makes it possible for them to navigate areas humans can't safely reach. The Packbots and Warriors are accompanied by six iRobot employees who will train Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force in their use. The units can be operated with an Xbox or PlayStation controller in a straightforward plug-and-play fashion. Once in the field, robots that enter nuclear hot zones aren't necessarily expected to make it back out, as contamination could render them unsafe for later. But by going where relief teams shouldn't, they might prevent additional, unnecessary human casualties. ""This is why we got into robotics,"" said iRobot's Trainer.

"(CNN) -- After traveling all year for business meetings or conventions and taking vacation to cover a child's inconvenient half days at school, many harried Americans are left with a dilemma. With a few weeks left in the year, their remaining precious vacation days are about to expire. The average American worker has about six paid vacation days left unused at the end of the year, according to Hotwire.com's American Travel Behavior Survey, conducted earlier this year. It's time to use 'em or lose 'em. For the flexible traveler able to jump on a plane over the next two weeks, discounts are plentiful. That's because business travel is winding down for the year while many leisure travelers are saving their pennies for holiday expenses. Hotels and airlines are cutting prices and bundling discounts to fill rooms and seats that would otherwise go unsold. ""It's a great time to get last-minute deals if you're flexible and have time available,"" says Fiona O'Donnell, senior lifestyles and leisure analyst for the Mintel Reports Group. Here are a few deals: . Winter in the wine country (West Coast) Winter is Cabernet season in the Napa Valley and hoteliers are celebrating the end of harvest with discounted winter room rates. While new wine ages in recently-filled barrels, the legendary Napa Valley Lodge in Yountville, California, has packages with room rates starting at $195 (Sunday through Thursday) and $245 (Saturday and Sunday) that include wine tasting passes, a bottle of wine, continental Champagne breakfast buffet and 20% off spa treatments. In contrast, Summer rates can start at $300/night. This offer is good now through January 31, 2012. Other Napa Valley offers, including restaurant month and vintner discounts are also available. ""The harvest season might be over, but there are still plenty of reasons to visit wine country in winter,"" says Anne Banas, executive editor of Smarter Travel. ""Not only will the wines warm you up, but wine tastings and dining options offer plenty to do indoors. Plus, you can often find good discounts on hotels and B&Bs, often 30% to 50% off regular season rates."" Winter in wine country (East Coast) Bundle up and head to the Finger Lakes region of New York, where the wine scene is low-key and travelers celebrate the cold with cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing. Banas recommends Atwater Estate Vineyards and the New York Wine and Culinary Center on Canandaigua Lake. Winter travelers can receive discounts or free nights with participating hotels and inns as well as discounts at local wineries and restaurants through March 31, 2012. San Francisco --or Washington -- here we come . Even cities where hotel prices increased this year are experiencing a lull between the holidays. Prices for San Francisco hotels have jumped 22% over 2010, due to convention bookings and domestic and European visitors, says Hotwire.com's Clem Bason, president of the Hotwire Group. But rates for the first few weeks in December are down by about 10% from peak prices, according to Hotwire. The nation's capital is almost always busy doing the people's work, so hotel prices tend to remain high in good times and bad. However, government also slows down around the holidays. Prices in Washington are down about 15% from peak rates, according to Hotwire. ""We love sending people to D.C. when the weather is OK because there are so many free attractions in the area,"" says Bason. ""You can see a lot of our nation's history for free.""

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged global leaders Monday to launch a multibillion-dollar climate fund agreed to last year in Cancun, Mexico. The U.N. chief made the call as he attended a conference of climate vulnerable countries held here in the Bangladesh capital. Representatives from 20 countries attended the ministerial level meeting inaugurated by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Ban said, ""We are in the middle of a serious economic crisis. But even in these difficult times, we cannot afford delay. We cannot ask the poorest and the most vulnerable to bear the costs."" ""The Green Climate Fund needs to be launched in Durban. An empty shell is not sufficient,"" he said. ""Governments must lead the way to catalyze the $100 billion dollars per annum from public and private sources that was pledged to 2020,"" he said. He urged the governments to find a compromise on the Kyoto Protocol on climate change at a Durban climate conference and to make a broader comprehensive climate agreement possible in the future. ""Durban must complete what was agreed last year in Cancun,"" he said at the Climate Vulnerable Forum-2011. The two-day CVF conference began Sunday, aiming to reach consensus on various climate issues and an agreement to work together at the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP-17) to be held in Durban, South Africa, beginning November 28. Ban said adaptation must be a priority for all countries, but especially the most vulnerable. ""They need help with resources and technology,"" he said. The conference of the alliance of the 26 most vulnerable countries to climate change, ended with the adoption of a 14-point Dhaka Ministerial Declaration. Bangladesh Prime Minister Hasina expressed her frustration over a slow and inadequate progress of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process to confront the daunting challenges of climate change, and she called for setting criteria to prioritize vulnerable countries based on their risks and lack of coping capacities. ""We see no evidence of direct and easy access to funds and technology, and conditions and criteria seem to favor countries that have greater capacities... most vulnerable countries are failing to access whatever support that are being realized,"" she said. The CVF members expressed their determination to stand indivisible to face causes, consequences and collateral effects of climate change in their declaration. They reiterated firm resolve to work collectively with the other Parties to the UNFCCC towards limiting foreseeable global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, peaking global green house gas emissions by 2015. Briefing reporters after the conference, the Bangladesh state minister for environment and forests, Dr. Hasan Mahmud, said, ""We have decided to raise our voice together on various contentious issues in Durban"". The declaration said climate change induced displacement of people has become a major concern, and the relocation and rehabilitation of those people is putting enormous pressure on infrastructures and service facilities, as well as causing tremendous social stresses.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some ""Occupy"" demonstrators who've clashed with police in New York City have migrated south as the new year begins, joining their colleagues in the nation's capital where authorities continue to allow protest camps at two locations. ""We're here because we got pushed out of New York, but we're also here because this is the heart of where all politics happen,"" said a protester who would not give his name. ""Police know me,"" he explained, as he tried to repair a tarp torn free by high winds early Monday. He said he has been joined by a handful of other Occupy Wall Street demonstrators pushed out by New York police. On New Year's Eve, New York City police arrested 68 Occupy Wall Street demonstrators at their longtime camp in Zuccotti Park. The young man, who said he left the Wall Street location weeks ago after authorities began to pressure protesters to leave, reflected on a strategy for the new year as he spoke Monday at the larger of two encampments in Washington -- at a small downtown park known as McPherson Square, near the White House . ""I think (the movement's) most important stage right now is to inform the American people, before we can give any kind of particular answer or one message,"" he said. ""This is still, relatively, in my opinion, a young movement, and I don't think it's so much that it's anybody having the same answers but everybody asking the same questions right now,"" he told CNN, speaking on camera with most of his face concealed by a heavy winter scarf. Among the questions being asked include those from a ranking U.S. congressman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, demanding to know why protesters have been allowed to make camp in the first place. Issa, in a letter two weeks ago to the U.S. Department of Interior, said he believes the camping is illegal. But the National Park Service, which is in charge of McPherson Square, has applied the most liberal interpretation of rules against overnight camping, and officials instead consider the makeshift tent city a ""24-hour vigil. A handwritten bulletin board maintained by the protesters Monday noted it is ""Day 93"" of the demonstration there. At a second location in Washington, known as Freedom Plaza, the National Park Service in recent days extended a required permit through the end of February, acting just before it was to expire on New Year's Day. The extension may further provoke Issa, who chairs a House panel on government reform. His December 13 letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar expressed concern that the tent city in McPherson Square has ruined some of a $400,000 restoration project at the park, paid for with economic stimulus money. Issa said the National Park Service has allowed ""the Occupy DC movement to ecologically damage the park significantly over the past two months, by camping and killing the newly planted grass"" at the location. Protest organizers and supporters have distributed straw around the tents to deal with mud that followed heavy rains last month. Other areas where grass remains now show signs of damage from the tents and tarps blocking sunlight. National Park Service spokeswoman Carol Johnson told CNN the protesters in McPherson Square do not require a permit because their group contains fewer than 500 people and is considered a 24-hour vigil. Police in the area have said their enforcement so far has been to keep city streets clear of protesters, and to respond to petty crime that may take place around the camps. CNN's Greg Seaby contributed to this report.","Occupy Wall Street demonstrators migrate south .

"(CNN) -- When designer Sam Lessin started working at Facebook he wanted to make a point. So he printed his Facebook profile page and stretched it out in the company's California offices. There it was, multiple years of his life, on a scrolling piece of paper. A story big enough to cross the room. It's a story you'd never see on Facebook.com, he argued, since pretty much all the status updates and photos he'd posted over the years were hidden beneath a gray button at the bottom of the page: ""Older Posts."" ""All of the stories you've shared over time just fall off a cliff at the bottom of your (Facebook) wall and effectively disappear,"" company CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on stage at an event for Facebook app developers in San Francisco, where this story was retold. That, in a nutshell, is why Facebook on Thursday unveiled a completely rethought version of its profile pages: To surface all the events and stories that are hidden from view because they happened too long ago. The fact that this is even something up for discussion is significant. Facebook, as The Atlantic's Rebecca Rosen pointed out, is trying to be the ""forever"" social network. All its predecessors, from Friendster to MySpace, vanished almost as quickly as they appeared. Now Facebook is saying it wants to be the website where you document the most important events of your entire life, presumably from birth to death, not just this year or next. That's something audacious and new in this ephemeral era of social networking. The vehicle for this lifelong sharing, according to Facebook, is called ""Timeline."" ""We wanted to design a place that feels like your home,"" Zuckerberg said on stage Thursday, wearing a gray T-shirt and one of those ear-clip headsets you see on Old Navy employees. ""Where you tell your story online is really personal. You invest a lot of time in it and you curate it. You link to it and you tell all your friends to find you there. So we wanted to make Timeline a place you're proud to call your home. So Timeline is a completely new aesthetic from Facebook ... so you can express who you really are."" Or, more succinctly: ""Timeline is the story of your life,"" Zuckerberg said. In the coming weeks, Facebook is going to start replacing peoples' profile pages with a new blog-like template, where photos and check-ins and status updates are strung along the backbone of chronology -- days, months and, here's the big leap, years. The site's users can customize this page as they'd like, clicking a heart button to make photos appear at double their normal size, for example, or deleting catty comments from ex-boyfriends or girlfriends. Facebook's robots take care of the rest. The site's equations prioritize your memories, letting the stuff they determine to be insignificant fade into the recesses of time, and shining a digital light on moments they determine to be the most life-alteringly crucial. This goes all the way back to birth. When the 27-year-old Zuckerberg unveiled this page design, he scrolled to the bottom of his Timeline and there it was: a photo of him as a baby. It was as if he was hinting at a future when a person's entire existence could be cataloged and preserved, all on Facebook.com. That sparked some chatter online. ""So it's easier for kids to put more of their lives online that they'll regret later in life,"" tech analyst Michael Gartenberg wrote on Twitter. Anyone who has friends of a child-bearing age likely realizes that many kids already have Facebook pages almost from birth -- or, at the very least, their early lives are detailed on their parents' pages. Timelines, which highlight all of a Facebook user's years, may make this even more apparent. Furthermore, as Douglas Crets at the blog ReadWriteWeb says, those of us who crossed out of infancy before the dawn of Facebook could use Timelines to recreate our pasts on the social network: . ""This new format allows you to go back in time to periods in your life that happened before there was a Facebook, making your Facebook profile into a graphically intense version of your entire life,"" he wrote. TechCrunch called the Timeline ""the story of your life on a single page."" If you want it to be. Bill Barol at Forbes wrote that Facebook users should be skeptical of this concept: . ""The news isn't that Facebook has figured out a new way to package your life and present it back to you,"" he wrote. ""The news is that no one blinks at the notion of a giant company being the custodian of your memories. At least that's what Facebook is banking on. Timeline is your life, their way. ""That is, if you want to fill in the details.""","Mark Zuckerberg unveils new profile pages called ""Timelines""

"(CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a terrorist rampage that shook Norway last summer is insane and cannot be sentenced to prison or preventive detention, but can be confined to a mental hospital for the rest of his life, police said Tuesday. Anders Behring Breivik suffers ""grandiose delusions"" and ""believes he is chosen to decide who is to live and who is to die,"" Prosecutor Svein Holden announced. Police said psychiatrists had determined that the 32-year-old man was psychotic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. The doctors also found him to be paranoid and schizophrenic, police said. The experts reached their conclusions after 36 hours of interviews with Breivik, police said. The extension of Breivik's confinement under a compulsory mental health care order will be reviewed by a court every three years, police said. The court will consider whether he still represents a danger to society. Breivik had not been told of the psychiatrists' findings, police said. His lawyers were expected to relay the news. The decision underscores the difference between the justice system in the United States and that in Norway, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston. ""In the United States, it is extremely difficult to establish successfully an insanity defense,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""You can be paranoid, yet still able to control your behavior and be legally responsible."" In cases like the mass killing in Norway, ""there tends to be a tremendous amount of pressure from the public and maybe politicians as well to lock someone away for as long as possible, and bring justice to the victims,"" Fox said. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in Oslo and 69 who were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party youth camp on nearby Utoya Island. He has pleaded not guilty but admits carrying out the attacks, the judge handling his case has said. Breivik is described by authorities as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including the Labour Party. The manifesto predicts that a ""European civil war"" will lead to the execution of ""cultural Marxists"" and the banishment of Muslims. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in the aftermath of the attacks that his country had been fundamentally changed, but vowed that Norway would remain ""an open society."" Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang said Norwegians would respond to the violence with equally powerful weapons: ""We're going to punish him with democracy and love,"" he told CNN shortly after the killings. Still, memories of the slaughter on the island, where many of the campers survived by hiding behind rocks, remained acute on Tuesday. ""I will always have mixed feelings when I go back, of course,"" Labour Party member Eskil Pedersen told a reporter. ""I think about the 22nd of July and the dreadful things that happened that day, but I have been here every year and every summer since 2000. A lot of my time as a youth has been here on this island. I have very many good memories as well."" He said a memorial will be built there. ""Our aim is to reclaim Utoya, take it back as an island, have activities, have a summer camp here,"" he said. Relatives of some of the victims expressed disappointment at the decision on Breivik, a journalist from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corp. told CNN. ""They have looked forward to seeing him getting a sentence for the rest of his life for the acts he has committed,"" correspondent Tomm Kristiansen said. Public reaction is mixed, said journalist Olav Mellingsaeter. Most people are surprised, not angered, by the findings, he said. ""We must trust that the psychiatrists have done a thorough job,"" a 30-year-old student told the reporter. A 36-year-old woman said, ""As long as he does not escape, I do not care where he's kept."" At his trial in April, Breivik will have the opportunity to present evidence, police said. He has been in custody since his arrest on Utoya Island on the day of the killings, which marked the deadliest attack in Norway since World War II. CNN's Tom Watkins, Richard Allen-Greene and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Victims' families are disappointed that Anders Behring Breivik is ruled insane .

"(CNN) -- Could a Mexican drug cartel be the next target for a group of hackers known for online attacks against banks and government institutions? A video purportedly from the international hacker ring Anonymous threatens the Zetas, warning that the names, photographs and addresses of cartel supporters can be published ""if necessary."" ""We cannot defend ourselves with a weapon,"" a masked man says. ""But we can do this with their cars, homes, bars and whatever else they possess. It will not be difficult. All of us know who they are and where they are located."" The man, wearing a suit and tie, claims the notoriously violent drug gang has kidnapped an Anonymous associate in the Mexican state of Veracruz. ""We demand his release,"" says the man, who uses Mexican slang but speaks Spanish with a Castilian accent. It's unclear whether Anonymous is behind the October 6 video, which does not mention a victim's name or provide details about the alleged abduction. The hacking group has no clear leader, and no official website. ""One thing that's important to remember is that Anonymous is not an organization. It does not have a hierarchy. Basically it's a collective of people who self-identify,"" said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for the STRATFOR global intelligence firm. ""Not everybody agrees and not everybody participates."" Stewart said the video ""absolutely"" appears authentic. ""It's part of the dynamic we've been watching with Anonymous activities in Mexico,"" he said, noting that the video was similar to others the group has released and expresses similar sentiments. ""It seems like they're speaking up as the voice of those people who are in fear."" In recent months, Anonymous has claimed responsibility for ""paperstorm"" campaigns, dropping fliers accusing officials in the Mexican state of Veracruz of corruption and connections with cartels. The video purportedly posted by Anonymous this month says the alleged abduction occurred during a ""paperstorm"" campaign. An Anonymous source told CNN that there were discussions about three weeks ago in Anonymous' main online chat portal that suggested that members based in Mexico were going to target the Zetas. The source said that Anonymous Mexican members claimed in online discussions to have information about politicians in Mexico who were corrupt and working with the Zetas. Anonymous members in Mexico appeared, based on their portal chats, to want to make this information available online, the source said. On Monday, a Facebook page purportedly connected with a Latin America branch of Anonymous said the attack targeting the Zetas had been put on hold because of security and political concerns. ""We are searching for alternative actions,"" said the post on The Anonymous Link's page. CNN was unable to independently verity the website's claim. It's too soon to tell whether Anonymous, which normally uses Internet attacks to disrupt website traffic, can combat the ruthless violence of drug cartels, Stewart said. ""This is like one of those 1950s horror movies, the Werewolf versus Frankenstein. They're incompatible creatures that do warfare in different ways,"" Stewart said. Even if members of Anonymous use virtual weapons, he said, they could sustain real-life wounds. ""If they get identified as part of this, they could be beheaded,"" he said. As social media become an increasingly common battleground in Mexico's drug war, the viral video fueled debate online. Twitter was abuzz with word of the possible threat Monday, with some posts under the hashtag #OpCartel saying Anonymous had called off its plans to target the Zetas, and others questioning the legitimacy of the video. ""Was the #OpCartel Anonymous Hackers vs. Zetas story a highly publicized hoax?"" SYoungReports wrote. Other Twitter users criticized the group. ""Bits and bytes won't work against bullets,"" said a post on the Twitter account of Angeliner4life. ""Don't be dumb, you are messing with real killers."" The most common mode of operation for Anonymous is launching distributed denial-of-service attacks, in which multiple people use scripts to access a website repeatedly, slowing it badly or shutting it down, if its servers can't handle the traffic. In the past few years, Anonymous has taken credit for disrupting a number of prominent websites, including those of PayPal, Master Card, Visa and the Church of Scientology. Last month the group claimed it was targeting the Mexican government, launching attacks on a range of official websites, including those of Mexico's defense and public safety ministries. Online posts have become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in Mexico. In some parts of the country, threats from cartels have silenced traditional media. Sometimes even local authorities fear speaking out. Last month attackers left ominous threats mentioning two websites on signs beside mutilated bodies dangling from a bridge in northern Mexico. The message was clear: Post something we don't like online and you're next. ""I am about to get you,"" one sign said. It was unclear who the two brutally slain victims were, or whether they had any connection to social media. But analysts said that case showed the prominent role technology has come to play in describing and denouncing violence in Mexico. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Doug Gross and CNNMexico.com's Tania L. Montalvo contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst: Anonymous battling Zetas is like ""the Werewolf vs. Frankenstein""

"San Francisco (CNN) -- When Microsoft released the first Xbox nearly a decade ago, analysts considered the then-money-losing endeavor to be a sort of Trojan horse into the living room: a bid to become the home's central media hub. Now, Microsoft is facing an undisguised assault from Apple, Google, Samsung Electronics and start-ups like Boxee and Roku. They are all vying to fill the holes in Internet video on the big screen with hardware that makes it easy to watch on demand. Microsoft and Sony, which makes the PlayStation, are working to bolster their Internet-video offerings before new challengers can usurp the home-entertainment market that they've been cultivating for many years with their systems. Sony plans to unwrap a new version of its video-download service for the PlayStation 3 on Tuesday. People who subscribe to PlayStation Plus will be able to download a preview, and starting on October 11, all owners of the game console will be able to download the application from the home screen in the same way they can get Netflix. The sleeker Video Unlimited has large text and cover artwork for movies and television shows. The overall design looks a lot like the Metro style Microsoft is using in Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8. Video Unlimited will deploy a new patented search interface that works well with the arrow buttons on remote controls, which typically don't have keyboards, and the system suggests results as the user types -- much like Google's predictive search results. While surfing through menus, the app frequently makes recommendations about similar films and programs. ""We want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way,"" Michael Aragon, a vice president for Sony Network Entertainment, said in an interview. ""We want people to get lost in the experience."" The company is rebranding its Qriocity media suite, which includes a music-subscription service and the video store. Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited will live under the Sony Entertainment Network umbrella, and they may eventually be joined by the PlayStation Network, Aragon said. For now, the PlayStation Network Store will continue to offer the same programming that Video Unlimited has, to cater to customers familiar with buying media through the existing store. Music Unlimited and the PlayStation Network Store will be redesigned later, Aragon said. The music service has about 750,000 active users, and about 100,000 paying for access, he said. Couch potatoes expect programs to start immediately, but Video Unlimited's a-la-carte downloads don't do that currently on the PlayStation. This already works on Sony's Blu-ray players that have the app installed, and will be coming soon to the PlayStation, Aragon said. The redesigned video service will be coming to Sony set-top boxes and Bravia TVs in the next few months, Aragon said. The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said. With the new Web services, Sony is hoping to leave behind the blunders from earlier this year which resulted in a lengthy outage for its network. A reminder of those flared up recently when Sony asked its users to waive their rights to file class-action lawsuits. In the interview, Aragon boasted that Sony has added 3 million accounts and usage has increased by more than 10% since the outage. But Sony's network division has more than its own recent mistakes to concern itself over. Google has been unwavering in developing its Google TV platform, which Sony installs on a few of its products. Some rumblings within supply chains suggest that Apple is working on a television set. Samsung is pushing its Smart TV system. Even with more TV sets bundling Internet capabilities, the market for set-top boxes is expected to grow 14% this year to 21 million devices shipped, according to market research firm In-Stat. Microsoft, like Sony, feels the heat and continues to push the Xbox beyond gaming. ""Your Xbox is becoming the hub of your living room,"" Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said at a conference in January. ""It is your gaming system; it is your movies; it is your TV experience."" Ballmer expanded on this concept in a presentation at the company's developers conference last month. Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said. There is already an ESPN channel for Xbox Live subscribers. While Sony is optimizing its platform for existing remotes with the unique search feature, Microsoft is promoting the Kinect, with its microphone and camera for motion sensing, as the peripheral for navigating video content. Microsoft declined to make an executive available to be interviewed. ""Certainly we all know the frustrations of using guides and menus and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox,"" Ballmer said last month. ""You say it; Xbox finds it."" With Zune Pass and Xbox's limited video programs, Microsoft has favored subscription models. It's unclear how the new Xbox services will be packaged. Nintendo has been testing the waters on 3-D media delivery through its 3DS hand-held. The Wii is not seen as a media hub, though it can access Netflix. Netflix has about 24 million subscribers, and the game consoles have been a primary way people get the service. Sony favors a la carte over ""the Netflix model,"" Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray. ""If you want to do subscriptions, you can't have new content,"" he said. Sony is considering offering a subscription service catering to young men, which would include anime films, Aragon said. ""PlayStation has such a strong tie to the gamer market,"" he said. Subscriptions are thriving, evidenced by Netflix's success and by Amazon.com's partnership with 20th Century Fox, announced Monday, for the Instant Videos service. Microsoft and Sony would like to sell the media, not just the hardware that plays them. But if their gaming consoles were truly home-entertainment Trojan horses, the clock is ticking for them to spring their surprise.","Sony is redesigning its video download service for the PlayStation 3 .

"(CNN) -- Someone out there just leapt all comic book purchase price records in a single bound. A near-pristine copy of Action Comics #1 -- better known as the first appearance of Superman -- sold at an online auction Wednesday night for a staggering $2.16 million. The seller? None other than cash-strapped actor Nicolas Cage, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Cage turned a super-sized profit, the Reporter noted. He bought the 1938 Man of Steel original 14 years ago for roughly $150,000. The buyer has remained anonymous. But ""he's an extremely passionate collector, and he treasures owning the best of the best,"" said Vincent Zurzolo, chief operating officer of New York-based ComicConnect.com, which conducted the auction. ""In particular, he loves Superman."" When the comic book first went on the auction block November 12, the top bid was around $900,000, Zurzolo noted. The price rose to more than $1.5 million Monday and smashed the $2 million mark five minutes before the close of bidding. The previous comic book sale price record? Roughly $1.5 million for another copy of Action Comics #1 in March of 2010. ""I've been involved in the comic book business for over 25 years,"" Zurzolo told CNN. Superman remains an ""icon that represents the best of this great country."" Cage's copy of the all-American classic comes with a colorful back story. It was reported stolen in January 2000, according to the Reporter, and remained lost for more than 11 years before showing up last April in an abandoned storage locker in California's San Fernando Valley.

About 100 copies of Detective Comics #27 -- better known as the first appearance of Batman -- are also still believed to be out there. The Caped Crusader made his inaugural appearance in 1939. An original Depression-era Batman won't come cheap, however. One copy sold last year for a little over $1 million. The good news: if you're willing to settle for a more modern incarnation of the two crime fighters, you can probably afford it.

"(CNN) -- President Obama authorized the killing of an American citizen because he had declared war on the United States and encouraged others to bring harm to America. Whatever Anwar al-Awlaki's wrongs -- and there were many -- when America kills its own without a trial, it not only demeans itself but it hands over a propaganda victory to its enemies. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's leader since the death of Osama bin Laden, will chide this great country again for abandoning its values and principles. The White House's authorization of this killing also tells American Muslims that a precedent has been set by their government to kill American citizens abroad without trial if they oppose their country. This cannot be right -- and is counterproductive to defeating terrorism in the long term because it demolishes the very values that America stands for: the rule of law and trial by jury. It is abandoning these very same principles of human dignity, underpinned by free and fair trials that led to al-Awlaki's decisive shift after being released from a Yemeni prison in 2007: From being anti-American rabble-rouser, he went to advocating direct violence against the United States. Prison experiences in the Arab world -- being arrested and detained without legal representation and exposed to the worst forms of torture at the hands of fellow Muslims -- change nonviolent extremists to violent extremists. Al-Awlaki's transformation from extremism to violence comes in this context. His alleged links to 9/11 terrorists were not as significant as some argue. If he was known to be involved in the 9/11 attacks, why was he a guest of the Pentagon, of all places, in 2002? Al-Awlaki is not alone. Before him, al-Zawahiri was tortured in Egyptian prisons, and during his trial in 1982, he addressed a gallery of Western journalists in English and declared, ""So where is democracy? Where is freedom? Where is human rights? Where is justice? We will never forget!"" Without a doubt, al-Awlaki and al-Zawahiri were already radicalized before prison, but the tipping point toward violence came with their prison experiences. And before al-Zawahiri, the intellectual framework for al-Qaeda's destructive worldview was put in place by Syed Qutb in Mazra Tora in prison in Nasser's Egypt. Again, it was torture and the absence of humane treatment that led to Qutb declaring war on the Egyptian government. Qutb's prison writings have inspired every jihadist movement around the globe. This same movement sees al-Awlaki as a lightweight, not least because he never set foot on the battlefield and his scholarly credentials are open to question. In Egypt or Pakistan, al-Awlaki is not well-known. Little wonder, then, that Al Jazeera Arabic is not as excited by al-Awlaki's killing as Western media outlets. Al-Awlaki was important among Muslims in the West -- from Yemen, he used the Internet to reach this constituency. But even before the launch of his blog in 2008, al-Awlaki was popular among Muslims in England, Canada and America because of his audiotapes about the history of early Muslim personalities. These tapes were, and many still are, in circulation in mosques and bookshops. Al-Awlaki could have been discredited before his prison experiences or, now, his perceived martyrdom. By killing al-Awlaki, his message gains new life as words from an American Muslim martyr, the first to join the iconography of underground Muslim culture since Malcolm X. An easier, cheaper and more effective way of discrediting al-Awlaki and countering his message would have been to disclose his three arrests for the solicitation of prostitutes in San Diego and the Washington, D.C., area between 1996 and 1997. He had even pleaded guilty to the 1997 charge, and was subsequently sentenced to three years' probation and a fine. Among his socially conservative Muslim following in Europe and America, immediately after 9/11, such information would have been dynamite. The United States cannot kill its way out of terrorism. Just as with the Cold War, the challenge from Islamist extremism and jihadist violence urgently needs a cultural, intellectual and informational response. Violence breeds more violence and, in this case, literally creates martyrs out of al Qaeda's murderers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Husain.","Ed Husain: Killing Anwar al-Awlaki demolishes the values that America stands for .

"(CNN) -- I have never been whacked out on LSD. However, if I had ever had the chance to meet Hunter S. Thompson, a real acid pro, my fantasy is that during a brief conversation in which he got to know me a little bit I'd feel comfortable asking him at the end of our talk: Do you think I could handle acid? Even after I regaled him with the story of when friends of mine tried it in college, then wandered around the New York Botanical Gardens and invented the rock n' roll backpack -- which is a standard backpack with a radio boombox in it -- he would say no, you personally shouldn't take LSD, you suppressed malcontent. Hopefully, this would all just sound like a sort of guttural gesture, because that would be subtle enough. There's a definite chance that not only would HST think I couldn't handle the drugs, but he might hate me entirely. I can't imagine someone who covered the Hells Angels, shark fishing competitions, got to threaten the life of the man he hated more than anyone else on Earth (Richard Nixon) and helped get Jimmy Carter elected president enjoying the company of me, a person who basically gets paid to tweet for a living? I am not alone in my enduring fascination with Thompson. Today the movie about the novel Thompson started writing in 1959 at the age of 22-years-old, ""The Rum Diary"" starring Johnny Depp, will be released. The film offers plenty of opportunities to remember the renegade journalist, such as Jann Wenner's recent piece titled ""Hunter S Thompson Was My Brother in Arms."" I get the continued curiosity. And while it's fine that I can't write or take drugs like Thompson, I actually did try to be like him once. In 2008, after reading ""The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,"" the piece in which he invented Gonzo journalism, I wrote a three-part series for Yahoo! Sports called ""The Odyssey To The Infield"" in which I attended all three legs of the Triple Crown Of Thoroughbred Racing in person. My experience was maniacal enough, but I wrote in a style that was caught up in the decadence and truly ignoring of the depraved. I too overindulged in gambling, alcohol, and some frat boy misogyny, took a full can of beer projectile to the collar bone and hung around women in fancy dress that were too blind drunk to know that they were knee deep in mud. Yet with all that I still couldn't capture his frenetic style. I was impressed by my own momentum but could never let it come unhinged, and if HST himself read this report he would probably be nauseous at how upbeat it was. It's cool that I failed, because everyone who tries to emulate his Gonzo genius falls short to a certain extent. Recently, when she thrust herself into the annals of The Gathering Of The Juggalos, Emma Carmichael from Deadspin wrote an excellent analysis on the currency of women's breasts at the debauched music and arts festival held in some back corner of southern Illinois (see: ""Dropping In On The Demented Utopia Of The Gathering Of The Juggalos""). It was fine Gonzo reporting; she had the Juggalo clown make-up and everything, but ended up with the determination that she couldn't be one of these people. I can't help but wonder if Thompson fraternized with the crazies on the aptly named ""drug bridge"" at The Gathering if we would have ended up making them his people -- and then they probably would have set off many, many explosives together. I suspect ""The Rum Diary"" will be released to mixed reviews. I wager most of the criticism will be directed at the fact that 48-year-old Depp is attempting to play a 23-year-old. And the Thompson fans who see the film will get the subtext that this book is supposed to be Thompson on the brink of finding his path to self-destruction. A time in his life when fear and loathing was just the fear. It was a time, pre- Nixon, when Thompson pictured himself writing books of varying degrees of madness, and not necessarily covering political campaigns of varying degrees of mad politicians. We don't know how much of ""The Rum Diary"" he composed in the late '50s and how much he wrote later on (the novel wasn't actually published until 1998), but I like to think that whatever was written by early-20s Thompson was written by a guy that already believed strongly in the notion that his own career momentum should take him down the path of madness, for better or worse. Something that would be more awesome than meeting Thompson and having him insult me and write me off like one of the debauched hack journalists in ""The Rum Diary,"" would be meeting him and having him love me. Maybe he'd like that I work at job where I get to post stuff like Photos Of Hunter S. Thompson Partying and supercut video of people doing Hunter S. Thompson impressions? Maybe Hunter would even like Twitter? As Johnny Depp said earlier this week, ""He was a very gentle guy. Hyper, hypersensitive, hence the self-medication."" Maybe I could get a cool Thompson nickname like Depp, who Thompson called ""The Colonel."" Of course, if he liked me, we might end up dropping acid together and developing fuel-intake technology for the rock n' roll backpack. And then there's a good chance I'd lose my mind.","Everyone who tries to emulate Thompson's Gonzo genius falls short to a certain extent .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has defended Fernando Torres after the striker missed an open goal during the club's 3-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. Villas-Boas, 33, saw his team fall 3-0 behind in the first half at Old Trafford, through goals from Chris Smalling, Nani and Wayne Rooney, before Spain international Torres clawed one back for Chelsea with his first goal of the season early in the second half. But former Liverpool forward Torres spurned a golden opportunity after 83 minutes, as he fired wide from close range having rounded United goalkeeper David de Gea. Despite his error, Villas-Boas stood by Torres, 27, and pointed to England international Rooney's second-half penalty miss as proof that even the best strikers can be unlucky. ""Two of the best world strikers missed crazy opportunities,"" the former Porto coach told a post-match press conference. ""It happened to Fernando, but it also happened to Rooney. It's nothing dramatic, sometimes these balls go in. I think luck didn't fall on our side."" Former Atletico Madrid star Torres has struggled for form since joining Chelsea from English Premier League rivals Liverpool in January, with his goal on Sunday only his second for the London outfit and his first since a 4-1 win over West Ham in April. If Torres had converted his late opportunity the score would have stood at 3-2, and Villas-Boas was left to wonder what might have been. ""I think 3-2, in that period of the game, could have given us the mental edge ... It would leave us completely exposed at the back, but we would take the risk trying to get the draw."" Chelsea had numerous attempts at goal during an open match, with Brazil midfielder Ramires also guilty of spurning a good opportunity while the score was only 1-0. ""We are pretty happy with how the team reacted to such a negative impact at half time, when the team was playing well. We cannot say the team was playing awful and that 3-0 at half time was a fair result."" Villas-Boas also bemoaned the officiating in the match, claiming English champions United scored their opening two goals from offside positions. ""It didn't fall our way in every kind of the word, not only in terms of goalscoring opportunities but in terms of refereeing decisions or the linesman's decisions ...They influenced the game, it's 2-0 instead of 0-0."" The defeat was Chelsea's first under Villas-Boas and the four-time English title winners have collected 10 points from their first five matches. Their next Premier League fixtures will see them entertain newly-promoted Swansea City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.","Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has defended Fernando Torres .

"(CNN) -- It's famous for its rich cultural history, a waltz and Wiener schnitzel. And for the third year in a row, Vienna, Austria, can also boast the highest quality of living in the world. According to the Mercer 2011 Quality of Living survey, Vienna beat 220 other cities to earn the distinction. Zurich, Switzerland, ranked second, followed by Auckland, New Zealand. Vancouver, Canada (No. 5) topped cities in the Americas; Dubai, United Arab Emirates (No. 74) is ranked the best city in the Middle East and Africa; and Singapore (No. 25) beat all other Asian cities surveyed. Baghdad ranked last, under Bangui, Central African Republic; N'Djamena, Chad; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Mercer scored the cities based on 39 criteria, including relationships with other countries, traffic congestion, schools, climate, recreational activities, internal stability and economic factors. More than half of the top 25 cities are in Europe. ""European cities in general continue to have high standards of living because they enjoy advanced and modern city infrastructures combined with high-class medical, recreational and leisure facilities,"" said Slagin Parakatil, senior researcher at Mercer. ""But economic turmoil, high levels of unemployment and lack of confidence in political institutions make their future positions hard to predict."" The three top-ranking U.S. cities are Honolulu (No. 29), San Francisco (No. 30) and Boston (No. 36).

"(CNN) -- A California lettuce grower has recalled 2,498 cartons of chopped or shredded romaine lettuce shipped to wholesale food service distributors in 19 states and Canada over concerns the produce may be contaminated with the same bacteria that caused 13 deaths in an outbreak traced to tainted cantaloupes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and True Leaf Farms initially reported the recall of 90 cartons of chopped and shredded romaine lettuce on Thursday, saying a random sample detected listeria monocytogenes in one bag pulled from a lot shopped on September 12 and September 13. Later Thursday, True Leaf issued a statement saying the FDA asked the company to expand the recall. No illnesses have been reported, the FDA said. The affected lettuce was available for direct purchase at Cash & Carry Smart Foodservice warehouses in Oregon, Washington and Idaho, It also shipped to food service distributors in Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Vermont. It also was sent to a distributor in Alberta and British Columbia. The recalled lettuce carries a use by date of ""9/29/11"" and the bag and box code B256-46438-8. The FDA said anyone who has the lettuce should destroy it or contact the company to come pick it up. Listeria can cause fever, muscle aches and gastrointestinal problems. It usually causes only mild illness for healthy people, but it can be extremely dangerous for older adults, people with weakened immune systems, newborns and pregnant women, in whom listeriosis can cause miscarriages and stillbirths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The listeria bacteria recently was blamed in a multi-state outbreak associated with tainted cantaloupes. At last count, 13 people had died and 72 had been made ill in 18 states after consuming cantaloupes grown by a Colorado farm.","Chopped and shredded romaine lettuce is recalled over contamination concerns, the FDA says .

"(CNN) -- This week the world will reach 7 billion people. Understandably that raises concern about a soaring world population. But there is a good news story from the demographic data that is not often told. We -- or rather the poor women of the world -- are defusing the population bomb. Women today are having half as many children as their mothers and grandmothers. The global average is now down to 2.5 children per woman, and it continues to fall. This is not just a rich-world phenomenon. Much of Asia now has fertility rates below two, from Japan and Korea to China, with its one-child policy, through Taiwan, Vietnam, Burma, Singapore and much of southern India and parts of the Middle East. Behind the veil, the women of Iran have cut their fertility from eight to less than two in a generation. The young people out on the streets demanding democracy during the Arab Spring are arguably far more politically active because they are not at home raising large families. Falling fertility happens faster if countries get richer and if women are better educated. Similarly urbanization helps a lot. While even young children can be an economic asset on an African peasant farm, they are an economic liability in cities, where they require education before they can get a job. The teeming megacities of the poor world may look like symbols of overpopulation, but they are part of the solution, too. But the real story is that rich or poor, Muslim or Catholic, secular or devout, socialist or capitalist, with tough government birth control policies or none, most countries tell the same story. Small families are becoming the new norm. The reason, I believe, is very simple. Women are having smaller families because for the first time in history they can. In the 20th century, the world largely eradicated the diseases that used to kill off most children. Today, most kids get to grow up. Mothers no longer need to have five or six children to ensure the next generation. Two or three is enough, and that is what they are choosing to have. There are holdouts, of course. In much of Africa, rural women still typically have five children or more. But if Africa follows Asia, then we can see an end to population growth. We are, I believe, likely to see ""peak population"" by about mid-century. Perhaps at around 9 billion people. After that, on current trends of fertility falling to below replacement levels, we will see a falling world population. And rapid aging. With longer life expectancy and fewer babies, this is all but inevitable. China will soon be aging faster than anywhere on Earth. Aging is set to be the dominant demographic phenomenon of the 21st century, just as the population boom dominated the 20th century. What does this mean for the environment? Well, peak population is good news, of course. But don't hang the flags. It is a pervasive myth that it is all those extra people that are wrecking the planet. That's no longer the case. Rising consumption today is a far bigger threat to the environment than a rising head-count. And most of that extra consumption is still happening in rich countries that have long since given up growing their populations. According to Stephen Pacala, the director of the Princeton Environmental Institute, the world's richest half billion people -- that's about 7 % of the global population -- are responsible for half the world's carbon dioxide emissions, the primary cause of man-made climate change. Meanwhile the poorest 50 % of the world are responsible for just 7 % of emissions. So there is no way halting population growth in the poor world today would have more than a very marginal effect on climate change. It is the world's consumption patterns we need to fix, not its reproductive habits. Every time we talk about too many babies in Africa or India, we are denying this fact. The population bomb may be being defused by the women of the poor world. But the rich world has not even begun to defuse the consumption bomb. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fred Pearce.","Fred Pearce says there's good news attached to the 7 billion population milestone .

"(CNN) -- The small, World War II-era plane that crashed Friday during a Reno, Nevada, air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why. Seven people, including the pilot, were killed when the plane crashed into spectators at the race, with two others later dying at area hospitals. Close to 70 people were injured. National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind on Sunday described this realization, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it, this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, who is the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device, and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators then at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the probe. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine if these came from the plane being piloted by 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said on Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not now known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab -- which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Besides the plane's trim tab, parts of a tail, the memory cards and already known plane data, investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. While a preliminary report will be available Friday, Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again."" Meanwhile, the crash's toll became clearer Sunday as more of those killed were identified. Besides Leeward, the dead include Michael Joseph Wogan, a 22-year-old from Phoenix who was attending the event with his father as part of a father-and-son vacation, his family said in a statement. His father, William, was ""seriously injured,"" the statement said. Wogan was diagnosed at an early age with muscular dystrophy, and was wheelchair-bound his entire life. However, his 19-year-old brother James Wogan said in the family statement, ""He was about moving past that and always driven toward independence. Michael liked to get out and travel, and he was so excited about getting on a plane as part of this trip."" Michael Wogan graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with a finance degree in May, his family said. He had operated a web development company and was in the process of developing a second business. Memorial service details were pending, the statement said. Also identified Sunday were George and Wendy Hewitt, members of Cascade EAA Warbirds Squadron 2. The Hewitts were killed when the plane crashed into the seating area, said R.D. Williams, a spokesman for the squadron. According to its website, the squadron aims to ""promote and encourage the preservation and operation of World War II and other such aircraft that are representative of military aviation operations"" along with educating people on safely operating and maintaining such aircraft. The plane that crashed Friday -- dubbed the ""Galloping Ghost"" -- was one such plane dating from that era. Several witnesses have portrayed Leeward -- a real estate developer from Ocala, Florida -- as a hero because he appeared to manuever the plane away from the crowded grandstands at the last moment. He went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday while taking part in a qualifying round in the ""unlimited class"" division of the air race, said Mike Draper, the show spokesman. The final rounds, which had been slated for the weekend, were cancelled. ""This is the first time in 40 years, I think, that we've had a visitor injured or killed,"" Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told reporters Saturday. ""We've lost some pilots, but we've never had a major catastrophe."" One local hospital, Renown Medical Center, received 34 patients, four of whom were in critical condition as of Sunday afternoon. Two patients -- a male and a female -- died, the hospital said Friday. Dr. Mike Morkin, the medical director of emergency services at the hospital, was on duty when the call about the crash came in Friday. ""The severity of this accident was the worst I've seen since I've been at Renown,"" Morkin, a 16-year veteran at the hospital, said. Renown South Meadows Medical Center received and discharged five patients, the hospital said Saturday. St. Mary's Hospital in Reno said it had accepted 28 patients from the accident: As of Sunday afternoon, two were in critical condition and six in serious condition. The remainder have been released. CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report.","NEW: The downed plane had video and data recording devices, a NTSB official says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The Arab League and other world powers boosted pressure on the Bashar al-Assad regime to end its nearly nine-month-long crackdown on demonstrators, a relentless push against mostly peaceful citizen protest that has now claimed at least 4,000 deaths. Nabil el-Araby, the secretary-general of the Arab League, said the Syrian regime can ""avoid the dangers of a foreign intervention"" if it agrees to an Arab League plan to defuse the grinding conflict. He said the Syrian government hasn't accepted the league plan to send observers into the country to monitor the response to civil unrest. But he said the government has a chance to overcome the crisis by agreeing to the idea. ""The Syrian government is not complying with the Arab initiative plan and their inability to stop the violence is what led to the escalation of the procedures of the sanctions against it,"" el-Araby said in a written statement. Earlier this week, foreign ministers from 19 Arab League countries voted to slap economic sanctions on the Syrian regime, including cutting ties with the nation's central bank, banning high-profile officials from visiting Arab countries and freezing government assets. The number of deaths has reached at least 4,000 since the crackdown began in mid-March and could be much higher, Navi Pillay, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in Switzerland on Thursday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group, said 4,744 people have been killed, including 843 from the army. The group said at least 23 people had been killed in the country on Thursday. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned two high-ranking Syrians and two government controlled entities on Thursday for their role in the crackdown. One of the people is Mohammad Makhlouf, al-Assad's uncle and father of long-serving financial adviser Rami Makhlouf. The other is Aus Aslan, a Syrian general. The sanctions are the latest of several imposed by the United States, the European Union, and Turkey. ""It has never been more critical to escalate pressure on the Syrian government to immediately cease all violence against its own people and isolate the regime from the international financial system,"" said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. ""We will continue to work closely with our partners in Europe and around the world to hasten a transition to democracy in Syria."" A league official told CNN on Thursday it is targeting 17 senior Syrian regime officials for a travel ban to member states. One of them is President al-Assad's brother, Maher Hafez al-Assad, the commander of the country's 4th Army Division, according to a senior Arab League official directly involved in negotiations with the Syrians. The preliminary list also includes Defense Minister Emad Dawoud Abdulla, Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim Al Shaar, intelligence chief Abdulla Fattah Quedsia, and military intelligence chief Rostom Ghazali. The source doesn't want be named because of his direct involvement in the talks. Syrian citizens blame the military and security apparatus for the casualties. The Syrian government insists that armed groups are responsible. The instability is affecting non-Syrians. Kuwait urged its citizens in Syria to leave and said those planning to travel there should not because of ""the unstable security situation,"" the state-run media said on Thursday, citing a statement from the Foreign Ministry. El-Araby has said a committee examining how to implement the sanctions will focus on protecting civilians while targeting the government. An Arab League committee led by economic ministers will meet in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday to discuss implementing sanctions, the source said. It will pass along its ideas to the league foreign ministers meeting in Cairo next week, the source told CNN on Thursday. The source also said a ban on Arab airlines traveling in and out of Syria will start on December 15. Syria announced that it has suspend its membership in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership until the European Union backs down on the sanctions imposed on Syria. But European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton told the EU Foreign Affairs Council on Thursday that the group is pleased with the Arab League sanctions and international initiatives to keep Syrians safe. EU officials met with el-Araby and discussed a range of issues. ""The most important thing is to keep the people of Syria as safe as possible and to put pressure on the regime,"" Ashton said in Brussels, Belgium. In Switzerland on Friday, the U.N. Human Rights Council will meet to discuss the violence in Syria. CNN is unable to independently confirm events occurring inside Syria because the government does not allow journalists free access to the country.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have hit back at Owen Hargreaves after their former midfielder claimed he had been mistreated by the English champions' medical staff. Hargreaves, who joined United's archrivals Manchester City in August after his contract at Old Trafford expired, was reported in the British press as having said he felt like a guinea pig during an injury plagued four-year spell with the Red Devils. The England midfielder was speaking after making a goal-scoring debut for City in their 2-0 Carling Cup win over Birmingham City on Wednesday. ""Manchester United is disappointed with Owen Hargreaves' remarks after the game on Wednesday,"" read a statement on the three-time European champions' website. What are the reasons behind Man Utd's flying start? ""The club gave him the best possible care for three years and is as disappointed as anyone he was not able to play a part in the team's success at that time. ""It has shared all the medical records with Manchester City and is comfortable with the actions taken by its medical staff at each step of his many attempts at rehabilitation."" The Canada-born star arrived at United from German outfit Bayern Munich in 2007, but only made 27 appearances for Alex Ferguson's team due to persistent injury problems relating to the tendons in his knee. ""They said I would be fit for the start of pre-season but, after that, I never got back on my feet,"" Hargreaves was reported as saying in British newspaper The Guardian. ""My tendon was never the same. They said my tendon was good, but it felt like I was made out of glass. ""We treated it and it got significantly worse through the injections. That obviously had a huge impact. Basically, I was left to pick up the pieces, which was incredibly frustrating. That was surgery, and that was 18 months gone."" But United denied Hargreaves' claims, with the statement continuing to say: ""United does not acknowledge any validity in the comments Owen is alleged to have made. ""Manchester United has some of the best sports medical staff in world sport, who have made a significant contribution to United's on-pitch success in recent seasons."" Prior to joining City, Hargreaves posted a series of clips on the video-sharing website YouTube aimed at proving his fitness. The 30-year-old made his professional debut for Bayern in 2000, and went on to win four Bundesliga titles with the club and the European Champions League in 2001. Hargreaves also represent England at both the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, and won a second career Champions League title when United beat Chelsea in Moscow in 2008.","Manchester United have hit back at former midfielder Owen Hargreaves .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel became Formula One's youngest world champion in a five-way shootout at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2010, and the German needs just one point in Japan this weekend to seal a second world crown. Vettel's dominant form in 2011 has led him to victory in nine of 14 races so far, and the 24-year-old is on the brink of becoming the ninth driver to secure back-to-back titles in the championship's 61-year history. If he does so, the celebrations will come with four races to go -- putting Vettel narrowly behind his legendary compatriot Michael Schumacher, who set the standard in 2002 when he clinched the fifth of his record seven world titles with six of the 17 races remaining. Vettel will also become the youngest double world champion, beating the 25-year-old Fernando Alonso's feat with Renault in 2005-06. Latest F1 standings after Singapore GP . Former Toro Rosso driver Vettel needs to earn a 10th-place finish, or higher, in one of the season's five remaining grands prix to complete his triumph. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button, second in the drivers' standings, is the only driver who still has a mathematical chance of preventing Red Bull celebrations on Sunday. British racer Button would need the unlikely combination of Vettel to score no further world championship points, while also winning the year's five remaining races. Despite Vettel knowing he could win the title with an uncharacteristically low finish -- he has finished outside of the top two in just one race this year -- the one-time Sauber driver insisted he is fully focused on claiming another maximum 25-point haul. ""Obviously there's still a chance for Jenson to win the title and for me not to win the title,"" Vettel told Formula One's official website. ""Even if it's only one point. ""The moment you decide to fly, sooner or later there's a moment when you will come down as well. You have to, nothing flies for ever. I think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage, the target going into this weekend is not to get one point, in a way it's not to win the championship, the target is to do our best. ""Yes, there would be reason to celebrate, even if we finish tenth, but it wouldn't be the same so we try to race as usual and we try to get the best out of ourselves."" When asked what the secret behind his success was, Vettel's answer was simple: ""Probably a word that is not at first sight that fancy, consistency. And in this respect we have had a terrific year so far and I hope it will not desert us for the final races."" The climax to the 2011 season is in stark contrast to last year's finale, when Vettel leaped from third position heading into the final race at the Yas Marina Circuit to overhaul teammate Mark Webber and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso to claim glory. ""Going into the last race and being some points behind is a completely different situation to leading the standings by a gap of 124 points,"" said Vettel, who was 15 points adrift of first-place Alonso heading into November's final race in the gulf kingdom. ""What I try to do is not to listen to all these statistics and simply focus on this race, as I always do with every single race -- which has served me well. I have learned from the mistakes that I made in the past and it would be foolish to make them again, so don't wait to see them here. ""It is not embarrassing making mistakes if you learn from them, but it would be embarrassing making the same mistakes all over again. "" Button signs new multi-year deal with McLaren . Button was cautiously optimistic regarding his chances in Suzuka, but admitted the circuit is one which would suit Red Bull's RB7 car. ""I think it will be a great race for everyone,"" said Button, who recently signed a new deal with English-based McLaren. ""In the last few races, I think we've shown that we have extremely good pace and that we've been the team most able to take the fight to Red Bull. ""On paper, I think it's a circuit that will suit the Red Bulls, particularly in the high-speed sweeps that make up the first sector of the track, but I certainly don't think people should under-estimate our package. ""We showed at Spa that we have a car that's very effective in high-speed corners. We've also improved our straight-line speed and we have a more efficient rear wing for qualifying, so I think we're feeling positive about the weekend."" If Vettel fails to clinch the championship this weekend, the title race would roll on to the Korean Grand Prix on October 16.","Sebastian Vettel can clinch a second world title at Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have warned a group of supporters they are slowing the progress of the English Premier League outfit after they opted not to return the freehold to the club's Stamford Bridge stadium. The ground, in the west of the English capital, was sold to a fans' organization called the Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO) in 1997 to protect it from falling into the hands of developers if the club ran into financial trouble. But only 61.5% of CPO's shareholders voted to sell the freehold back to the club -- less than the 75% needed to authorize the move. Explainer: Chelsea's bid to leave Stamford Bridge . Chelsea, who are currently third in the Premier League, are keen to explore the possibility of building a new ground with a bigger capacity than Stamford Bridge, which currently holds only 42,000 supporters. In a letter to CPO, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck said that a new ground could help the club raise an extra $56 million of revenue each season but that the redevelopment of Stamford Bridge was necessary to help pay for it. But many fans were not happy at the club's plans to move away from the site and Chelsea fell short of the vote required. The club are owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich but limited space around their ground means expansion is difficult. Two of the club's rivals, Manchester United and Arsenal, have stadiums that hold 76,000 and 60,000 respectively. A statement on the Chelsea's official website read: ""Chelsea FC is naturally disappointed with the result. A large number of fans supported our proposals but it was always going to be difficult when we had to have a 75 per cent majority of voting shareholders accepting them. ""We approached this process with transparency and the will to do what is best for Chelsea Football Club and while we will remain as ambitious as ever, this decision could slow down our progress."" Buck added: ""Obviously we are disappointed but we recognise and we respect totally that the shareholders of Chelsea Pitch Owners have spoken. ""We will meet with Mr Abramovich (Chelsea's Russian owner) and the rest of the board and we will decide what action, if any, we will take going forward. '""I don't view this as an us and against you, we against they situation. We are all Chelsea fans and I can only hope that on Saturday we can get together and support this club and beat Arsenal.""","Chelsea lose vote to buy back their Stamford Bridge stadium .

"(CNN) -- Striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended by Manchester City after the furore surrounding his non-appearance from the substitutes' bench during the 2-0 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich on Tuesday. City manager Roberto Mancini slammed the Argentine international following his team's loss at the Allianz Arena, claiming Tevez had refused to take to the pitch and would consequently not play for the club again. And, although Tevez subsequently released a statement denying the claims, City have now confirmed that the player will be suspended for the immediate future. A statement on City's official website read: ""Manchester City can confirm that striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended until further notice for a maximum period of two weeks. ""The player's suspension is pending a full review into his alleged conduct during Tuesday evening's 2-0 defeat to Bayern Munich. ""The player will not be considered for selection or take part in training whilst the review is under way."" Earlier on Wednesday, former Manchester United forward Tevez rejected Italian coach Mancini's claims and said the incident was a ""misunderstanding."" ""I would like to apologise to all Manchester City fans, with whom I have always had a strong relationship, for any misunderstanding that occurred in Munich,"" read the statement from Tevez. Tevez tantrum is a disgrace to soccer . ""They understand that when I am on the pitch I have always given my best for the club. In Munich on Tuesday I had warmed up and was ready to play. This is not the right time to get into specific details as to why this did not happen. But I wish to state that I never refused to play. ""There was some confusion on the bench and I believe my position may have been misunderstood. Going forward I am ready to play when required and to fulfil my obligations."" The statement is in contrast to Tevez's remarks immediately after the match, when he appeared to reaffirm his desire to leave City. ""I think it's Mancini's decision. I've been a professional throughout,"" he told British broadcaster Sky Sports through a translator. ""I put my opinion through, that I wanted to leave for family reasons and I still played my best."" Gomez double gives Bayern 2-0 win . The fixture in Europe's premier club competition was set to be a landmark occasion for City; whose clash with four-time European champions Bayern represented their first away match in the tournament. But the match unravelled for City, who won the English FA Cup last season, when Germany striker Mario Gomez grabbed two goals in the closing stages of the first half. Tuesday's controversy is the latest development in a saga which has seen Tevez move close to an exit from the Etihad Stadium on several occasions. The former Corinthians striker handed in a transfer request in December 2010, citing a breakdown in communications with the City board as the reason behind his decision. It looked as if Tevez was set for a return to Sao Paulo-based Corinthians in July, but the four-time Brazilian champions claimed there was insufficient time to conclude the deal. City have signed a host of attacking players in 2011, including the capture of Dzeko from Wolfsburg in January and the additions of Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid and France midfielder Samir Nasri from Arsenal in the last transfer window. As a result, Tevez has struggled to break into City's starting line-up so far this season and has seen defender Vincent Kompany replace him as club captain. ""He wanted to leave last year,"" former Inter coach Mancini told a press conference on Tuesday. ""I helped him for two years every time. He refused to play. I cannot accept this behaviour from him. I decide the substitutions, not Carlos. ""Do you think at Bayern Munich one player can play like this? Or Milan or Manchester United? No. There were 30 minutes to the end. There was time to change the game.""","Striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended for two weeks by Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Steve Bruce has become the first English Premier League managerial casualty of the season after being sacked by Sunderland on Monday following a poor run of recent results. On Saturday, Sunderland relinquished a 1-0 lead to lose 2-1 at home to bottom side Wigan Athletic, with the winning goal coming in injury time. That result left Sunderland 16th in the 20-team division -- just two points above the relegation zone -- despite an extensive recruitment drive in the close season which saw 11 players join the club. The Wigan defeat also highlighted crowd dissatisfaction with Bruce -- with a number of banners calling for his removal -- and club chairman Ellis Short has decided to act after calling recent results ""simply not good enough"". Ellis told the official Sunderland website: ""This has been a difficult time for everyone at Sunderland and is not a situation that any of us envisaged or expected to be in. ""It is my job as chairman to act in the best interests of our football club at all times and I can assure everyone that this is not a decision I have taken lightly."" He continued: ""Sadly results this season have simply not been good enough and I feel the time is now right to make a change. ""Steve has acted with honesty and integrity throughout, which is testament to the character and commitment he has shown during his time at Sunderland. ""I would like to personally place on record my thanks to him for his significant contribution to our football club over the past two-and-a- half years and everyone here at Sunderland naturally wishes him the very best for the future.""","Sunderland manager Steve Bruce has been sacked after Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Wigan .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former Iranian president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was sentenced to six months in prison for making anti-government statements, semi-official Mehr News Agency reported Tuesday. Hashemi was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests, and the announcement of her sentence comes as parliamentary elections near. Her father, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is a powerful cleric and former parliament speaker. In the past, Rafsanjani has been one of the government's most vocal critics. Rafsanjani served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997, and is still widely believed to be one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful men in Iran. He had long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest in a speech delivered at Tehran's Friday prayers. In recent months, Rafsanjani had toned down attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last March, Rafsanjani was replaced as head of Iran's Assembly of Experts, a powerful committee charged with electing and removing the leader of the Islamic Revolution and supervising his activities.","Faezeh Hashemi was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- President Barack Obama addressed a broad range of political topics during an appearance on NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" Tuesday, insisting among other things that he's not spending too much time yet focused on next year's potential GOP campaign rivals. ""I'm going to wait until everybody's voted off the island,"" Obama joked. ""Once they narrow it down to one or two (candidates), I'll start paying attention."" Obama is currently on a three-day trip to Nevada, California and Colorado. The trip includes several fundraisers for his re-election bid. During a wide-ranging interview, Obama criticized Washington's harsh political climate, telling Leno that ""the things that folks across the country are most fed up with, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, (or) independent, is putting party ahead of country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation."" The two men discussed several foreign policy topics, including the situation in Libya and the impending withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Regarding Libya, Leno asked the president for his reaction to the death of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi. ""This is somebody who for 40 years has terrorized his country and supported terrorism,"" Obama said. Gadhafi ""had an opportunity during the Arab Spring to finally let loose of his grip on power and to peacefully transition into democracy. We gave him ample opportunity, and he wouldn't do it."" Obama said Gadhafi's demise sent ""a strong message around the world to dictators"" that ""people long to be free,"" and that ""universal rights"" and aspirations should be respected. The bloodied Gadhafi's televised jostling with his captors was not something Americans ""should relish,"" the president said . ""There was a reason after (Osama) bin Laden was killed, for example, we didn't release the photograph,"" the president said. ""I think that there's a certain decorum with which you treat the dead -- even if it's somebody who has done terrible things."" The president hit back at GOP critics of the American role in the NATO-led Libya campaign, insisting that the United States did not, as many have claimed, ""lead from behind."" ""We lead from the front,"" Obama asserted, highlighting the U.S. role in pushing a U.N. resolution backing NATO's intervention, as well as the U.S. military's role in establishing a no-fly zone over Libya. ""The difference here is we were able to organize the international community,"" Obama said. ""There was never this sense that somehow we were unilaterally making a decision to take out somebody. Rather, it was the world community."" The Libya operation ""is a recipe for success in the future,"" the president declared. Obama also defended his choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year -- a decision blasted by GOP critics concerned the move will imperil U.S. gains in the region. ""I don't know exactly how they are thinking about it,"" Obama said. ""We've been in there for years, over 4,000 young men and women killed, tens of thousands injured, some of them for life, (and) spent close to $1 trillion on this operation. I think the vast majority of the American people feel as if it is time to bring this war to a close, particularly because we still have ... work to do in Afghanistan."" The president noted the importance of the recent death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike. Al-Awlaki played a critical role with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, heading up external operations and focusing on attacking the United States, officials said. Al-Awlaki was ""probably the most important al Qaeda threat that was out there after bin Laden was taken out,"" Obama said. ""It was important that working with the enemies, we were able to remove him from the field."" Turning closer to home, Obama had strong praise for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- his toughest competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. ""I'm really proud of her,"" Obama said. ""It really wasn't that difficult"" to come together after the campaign. ""The truth is Hillary and I agree on the vast majority of issues."" Obama appeared to dismiss rumors of a possible job swap between Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden in 2012, telling Leno that ""they are doing great where they are."" The president expressed a degree of sympathy for the Occupy Wall Street movement, noting that ""people are frustrated, and that frustration has expressed itself in a lot of different ways"" -- including both Occupy Wall Street and the tea party. As a huge basketball fan, the president called the current NBA lockout ""heartbreaking."" ""We should be able to figure out how to split a $9 billion dollar pot so that our fans, who are allowing us to make all of this money, can actually have a good season,"" he said. Asked about his health and personal habits, Obama told Leno that he has ""definitively"" quit smoking, and remains ""big on exercise."" The president said he works out on a regular basis with first lady Michelle Obama in a small White House gym. ""It's embarrassing sometimes,"" the president said. ""She'll get up there a half an hour earlier than me. She will have already run 10 miles or something ... (when I'm) staggering up to the gym."" Noting the first lady's highly publicized campaign for fitness and healthier eating habits, Obama said his wife actually does enjoy more unhealthy cuisine on occasion. ""She loves french fries. She loves pizza. She loves chicken. Her point is just in moderation,"" Obama told Leno. As for the upcoming Halloween holiday, the president said his wife generally hands out fruit and raisins. The president said he told his wife that ""the White House is going to get egged if this keeps up.""","NEW: Obama jokes White House may get egged if first lady hands out fruit and raisins on Halloween .

"London (CNN) -- Though she may have had numerous husbands and lovers, Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor had one enduring love: jewelry. Her dazzling collection of jewels, many of which were given to her as presents by husbands including Richard Burton and Mike Todd, were referred to Friday in London by Jonathan Rendell, Deputy Chairman of Christie's Americas, as ""the crown jewels of Hollywood."" Fans of the screen idol can now ogle highlights from her extensive jewelry collection, along with a selection of her haute couture dresses by designers including Chanel and Christian Dior, and paintings by artists such as Edgar Degas and Camille Pissarro, at Christie's auction house in London. They are being exhibited there as part of a world tour that will culminate in a series of high-profile sales at Christie's in New York in December. Taylor's jewel collection has been valued in excess of $30 million, according to the auction house. Keith Penton, head of the jewelry department at Christie's in London, said that Taylor's taste in jewels was ""extraordinarily refined. She really understood her gemstones ([and)she had a passion for design and workmanship, quite a rare combination."" And not only do they speak of her infamous and tempestuous romance with actor Richard Burton, he said, the jewels come with their own dramatic histories -- such as a 50-carat pearl known as ""La Peregrina,"" given to her by Burton in 1969, that was once part of the crown jewels of Spain. It was mounted onto a specially commissioned diamond and ruby Cartier necklace and is estimated to fetch between $2 million and $3 million at auction in December. There is also the Taj Mahal diamond pendant necklace, which Burton gave her on her 40th birthday in 1972 and which had been a gift from the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan to his wife in the 17th century. ""If a jewel had a historic provenance, they were particularly enamored,"" said Penton of the pair's taste in gems. According to Nancy Schoenberger, co-author of the book ""Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, The Marriage of the Century,"" Taylor developed a taste for jewels from a young age. ""Her father was an art and antiques dealer,"" Schoenberger explained. ""She grew up surrounded by beautiful things and was always drawn to jewelry as a young girl,"" she said. But it wasn't until Taylor's marriage to film and Broadway producer Mike Todd that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold, Schoenberger said. Todd, her third husband, bought Taylor a 29.4-carat diamond ring as well as a diamond tiara, which she wore to the 1957 Academy Awards. Schoenberger believes that when Richard Burton bought Taylor the 33.19-carat Krupp Diamond ring in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at Christie's, estimated to fetch between $2.5 million and $3.5 million -- he was trying to out-do Mike Todd, who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with Taylor. ""I think that was a big deal for Richard, to buy her a diamond as big as Mike Todd's. And he liked showing that the son of a Welsh coal-miner could buy his lady love these extravagant jewels,"" she said. Penton believes that the collection will induce feverish bidding in the salesroom, for the quality of the collection but also for their added Hollywood glamor. ""Judging from past sales, which have never been as spectacular as this one -- I think the sky's the limit,"" he said. The actress, who died this year aged 79, eulogized her love of gems in her 2002 memoir, ""My Love Affair With Jewelry."" In it, she wrote: ""I never, never thought of my jewelry as trophies. I'm here to take care of them and to love them. When I die and they go off to auction I hope whoever buys them gives them a really good home."" At a press conference on Friday, Rendell of Christie's said that the collection reveals ""one of the great characters, this was one of the great stars, this was someone who understood her contract with the public."" Penton agreed and said, ""Looking at the couture, you can see that she was not a very large lady but obviously with the hair, with the presence, with the glamor, it all added up to something very fabulous."" In memory of the actress's life-long devotion to humanitarian causes, a portion of profits generated by admissions, events and select publications related to the sales will be donated to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation (ETAF), which she set up in 1991. ""Highlights from the Collection of Elizabeth Taylor"" is on public display at Christie's, London, on 24, 25 and 26 September, after which it will travel to Los Angeles, Dubai, Geneva, Paris, Hong Kong and finally, New York.","Highlights from Elizabeth Taylor's extensive jewelry collection on display at Christie's in London .

"Paris (CNN) -- A Paris prosecutor has asked for corruption charges against former President Jacques Chirac to be dropped, courthouse press representative Sylvie Polack confirmed Tuesday. Chirac was accused of misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president. The prosecutor also asked for nine other people charged along with Chirac to be acquitted Tuesday. The judge has yet to give his verdict in the case and could still find the accused guilty. Chirac, now 78, had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France, from 1995 to 2007. He was accused -- along with the other defendants -- of using public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and to pay others to perform jobs that did not really exist. ""There are elements missing to show both the intentional and material aspect of an offense, so I ask that the charges be dropped against the 10 defendants,"" said Michel Maes, an aide to the prosecutor. The judge's verdict is expected before the end of the year, the courthouse press representative said. Former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair. After Chirac left office as president, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter. He always denied wrongdoing.","Chirac was accused of embezzling funds from the city of Paris while mayor .

"(CNN) -- On a scenic Hawaiian beach, a sailor found a message in a bottle that was sent about five years ago by a sixth-grader in Japan. Petty Officer Jon Moore spotted the bottle Thursday during a beach clean up project near the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility on the island of Kauai. Moore was among a group of sailors plucking cigarette butts and food wrappers from the beach when he spotted it. ""I looked over and saw the bottle.  I jokingly thought it would have a treasure map inside, but it actually had a message,"" Moore said. Inside the bottle were four origami flowers and a letter signed by student Saki Arikawa. There was also a picture of Arikawa's class from Kagoshima, a city in Japan's southern island of Kyushu. The letter was dated March 25, 2006 and Arikawa's note asked that whoever found the bottle to write back. Somehow the bottle had traveled some 4,000 miles and reached Moore. Moore said he immediately thought of home. Even though he was born in Guyana, South America, he said Japan feels like home because his wife and son live there. The sailor said he plans to visit Kagoshima on his next trip home to visit his family. And he also has a letter to write. ""I'll definitely respond.  I want to write back to the school and get their thoughts,"" Moore said.","Petty Officer Jon Moore finds the bottle during a clean up project in Hawaii .

"Berlin (CNN) -- An opossum that gained worldwide fame for its comedic cross-eyed looks has been put to sleep after its health deteriorated, Leipzig Zoo said Wednesday. The female opossum, called Heidi, became a German media sensation after her picture was published in late 2010 and had more than 330,000 fans on Facebook. According to the zoo's website, she and a sister were probably born in May 2008. The pair were found as orphans and raised in a wild animal sanctuary in North Carolina before moving to a zoo in Denmark and eventually arriving in Leipzig in May last year. Leipzig Zoo released a statement saying: ""Heidi, our cross-eyed opossum, has closed her eyes forever today. She passed away having shown typical symptoms of her old age and having severely suffered from arthrosis. ""This illness has made it painful for her to move over the last couple of weeks and Heidi was treated with vitamins and other medicine. Following a short-lived improvement of her condition, her general state of health deteriorated over the last days despite continuous efforts by the veterinarians."" Heidi had to be put to sleep avoid her suffering pain, in accordance with animal welfare guidelines, the zoo said. Arthrosis is a degenerative joint disease. The cause of Heidi's profoundly crossed eyes remains a mystery, although the zoo's website suggests the way she was fed when she was hand-reared in the United States may have played a role -- as well as the fact she was overweight, which led to ""fatty deposits behind the eyes which are pressing the eyeballs slightly out of the eye sockets."" Her sister, named Naira, is also cross-eyed but the zoo's third opossum, a male called Teddy, lacks their distinctive looks. Opossums, a type of marsupial found in North and South America, have a maximum life expectancy of four to five years, the zoo's website says. CNN's Brian Walker and Stefan Simons contributed to this report.","Heidi became a German media sensation after moving to Leipzig Zoo last year .

"(CNN) -- When Piers Morgan pointed out that ""Vicious"" Victor Ortiz will be ""facing a guy that has beaten just about everyone that's come in front of him,"" the boxing champ told the CNN host, ""Fear doesn't even exist in my dictionary anymore. It was one of those things where my upbringing alone got rid of all that."" Morgan was referring to Ortiz's upcoming September 17 bout with ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd Mayweather. Ortiz and his mentor, boxing great Oscar de la Hoya, are guests on Wednesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Abandoned by his mother at the age of 8, Ortiz was left to essentially raise his younger brother when his father walked out of the family's Kansas home four years later. ""It was my brother and I just roaming around like two strays, you know,"" said Ortiz. Ortiz took care of his brother, who is two years younger, day in and day out and even put him through college. ""He and I had each other's back usually,"" said Ortiz. ""Like, you know, like two brothers would."" Interestingly enough, once Ortiz became famous, his parents did not seek him out. ""I actually went out of my way to find both of my parents,"" said Ortiz, who told Morgan that he traveled to Kansas and ""asked around everywhere,"" in order to track down his dad. When he finally found the elder Ortiz, the World Boxing Council Welterweight Champion of the World said that his father was still ""very intimidating,"" and that he resisted the urge to ask the man why he'd abandoned his family. ""I was just like, 'Hey, Dad, you know what? I did your job and my brother and I grew up."" Morgan asked Ortiz, 24, if he feels that his opponent holds a psychological advantage over him. Mayweather has won 10 world titles and is undefeated as a professional boxer. Mayweather, however, hasn't stepped in the ring in over a year, while Ortiz has fought five fights in that time. ""I'm not really sure how the balance lies,"" answered Ortiz. ""But that's one thing that I'm willing to put aside, because I want the best pound for pound, Floyd Mayweather to arrive, September the 17th, across the ring from me."" Morgan asked 10-time world champion and Olympic medalist Oscar de la Hoya, who was defeated by Mayweather in 2007, what kind of man Mayweather is to fight. ""He is a great fighter,"" said de la Hoya. ""He is the best pound for pound fighter in the world today. He is great for the sport. He has done great things for boxing. And, you know, on September 17th, Victor is going to face the best. And, you know, there's no excuses whatsoever. ""But when I fought him, I mean you can say that I was over the hill. I was an old 35 years old when I faced him. He beat me, yes, hands down. There's no doubt about that. I congratulate him."" De la Hoya alluded to the possibility of Mayweather, who at 34 is 10 years Ortiz's senior, passing the torch on to Ortiz, who de la Hoya believes ""will be one of the greats."" Does de la Hoya believe he'd beat Ortiz if the pair got into the ring today? ""Let me put it this way,"" de la Hoya told Morgan. ""If I was at my prime and -- and Victor is at his prime -- it would be one hell of a fight, that's for sure. Maybe a draw."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- President Obama says the new Buffett Rule ""is not class warfare,"" raising once again the question of why he and his party keep rowing back from one of the Democrats' most potent arguments. They seem to have accepted the Republicans' pejorative definition of economic class warfare as an un-American evil. As Warren Buffet points out, middle-income Americans ought to be protesting a system in which billionaires like him pay a third to a half of the 33% tax rate of Buffet's secretary. In fact, nonviolent class struggle over income distribution has a long and beneficial history in this country and most other industrial democracies. Starting with the rise of the Populist Party in the late 19th century, continuing into the Progressive Era and the New Deal, grabbing for and getting a bigger slice of the economic pie for wage earners has been a major stabilizing force in American democracy. We are now racing in the direction of income polarization and the political instability that inevitably accompanies the contraction of the middle class and a concentration of wealth within a tiny minority. Based on the numbers, President Obama ought to be able to win this argument easily. As former President Clinton pointed out in an interview Monday, 10% of the population have taken 90% of the benefits of economic growth. James Carville is probably right that it's time for Obama to fire the White House communications team and carry the economic fight to the Republicans. It could hardly hurt when the voters who are getting their pockets picked are siding with the Republican corporate oligarchs who used to be the Democrats' arch-villains. In the current journalistic environment only the rich may be greedy without blame, and it is not just Fox, but the mainstream media, as well, that parrots the ""class warfare"" criticism and puts a negative spin on anything that can be called ""populism."" For their part, Congressional Democrats seem allergic to their own president's advocacy of a minimally fair tax rate on rich individuals and corporations. They are also timid about challenging the Republicans on their myth-making propaganda about ""job creators."" What evidence can House Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan produce that repealing Bush-era tax rates for couples making more than $250,000 and allowing the top marginal tax rates of 33 percent and 35 percent to revert to 36 percent and 39.6 percent next year would prevent corporations and investors from creating jobs? What can be deduced is that corporations are content to sit on their $2 trillion in cash reserves as long as tax breaks and lax regulations make reinvestment for growth a less attractive alternative. All MBA students are taught ""cash is king,"" and the banks have taken the slogan so seriously they won't even release to credit markets the $2 trillion in bailout funds given them as a gift outright. The job creators aren't creating anything. They're sitting on every tax-free dollar they can while the sitting is good. So how did we get to this point? Something is clearly wrong with Kansas and the rest of Middle America when it comes to letting economic self-interest guide their voting. The decline of the labor movement, which was a powerful instrument of economic education for the masses, surely must have something to do with it. Then there is the impact of more than 30 years of conservative distortion of America's economic vocabulary since Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. He showed his party that making vague promises to preserve the ""safety net"" was smarter politics than tackling the real problems of Social Security disability, private pension funds and indigent health care. By 1984, the Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale, was ridiculed for trying to make campaign themes of ""fairness"" and ""compassion."" This history gives one pause about urging Obama to argue more openly for fairer distribution of income. Certainly if we are in a class war over money, only one side is fighting. Probably not even Reagan, an ex-New Dealer, expected so complete a turnaround on what used to be called ""pocketbook issues."" In interviewing a Republican guest, Mitch Daniels, Jon Stewart noted last week that the bottom 50% of the population owns less than 2.5% of the nation's wealth. If that's not the result of class warfare, Stewart wondered, what is? Put that way, the question seemed momentarily to fluster Daniels, as if he had not realized how completely the affluent have triumphed. Finally, Daniels allowed that maybe some tax fairness could be considered as long as it didn't hurt the job creators. No wonder he got thrown out of the Republican presidential race, given such blatant advocacy of class warfare against the deserving rich. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howell Raines.","Howell Raines: Obama, Dems run from class warfare notion even though it's potent issue .

"(CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky's attorney said Wednesday that a young man at the heart of cover-up allegations against Penn State University officials told him he was not a victim and had no sexual contact with the former assistant football coach. Defense lawyer Joseph Amendola told CNN contributor Sara Ganim that the young man, who was described in a grand jury report as being about 10 years old in March 2002, was in Amendola's office several weeks ago and said he believed he was the boy called ""Victim 2."" The young man said nothing sexual occurred with Sandusky in the shower, according to Amendola. ""He said he had turned all of the shower heads on ... and water was running on the floor. He said he was surfing, going from one end to the other to slide across the shower floor,"" Amendola said. First lawsuit filed against Sandusky . The lawyer said that three, perhaps four, of eight alleged victims mentioned in the grand jury report have either maintained friendships with Sandusky or visited him. ""Victim 2"" had dinner last summer with Sandusky, Amendola said. According to grand jury documents, a graduate assistant told then-Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno in 2002 that he had seen Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in a football complex shower. Paterno told Athletic Director Tim Curley, who told Gary Schultz, a university vice president, according to the grand jury report. Curley and Schultz were each charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations about Sandusky. According to Amendola, Sandusky contends that Curley told him that a person reported seeing the coach and a young boy in the shower. Curley described the incident as ""horseplay"" and that it made the witness uncomfortable. Sandusky's ""make-believe world"" Sandusky gave Curley the boy's name and phone number and said that nothing inappropriate had occurred, Amendola said. That graduate assistant has been identified as assistant coach Mike McQueary, who has been placed on administrative leave. Neither the boy in the shower nor Sandusky reported seeing McQueary, Amendola said Wednesday. Sandusky, 67, is free on $100,000 bail. He is charged with 40 counts related to the alleged sexual abuse. He allegedly met the victims through The Second Mile, a charity he started. A preliminary hearing for Sandusky is scheduled for December 13. According to Amendola, Sandusky has seen McQueary at charitable events, including those of Second Mile. There was never any tension between the two, the lawyer said. Sandusky has maintained he did not commit the crimes and has not discussed a possible plea deal. Amendola said Sandusky has defenses to all the allegations. ""Right now he's presumed to be innocent, these are alleged victims,"" Amendola told Ganim. ""The media has done Jerry a disservice by continuously referring to them as victims."" Amendola said he's told Sandusky that giving a bear hug to a youth in a shower was not a good idea. People who know him well call Sandusky a ""big overgrown kid,"" the lawyer said.","Defense attorney describes Sandusky's version of shower incident .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The mother of a German national suspected of one of the worst arson sprees in Los Angeles history appeared before a U.S. magistrate judge Tuesday in the German government's effort to extradite her on fraud charges. Harry Burkhart, 24, may have been motivated to set the fires by his mother's arrest, according to officials and CNN affiliates. His mother, 53-year-old Dorothee Burkhart, was arrested by Los Angeles police during a traffic stop on December 28, a day before the first of 52 fires, mostly in parked cars, that investigators suspect were part of a series of arsons. The son, who was arrested Monday, was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling. He is likely to face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harry Burkhart remains jailed without bail and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. ""What did you do to my son,"" Dorothee Burkhart, yelled at the judge during her hearing Tuesday. ""My son is disappeared since yesterday. Perhaps the German Nazis know of our address."" It did not appear that she knew her son had been arrested a day earlier on the arson charge. She turned down an offer of a court-appointed lawyer and was given until her next hearing Friday to hire a defense attorney. A federal extradition complaint said she is wanted in Germany on 19 counts of fraud, including an allegation that she defrauded the doctor who performed breast augmentation surgery on her in 2004. The other fraud charges center on rent and security deposits for apartments in Frankfurt, Germany, the complaint said. A website advertising ""sensual tantra massage"" and offering ""full body hot oil body to body sliding massage"" is registered to Dorothee Burkhart using a Hollywood address, according to a domain registry database. She lived with her son in a Hollywood apartment, according to the complaint. Investigators seized press clippings of arson attacks in Germany from the apartment, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Dorothee Burkhart last entered the United States lawfully in January 2007 and left the country four months later, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She currently has no lawful immigration status and ICE has lodged an immigration detainer against her, it said. A court document released earlier on Tuesday incorrectly stated that Dorothee Burkhart had most recently entered the United States in October, according to ICE. Harry Burkhart was in the United States lawfully at the time of his arrest on a non-immigrant visa, which expires on January 18, ICE said. The agency has similarly lodged an immigration detainer against him. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the suspect was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage is likely to reach $3 million, said Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that after Los Angeles police released a surveillance video of a man seen near the scene of one fire, agents in the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security field office recognized Burkhart. Multiple CNN affiliates reported the alleged arson spree could have stemmed from a deportation battle between the suspect and immigration officials involving Burkhart's mother. After his arrest, Burkhart told investigators, ""I hate America,"" according to CNN affiliate KABC. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said officials believe -- and hope -- the fires were set by one person. But they will proceed as though others may be involved until they know for sure, Beck said. ""I feel very good that we've got the right guy. (The suspect) had the right stuff in his van, and we are confident in the arrest,"" Beck said. Neighbor Galina Larimoda told KABC-TV through a Russian translator that Harry Burkhart knocked on her door Sunday and seemed angry and not ""completely normal."" Los Angeles County Reserve Sheriff's Deputy Shervin Lalezary, who draws a salary of $1 a year, was hailed as a hero for arresting Burkhart. Lalezary, an Iranian-born lawyer who moonlights as a deputy, pulled over a van in Hollywood driven by a man who resembled the person seen on the surveillance video. With the help of backup officers, he then arrested the driver, Burkhart. CNN's Chuck Conder, Alan Duke, Paul Vercammen, Mike Ahlers, Ashley Hayes, Lateef Mungin, and Irving Last contributed to this report.","NEW: Harry Burkhart's mother has no lawful immigration status, ICE says .

"(CNN) -- Billy Graham is being treated for pneumonia and ""is responding well to antibiotic treatment,"" said a pulmonologist at the North Carolina hospital where the evangelist was admitted Wednesday. Dr. Mark Hellreich, who is treating Graham at Mission Hospital in Asheville, said Thursday that the 93-year-old is in stable condition, and a spokesman for Graham said he is in ""good spirits"" and resting comfortably. Graham spent time reading the Bible and praying with his daughter, Gigi, Wednesday night, spokesman A. Larry Ross said on Twitter. When Graham was admitted Wednesday for evaluation of his lungs, ""he was alert, smiling and waving at hospital staff,"" the hospital said. ""While no date has been set for discharge, Mr. Graham is looking forward to returning home to spend the upcoming Christmas holidays with his family."" Ross said Graham was visited Thursday by his pastor, the Rev. Don Wilton, who shared a passage from the book of Ephesians: ""For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers."" ""Given the outpouring of love and well-wishes Mr. Graham has received from people around the world, the verse seemed to have special meaning to him,"" Ross said. Ross said that as Graham and his daughter were channel-surfing to find a news broadcast, they came upon a broadcast of Graham's 1973 crusade in St. Louis. ""It was a blessing to Mr. Graham to realize his preaching still reaches around the world,"" said Ross, ""and even into hospital rooms like his."" Graham was hospitalized in May for treatment of pneumonia. He resumed his ongoing program of physical therapy and normal activity shortly after release, the hospital said. Graham, a resident of nearby Montreat, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents beginning with Harry S. Truman and is the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The Charlotte native has preached to untold millions over six decades, beginning his missionary work in 1944 when he started speaking at rallies for the Youth for Christ Campus Life ministry. Five years later, Graham was holding crusades in tents in downtown Los Angeles. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the crusades drew so many followers they were extended to seven. His most recent book, ""Nearing Home,"" was published in October. Graham's ""last crusade"" in June 2005 drew a total of 230,000 people. He described it as his last American crusade, but hedged his farewells during a poignant appearance in Corona Park in Queens, New York. ""We hope to come back again someday,"" Graham announced. ""I was asked in an interview if this was our last crusade and I said it probably is -- in New York. But I also said, 'I never say never.'

"(CNN) -- The man authorities believe was responsible for the New Year's Day shooting death of a national park ranger in Washington state was a former soldier who owned many knives and guns despite an emotionally unstable, vindictive and anger-prone mind-set, the mother of his toddler daughter said in court documents. Authorities on Monday found Benjamin Colton Barnes' body face down in a creek in Mount Rainier National Park, not far from where investigators believe he fatally shot park ranger Margaret Anderson. Investigators say they believe Barnes shot the ranger after he blew through a checkpoint set up to check vehicles to make sure they had the proper winter gear necessary to travel the park. Anderson and another ranger had set up a second roadblock to stop him when he jumped out of the car and opened fire. She was struck before she was able to get out of her vehicle, authorities said. Anderson, 34, was the first Rainier park employee to be a homicide victim, and the devastated staff needed a few more days to recover before the park reopens Saturday, officials said Tuesday. While investigators said they had little insight into Barnes' mind-set or motivations, the woman with whom he was in a custody dispute over their young daughter said in court documents filed last year that she was frightened to be in the same state with him. ""The weapons are harmful, and I don't know if he will try to use them against myself or my family,"" the woman wrote in a filing for a temporary restraining order filed with the Pierce County Superior Court on May 24. She wrote in other documents reported on by CNN affiliate KIRO that Barnes might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a deployment to Iraq. Barnes, 24, served as a radio and communications repair specialist with 2nd Squadron, 1st Calvary Regiment, a unit of the 2nd Infantry Division located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Seattle, according to Army spokesman Troy Rolan. He joined the Army in February 2007 and was deployed to Iraq from that year to shortly before his discharge in 2009, Rolan said. Details of his discharge were not immediately available, Rolan said, and Army policy prohibits release of information about a soldier's medical condition. Despite photos of a muscular Barnes, shirtless, tattooed and brandishing two guns, Barnes wasn't a combat soldier. Instead, he was responsible for fixing radios and other communications equipment, Rolan said. The weapons in the widely circulated photo didn't appear to be government-issued, Steven Dean, an assistant special agent in charge at the FBI's Seattle office, said Monday. And he didn't appear to have any special wilderness or survival training, Dean said. Barnes was found face down near a creek in a T-shirt, jeans and one shoe. Before the shooting at the national park, Barnes was wanted in connection with a shooting early Sunday in the Seattle suburb of Skyway that left four people wounded, two critically, according to the King County Sheriff's Office. ""There was kind of a show-and-tell with guns in the evening at a party,"" spokeswoman Sgt. Cindi West told CNN. Shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday, one of the males at the party asked to see a gun belonging to another person, West said. When asked to give the gun back, the male refused. ""A fight ensued, and at one point at least two people pulled guns, and a shootout ensued. Witnesses said that Benjamin Barnes was one of the subjects that pulled a gun and fired,"" West said in a statement. Barnes left the scene with two others. ""It is unclear at this point who shot first and who was shot by whom,"" West said. Authorities contacted Barnes' family after the incident in a bid to have him come in for questioning, according to authorities. Meanwhile, a woman who said she had spurned Barnes' romantic advances said he visited her on Sunday morning, before Anderson's shooting, to wish her a happy new year, according to CNN affiliate KCPQ. She told the station that she thought Barnes was a nice guy when they first met, but that he ""seemed sketchy"" after she got to know him better. That he turned to violence in his final days wasn't shocking to her, she told the station. ""It doesn't surprise me, honestly. He is a loose cannon. If he doesn't get his way or something makes him upset, he goes all the way out of control,"" she told the station. The park remained closed Tuesday, as authorities continued to investigate the shooting and Barnes' death. ""We are still dealing with the loss,"" said Mount Rainier National Park spokesman Kevin Bacher. ""Everybody is just devastated and exhausted by this, trying to get back on an even keel."" The last ranger fatalities at the park was in 1995 when two climbing rangers died during a rescue, officials said. About 125 employees at Rainier are being offered counseling and other measures. ""A very large number of our staff are very shook up by this event,"" said Bacher. Anderson was one of about a dozen commissioned law enforcement officers at the park. They assist motorists, firefighters, campers and search-and-rescue personnel. ""Our rangers are trained to be prepared for anything,"" Bacher told CNN. Condolences continued to pour in Tuesday to the Officer Down Memorial Page; 955 messages had been posted as of Tuesday evening in praise of Anderson's service and offering comfort to her family, including her husband Eric Anderson, who also worked as a ranger at the park, and their two children, 1 and 4. ""Everyone is talking about her,"" Patty Wrzesien, a waitress at Cruiser's Cafe, told CNN affiliate KING on Monday. ""She was such a sweet, sweet lady."" Anderson had always liked the outdoors, and she liked helping people, her father, Paul Kritsch, told KING. And that is why she loved her job as a ranger, he said. Her family is planning a memorial service, according to Bacher. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Mount Rainier National Park will reopen Saturday .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Pop superstar Rihanna has been ordered to cover up by a Christian farmer who took exception to her ""inappropriate behavior"" while filming a music video on his land. The controversy has erupted in Northern Ireland and was even discussed Tuesday by lawmakers in the province's elected Assembly in Belfast. Rihanna, who was born in Barbados but has Irish ancestry, is in Northern Ireland this week for sold-out shows at Belfast's Odyssey Arena. The 23-year-old had been given permission to film a video for the song ""We Found Love"" in a muddy barley field owned by farmer Alan Graham outside Bangor, about 10 miles from Belfast. Graham explained Tuesday, ""I didn't know who was coming. If the name 'Rihanna' had been mentioned, well, no disrespect, but it wouldn't have meant anything."" However, he says that when he went to get his tractor Monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top, he stepped in to end the shoot. The local political representative said he ""asked the film crew to stop, and they did."" Graham insisted that ""there were no hard feelings."" He added: ""I had a conversation with Rihanna; we shook hands; we parted company on good terms. I found her very gracious, and I hope she understands where I'm coming from. I wish her well."" Word had quickly spread of Rihanna's surprise appearance in the Northern Irish countryside, and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star. Graham's wife shed more light on the incident Tuesday, revealing that Rihanna had gone topless. Said Mrs. Graham, who declined to give her first name, ""What she was doing became more inappropriate. When she started to go topless, that's what Alan was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand. There was a man as well, and the behavior was getting more inappropriate. ... It wasn't the sort of thing Alan wanted young people (those watching) to see on his land. We are Christians."" However, Mrs. Graham added: ""The girl was very nice; she shook hands with Alan several times"" after he asked for the filming to stop. Not to be deterred, Rihanna was back filming again in Belfast on Tuesday. But the controversy of the sexy shoot in the barley field rumbled on -- and even made it onto the agenda at the Northern Ireland Assembly. Graham is a local representative with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (formerly led by Protestant preacher the Rev. Ian Paisley), and the Rihanna row led to a light-hearted exchange between lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday. Mike Nesbitt, of rival pro-British party the Ulster Unionists, addressed Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister. Nesbitt said, ""I wonder if the first minister has had an opportunity to assess the potential damage from the news that the pop icon Rihanna was foiled in her filming ambitions yesterday, which I believe were no more sinister than appearing in a field in red, white and blue."" (The latter are the colors of the British flag as well as the American one). Robinson replied, ""I'm pretty sure there was no problem with the colors involved!"" Robinson had just been telling the Assembly of his recent trade mission to the United States to encourage Hollywood studios to make more movies in Northern Ireland.","Pop singer was filming ""We Found Love"" video on farm outside Belfast .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's perfect start to the English Premier League season came to a halt on Saturday when the defending champions were held to a 1-1 draw at Stoke City. United had won five matches in a row, and took the lead through a superb individual goal from midfielder Nani in the 27th minute as the Portugal international waltzed into the box and drilled in a low shot. However, the industrious home side never gave up and claimed a point against the 19-time English champions for the first time in the Premier League thanks to a 52nd-minute header from big-money August signing Peter Crouch. The lanky former Tottenham striker got between central defenders Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand to nod home from a corner as United goalkeeper David De Gea was left helpless on his line. United went into the match without England striker Wayne Rooney, who wrote on Twitter that he expects to return from injury for Tuesday's Champions League visit by Swiss side Basel. His regular forward partner Javier Hernandez is a doubt for that match after coming off in the first half against Stoke having fallen hard on his head when he tumbled following a tussle with Jonathan Woodgate as the Mexican sought to score. That left United with last season's top scorer Dimitar Berbatov up front alongside Michael Owen, who scored twice in midweek in the League Cup but failed to make the same impression. Berbatov was similarly ineffectual and was later replaced by Danny Welbeck as United battled in vain to win the match. The result left United on 16 points, above local rivals Manchester City only on goal difference. City earlier briefly topped the table as second-half goals from substitutes Mario Balotelli and James Milner ended Everton's run of victories in their last four visits to Eastlands. Balotelli broke the deadlock in the 68th minute after replacing Edin Dzeko, with his shot taking a deflection off Everton defender Phil Jagielka. The Italian then set up David Silva, whose effort was ruled out for offside -- and the Spanish playmaker also earlier hit the woodwork. Silva provided City's second with a minute to play as he sent England midfielder Milner clear after an error by Everton's former Real Madrid winger Royston Drenthe, who came on as a substitute. Balotelli's return to form will give manager Roberto Mancini a selection dilemma ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Bayern Munich. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres was both hero and villain as third-placed Chelsea beat promoted Swansea 4-1. The Spain striker scored his second goal in two games after a long drought to put the London side ahead on the half hour, but was sent off before halftime for a bad tackle on Mark Gower -- his first red card in the Premier League. It was another mixed weekend for the $80 million former Liverpool player, who also netted in the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United before an extraordinary miss that saw him widely lampooned. Ramires had already made it 2-0 before Torres departed, and the Brazil midfielder doubled his tally in the 76th minute before Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed in Gower's freekick. Substitute Didier Drogba sealed victory deep into stoppage time to boost his hopes of starting in Wednesday's Champions League trip to Valencia. Newcastle retained fourth place with a 3-1 victory over Blackburn, who remained in the relegation zone. Senegal striker Demba Ba scored his first hat-trick in English football before being replaced by France midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his league comeback after almost a year out with a broken leg. Fifth-placed Liverpool bounced back from the 4-0 trouncing at Tottenham by beating mid-table Wolverhampton 2-1 at home. Charlie Adam was sent off last weekend but this time his 11th-minute shot produced an own-goal by defender Roger Johnson, and striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 before halftime. Substitute striker Steven Fletcher gave Wolves hope four minutes after the break, but Kenny Dalglish's team held on as England midfielder Steven Gerrard continued his comeback from long-term injury when he was introduced late in the match. Tottenham closed to within a point of Liverpool, having played one fewer match, after a 2-1 win at Wigan. New signing Emmanuel Adebayor set up Dutch midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart in just the third minute, then Gareth Bale headed home Luka Modric's 23rd-minute corner to make it 2-0. Striker Mohamed Diame reduced the deficit five minutes after halftime but Wigan defender Steve Gohouri was sent off for a second booking for a foul on winger Bale as Spurs held on for a third successive victory. Arsenal moved out of the relegation zone and up to 12th place with a 3-0 win over 10-man Bolton that left the visitors rock bottom after five successive defeats. Robin van Persie's second-half double gave the Dutch forward 100 goals for the London club, while Alex Song curled home late on. Bolton had defender David Wheater sent off with the score at 1-0 after tugging back England forward Theo Walcott, who later limped off. West Brom and Fulham remained in the bottom four after a 0-0 draw at the Hawthorns which left the visiting London side still seeking a first victory this season.","Manchester United drop first points of English season with 1-1 draw at Stoke .

"Watch the full interview with Denise Richards tonight. ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" airs weeknights on CNN/US at 9 p.m. ET and on CNN International at 0200 GMT (Live simulcast), 1200 GMT and 2000 GMT / HKT 2000 . CNN -- ""If Charlie [Sheen] is to sort his life out,"" Piers Morgan asked Denise Richards. ""Can you ever imagine a scenario where you might one day get back together?"" ""I'm way too old for him now,"" joked Richards, who turned 40 this year. ""I'm way past his age range."" The actress and mother of three is a guest on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Richards is also a first-time author. Her new book, ""The Real Girl Next Door,"" was released this week. Richards told Morgan that she and Sheen have been split up for six years. The couple's divorce was finalized in 2006. ""When we fell in love,"" Richards said, ""he had been sober for three years. He was getting his life back together. He had just gotten a job on 'Spin City.' And I really admired his strength and courage for overcoming addiction, and being so humble about it. ""And that's what attracted me to him. So the Charlie that some of you have seen over the last six months is not the person that I met and married."" Richards went on to say that Sheen was ""amazing"" when they first met. ""He was so humbled and sweet, and charming and funny. And had such a great heart, and very honest. And we just had a very deep connection."" Morgan asked Richards about her take on ""the recent circus of Charlie's life."" ""From the beginning of it I was very worried,"" she said. ""And it made me sad to see him that way. And so I was concerned. I was concerned for our children."" Richards said that, in dealing with Sheen, the couple's two daughters -- Sam, 7, and Lola, 6 -- remain her priority. ""We'll always have a bond with our daughters,"" she said. ""And I wish nothing but the best for him."" When Morgan asked Richards what her wish for her ex-husband was, the actress said she wants him to be healthy and there for his kids and himself. ""He's a survivor,"" said Richards. ""If anyone can pick themselves up, make a huge comeback, it's Charlie."" Morgan asked, what is the weirdest rumor she'd ever heard about herself? ""Well, this isn't that hurtful, but it's weird -- that I used to be a hooker. I used to be a Heidi Fleiss girl. I heard that rumor,"" Richards answered. ""If anyone would know, it would be Charlie,"" said Richards, referring to Sheen's well-documented testimony in Fleiss' 1995 trial that he had spent over $50,000 on 27 hookers. Richards, who is single, said of dating: ""The qualities that I look for now are different than prior to getting married and having kids. ""I find myself very attracted to men who have children. And I think one of the sexiest qualities in a man is seeing a man great with kids."" Richards called motherhood her greatest achievement. ""I love being a mother more than anything. And I get so much fulfillment and joy with my children."" Richards opened up about her recent adoption of a baby girl, whom she named Eloise Joni Richards. ""She's amazing,"" Richards said. She told Morgan that Sam and Lola ""are so in love with her. They are very protective of her."" As for whether she'll marry again, Richards said she intends to ""be a good role model for my kids, and be a strong woman, even if it's on my own."" Richards said that she also plans to continue acting, and that her dream gig has always been ""a role in a movie with Quentin Tarantino directing."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're here now,"" Bono says early on in Davis Guggenheim's new U2 documentary, ""From The Sky Down,"" which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on Thursday night. The film -- which focuses on the tumultuous time in the band's career 20 years ago -- shows how Bono, guitarist the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton got back on track: After considerable infighting and ""creative differences"" while the four hunkered down at Hansa Studios in Berlin in 1990 to try to make an album, the song ""One"" finally and miraculously sprouted from the unfinished ""Mysterious Ways."" ""The movie has this pretty long [section] where you hear them write that song -- and it's goose bumps,"" Guggenheim told Rolling Stone in Toronto. ""The writing of that song really saved the band. They had come out of the height of Joshua Tree as the biggest band in the world. 'Rattle and Hum' was a disaster from their point of view, a lot of bad reviews -- they weren't happy with what they had become. They take that bridge section out of 'Mysterious Ways' and they go back into the room at Hansa. They write a song on the fly in a matter of minutes. 'One' is written and the band is saved and we have all that on tape."" There are other telling inclusions in the film, from footage of Bono getting angry in a dressing room after a Joshua Tree concert in 1987 (culled from Rattle and Hum director Phil Joanou's amazing leftovers) to candid, present-day sound-only interviews that Guggenheim was able to draw from each band member. ""The soul of the movie is these interviews I do with them,"" he said. ""I didn't know how they'd react to the things that I put in the movie,"" said Guggenheim. ""There are some very sensitive things. And to their credit, they said, 'This is truthful; this is real; it's not sensational.'"" Rolling Stone: The Best U2 Songs . The day after the TIFF gala screening, Bono, the Edge and Guggenheim spoke at a press conference about the film. ""I found it a little humiliating to realize that we were so inept and these days we're a better band,"" Bono said. ""We've learned our craft -- and therein lies the huge danger, which is there's a giant chasm between the very good and the great, and U2 right now has a danger of surrendering to the very good."" Guggenheim had earned the Edge's trust from the documentary they did together in 2008, ""It Might Get Loud,"" alongside two other guitar greats, Jack White and Jimmy Page. Still, it's a relationship in progress, Guggenheim noted: ""There's a something adversarial about making a movie about something that neither side wants, but it's naturally there."" ""For me, when Davis agreed to do this, I felt like I could relax because I knew the thing that he was most interested in was actually the truth as opposed to what was a great shot or what might be sensational,"" said the Edge. ""The stuff that's in the film are those moments where we're really being honest."" ""A little bit of sensationalism would have been good, a few great shots,"" joked Bono. ""I felt like I was mugged."" In addition to the tension, intensity and struggle that plays out in the film, there is a lot of levity too, including a satirical montage of bands that have imploded or lost members, references and demonstrations of Bono's unique gibberish singing, dubbed ""Bongalese"" and yes, the band in drag. ""What's interesting is Larry really didn't like the idea and thought he looked like he was in some skin flick,"" said Bono. ""Edge took to it with a perfectionist's eye."" ""I just freaked myself out because I looked so much like my sister, I was shocked,"" the Edge said. Added Bono: ""Adam looked like the Queen of England and I looked like Barbara Bush.""

"(CNN) -- In Japanese legend they are known as The Kamikaze -- the divine winds -- a reference to two mighty typhoons placed providentially seven years apart which, in the 13th century, destroyed two separate Mongol invasion fleets so large they were not eclipsed until the D-Day landings of World War II. Marine archaeologists now say they have uncovered the remains of a ship from the second fleet in 1281 -- believed to have comprised 4,400 vessels -- a meter below the seabed, in 25 meters of water off the coast of Nagasaki, Japan. Scientists are hoping they will be able to recreate the complete Yuan Dynasty vessel from Kublai Khan's lost fleet using a 12-meter-long section of keel. The Mongols ruled China from 1271 to 1368. According to Yoshifumi Ikeda, a professor of archaeology at Okinawa's University of the Ryukyus, and head of the research team, the section could go a long way to helping researchers identify all the characteristics of the 20-meter warship. ""This discovery was of major importance for our research,"" Ikeda told a news conference. ""We are planning to expand search efforts and find further information that can help us restore the whole ship."" Discovered using ultrasound equipment, the research team says it is the first wreck from the period to have an intact hull, the planks of which are still attached to the keel with nails. Scientists say its good state of preservation -- they were even able to establish that the planks were originally painted a whitish-gray -- is due to the fact it has been covered by sand. ""I believe we will be able to understand more about shipbuilding skills at the time as well as the actual situation of exchanges in East Asia,"" Ikeda told reporters in Nagasaki. How to survive a shipwreck . More than 4,000 artifacts, including ceramic shards, bricks used for ballast, cannonballs and stone anchors have been found in the vicinity of the wreck, linking it to the Yuan Dynasty invasion fleet. Ikeda said there were no immediate plans to salvage the hull and the first step was to conserve the find by covering the sites with nets. The Kamikaze -- perhaps better known as the nickname given to the Japanese suicide pilots of the Pacific War -- were a nation-defining event for Japan and set the limits of Mongol expansion in the east. Historians say the first Chinese attempt to invade Japan in 1274 ended in disaster. Having initially engaged a numerically superior Japanese samurai force at the Battle of Bun'ei in First Battle of Hakata Bay, the Chinese retreated to their fleet of 300 ships and some 500 smaller craft after just one day of battle on land. A typhoon destroyed a third of the fleet that night and the remnants limped back to port in Korea which was then a vassal state of China. Seven years later, Kublai Khan amassed an impressive armada of 4,400 ships carrying 40,000 Korean, Mongol and Chinese troops in a bid to finally subjugate Japan. The Japanese, convinced of a second invasion, had spent the intervening years building strategic seawalls which made it difficult for the Chinese to land. Unable to gain a beachhead after initially taking the island of Iki and Tsushima, the fleet was decimated by a two-day typhoon that hit the Tsushima Straits. It is believed about 80% of the fleet was destroyed and the Khan's troops either drowned at sea or slaughtered on the beaches by samurai. According to a contemporary account cited in the book ""Khubilai Khan's lost fleet: In Search of a Legendary Armada,"" by maritime archaeologist James P. Delgado, the losses were so great that ""a person could walk across from one point of land to another on a mass of wreckage"".","Marine archaeologists have found a shipwreck dating from the 13th century off the coast of Japan .

"Washington (CNN) -- A hearing continues Thursday to determine the future of John Hinckley Jr., who shot President Ronald Reagan and three others in March 1981. After an expected week and half of testimony, a federal judge will consider whether Hinckley should eventually be released from a mental hospital, where he has been a patient since his 1982 trial. The trial ended in a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. On Wednesday, Hinckley's lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released. But prosecutors are fighting that, saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia. In opening statements, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they performed surveillance on Hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in Williamsburg. On several occasions in July and September, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movies or shopping but instead went to bookstores where he looked at books about Ronald Reagan and presidential assassins, Chasson said. A requirement of Hinckley's current visitation program is that plans be laid out detailing what he will do when on his own and that medical staff and the Secret Service are informed. According to Chasson, in the first instance in July, Hinckley was supposed to go to the movie ""Captain America."" Later when he saw his ""treatment team,"" Hinckley not only maintained he had gone to the movie, but he enthusiastically recommended it. Chasson also quoted from a 1987 diary entry by Hinckley in which he said ""psychiatry is a guessing game"" and doctors ""will never know the true John Hinckley."" ""The hospital doesn't know what Mr. Hinckley is thinking, and he wants it that way,"" the prosecutor said. Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous. ""This man is not dangerous and the evidence shows he is not dangerous,"" Levine said. He added that Hinckley is ""flawed"" but is ""fundamentally decent."" Levine said that in the two and a half decades that Hinckley has been at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington to undergo treatment and during his visits outside that facility, there has ""not been a single act of violence."" Since 1999, Levine said, Hinckley has been taking a drug called Risperdal. Medical websites describe Risperdal as an antipsychotic medication often used to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Dr. Tyler Jones, director of psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, testified Hinckley also started taking Zoloft in 2005 after complaining about anxiety. Jones said Hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder. But Jones said he's been in remission for both of those disorders for many years. He said Hinckley also suffers from narcissism, which has improved but is still present. Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him. According to Jones, Hinckley's treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits. Jones said the medical staff discussed this issue with Hinckley, who initially did not appear to view the issue as a big deal, but later understood it was a serious issue. Although concerned Hinckley was not truthful about his activities, Jones said, ""We didn't feel this constituted an increased risk."" The staff decided to reduce Hinckley's Christmas visit to his mother from 10 days to five days, and he will not be allowed to have any unaccompanied activities during that December stay. Jones said the staff had considered stronger action including the possibility of revoking Hinckley's privileges altogether. A September filing by prosecutors said Hinckley ""continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women."" According to the document, in June of 2009 he went on the Internet to find photos of his female dentist. ""When he was caught, Hinckley claimed, falsely, that the dentist had invited him to view her personal photographs."" Asked about the photographs of the dentist, Jones said the photographs were of the woman graduating from dental school and were ""not salacious."" He said the hospital considers Hinckley ""a low risk of violence to himself and others."" Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month. On July 29, St. Elizabeths Hospital filed a proposal to increase that. The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days. That would be followed by six visits of 24 days. According to the September government filing opposing the plan, the hospital would then ""be given the sole discretion to place Hinckley on convalescent leave in his mother's hometown."" After the judge and all the lawyers were in place, Hinckley, now 56, entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket, dark pants and a striped tie. He shook hands with all his lawyers and sat down. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman greeted Hinckley and he replied, saying, ""Good morning."" Hinckley's defense team has listed him as a possible witness at the proceedings but has not revealed if he will definitely testify. Prosecutors want to cross-examine Hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that. Mental health experts and Secret Service agents will testify, along with Hinckley's brother and sister. Hinckley's mother is now 85 years old and is not a scheduled witness. It's not clear how quickly the judge might issue a ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom. On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech. He opened fire and hit Reagan, his press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington police officer Thomas Delahanty. All survived, but Brady suffered a serious head wound that permanently affected his mobility and his speech. Hinckley, who was 25 at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress Jodie Foster. He left a letter addressed to her in his Washington hotel room saying, ""Dear Jodie. There is a definite possibility I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan.""","Defense attorneys want John Hinckley to be transitioned out of a mental hospital .

"Washington (CNN) -- What's the most emotional and divisive issue in American politics? Abortion, right? Just this weekend, former Republican front-runner Rick Perry used the abortion issue to slam current Republican front-runner Herman Cain at the Iowa Faith and Freedom forum. Perry said: . ""It is a liberal canard to say I am personally pro-life, but government should stay out of that decision. If that is your view, you are not pro-life, you are pro having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too."" Over the previous week, Herman Cain had alarmed anti-abortion voters with a series of verbal miscues, indicating both that abortion must be stopped but also that the decision should be left to the individual woman, with no role for government. At the Faith and Freedom forum, Cain over-corrected for his week of stumbles: ""No abortions. No exceptions."" That new position goes far beyond the usual pro-life policy, which allows exceptions for rape, child abuse, and to save the life of the mother. Pro-life activists must unhappily confront the probability that many of the leading candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012 - while all professedly pro-life - in reality neither care very much nor think very much about the abortion issue. But now look at the world from the politicians' point of view. They must hold together a coalition that is sliced apart by the abortion issue. Pro-choice Republicans do not hold forums. But they exist, and they have power. With the result that while you can't get nominated for president by the GOP if you are pro-choice (see Giuliani, Rudy), you also can't get nominated if you oppose abortion too much (see Huckabee, Mike). For the politicians, it's all baffling and vexing. And yet -- incredible as it sounds now -- there is reason to expect that the abortion issue may someday just vanish from national politics. After all, that's what happened to the last great moral issue to rattle the American party system: alcohol prohibition. For 70 years from the end of the Civil War to the Great Depression, a human lifetime, the ""drys"" and the ""wets"" mustered all the passion, commitment, and moralism of the pro-life and pro-choice movements of our day. ""It is my opinion that the saloonkeeper is worse than a thief and a murderer. The ordinary thief steals only your money, but the saloonkeeper steals your honor and your character. The ordinary murderer takes your life, but the saloonkeeper murders your soul."" That's from the famous ""booze sermon"" of Billy Sunday, the great popular preacher of the 1910s and 1920s. Thousands of such passionate speeches -- millions more passionate words -- were uttered by names now brown with history: William Jennings Bryan, Carrie Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It was not all talk. Ferocious legislative battles were bought to prohibit alcohol at the county, state and then ultimately national level. The great scholar of American politics, Judith Shklar, estimated to her graduate students that through the long run of American history, more elections at more levels of government have turned on alcohol than any other issue, including slavery. Politicians hated the alcohol issue for the same reason they now dislike the abortion issue: It sliced apart the existing party structure. The Republicans could not win a national majority without the support of Protestant immigrants from Germany in cities like Milwaukee and St. Louis. The Democrats could not win without the enthusiastic support of Irish Catholics in New York and New England. City-dwelling Germans and Irish intensely resented attempts of their country-dwelling neighbors to regulate their behavior for them. ""If they don't feel like takin' a glass of beer on Sunday, we must abstain,"" a contemporary Irish-American politician bitterly complained. ""If they have not got any amusements up in their backwoods, we mustn't have none."" National politicians responded to Prohibition then in the same way they respond to abortion now: by looking for ways to avoid and de-escalate a destabilizing issue. ""Questions based upon temperance, religion, morality, in all their multiplied forms, ought not to be the basis of politics,"" declared Senator John Sherman of Ohio in 1873. ""We don't want to alienate anybody!"" complained a Michigan Republican leader of the 1880s as quoted in a contemporary newspaper. As Richard Jensen observes in his classic history, ""The Winning of the Midwest"", ""Very few prominent Republican politicians were abstainers ... The politicians were not less likely to be churchgoers (many voters, after all, attended church), but they had developed their own standards of personal morality."" Then as now! And yet a century later ... the issue is dead. Vanished. Forgotten. What happened? Three things. 1. Alcohol prohibition did finally get a national trial, from 1919-1933 and was universally experienced even by former supporters as a disaster. 2. The problem addressed by prohibition has dwindled away. While it's difficult to know with any precision how much people drank in the years after the Civil War, it's almost certain that 19th Century Americans drank much more than they do today. (For that matter, Americans today drink nearly 20% less than they did as recently as 1980.) 3. And maybe most important, drinking and non-drinking are no longer so intimately associated with other ethno-cultural divisions within American life. As alcohol ceased to be a cultural symbol, the appropriate regulation of alcohol ceased to be an ideological issue. When alcohol regulation flared up again in the 1980s, during the debate over stricter punishments for drunk driving, the debate never turned into a culture war because ""alcohol"" was not code (as it had been a century before) for a dozen other identities and grievances. Can we imagine such a fate for the abortion issue? Condition number one could well happen, and would be revolutionary. But even in its absence, condition number two is beginning to obtain in the United States. In the early 1980s, there were some 29 abortions per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. Today that rate has declined to about 19 abortions per 1,000 women. The rate will never reach zero, but we may expect that it will continue to decline as contraceptives improve and attitudes to out-of-wedlock birth become more accepting, and as younger generations increasingly reject abortion as an acceptable resolution of a pregnancy. What about condition three? Alcohol became central to American politics at a time when Americans were arguing whether the country should be rural or urban, a farm economy or industrial, and whether Catholics could ever become good Americans. As those arguments lost their intensity, so did the alcohol issue. Abortion became central to modern politics at exactly the same time as Americans were arguing over sexuality generally, over the status of women and the rights of gays. I think it's a good guess that if we come to a new consensus about the status of women -- absorbing and digesting the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the feminist revolution of the 1970s into a new dispensation more comfortable with both women's equality to men and their differences from men -- disagreements over abortion will come to matter less. Such disagreements won't disappear, any more than we've seen the end of debates about whether bars should open on Sundays. But the disagreements won't matter so furiously much as they now seem to do. Too bad for Herman Cain that day still seems at least a couple of decades remote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Herman Cain's comments on abortion brought him heavy criticism .

"(CNN) -- The Arab League's decision to impose sweeping sanctions on Syria, a move followed by Turkey, reflects an unprecedented level of collective action by the historically moribund regional body. The Sunday vote by 19 Arab states to punish Syria further isolates Damascus and undermines President Bashar al-Assad's self-proclaimed role as the dominant voice of Arab nationalism. Indeed, the activist role adopted by the Arab League as the 2011 Arab uprisings unfold has been a surprising development: Following decades of issuing lowest common denominator communiques, the league is rapidly emerging as a key regional actor. The Arab League's strong condemnation last spring of Moammar Gadhafi's brutality easily could have been dismissed as a one-off, given the Libyan strongman's success at enraging most Arab leaders over the years. Yet by following up its suspension of Syria from the organization with tough sanctions, it's clear the Arab League is taking on a more muscular role in the unfolding regional drama. There are four main reasons for this new Arab League approach: . First and foremost: The Arab uprisings themselves. If nothing else, the protests of 2011 brought the power of Arab public opinion front and center. Gone are the days when Arab leaders could act with total disregard for their people's opinions. Public opinion throughout the Arab world resoundingly disapproved of Gadhafi's behavior, and now of Assad's. This sentiment is motivating Arab leaders to respond to their people's anger, through the Arab League. The corollary to this is Arab leaders' fear that if they stand idly by while Assad slaughters Syrians, popular resentment could boomerang against them. Whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward Israel and the West, collective Arab opprobrium is now targeted at brutal Arab regimes. If they fail to act, many Arab leaders could suffer political heartache and more popular unrest at home. Getting ahead of this demonstrates that they respond to public opinion, and it helps deflect popular discontent away from domestic issues. On the geo-strategic level, Arab League activism is motivated by a desire to keep the Arabs in the drivers' seat. With the United States largely over the horizon, Arab docility only creates windows of opportunity for non-Arabs to muck about in Middle East diplomacy. Turkey has not succeeded in creating a leading diplomatic role for itself in the region, despite efforts to play an active role in Libya, Yemen and other hot spots. The Arabs want to ensure that this remains the case. Hence, Ankara was relegated to supporting the measures adopted by the Arab League, not initiating them. The other geo-strategic explanation for Arab League activism is Iran. The Arabs, particularly the Gulf states, have long decried Iran's encroachment in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Isolating Iran's key strategic ally in the region -- Assad's Syria -- provides a significant opportunity to roll back some of Tehran's regional gains. Already, Hamas' Damascus-based leadership is looking for a new home and behaving with greater restraint. And when Iran was seen to be meddling in Bahrain's sectarian struggle earlier this year, the Gulf states brutally crushed it -- collectively. With the United States withdrawing from an Iraq they see as now heavily influenced by Iran, the other Arab states have even greater incentive to band together. In taking strong actions, the Arab League claims to want to stave off foreign intervention in Syria. Qatar's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim hinted at this when he said that he ""hoped"" the Arab League's sanctions would obviate the need for foreign intervention. In the short term, a more active Arab role may indeed make non-Arab nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in Libya, the Arab League might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention. This Arab League activism may signal a new regional norm analogous to the United Nations' ""responsibility to protect."" The Arab League has effectively joined the international rejection of the three-century old Westphalian system that enshrined the nonintervention of one state in the domestic affairs of another state. Arab leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow Arab rulers. This is a welcome development, one that could head off other foreign interventions in the Middle East and encourage further collective action against brutal acts some Arab leaders perpetrate against their own people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Danin.","Robert Danin: Arab League's tough sanctions on Syria show new activism in region .

"(CNN) -- The Mexican navy smelled something fishy and their intuition paid off. They found nearly a ton of cocaine hidden inside a shipment of frozen sharks. The cargo, which was aboard the freight ship Dover Strait, had been loaded in Costa Rica, Mexican navy says. Navy inspectors at the southeastern port of Progreso, in Yucatan state, on Tuesday detected an anomaly in two shipping containers during a routine X-ray, according to a navy news release. The inspectors zeroed in on a shipment of sharks. Upon slitting one of the frozen fish open, they found black bags containing rectangular packets filled with cocaine. In all, authorities recovered 870 packages of cocaine, weighing 894 kilograms (about 1,967 pounds), the navy reported Wednesday. In recent years, Mexico and the United States have stepped up drug enforcement efforts, pushing more of the drug trade to sea routes and forcing drug smugglers to find more creative ways to hide their contraband.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI met Friday with a group of people who had been sexually abused by clergy in his native Germany, where disenchantment with the Roman Catholic Church has grown in the wake of the scandal. The meeting, which occurred at a seminary in Erfurt, came on the second day of the pontiff's four-day visit to his homeland. Besides talking with victims of sexual abuse committed by priests and church personnel, he also met with people ""who care for those injured by these crimes,"" according to a statement from the Vatican press office. ""Moved and deeply shaken by the sufferings of the victims, the Holy Father expressed his deep compassion and regret over all that was done to them and their families,"" the statement added. ""He assured the people present that those in positions of responsibility in the church are seriously concerned to deal with all crimes of abuse and are committed to effective measures for the protection of children."" The pope has had similar meetings elsewhere, in the face of outcries from many nations in Europe, North America and beyond criticizing the church for its handling of sexual abuse cases. Friday's visit was unique in that it took place in the homeland of Benedict, where he'd also served as a cardinal. He himself got caught up in the scandal in at least one case, when he -- as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- approved the transfer of a man within Germany in the wake of accusations that the man had abused children. But the archdiocese has said the then-cardinal was never personally aware of the details of the man's case. In March 2010, the priest -- then identified only as H -- was suspended, the archdiocese of Munich and Freising announced. Five years earlier, enthusiasm was high in Germany's Catholic community when Benedict was named pope. But the sex abuse scandal, and a perception that a conservative church is unlikely to change its ways, has affected the church in the European nation. According to Der Spiegel magazine, more than 181,000 Catholics have left the church since the scandal broke. And candidates for the priesthood have plummeted 62% since 1990, according to the German Bishops Conference. While he has visited Germany three times since 2005, this marks Benedict's first state visit as pope. On Thursday, he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulf. He also gave a speech before the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, in which he spoke of the ""inviolable dignity of every single human person."" Benedict began his day Friday with a mass in Berlin and he met with 15 representatives of Germany's Muslim community. In a subsequent speech, he said, ""the convictions (Catholics and Muslims) are becoming visible"" while adding that ""constant effort is needed in order to foster better mutual acquaintance and understanding."" ""There can be a fruitful collaboration between Christians and Muslims,"" Benedict said in the speech, a transcript of which was provided by the Vatican. ""We can offer an important witness in many key areas of life in society (such as) the protection of the family based on marriage, respect for life in every phase of its natural course or the promotion of greater social justice."" CNN's Rick Noack contributed to this report.","Pope Benedict XVI meets with victims of clergy abuse in his native Germany .

Fine's house used to be like a home to him, and the coach was a father figure, a ""great guy,"" he said. Syracuse fired Fine on Sunday, less than a month after the university placed him on administrative leave after Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, came forward to publicly accuse him of molesting them over several years. See a timeline of the Syracuse sexual abuse scandal . A third man, Zachary Tomaselli, now 23, has also said he was abused by Fine -- while in a hotel room in Pittsburgh, where he'd gone to watch a Syracuse game. Police in Syracuse and Pittsburgh are investigating the allegations and looking for other potential victims, authorities have said. Police say they'll change reporting procedures . When the allegations first surfaced, Fine -- married with a son and two daughters -- called them ""patently false."" He has not commented since. The investigation at Syracuse comes in the wake of a sex abuse scandal at Penn State University that received nationwide attention. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky is accused of sexually abusing boys over a span of 14 years. When asked what his reaction was when he saw the Penn State story break, Lang said his ""stomach just turned."" ""All I can think of is what me and my little brother went through, and it's happening all over again,"" he said. Regarding Jim Boeheim, head men's basketball coach at Syracuse, Lang said, ""I honestly believe he didn't know anything about this."" While some have called for Boeheim to be fired, he said, ""I just don't want that to happen. He's a Syracuse man in and out and ... I don't believe that he had any knowledge this was going on."" Lang, now 45, said he used to tell Fine to stop touching him, but that ""you couldn't tell him no."" ""It was hard to say anything, because you think you're with a god -- just hard to come out and say anything to anybody about it,"" Lang said. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is battling a large grass fire in the marshlands of Jefferson County, Texas, an agency official told CNN on Tuesday. The fire began Monday afternoon about 12 miles west of Sabine Pass and about 200 yards from the Intracoastal Waterway, Jim Stockie, spokesman for the fish and wildlife service said. He estimated the area burned by Tuesday afternoon to be between 10,000 and 12,000 acres, but he said the fire was not threatening any structures. Smoke from the blaze was drifting into the Houston/Galveston area more than 100 miles from the fire. Just a dozen firefighters were working the blaze, Stockie said. ""We don't like to put firefighters out in a sea of grass. We retreat to levies and burn off the fuel,"" Stockie said. Texas has suffered its worst fire season in state history with more than 3.5 million acres burned, according to state officials. In October, the Bastrop Complex Fire torched more than 1,500 homes and 34,000 acres of land north of Austin before officials were able to contain it, the Texas Fire Service said. An unusual La Nina weather pattern led to a nearly 11-month fire season in the state, fire service spokeswoman April Saginor said. A survey released last month by the Texas Forest Service estimated between 100 million and 500 million trees, or 2% to 10% of the state's 4.9 billion trees, were killed by the severe drought and consequent fires. The dry spell that began in 2010 was the worst the state has seen since 1895, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has said. The drought conditions also caused concern for the state's water supply, especially in smaller towns. CNN's Dave Alsup and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","The fire began Monday afternoon .

"Editor's note: Brian Levin is a professor of criminal justice at California State University, San Bernardino and director of the university's Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism. Michael Stoops is executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington. Brian Levin says the homeless are excluded from lessons on tolerance and aren't protected by hate crime laws. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Over the last two calendar years, more Americans in the United States were killed in a little-noticed spate of unprovoked attacks than were killed by terrorists, in large commercial jet crashes or in racial hate crimes. Since 1999, more than 240 vulnerable homeless Americans have been stabbed, beaten, drowned, shot or burned to death in a revolting display of one of the last socially tolerated prejudices, this one based on class. Despite being prime targets of prejudice and violence, particularly in today's youth subculture, the homeless are routinely excluded from lessons related to tolerance, as well as from official data collection and hate-crime penalty enhancement laws. A newly released report from the National Coalition for the Homeless documented 27 unprovoked, apparently bias-related homicides by attackers in the United States last year, down one from the previous year and the second-highest number of killings since 2001. After bottoming mid-decade, the number killed has not dipped below 20 a year since 2005. In contrast, the FBI documented only 12 hate-crime homicides nationally for the two most recently available calendar years combined. According to the NCH and the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, nearly 2 1/2 times more homeless people in America have been killed over the past 10 years in apparent unprovoked bias homicides than the total for all the other hate- crime homicides -- on the basis of race, religion, national origin, disability and sexual orientation -- combined. Like other hate crime perpetrators, these attackers are typically young male ""thrill offenders"" seeking excitement, with 58 percent of assailants over the past 10 years falling in the 13-19 age range. In 2006, three teenagers out for fun attacked homeless people in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with baseball bats, killing one of their victims, 45-year-old Norris Gaynor. One pleaded guilty and the two others were convicted of murder last September after the jury saw graphic surveillance tape of one of their nonlethal beatings from earlier in the evening. These attacks exclude the large number of other types of crimes involving the homeless, such as personal disputes, homeless-on-homeless violence, robbery, drugs or murder for life insurance proceeds. The August issue of Maxim, a youth-oriented magazine targeted at college-aged males, joked about last weekend's National Hobo Convention in Britt, Iowa, in a blurb titled ""Hunt the Homeless."" The journal quipped ""Kill one for fun. We're 87 percent sure it's legal."" In previous violent attacks, some assailants have referenced degrading and violent depictions in popular culture such as ""Bumfights"" either during their crimes or in subsequent interviews with authorities, with some even filming the events. ""Bumfights"" is a popular violent video series that sold hundreds of thousands of tapes and DVDs before going viral on the Internet. The film series sets a new low in American popular culture, featuring fights between homeless men plied by the producers with alcohol, as well as sadistic parodies of the late Australian conservationist ""crocodile hunter"" Steve Irwin. These ""skits"" feature terrified sleeping homeless people who are startled awake and forcibly restrained with duct tape by ""hunters"" narrating their attacks with feigned Australian accents. Samuel Bowhay of Grinnell College found almost 86,000 videos on YouTube last month with ""bum"" in the title, thousands more than videos with other derogatory prejudiced epithets. While homeless advocates lack the political and financial infrastructure often needed to institute policy reform, the frequency and brutality of the bias attacks have renewed focus on the nature of this violent form of prejudice and ways to address it. Last week, District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed legislation adding homeless status to the district's hate-crime law. Maryland, an early adopter of such measures in the 1980s, will join Maine in adding homeless status to its hate-crime law on October 1. Other jurisdictions such as Alaska; Puerto Rico; Los Angeles County, California; and Seattle, Washington, also have taken various steps to recognize homeless status in their laws, data collection, educational efforts or procedures. In almost a dozen other states, including California, Texas, South Carolina and Florida, legislation has been introduced over the past three years to add homeless status to their hate-crime laws as well. Nationally, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas has introduced legislation to add homelessness to federal hate-crime laws and data-collection efforts. These efforts are long overdue. A primary purpose of hate-crime laws is the targeted deterrent message to would-be offenders that they face real punishment and social disapproval. Moreover, the key criminological criteria for coverage in hate-crime law apply seamlessly to homeless status as well: . 1. a significant additional risk of violent victimization; . 2. discriminatory selection; . 3. established prejudice against a socially identifiable class; . 4. identical offenders such as bigoted skinheads or young male thrill offenders who share identifiable characteristics and motivations. Arguments against including provisions in hate-crime laws for the homeless are recycled ones that were initially used unsuccessfully against other groups, like gays and lesbians. Too many additional groups dilute the laws, or homelessness is a changeable condition that most people wouldn't want, they argue. The fact is, millions of Americans have changed their religious affiliation and yet, just about all hate crime laws cover faith. Disability is a characteristic that, like homelessness, most people would not seek out, yet it too is covered. Adding the homeless to hate-crime laws, tolerance education and data-collection efforts must not be obstructed. When hate makes a fist, the laws of a civilized society must decisively block the blow in the most forceful and unambiguous way possible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Levin and Michael Stoops.

"Moscow (CNN) -- President Dmitry Medvedev has signed an order dismissing longtime Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, the Kremlin reported Monday on its website. The state-run RIA-Novosti news agency said Kudrin had resigned amid a dispute with Medvedev. The announcement came shortly after Medvedev had given Kudrin until the end of the day to decide whether to quit. ""You need to make a decision quickly and tell me about it today,"" Medvedev told Kudrin during a session of the modernization commission in Dimitrovgrad. Medvedev urged that Kudrin to ""make up his mind about his political future,"" according to the non-governmental, Moscow-based Interfax news agency. The president was reacting to a comment Kudrin is reported to have made in Washington. Citing differences with Medvedev, particularly related to defense spending, Kudrin said that he would not remain in a government led by Medvedev, Interfax said. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Saturday he plans to return next year to the presidency and to name Medvedev as prime minister. Kudrin, 50, had served as finance minister since 2000, during which time the government had paid off most of its foreign debt and created oil wealth funds that helped the nation weather the global economic problems of recent years, RIA-Novosti said. -- Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this story .","Russian Finance Minister Kudrin steps down over differences with Medvedev .

"Washington (CNN) -- At the stroke of midnight Friday, the good music and bad jokes of Freedom Radio Iraq fell silent. Army broadcasters who pumped out tunes, wisecracks and information to their fellow American military personnel in Iraq formally turned off their microphones after eight years. ""This is the radio station for our troops, and you know we are sad to see it go,"" said Army Staff Sgt. Randall ""Jay"" Townsend, one of the station's disc jockeys, before the final broadcast. ""But at the same time, this piece is part of the big transformation that is going to happen over here -- so some sadness and some excitement as well."" So exciting that Townsend, from Arkansas, was up even earlier than usual -- 3:30 a.m. -- ready for a long day with his listeners. ""This station has been in Iraq for the troops the entire time, and this is their outlet to back home,"" he said. The closing of the station is just the latest visible evidence of the deliberate, phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, all pointing toward an end-of the-year deadline. With the withdrawal clock ticking, the U.S. continues to talk with Iraqis about leaving some American forces behind for training and security. But Armed Forces Radio is over and out. ""The security agreement reached back in 2008 calls for all U.S. forces to be out of Iraq by December 31, and we are operating consistent with that guidance,"" said one of the officers in charge, Lt. Col. Freddie Mack. ""So tonight will be our last night as Freedom Radio here in AFN Iraq."" The unit's motto is ""serving those who serve,"" Mack said. ""We all can't wait till the 31st of December to board planes, so some of that transition has to start now. The soldiers of AFN Iraq have certainly done their part in bringing to a close this chapter."" The station went on the air in December 2003, and the first song was Paul McCartney's ""Freedom."" The transmitters will stay in place for now, but music and news will come from Europe. Townsend said he thought long and hard about exactly how to sign off. ""I'm just going to say my thanks,"" he said Friday by video link provided by the Defense Department. ""I'm not going to make it too complicated."" In recent weeks, the station's DJs asked their listeners for how to end the final broadcast. A Facebook poll narrowed it down to five songs: . Toby Keith: ""Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue"" Green Day: ""When September Ends"" Saving Abel: ""Miss America"" Daughtry: ""Home"" P. Diddy: ""Coming Home"" The final selection was revealed at midnight: Keith's ""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue."" Townsend and his fellow radio jocks know they are part of a long line of other broadcasters in uniform. They have a special place of honor for ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, who came on Friday's show for an interview. ""Absolutely! There is not a military broadcaster who doesn't know who Adrian Cronauer is and the things he was able to accomplish and the lasting impact he had on military journalists and AFN radio stations around the world,"" Townsend said. Cronauer's signature sign-in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" became part of that era, and the movie inspired generations of broadcasters like Townsend to sign up. ""I feel like we are part of an evolved set of broadcasters throughout the years,"" Townsend said. ""We really do think we are part of that military journalism corps, I would say, passed down from those folks in Vietnam all the way back to World War II. So we know we are just part of that legacy just as much as anyone else."" Part of that legacy, reinforced by Cronauer and others, is to go right to the brink. ""My morning show, we push the limits as far as we possibly can to make the troops laugh, and if we don't get a complaint from somebody, you know, with some real rank on them every now and then, we don't feel we are pushing the envelope far enough to give the troops a real sense of a real radio station they would be listening to back in the states,"" Townsend said. Both he and the brass were counting down to the goodbye Friday. Said Townsend, ""To be here at the end of that chapter -- too surreal.""","Freedom Radio Iraq broadcasters turn off their microphones Friday night .

"(CNN) -- Age has slowed Sonic, the beloved blue hero from an earlier generation of video games, but Sega may have finally rehabilitated the venerable hedgehog. ""Sonic Generations,"" which arrives in stores Tuesday for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, comes at an opportune time. With a crucial holiday season imminent, Sega Sammy Holdings hasn't produced a stellar Sonic game in about a decade, and the company's game division has performed especially sluggishly this year. But ""Sonic Generations,"" coming on the 20th anniversary of the franchise, looks like a promising candidate to buck these trends. The first batch of reviews have been positive, and the game has received more preorders than any previous Sonic game, which is an early barometer for success. Sega also managed to build some buzz for the game at video game expos like E3, although those conventions have not been particularly kind to other Sonic games. Encouraged by the favorable feedback, Sega is throwing its marketing weight behind the game. These initiatives include traditional advertising, constructing a Sonic-themed playground in East Oakland, California, and a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The original ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" debuted on Sega's Genesis game system in 1991. Since the heydays of Sega going head-to-head with Nintendo for home console domination, the company has ceased selling hardware, started developingÂ for multiple systems and merged with Sammy, which makes pachinko slot machines in Japan. Perhaps as a result, Sega's flagship franchise, which is developed by the aptly named Sonic Team, has slumped. Sonic's and Mario's ""platformer"" genre -- in which cartoonish characters navigate increasingly challenging maze-like levels -- was once a blockbuster seller, but it's been surpassed by first-person shooters such as ""Call of Duty"" and ""Battlefield."" Nintendo has managed to maintain the high quality of Mario games over the years, but Sega has struggled to remake Sonic for the fast-paced 21st-century game industry. ""Sonic Generations"" is designed to ""take Sonic back to the pure elements,"" Yasuhiro Noguchi, a senior producer who led development on the Western version of the game, said in an interview. Some previous games in the series became preoccupied with elaborate story lines and slower-paced exploration. American and European players may have been put off by elements of the plots that were geared toward audiences in Japan, where Sonic Team is based. ""The team tries very hard not to bias it for a particular territory,"" Noguchi said. ""They don't necessarily do stuff that is very, very specific to, say, their home territory. That's one of the learnings that has kind of informed their development DNA in the last 20 years -- that Sonic is loved internationally."" For ""Sonic Generations"" and its predecessor, ""Sonic Colors"" for the Wii, Sega recruited writers from the television show ""Happy Tree Friends."" They pen straightforward scripts that they hope will resonate with players outside of Asia, where Sonic's market is bigger. However, the writers must also adhere to standards set by Sega's Japan-based Sonic Committee, which is tasked with upholding the integrity of the Sonic brand. ""Sonic is a beloved franchise,"" Noguchi said. ""Disney has Mickey, and we have Sonic."" ""Sonic Generations"" is looking to polish the franchise's legacy and reverse the recent decline of Sonic's popularity, said Patrick Riley, a U.S.-based development director for the company. ""I think that fans recognize that as far as the quality, Sonic is moving in the right direction."" The game melds the classic two-dimensional action with three-dimensional exploration. ""We're truly bringing the 'A game' on 'Sonic Generations,' "" Noguchi said. ""In some ways, it is sort of a celebration and a sendoff for the first generation of Sonic."" ""Sonic Generations"" will dip into past successes in its attempt to rebuild the franchise. Levels from classic Sonic games, such as the memorable Green Hill Zone, have been remade in 3-D. A dash of nostalgia may be just what Sega needs to reinvigorate its aging hedgehog.","Sega is looking to revive its flagship franchise with ""Sonic Generations""

"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Nayef bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's interior minister, has been named the new crown prince of the key oil-producing nation, ascending at a time of regional turmoil amid the populist Arab Spring movement and simmering international issues involving Iran and other neighbors. The news, following a royal decree signed by King Abdullah, was announced early Friday on state-run Saudi Television. The official Saudi Press Agency reported that the decree was issued the previous evening. Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, the king's half-brother, died in a New York hospital on Saturday after being ill for some time. His funeral was held three days later in Riyadh. As was the case with his predecessor, the move makes Nayef bin Abdulaziz the heir to the Saudi throne. He will assume his new post at a tension-filled time in the Arab world. The longtime leaders of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have fallen in recent months during the so-called Arab Spring, while those in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere are holding on to power despite continuing popular unrest. Violence remains a problem in neighboring Iraq, as well as Afghanistan. Iran, a longtime rival of the Saudi royal family's, is still at odds with much of the international community over its nuclear program, among other issues. Before the announcement, Nayef had been considered a likely successor to his brother as crown prince. He was named in 2009 as second deputy prime minister, a post held by the second in line to the throne. Nayef has served as the Saudi interior minister since 1975, having overseen the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries that has truly dismantled a domestic al Qaeda network, said Christopher Boucek, a Saudi expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Nayef is widely seen as a hard-line conservative who, at best, is lukewarm to King Abdullah's reform initiatives,"" read a classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks. In addition to his new title, Nayef will remain interior minister, according to Friday's announcement. The Saudi Press Agency noted that he also has been appointed deputy premier, meaning he will officially hold three positions in the Saudi government. He and others met Thursday with a U.S. delegation that included Vice President Joe Biden, CIA Director David Petraeus and Sen. John McCain. Ascension to the Saudi throne is kept within the royal family, though it does not pass from father to son. Instead, it's a complex process, and decisions in the conservative kingdom are often cloaked in secrecy. Nayef's appointment follows the first-ever convening of the Allegiance Council, which the king established in 2006 to discuss and allow for more transparency on succession issues. The king made his decision after receiving their input. Afterward, Abdullah instructed Nayef's fellow princes to pledge allegiance to him as the new crown prince. CNN's Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","NEW: Other princes were told, by the king, to pledge allegiance to Nayef, state media says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- For the first time in U.S. history, the largest single group of poor children in any racial or ethnic category is Hispanic, according to a new survey. Calling it ""a negative milestone"" in Hispanics' explosive growth in the United States, the Pew Hispanic Center study said in 2010, 37.3% of poor children in the U.S. were Hispanic, compared with 30.5% white and 26.6% black. The Pew analysis of new census data put the number of Hispanic children in poverty at 6.1 million in 2010. This negative trend has emerged as the 2010 census confirmed for the first time that Hispanics are the nation's No. 2 group, surpassing African-Americans. Hispanics now make up 16.3% of the total American population -- but in the youth demographic, Hispanic kids comprise an even bigger share -- 23.1% of U.S. children are Latino, the study said. See how Hispanics drove the growth of the white population . The study found there are 6.1 million Latino children living in poverty, and more than two-thirds of them -- 4.1 million -- are children of immigrant parents. Of those 4.1 million, 86% were born in America, the study said. The remaining 2 million poor Latino children have U.S.-born parents, the study said. Prior to the recession, more white children lived in poverty than Latino kids, but since the recession began in 2007, those positions reversed, and the number of poor Hispanic children grew by 36.3% between 2007 and 2010, or 1.6 million, the study said. The number of white and black children in poverty also grew, but not as big, the study found. See how the white population changed in relation to minorities . The recession hit Latino families hard: the unemployment rate among Hispanic workers is 11.1%, compared with a national rate of 9.1%, and the household wealth for Latinos fell more sharply than for white or black families between 2005 and 2009, the study said. Food insecurity also grew among Latinos, with one-third of households facing the problem in 2008, up from 23.8% the prior year, the study said. Leaders of programs serving the poor said Thursday their experiences match the study's findings, which was released Wednesday. In his twice-a-month acts of charity, Reverend Carlos Paiva has noticed the increasing number of Latino youngsters who arrive with their families at his Angelica Lutheran Church near downtown Los Angeles. The church gives free rice, beans, potatoes, onions and fruits to needy families, he said. ""The numbers are growing,"" Paiva said about Latino kids who show up at the church with their families. ""The average age of the people who come here for food is 10 years old."" Michael Flood, CEO of the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, said his group's recent summer lunch program for poor children saw ""a lot more kids from the Latino community."" ""It worries us,"" Flood said. ""Given the fact that the economy hasn't turned around, it's a more desperate deal."" Victor Martinez, director of programming at Bienestar, a nonprofit that runs nine health community centers in southern California for Latinos, said he was ""sad and disappointed to see that my community is facing these problems."" ""Especially for the more recent immigrants, they have more limited resources to work. We have more requests to go to the food bank and housing,"" Martinez said.","NEW: More than 6 million Latino kids were living in poverty in 2010, according to study .

"London (CNN) -- A complete set of 100 etchings by Pablo Picasso -- never before seen in public -- is to go on display at the British Museum after an ""extraordinary"" $1.5 million gift. Businessman Hamish Parker -- a long-term fan of the London museum -- donated the entire Vollard Suite in memory of his father, Major Horace Parker, who died last year. The Vollard Suite -- one of the 20th century's most highly prized collections of etchings -- was created by Picasso between 1930 and 1937. It features pictures of the artist's young lover, Marie-Therese Walter, depictions of the Minotaur, the half-man-half-beast from classical myth who would become a regular feature in Picasso's works, and also a number of portraits of art collector Ambroise Vollard, for whom the collection is named. A spokeswoman for the museum said Parker -- a friend of the prints and drawings room -- had learned of the museum's hopes of acquiring the suite of etchings at an event there last year. ""We already owned a few individual plates from the collection, five or so out of the 100, and one of those was on display,"" she told CNN. ""Stephen Coppel, the prints and drawings curator, had placed a note beside it explaining that it was a long-term ambition of the British Museum to own the complete set. ""But it was pie-in-the-sky stuff really -- we hoped to be able to add to the collection piece by piece over time. Never in our wildest dreams did we imagine it would happen so quickly."" After his father died, Parker surprised museum bosses by telling them he planned to offer them the money to buy the full set, in memory of the Major. ""It was very unexpected, and incredibly generous,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We are delighted."" The Vollard Suite will go on display at the British Museum in London from May 3 to September 2, 2012, the first time a complete set of the etchings has been shown in the UK for half a century. The collection will be shown alongside examples of the classical sculpture, Rembrandt etchings and Goya prints which inspired Picasso in creating it.. The suite was commissioned by Parisian collector Ambroise Vollard, who planned to print and sell editions of it; however he died in a car accident in 1939 before the task was completed. After his death most of the prints were sold to fellow art dealer Henri Petiet. The British Museum's set, which has never been shown in public before and is in pristine condition, was bought from the Petiet family.","British Museum celebrates 'unexpected and incredibly generous' gift .

"(CNN) -- It is the role that every fan of the beautiful game counts on but which few people envy. The much-maligned position of the football referee is a job that attracts criticism, controversy and castigation on an almost weekly basis with little glory in return. Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho is the latest to add his voice to the deafening boom of dissent so often aimed at various men in black around the world. Despite a 5-1 victory for his side against Murcia in Spain's Cop del Rey, the Portuguese boss let rip at the referee Paradas Romero's record of showing more then six yellow cards per match. Romero added to this with a red card for Mourinho himself, after the 47-year-old told the official to ""Go f*** himself"" during the game, according to the ref. The incident follows similar controversy in Britain where Manchester United's game against English title rivals Tottenham last month ended in farce when Mark Clattenburg allowed Portugal winger Nani to score despite his clear handball in the build-up. Should referees be relegated too? Clattenburg's clanger came hot on the heals of referee Dougie McDonald's blooper in Scotland where he awarded a penalty to Celtic against rivals Dundee United, before overturning his own decision before the kick was taken. In honor of all of the above, Fanzone takes a look at the best moments of on-pitch gaffes from soccer's finest: . Brazilian ball boy scores equalizing goal . Silvia Regina de Oliveira was the first woman to ever referee a match in the Brazilian National Championship, and went on to handle games at the 2004 Olympics. But her career went into decline two years later when she inexplicably awarded Santacruzense a late equalizer against Atletico Sorocaba in a Paulista Football Federation Cup clash. One of the home team's players had fired a shot into the outside of the net, and the waiting ball boy took the chance to cheekily evade the visiting goalkeeper and tap a shot over the goal-line. De Oliveira did not see the incident, but noticed the ball was in the net, so consulted with her linesman and awarded a goal -- sparking scenes of mayhem as the Atletico players protested. Despite the video evidence, the result of the match was allowed to stand. ""I should have trusted my own vision,"" De Oliveira later admitted. Three yellow cards equals one red . Top English referee Graham Poll sabotaged his hopes of controlling a World Cup final in 2006 when he made a massive blunder in Australia's 2-2 draw with Croatia in a group-stage game in Germany. Poll booked Josip Simunic after an hour and then in the final minute of regulation time -- but forgot to send the Croatian from the pitch. He had the chance to compound his error in time added on when he handed Simunic a third yellow card. It was third time unlucky for Poll, who had correctly dismissed Croatia's Dario Simic and Australia's Brett Emerton after giving the duo their second respective bookings just minutes earlier. Poll, who later admitted putting Simunic's first yellow card against Australia defender Craig Moore's name in his notebook, was widely mocked as the video spread around the Internet, and the 42-year-old's house was blockaded by media. ""It opened my eyes as to who my real friends are and how much my family meant to me,"" he said. Fabiano one-ups Maradona with double handball . French referee Stephane Lannoy was left with egg on his face after allowing Luis Fabiano to clearly handle the ball twice before scoring his second goal in the 3-1 win over the Ivory Coast at the 2010 World Cup. Lannoy was pictured laughing with the Brazil striker when he questioned him about how he had controlled the ball. ""I wasn't sure if it was the elbow, the upper arm or the chest. So I decided to have a talk with him, he said it was chest. Thereafter, I could do nothing but allow the goal. It was after the match I realized that Fabiano had been dishonest,"" Lannoy told L'Equipe newspaper. Lannoy had a nightmare match, later sending off Kaka for a second yellow card after Ivory Coast's Kader Keita went down in a heap following an innocuous collision with the Brazil playmaker. Lannoy was duped again in a European Champions League match this month, when he waved play on and failed to book Barcelona's Jose Pinto after the goalkeeper whistled to distract an opposing player. Pinto was subsequently handed a two-match ban for improper conduct for deceiving Copenhagen forward Cesar Santin, who thought Lannoy had blown for offside when he broke clear of the defense. The case of the 'ghost penalty' Emerson Acuna was little known outside his native Colombia until December 2008, when the striker pulled off one of the most outrageous referee cons in the history of sport. The Atletico Junior player, nicknamed ""The Parasite,"" flung himself to the ground despite not being within meters of any opposing America da Cali players. The match official surprised everyone possessing a modicum of visual capacity when he awarded a spotkick despite having a clear view of Acuna's swan-dive, and the home team converted the penalty and went on to win 2-0. However, Acuna did not escape completely unpunished as he was sent off for another incident later in the match. A quick half . German referee Wolf-Dieter Ahlenfelder secured his place in tales of notoriety with some decidedly erratic behavior in a 1975 Bundesliga match between Werder Bremen and Hannover 96. He mistakenly blew for halftime only 29 minutes into what should be a three-quarter-hour period before a linesman pointed out his error, reported German journalist Eberhard Spohd. Having finally completed the half, Ahlenfelder stuck his tongue out at a photographer, leading Bremen's president Bohmert to quip: ""For this show we could have charged a higher entrance fee."" Spohd said that Ahlenfelder initially denied drinking alcohol, but later admitted to consuming schnapps. ""We are men -- we don't drink Fanta,"" the official reportedly said. A thorny problem . Scottish referee Les Mottram managed to be picked for the 1994 World Cup panel despite an embarrassing mistake in a domestic match the year before. Mottram failed to award a goal when a shot by Dundee United's Patrick Connolly rebounded out of the net off a supporting stanchion and into the arms of a Partick Thistle player, who handed the ball to his goalkeeper. Mottram somehow missed all that had transpired, not even noticing the illegal handball, and waved play on. After the World Cup in the U.S., where he ordered an amazing 13 minutes of injury-time in Bolivia's 0-0 draw with South Korea, he left the unpaid ranks and took up a professional contract refereeing in Japan's J-League. Dundee won their match against Partick 4-0, but English second division side Watford were denied a victory in 2008 when opponents Reading were awarded a goal for a shot which did not go between the posts. Linesman Nigel Bannister convinced 25-year-old referee Stuart Attwell that the ball had in fact crossed the line, prompting a now retired Poll to comment in his column with British newspaper the Daily Mail: ""This is the most bizarre situation I've ever seen in 40 years watching football and 27 years refereeing."" The goal that never was . Perhaps it is fitting that the last word should go to Clattenburg, who is unlikely to be on Tottenham's Christmas card list. He has the reputation of being one of England's best referees, despite the Nani incident and this major error in another match at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground. Clattenburg became the youngest Englishman to reach FIFA's international list at the age of 30 in 2006, but the year before he was vilified by Tottenham fans after failing to spot that Pedro Mendes' speculative long-range effort had bounced off United goalkeeper Carroll's chest and over the goal-line. The hapless Northern Irishman scrambled back into his own net and shoveled the ball back into the field of play, and the match ended in a goalless draw. Clattenburg was suspended from refereeing for eight months from August 2008 following an investigation into his business activities, having been charged with a breach of contract by his ruling body, Professional Game Match Officials Limited.","Incident in Manchester United-Tottenham game puts spotlight on refereeing decisions .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- In an effort to hold onto the few remaining places they still control in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi's forces put up stiff resistance again Saturday as revolutionaries fought to wrest control of the loyalist strongholds of Sirte and Bani Walid. Fierce fighting erupted in the coastal city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gadhafi and home to his tribe. At least eight anti-Gadhafi fighters were killed and 31 others were wounded, said Ali Gheliwan, a spokesman for the Misrata Military Council. NATO planes, meanwhile, bombed targets in the Sirte area Friday. Gadhafi's forces unleashed hails of gunfire, using snipers in tall buildings to target their enemies. Expected support from Sirte residents for the anti-Gadhafi forces did not materialize, as loyalists fought house to house with unexpected intensity. The revolutionaries were forced to retreat after the chaotic urban warfare. Despite such challenges, Col. Ahmed Bani of the National Transitional Council predicted it will not take long for all of Libya to be under the anti-Gadhafi forces' control. He claimed, for instance, that Sirte's airport and the nearby Ghardabiya air base already have switched hands. ""I can say that things will change drastically in the upcoming days in Sirte and Bani Walid,"" the group's spokesman said in his first press conference Saturday from Tripoli. Bani claimed that part of Bani Walid, another loyalist hub located in a mountainous area southeast of Tripoli, is also under anti-Gadhafi forces' control despite stiff opposition. City residents had been fleeing ahead of the offensive, which followed a 48-hour warning. ""We were attacked by rocket-propelled grenades and snipers from the mountains,"" he said. ""We repositioned, and we can say that the north is under control of our revolutionaries."" However, Salah Beniran, a field commander for anti-Gadhafi forces in Bani Walid, said Gadhafi loyalists have taken some residents hostage, ""and they are heavily armed with missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun-mounted trucks."" ""They encircled us from the eastern front,"" Beniran said. The clashes contrasted with the scene in several Sahara Desert towns more sympathetic to the revolution, where people cheered the anti-Gadhafi forces as they made their way toward the southern city of Sabha. In Shati, there was no combat; only a peaceful transfer of power, perhaps the first in the eight-month uprising. In the morning the tiny town had been under Gadhafi's grip. By afternoon, no more. Residents fired their guns in celebration and burned the green flags of the former regime. They welcomed the ordinary Libyans -- teachers, doctors, engineers -- who dropped everything to join the fight against Gadhafi. They were rebels once. Now they were the armed wing of Libya's new governing body, the National Transitional Council. But the situation was different in Sabha, a diehard pro-Gadhafi city in southwestern Libya. Anti-Gadhafi forces took control of the Al-Birak air base in the city Saturday, but the battle was far from over, Bani said. ""There has been fierce fighting for a while now,"" the spokesman said. ""The people in Sabha are from different tribes. There are a big number of loyalists who escaped from other cities, and they are still fighting."" Bani issued what he called a ""final call"" for all Gadhafi loyalists to switch sides and join his group, warning that -- if they do not -- they risk being charged with treason."" He added he hopes Gadhafi is in one of the three cities -- Sirte, Bani Walid and Sabha -- still in the throes of heavy fighting Saturday and not yet held by his forces, so that he can be taken into custody. ""We hope he is ... so we can arrest him and give the world a break from his evils,"" the colonel said. ""(Up) until now, there is no certain information about his location."" As these battles continued to rage in Libya, the international community came together to pledge support for the war-torn nation's new leaders in Tripoli. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday to establish a support mission in Libya for an initial period of three months and to take other measures to help the country get back on its feet. The mission's mandate includes restoring public security and order and promoting the rule of law, beginning efforts to write a constitution and set up elections, promoting and protecting human rights, and thawing the assets freeze that had been imposed on the Gadhafi's government. The resolution further asks U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to report on its implementation in two weeks and every month thereafter, or more often if he sees fit. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, Ben Wedeman, Richard Roth and Mick B. Krever contributed to this report.","An anti-Gadhafi official predicts ""drastic"" changes soon in Sirte and Bani Walid .

"(CNN) -- Oil company Royal Dutch Shell will pay $15.5 million to settle a lawsuit against its Nigerian subsidiary by the family of executed Nigerian environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and other dissidents, the plaintiffs announced Monday. A team from Royal Dutch Shell works amid spilled oil in Atali, Nigeria. The lawsuit accuses Shell of complicity in the 1995 hanging of Saro-Wiwa and the killings or persecution of other environmental activists by the military government that ruled the country at the time. Roughly half of the settlement will go into a trust fund to help the people of Nigeria's Ogoni region, according to court papers. ""In reaching this settlement, we were very much aware that we are not the only Ogonis who have suffered in our struggle with Shell, which is why we insisted on creating the Kiisi Trust,"" Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., said in a statement accompanying the settlement. Nigeria's Ogoni people have complained for years that Shell was allowed to pollute its land without consequences. Saro-Wiwa's death sparked a worldwide outcry, and his movement ultimately forced Shell out of the oil- and gas-rich Ogoniland region. There was no immediate response from Shell to Monday's settlement. The New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights went to court on behalf of Saro-Wiwa's family and others in 1996. Shell fought the lawsuit until last week, when a federal appellate court ruled that the plaintiffs could sue the company's Nigerian subsidiary in American courts, overturning a March decision in the company's favor. ""This was one of the first cases to charge a multinational corporation with human-rights violations, and this settlement confirms that multinational corporations can no longer act with the impunity they once enjoyed,"" plaintiff's lawyer Jennie Green said in a statement released with the settlement.","Executed environmental activist's family sued oil company .

"(EW.com) -- Huge news for ""American Chopper"" fans: Jesse James is returning to the network that made him famous to compete head-to-head against the Teutuls on ""American Chopper."" Marking his first appearance on Discovery Chanel in five years, the former ""Monster Garage"" star will guest star on ""Chopper"" across two nights in December. Not only that, but ""American Chopper"" is going live for the first time -- pitting James, Paul Teutul, Senior and Paul Teutul Jr. in a bike-building battle at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. The face-off airs December 5 and 6 at 9 p.m. both nights. The first night is the regularly scheduled ""American Chopper."" You'll see Senior, Junior and James building the bikes, and viewers will vote for their favorite. The second night is a live show from Las Vegas where the winning bike will be revealed. For ""Chopper"" fans, this is the stuff of online message-board wish fulfillment. Jesse James' documentary ""Motorcycle Mania"" helped launch the whole cable reality motorcycle craze back in 2000, whereas relative later-comer ""American Chopper"" helped bring the genre to a greater level in popularity. James then left Discovery and went on to other ventures, including his short-lived Spike TV series ""Jesse James is a Dead Man"" (and drawing international headlines for his divorce from Sandra Bullock). Though James and the Teutuls respective motorcycle garage shows overlapped during James' years at Discovery (""Monster Garage"" ran from 2002-06; ""Chopper"" has aired since 2003), this event marks the first time the combustible personalities have gone head-to-head on one of the programs.

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Galaxy beat the Houston Dynamo 1-0 in the Major League Soccer final Sunday, in what could be David Beckham's last significant game on U.S. soil. The Galaxy entered the final match, which was on their home turf in Carson, California, as the clear favorite. The squad hasn't lost this year at The Home Depot Center, and overall have won 19 games, tied 10 and lost five. The Dynamo, meanwhile, finished second in the Eastern Conference having won 12 games, tied 13 and lost nine. Yet while the Houston squad had strong players like Brian Ching and Brad Davis on its roster, they couldn't match the star-power of the Galaxy. That included U.S. national team stalwart Landon Donovan, Irish forward Robbie Keane and Beckham. The sole goal of the game came in the 72nd minute. Beckham flicked a header to Keane who passed the ball to Donovan -- who, in turn, sent it past Dynamo goalkeeper Tally Hall. It was the Galaxy's third MLS title, and Beckham's first. Beckham has been a global soccer icon for years, inspiring the movie, ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and starring for years with Manchester United, Real Madrid and the English national team. He's also been a hot item off the field, as the husband of former ""Spice Girl"" singer and fashionista Victoria Beckham. In 2007, he signed on with Major League Soccer -- a surprising move to some, given that he then was still considered one of the world's best players and the U.S. league's quality was considered inferior to many others worldwide. Beckham said then that he hoped to help build the sport's standing in the United States and the league's profile internationally. His $32.5 million contract is set to expire at year's end, and Beckham recently told CNN that he is still weighing where, if anywhere, he will go next. Clubs rumored to have shown interest in him include European teams Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Queens Park Rangers. ""People say I'm coming to the end of my career, which at 36 years old you usually are,"" he said last week. ""But it's always nice to be wanted, and to be wanted by some of the biggest clubs in Europe still."" Beckham added that, at season's end, he plans to talk through his next steps with his family -- considering, among other factors, his health and ""what I think I can still achieve."" Beckham hoped to have an answer possibly before Christmas. He also expressed his desire to somehow be part of the 2012 Summer Olympics, either as a player, ""an ambassador for the Olympics"" or simply a fan. ""To be a proud Englishman, to get the Olympics in a part of London where I grew up, it was something that I loved being part of,"" Beckham said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","The Galaxy entered the game as the clear favorite .

"(CNN) -- The flight down wasn't too bad, a little bumpy, but it went up and came down just fine. U.N. peacekeeper force commander General Martin Luther Agwai . When Sarah called the local office about permission to film, she got an earful of abuse. The official wanted nothing to do with us. I wasn't too worried yet, we'd made it to Darfur and we'd be with U.N. peacekeepers, UNAMID and for the most part out of the way of government officials. The next day the surprises began. We were in Darfur, we were with the U.N., but there was almost nothing we could shoot. It soon became clear why. The U.N. was in virtual lockdown. It turned out that even as we were leaving Khartoum to fly down to Darfur, rebels were attacking the outskirts of the city. In news terms, we were in the wrong place. It was immensely frustrating being in the same country as significant breaking news, but unable to get to it. We filmed what we could around the base and made the best of a bad situation by doing a few live shots with details about the attack gleaned from our sources. My frustration began to dissipate fairly quickly the following day. I realized we might have been in the wrong place to see the attack but we were in exactly the right place to see how the Sudanese government controlled the U.N. peacekeepers. For the most part they didn't go out and their Force Commander General Martin Luther Agwai was grounded. That morning we went to the airport to join Agwai on a flight. When we got there Sudanese officials there said the U.N. couldn't fly even though commercial aircraft were free to come and go as they needed. It's when you stand there face-to-face with the situation and the people responsible that you see who has the power, who calls the shots. The U.N. was powerless. That was a real eye-opener, but it was still a challenge to get it across on TV. We couldn't pull the camera out and shoot the whole sequence. The story was, the general couldn't work, and as the general was our story, if he wasn't doing anything we had nothing to shoot -- a sort of catch-22. Fortunately cameraman Scottie is an old hand at these situations and we'd gone in prepared. I had my radio microphone, so I could leave Scottie in the vehicle shooting me while I wandered around outside and he could still pick up what I was saying. No one would be any the wiser. We sneaked in a few reports at the gates to the airport that way. It made us feel better to be getting something in the can. The rest of the day was to be even more interesting. As we couldn't go anywhere, we were able to get more briefs and shoot a few interviews. I was starting to learn things that were shocking me. Not least, that the U.N. had no power over the Sudanese government, but, for example, some of the female gate guards the U.N. employed were from the displacement camps. Fair enough, I thought, until I found out their husbands were away fighting for the rebels. The U.N. was effectively freeing men to keep the war going by supporting their families. That night when we got back to our house, I wrote of list of everything shocking I'd learned that day. I would be adding to it for the rest of my stay. For example, rebels recruit in aid camps. Sometimes people in the camps won't let the aid workers in. And one that really caught me by surprise: The international community had been paying rebels millions of dollars to abide by a 2006 cease-fire agreement. Many rebels had splintered their groups to get a bigger chunk of the cash. Admittedly that as over now, but Agwai saw it as one of the root causes of the increasing lawlessness. Rebels with a taste for cash turning to banditry when money handouts dried up. It was making me realize just how complex the problems in Darfur are. I knew that I was getting far more detail than I could ever hope to fit in to the half-hour program we planned, never mind a short news story. But at the same time I felt a huge responsibility. We'd been afforded very rare access. The name CNN helps open doors. We really needed to find out as much as we reasonably and safely could in the time available. At times like this our unspoken contract with our audience comes to mind. We are their eyes and ears, to open a window on a situation and let them decide what they make of it. Not prejudice our reports with our own preconceptions of the story and put the camera down when we think we've got enough to call it a day based on what we thought already, but to be thorough. In Darfur, as elsewhere, we are witnesses to history. The innocent victims here have no other voice other than ours. Only we are able to tell the world what's happening here. When I read that back it sounds a bit pompous, high and mighty, but as our time with the peacekeepers and aid workers was to show, they walk a political and diplomatic tightrope. If they speak out about the terrible injustices they see, they risk hampering their operations, hurting supplies and help for the people they are trying to protect. We felt for General Agwai. In the time we spent with him it's clear he's being let down by the international community. The politics of his job -- that is, China's call at the U.N. Security Council to give Sudan an effective veto over which troops can come -- meant he was never going to get the strongest force the world could supply. But then, like him, I was left wondering despite that huge set back why then couldn't he get a single one of the 24 helicopters he'd been promised. I can't tell you the private conversations we had but they left me feeling a man with very good intentions is having the toughest time of his life. I certainly didn't envy him his job.","Rebels attack outskirts of Khartoum as CNN arrives in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of North Chicago placed the city's police chief on leave and hired a retired officer to lead an investigation into six cases of alleged excessive use of force by police over the past 18 months. Police Chief Michael Newsome is on paid administrative leave, Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said Tuesday. ""I do think that is something that we do need to look into and make sure that things are being done properly in our police department,"" Rockingham said. ""There's a lot of things that have come to light that I think does warrant us to take a second look."" In addition, the gender and race of the people involved in the incidents will be investigated, and reporting requirements will be tightened, he said. ""I think that we, as the city of North Chicago, do need to make sure that the residents and people who are coming into our community are being handled properly,"" he said. But Rockingham expressed confidence in police, whose job is to maintain order among the 36,000 residents of North Chicago, where the average income was $17,685, according to the 2010 Census. ""I will say, if there's anyone we find that is not doing what they should be doing, we will do disciplinary actions to those officers,"" he said. ""But I think, all in all, if you look at our department, we have a fine police force."" Over the past four years, the department has been involved in some 88 use-of-force incidents, the mayor said. Asked how many of them were investigated at the time they occurred, Rockingham said that will be part of the newly announced investigation, which is to be completed by February 1. Rockingham said the six cases came to light after publicity surrounding the November case of Darrin Hanna, who died days after police allegedly beat him and used a Taser on him during a domestic abuse call to his house. ""I'm a mother who lost her son by a beating,"" his mother, Gloria Carr, told reporters recently. Lawyer Kevin O'Connor is representing Hanna's family and three other alleged victims in the cases under investigation. O'Connor said the North Chicago Police Department has a problem with a group of officers that have repeatedly beat people. ""I think there are very good officers on the force, but it looks like the problem is in the night shift that is not very well supervised,"" said O'Connor. ""There is about 10 that call themselves a gang. We have heard stories that they handcuff people and tell them they have a time period to run before they are beaten. So basically they are making them run, so that they can get a chance to beat them up."" O'Connor said his law firm has heard from more than 30 people who plan to come forward and tell their story about abuse from local police. ""They were scared before, but now they want to tell their stories,"" O'Connor said. ""I am glad the mayor did this. This is the first step. But why did it take someone dying before someone finally did something?"" In a case that occurred last October, Christopher Harper, 31, of Waukegan, said he was preparing to leave his job as a bouncer at a North Chicago bar when a policeman pulled up shortly before midnight. The radio in Harper's Dodge Magnum was cranked, which apparently bothered the policeman, Harper said. ""He told me he was towing the car for loud music,"" Harper said. Harper said he took his house keys out of his car's ignition and was walking away from the policeman toward the bar when he was struck repeatedly by electroshocks. ""He just Tased me in my back for no reason and kept doing it. I didn't understand that."" The officer fired a Taser at least six times into his back, he said. ""I ran 'til I couldn't take no more of the shockage, and then I just fell out. I was asking him why was he Tasing me."" At least two of the Taser strikes hit him while he was on the ground, he said. The officer then took Harper to jail, where he was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, which he denies. ""I never touched him, so I don't know where that came from. Not at all. I couldn't."" The next day, after he was released, Harper drove himself to a hospital for treatment of burns and bruises on his back. He said he stayed out of work for two weeks, had to pay $600 to get his car back and has not yet determined what he owes the hospital. Harper said he has not filed a complaint but has contacted a lawyer about his treatment by the police. ""They are just losing their minds for some reason,"" he said. In another incident, a police video was played at a city council meeting last month that appeared to show an officer punching a detainee in the head and putting him in a choke hold. A woman who answered the telephone Tuesday night at the police department said no one was available to talk to the news media.","North Chicago's police chief is on paid administrative leave, the mayor says .

"(CNN) -- World number two Maria Sharapova limped out of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo after twisting her ankle during her quarterfinal match against Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic. Sharapova had hoped for revenge after the Kvitova beat her in the final at Wimbledon this year. But with Sharapova losing 4-3 in the first set the Russian fell and retired shortly after. ""I hit a serve and then landed awkwardly on my left ankle. I felt a sharp pain and next thing I knew I was on the floor. It swelled up immediately and I knew there was no way I could continue,"" Sharapova said in a statement quoted by AFP. ""I am incredibly disappointed and in a lot of pain. I obviously really wanted to win and felt that I was playing well."" Sharapova's retirement means that Kvitova will now face another Russian, Vera Zvonareva, in the semifinals although the Czech player expressed her sadness at the manner in which the match ended. ""We played very nice tennis, I think, and it was a great match,"" she told AFP. ""I'm very sorry about her, because the ankle swollen was too big straight away. Hopefully... she will be back early."" Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland will contest the other semifinal.

The injury has also put Djokovic's appearance in next month's Shanghai Masters in doubt. World number three Roger Federer and Frenchman Richard Gasquet have already pulled out of the event.

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old west Florida boy apparently struck by a bullet fired skyward during a New Year's Eve celebration is improving, but remains in serious condition, authorities said Tuesday. Overnight, his condition was upgraded from critical to serious, said Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. The bullet is still lodged in the boy's head, and doctors are working to control the swelling around his brain. Until the bullet is removed, detectives cannot compare it to other bullets to help determine a possible suspect in the shooting, said McKinnon. Diego Duran, 12, was sitting in the front yard of his Ruskin, Florida, home watching fireworks about 1 a.m. Sunday when he fell to the ground, bleeding from the nose and eyes, McKinnon said. The victim's mother drove him to South Bay Hospital in Sun City Center, where doctors determined that a gunshot had gone through the top of the boy's head. The child was then transported to Tampa General Hospital, where he was in critical condition Sunday afternoon. The boy's mother, Sandy Duran, spoke to reporters Monday about her son. ""His brain is still in that stage of the 48 to 72 hours where it swells. There's a lot of inflammation going on, so the doctors cannot say what he will and won't be able to do,"" she said. ""The good news is that he is moving his extremities. He can move his hands. He can move his legs. He has opened his eyes."" Duran described her son as ""noble"" and said he enjoyed skating and playing guitar. He is the youngest of three children, and her family is taking it ""hour by hour,"" she said. ""For me, it's a miracle that he's alive considering what has just happened to him,"" said Duran. No one in the immediate area around the victim's house was firing a gun, the boy's relatives and neighbors told detectives. Police believe that celebratory gunfire, possibly shot from miles away, wounded the boy. If the wound is determined to be from a celebratory gunshot, it would not be the first time a child was inadvertently shot in the Southeast on New Year's Eve and in the hours after midnight. In 2009, 4-year-old Marquel Peters died after a bullet went through the roof of a suburban Atlanta church and hit him. The boy's mother, Nathalee Peters, has launched an online effort -- called Marquel's Pledge -- to urge people not to shoot into the air in celebration. It's one of several such campaigns nationwide, including one in Miami called, ""One bullet kills the party."" Duran similarly spoke about the need to educate the public about the dangers of celebratory gunfire. ""I'm speaking out because I don't think there's enough awareness out there,"" she said. ""A firearm is a weapon. It's a weapon that takes a life. It's not a toy for celebration."" CNN's George Howell contributed to this report.","Diego Duran's condition is upgraded from critical to serious .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide bomber killed 26 people and injured 63 others during a funeral procession in northwestern Pakistan Thursday, a senior police official told CNN. Saleem Murrawat, the police chief of the Lower Dir district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said the ceremony was for a member of a pro-government anti-Taliban militia in the area of Jandol. The chief said a suicide bomber blew himself up when he was standing with people at the procession. There are usually no security checks in such ceremonies. The chief said the bomber was around age 18. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the neighboring tribal region have been havens for militants and there have been many insurgent attacks in the area -- close to war-torn Afghanistan. On Tuesday, a school bus loaded with children came under rocket and small arms fire near Peshawar. The driver and three children were killed and 16 others wounded, police said. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group's regional spokesman, Mohammad Talha, who said it was in response to growing support for local resistance groups against the Taliban in the region.

"(CNN) -- The popular uprising in Syria against the Alawi-led minority regime of Bashar al-Assad poses a serious challenge to U.S. national security in the Middle East. As it fights for its survival amid escalating violence, the Syrian regime risks not only the deepening of civil strife in the country, but also provoking sectarian strife in the region, potentially drawing in U.S. military involvement. Washington has thus far been cautious in dealing with Syria, favoring strong words and sanctions against the regime and supporting Arab efforts to stop the violent military crackdown. But this could change as conditions in Syria deteriorate. The recent arrival in Syria of Arab observers, as part of a Syrian-endorsed Arab League plan to stop the violence, has been met with mixed emotions. Syrian opposition members rejected the plan, which was mediated by Iraq, on the grounds that it will give the bestial regime another chance to continue its brutal policies. Syria pipeline attached amid ongoing killing . Burhan Ghalioun, the head of the Syrian National Council opposition movement, emphasized that the observers cannot do their work because ""they cannot go where the authorities don't want them to go."" The Arab League's initiative is further tainted by the contemptible presence of Sudanese Gen. Mohammad Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi, who heads the mission. Al-Dabi held high military intelligence and security positions in the government of President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted on international charges of genocide in Darfur. Meanwhile, Syria continues its slow, steady descent into sectarian strife. There is the militarization of segments of the opposition, as manifested by the creation of the Free Syrian Army, and the targeted sectarian murders committed in mixed towns, especially in Homs. Indeed, the recent twin suicide bombings in Damascus, regardless of the identity of the as-yet-unknown culprits, could well be a portent of what may happen in the multireligious, multiethnic country. This premonition of escalating violence is shared by many in the region, including those within the ranks of the Syrian opposition. Syria is tightly linked both to the evolving Arab politics -- as influenced by the past year's Arab popular uprisings -- and to the ongoing shifts in the Saudi and Iranian-led regional axes of powers that have resulted from withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. To be sure, it is the Arab League mission that reflects more the deep divisions splintering the Arab world: The Arab League, led by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, initially determined to pressure the autocratic Syrian regime into submission, but this resolve was weakened by Iraq questioning the League's apparent double-standard policy. Its stance on Syria contrasts sharply with its position on Bahrain. Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf Cooperation Council countries, sent troops to Bahrain to help quash a Shi'a majority-dominated uprising against that kingdom's Sunni monarchy. Similarly, the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, acting apparently in concert with Iran, has not concealed its desire to keep the Syrian regime in power. Iran has described the violence in Syria as part of a Western-Israeli conspiracy against the regime. And pro-Iranian forces in Iraq and Lebanon, such as the Sadrists and Hezbollah respectively, have expressed their readiness to support the Syrian regime. Beyond this, the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq has apparently boosted the confidence not only of Iran and its proxies but also the Syrian regime. Iran and Hezbollah laud the ""resistance"" for forcing the Americans from Iraq, and Syria no longer fears an American interference from Iraq. In fact, the regime believes that Iraq now affords Syria another strategic buffer with regard to a potential anti-Syrian military intervention; the other being offered by Lebanon. This will undoubtedly leave the international community facing neither an Arab nor a Russian solution. Russia recently introduced a draft resolution the U.N. Security Council on ending the violence in Syria. However, Russia, along with China, has had serious disagreements with other members of the Security Council, who favor sanctions against Damascus, including an arms embargo. Washington will most likely confront urgent Arab and Syrian opposition requests for direct involvement in Syria. Already, Ghalioun has called on the Security Council to adopt the Arab initiative; at the same time some Arab and Syrian opposition leaders have vocally called for a no-fly zone and NATO involvement to protect civilians. But a word of caution. The danger of this kind of involvement lies in the grave and complex reality that Iran still considers the security of the Syrian regime as part of its own security, and that, while both Tehran and Damascus have been preparing for a conflict with United States since its invasion of Iraq in 2003, including supporting proxy forces in the region, Washington has thus far pursued policies more reactive in nature to regional developments. Washington should be careful about falling into the duplicitous trap of Middle Eastern politics. Washington must act within the context that Syria is already in the throes of civil strife, which can only intensify and possibly spill over into Lebanon or Iraq, and that the Arab states are fighting two wars. One is over the nature of future power in their capitals and the other is over which regional axis they will support. Washington should also disabuse itself of the notion that the terminally ill Syrian regime will collapse soon. The regime has life support from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, and thrives on terror and Arab schisms. This makes any reactive or reflexive American involvement in Syria fraught with uncertainties and serious risks. Washington's policies should focus now on expanding and organizing its cooperation with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have deep interest in a change of power in Damascus; supporting the Free Syrian Army through Saudi Arabia and Turkey; strengthening sanctions against Syria in concert with regional and international allies, including placing sanctions on Sunni merchants closely associated with the regime.; maintaining and supporting a strong diplomatic presence in Iraq and Lebanon; seeking out Alawi and Christian political and military figures with the objective of reassuring them with the promise of political inclusion in the future of Syria. Most importantly, Washington should not lead a campaign in Syria designed in the imperial corridors of the American capital itself.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced recently that about 100 U.S. troops are being deployed to Central Africa to help ""apprehend and remove"" the elusive Joseph Kony and his top commanders of the Lord's Resistance Army. It's not the first time the United States has gone in to help put an end to the marauding, murdering gang known as the Lord's Resistance Army -- LRA, for short. The LRA has butchered, enslaved and displaced people in Uganda and Central Africa for two decades. Although its brand of terrorism doesn't target the United States, Washington has listed it as a terrorist group. The U.S. decision to help go after Kony is a strategic -- as well as a humanitarian -- one. Africa is a frontier for terrorism. Uganda is fighting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia -- which helps the United States -- so in turn, the U.S. is helping Uganda fight the LRA. The Lord's Resistance Army began in northern Uganda in 1987 as an opposition force to leader Yoweri Museveni. Kony sees himself as a prophet who has said he wants to rule by following the Ten Commandments. Instead, he has ruled -- and thrived -- by breaking a lot of those commandments. The Ugandan army -- with the help of the U.S. military -- has tried for years to take him and his leadership out. The International Criminal Court has had a warrant out for him since 2005. The Lord's Resistance Army replenishes its ranks by abducting villagers -- men, women and children -- brainwashing them and forcing them to fight. Or to serve as sex slaves for commanders. LRA members survive by staying on the move constantly and stealing food and provisions. Last month, according to researchers, an LRA band raided a village in the Democratic Republic of Congo soon after the World Food Programme had distributed food supplies there. So what is LRA leader Kony's secret? How has he evaded justice to operate his band of marauders and murderers with impunity for decades? Here are five reasons some experts give: . 1. He uses terror strategically. You've probably seen photos of children whose noses or ears were cut off -- because they didn't obey the LRA's orders. He's forced children he's abducted to kill their siblings or parents. (More: Woman recalls harrowing tale of captivity) ""They use very carefully thought-through strategies to have the biggest impact,"" said Tim Allen, a professor at the London School of Economics and co-author of ""The Lord's Resistance Army: Myth and Reality."" ""In northern Uganda in 2004,"" Allen said, ""they took some 20-odd women with their babies out of the displacement camp, laid them on the ground with their babies on their backs and smashed their brains in."" And they did it at the edge of the camp -- so that everyone in the camp would see. ""They didn't do that very often,"" Allen said. ""But you don't have to do that sort of thing very often to have a large impact on a lot of people."" 2. Kony exploits regional politics and borders. He got support from the Sudanese government for years. And the LRA uses borders as a defense: It hasn't been in Uganda for years. That's made it hard for the Ugandan army to pursue Kony. The militia is split and is constantly moving between the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and southern Sudan. 3. Uganda's efforts to get Kony have flagged. Uganda's army has been stretched to the hilt, fighting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia as part of an African Union force. 4. Kony is a smart strategist. His band travels in small groups, and they're a moving target. And he has informants -- with cell phones. The last time the U.S. military helped Uganda go after Kony, in 2008, it used a traditional air and ground assault. Kony and his leaders escaped, then massacred hundreds of people in revenge. This time, the United States is bringing Special Forces (and probably other intelligence agents) with equipment and tactics to track him in the jungle. 5. Kony mixes military discipline with cultish charisma and spiritual tactics to keep captives in line -- and sometimes, to keep the loyalty even of those who escape. Allen, the London School of Economics professor, has talked to women who have escaped the Lord's Resistance Army but are still loyal to their LRA ""husbands."" ""He cultivates this image of himself as a medium for the power of the spirit and at other times, he presents himself as a ruthless military leader,"" said Ned Dalby, Central Africa researcher with the International Crisis Group. ""So he's able to maintain cohesion as a group and maintain the loyalty of his fighters."" Dalby said some former LRA fighters from northern Uganda have given a clue as to why some outside the group have stayed loyal to Kony. ""They expressed the feeling that because they were given a rank, they were given a certain purpose, and respect and authority,"" Dalby said. ""And then, once they're outside the LRA, they find they've become just another poor person, trying to survive.""","Lord's Resistance Army has terrorized people in Africa for two decades .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them. Khaled AlKhamissi's novel ""Taxi,"" first published in 2006, has been translated into 10 languages. It features 58 fictional monologues with taxi drivers recreated from his own experience. A new post-revolution English edition has just been published. Despite the optimism that swept Egypt after president Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February, AlKhamissi said taxi drivers, and the rest of the country's poor, have in fact suffered more since then. ""My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day,"" said AlKhamissi. ""Those 55% were not on the streets during the revolution and are without a real voice now. ""They are wise, they are watching, they are analyzing, but they are not acting."" He added: ""Life has changed for them in the wrong direction. It's worse for them because we have no security and living on the streets without security is dangerous. ""There is less tourism and more chaos on the streets."" AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution. ""We are in the middle of a battle, and during the battle we can't see whether life is improving or not,"" he said. AlKhamissi, whose second novel ""Noah's Ark"" -- also a bestseller -- was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on January 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since. ""It's impossible to write because my mind is taken with what is happening day after day, hour after hour,"" he said. Since January, AlKhamissi has filled his time with a weekly newspaper column, lectures and speaking events. But the author wants to get back to writing fiction. ""Every night I want to write because it is my only job, my only happiness,"" he said. ""I have to find a solution soon or I will die."" ""Taxi"" was credited with single-handedly reviving an interest in reading in Egypt, according to its publisher Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation, but AlKhamissi denies his book is responsible. He said: ""Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits. ""Reading has increased in the last six years, but it has taken many social factors. We have had a cultural revolution in the last six years in all matters: Theater, music, fiction and publishing. ""This cultural revolution is related to youth searching for a dream."" AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book. ""They don't have time to read because they are struggling to survive,"" he said. ""When we can increase the quality of education and decrease poverty, then they will be able to read. I'm not interested in whether they read my book, I just hope they will read anything."" Another novelist credited with changing reading habits in Egypt is Ahmed Khaled Towfik, a 49-year-old medical professor described by Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation as the Arab world's most prominent bestselling author of fantasy and horror. He has written more than 200 books, selling millions of copies. He said he was among the first Egyptian authors to write for young people. ""Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read,"" said Towfik. ""We invented popular literature. I think I made the youth fond of reading. ""I think most of my readers were in Tahrir Square. I changed a part of their thinking, although you can't compare that to their economic disappointment or the scourge of the police system."" Towfik's book ""Utopia,"" which has just been published in English, is a grim futuristic account of Egyptian society in the year 2023 with wealthy gated communities insulated from the poverty outside. Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true. ""The first uprising came from the middle class, but I think another bloodier one could come from the lower classes, like described in my book 'Utopia'. ""I still think there's a danger my book could come true."" He added: ""After nine months, nothing has been accomplished except getting rid of Mubarak. We got rid of the head of the snake, but the body of the snake is still ruling everything.""","Life has got harder for taxi drivers since the revolution, says Khaled AlKhamissi .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Palestinian Liberation Organization's leadership reiterated its push for recognition as an independent state by the United Nations and condemning Israel's latest proposal for new settlements on disputed territory, state-run media reported. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas led the meeting in Ramallah on Thursday to discuss the official position, according to the official WAFA news agency. The U.N. Security Council's admissions committee is set Friday to review the Palestinian application for statehood. Last week, the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- called on Israel and the Palestinians to resume peace talks within a month and set the end of 2012 as the deadline for their completion. But no such direct talks have taken place. Abbas has said repeatedly that the Palestinians would not return to negotiations until Israel halted all settlement construction and accepted 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks. Israel has maintained that negotiations should begin with no preconditions. Besides calling for negotiation, the Quartet also called on both sides to ""to refrain from provocative actions"" -- in part a veiled reference to Israeli settlement-building in land Israel occupied as a result of the 1967 Mideast War. This week, the Israeli Interior Ministry announced this week that a district planning committee had approved the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern Jerusalem neighborhood that was seized by Israel in 1967. That decision will be open for public comment for the next 60 days, the ministry added. Yasser Abed Rabbo, secretary-general of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's executive committee, read a statement after the meeting Thursday criticizing the Israeli move. Palestinians, who want the land Israel now occupies in East Jerusalem and the West Bank to be part of a future Palestinian state. A day earlier, Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Shtayyeh said the action suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government are not serious about making peace. ""He said at the United Nations he was giving his hand in peace, but actually, he is digging in the land to build more settlements,"" Shtayyeh said. He further called Israel's move ""a slap in the face of the Quartet and the whole international community, which is saying 'stop settlements.'"" In an interview with the daily Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu defended Israel's right to build in Jerusalem. ""We plan in Jerusalem, we build in Jerusalem. Period. The same way Israeli governments have been doing for years."" The Israeli move drew international criticism, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemning it while U.S. officials expressed disappointment. ""Settlement expansion is illegal under international law, corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace,"" Hague said in a statement. ""We call on the government of Israel to revoke this decision."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the United States was disappointed by Israel's announcement, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it ""counterproductive to our efforts to resume direct negotiations between the parties."" As for possible U.S. government criticism of the move, Netanyahu declared that the Americans ""know this -- they have followed this a long time. There is really nothing new."" In the interview, Netanyahu also said Israel would not initiate another settlement freeze to get talks started again. ""We already gave at the office,"" he said, referring to a 10-month freeze enacted by his government last year.","Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas leads the meeting in Ramallah .
In it, Palestinian leaders say they'll push for statehood at U.N.

"(CNN) -- In the three years since ""Twilight"" bowed in theaters, we've learned a few things: . One, while teen girls are a sizable portion of the fan base, they're not its totality. Two, the first three films of the franchise have pulled in roughly $1.8 billion worldwide in ticket sales (not adjusted for inflation), according to BoxOfficeMojo.com. That's apparently enough for Robert Pattinson, who stars as Edward Cullen, to talk of being able to afford to fail, and his co-star Kristen Stewart (Bella Swan) of donating some of her ""funds."" Three, there must be a just a teeny tiny footnote on each installment's budget for Taylor Lautner's wardrobe, because rare is the moment when the kid isn't walking around without a shirt. But as ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I"" opens in theaters today, we're recounting 10 other (tongue firmly in cheek) lessons we've culled from the series, themes that have been carried from Stephenie Meyer's best-selling novels onto the big screen. 1. Love at first sight is overrated; he or she should fall for you at first whiff. Before Edward Cullen got to know the human he eventually married, he smelled Bella from across the classroom. Yes, his senses are attuned to the scent of human blood, but you're missing the point: Bella's smelled special, like his ""own personal brand of heroin,"" as he memorably says in the first film. Ladies and gents, rethink your relationships if they don't inspire comparisons to narcotics. 2. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" had it all wrong -- silence, irritation, storming off and mood swings are actually signs of unexpressed affection. Edward Cullen wasn't always the sparkly dreamboat of a blood-drinking gentleman you'll see in theaters this weekend. At first, he was actually pretty rude, prone to angrily walking away from Bella, being short with her and repeatedly telling her to stay away from him because he's dangerous. Talk about mixed messages! The next time someone gives you the brush off, don't think he or she isn't into you. Perhaps they're just trying to refrain from going for that vein in your neck. Which brings us to our next lesson: . 3. Be accepting of your partner's eccentricities. Quirks such as eye color fluctuations, superhuman strength, the ability to read minds and family members who try to devour you on your birthday are qualities that make a partner unique. Don't let silly things like her predisposition to kill stand in the way -- every relationship has its obstacles! Just be glad she's not a zombie. 4. There's no such thing as personal space when one's in love. Edward and Bella are so into each other, the thought of being separated for more than a span of a few days could send one of them into an outburst that rivals a demonic possession out of ""The Exorcist."" This was depicted with strong commitment from Kristen Stewart in 2008's ""Twilight,"" as she made Bella appear to be on the verge of a stroke when Edward suggested they should maybe rethink this whole human/vampire relationship thing. Really, your partner only needs enough space to go to the bathroom and change clothes, and even then, you should be waiting for them on the other side of the door. 5. In the event that you and your partner do breakup, withdrawing from life as you lived it while having hallucinations about your romantic partner are all expected side effects. That's why they call it being lovesick, kids. 6. Since you can't control such emotions, one should be open to falling in love with a human, shapeshifter, immortal or a baby. Taylor Lautner's Jacob Black and other select members of his tribe have the ability to phase into wolves to protect their land, and they can also ""imprint,"" essentially falling in love and linking themselves with the one person with whom they're supposed to be . They also can't help whom they ""imprint"" on. So if it happens that the woman of your dreams was born just a few days ago to the woman you used to have a crush on, well, you'll just have to wait. 7. If one love interest is the fun one, and the other love interest brings the passion, just hang out with both for as long as possible. * . Committing to one person is a tough choice, especially when you could die just from hanging around said individual, so it's understandable if your affections get pulled in another direction during a vulnerable moment. The best thing to do is to maintain one as the ""relationship"" and the other as the ""friendship"" until you can't play that game anymore. Bonus if they're natural-born enemies. * Frankly, this lesson makes some sense. 8. There's always going to be a rumble brewing, and one of you is always going to have to be saved. Edward and Bella are always fighting off this enemy or that, right up until the very end. Believe it or not, this kind of stress somehow benefits the relationship -- just think of all that drama as the""spark"" that ignites the fire of romantic moments. You know, ""It's us against the world/Volturi,"" etc. 9. When given the option, go ahead and stay human for the honeymoon. And if you're not breaking the bed while vacationing on your new spouse's private island, you're doing it wrong. Thankfully, there's hired help ready to clean it all up for you -- that's what happens when you wed an unbelievably wealthy immortal. But if you get pregnant, get ready for one hellish gestation period. 10. One can both acknowledge the ridiculousness of lessons one through nine and still be in line for a midnight showing after reading the series (again). Perhaps the biggest lesson of all? Don't look for nuggets of enlightenment in ""Twilight."" As fans of the series could tell you, the biggest draw isn't the outlandish plot points or the unrealistic romantic ideals, but the classic fantasy of love somehow conquering all. Have we missed a lesson you've learned? We want to hear it in the comments.","""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I"" opens in theaters today .
The supernatural romantic series has plenty of tongue-in-cheek lessons .
""Twilight"" shows how a partner's eccentric qualities just spice the stew .

"London (CNN) -- A comprehensive new study identifying the most threatened sea turtle populations worldwide has been published by conservationists. The report, jointly produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Marine Turtle Specialist Group (MTSG), Conservation International (CI) and the U.S.'s National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, is the first detailed appraisal of global sea turtle populations, say the authors, and will provide a blueprint for future conservation efforts. ""This assessment system provides a baseline status for all sea turtles from which we can gauge our progress on recovering these threatened populations in the future,"" Roderic Mast, co-chair of the MTSG and vice-president of CI said in a statement. ""Through this process, we have learned a lot about what is working and what isn't in sea turtle conservation, so now we look forward to turning the lessons learned into sound conservation strategies for sea turtles and their habitats,"" Mast added. Almost half of the world's most threatened sea turtle species can be found in the northern waters of the Indian Ocean and on nesting beaches lying within Exclusive Economic Zones in countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, according to the report. Threatened populations here include both loggerhead turtles (classified ""endangered"" by the IUCN Red List) and ridley turtles (""vulnerable""). ""The report confirms that India is a home to many of the most threatened sea turtles in the world,"" B. C. Choudhury, from the Wildlife Institute of India said in a statement. ""This paper is a wake-up call for the authorities to do more to protect India's sea turtles and their habitats to ensure that they survive,"" he added. Other hotspots for sea turtles include the east Pacific Ocean (running from the U.S. to South America) and the east Atlantic Ocean -- specifically off the coast of western Africa. According to the report, threats to sea turtles vary from region to region but can be broadly categorized. These include accidental (caught in fishing nets) and deliberate targeting (for trades in eggs, meat and shells), coastal development, pollution and climate change. Join Philippe Cousteau for ""Your Green World"" As well as highlighting danger areas, the report also pinpoints regions which are supporting healthier populations which face relatively low threats. Species including the hawksbill turtle and the green turtle are thriving in nesting sites and feeding areas in Australia, Mexico and Brazil, along with southwestern Indian Ocean, Micronesia (in Oceania) and French Polynesia. The report helps set up ""priorities for different populations in different regions,"" says Bryan Wallace, director of science for the marine flagship species program at CI and lead author of the report. ""Sea turtles everywhere are conservation-dependent, but this framework will help us effectively target our conservation efforts around the world,"" Wallace said in a statement. The report is published in the online science journal PLoS (Public Library of Science).","New report reveals northern Indian Ocean as area where most sea turtles under threat .

"(CNN) -- The family of deceased Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi will file a war crimes complaint against NATO with the International Criminal Court, a lawyer representing the family said Thursday. Members of the family believe NATO's actions led to Gadhafi's death last week, said Marcel Ceccaldi. ""All of the events that have taken place since February 2011 and the murder of Gadhafi, all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the International Criminal Court,"" Ceccaldi, a French attorney, said. NATO responded that it ""conducts its operation in strict conformity with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions."" In a statement Thursday, a NATO official said, ""At no time during Operation Unified Protector has NATO targeted specific individuals."" The ICC had previously issued a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest, accusing him of crimes against humanity. The ICC still has warrants for the arrest of Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi. Questions surround the death of Moammar Gadhafi, who eluded forces loyal to the National Transitional Council for months. Video shows Gadhafi was alive when captured by the opposition. He died from a shot in the head, officials said, but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear. The United States said it supports an independent investigation, as called for by the United Nations and by Libya's new leadership. Ceccaldi said the Gadhafi family's complaint will be filed in the coming days. ""Now we will wait and see if the ICC is a judicial system which is independent and impartial,"" he added. Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of the NATO military operation, said earlier this week that NATO ""did not get involved in anything beyond what was our legal mandate and we remain well within the mandate assigned to us by the North Atlantic Council."" While Gadhafi survived an airstrike in the Sirte area shortly before he died, Bouchard said NATO did not know the former Libyan leader was in the convoy. ""We saw a convoy, and in fact we had no idea that Gadhafi was on board,"" Bouchard said. Some vehicles in the convoy were carrying weaponry, and seemed to present a potential threat to the population, he said. The news came as the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to end NATO's military operations in Libya.","NEW: NATO responds that it never targeted specific individuals in the operation .

"(CNN) -- Two years ago, Carlo Ratti, the head of MIT's Senseable City Lab, decided to find out what happened when city residents disposed of trash. His team recruited 500 volunteers in Seattle to put sensor tags on items they were throwing away, and the researchers tracked the travels of the trash. Of the 3,000 discarded items that were tracked and visualized in the research, some traveled considerable distances, with one, an ink cartridge, being shipped to the East before winding up in Baja California, a journey of nearly 4,000 miles. ""When you have all these traces of trash moving around,"" said Ratti, ""you can ask yourself how can we make the system more efficient. Then we can make better decisions. And perhaps we will not throw away the plastic bottles that go every day to the dump."" Ratti, a civil engineer and architect, spoke at the TED2011 conference in Long Beach, California, in March and was interviewed by CNN. Watch Carlo Ratti's TED Talk . ""Cities are 2% of the earth's crust but they are 50% of the world's population,"" and consume 75% of the world's energy, he said. As computer technology has advanced in past decades, cities have been transformed into digital networks that can be analyzed and activated to improve urban living, Ratti said. Ratti sees technology as a two-way street. You can use it to make sense of the physical world, digitizing what's out there as he did with the Seattle trash project. But you can also take something that's purely digital and make it real in the physical world. Among other projects he has worked on was the ""Digital Water Pavilion,"" a building built for an expo in Zaragoza, Spain, with exterior and internal walls produced by flowing water controlled by a computerized system. When you approach the building to enter, sensors stop the water flow to create a doorway you can step through without getting wet.","Carlo Ratti heads MIT's Senseable City Lab .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Police Department has the capability to ""take down"" threatening airplanes, Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in an interview broadcast on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" Sunday night. Asked by interviewer Scott Pelley whether he is satisfied with the handling of potential aerial threats, Kelly responded, ""It's something that's on our radar screen. In an extreme situation, we would have some means to take down a plane."" ""Do you mean to say that the NYPD has the means to take down an aircraft?"" Pelley asked. ""Yes,"" Kelly answered. ""I prefer not to get into the details, but obviously this would be in a very extreme situation."" ""You have the equipment and the training?"" ""Yes."" There was no comment on the technology that would be used in such a situation. The interview highlighted several other security measures undertaken by the police department's Counterterrorism Bureau, including random subway searches, officers carrying nuclear radiation detectors on their gun belts, and thousands of ""smart"" cameras in downtown Manhattan. Kelly created the Counterterrorism Bureau in early 2002 in response to the September 11th attacks that occurred 10 years ago last month. Since the attacks, more than $3 billion has been spent on New York City counterterrorism measures. Units within the bureau include the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, and the Terrorism Threat Analysis Group. ""We're the number one target in this country. That's the consensus in the intelligence community,"" Kelly said. ""We're the communications capital. We're the financial capital.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- There may be an extra place setting around Jack Wagner's dinner table this holiday season -- and not just because he and longtime girlfriend Heather Locklear are no longer together. Wagner, 52, discovered earlier this month that he has a long-lost 23-year-old daughter from a ""fling"" he had with the girl's mother in the late 1980s, TMZ reports. The girl, named Carrie, introduced herself to Wagner backstage at a November 4 concert in Boca Raton, Florida. where the actor was performing with Rick Springfield. Less than two weeks after the encounter, Wagner and Locklear announced they had called off their engagement, saying planning their wedding was not allowing them enough time to spend with their children. Reports say Carrie, who was given up for adoption as an infant, had recently tried to track down her birth parents, a search that led her Wagner. Sources told TMZ that the two embraced at the Florida concert and, at a later performance, Wagner introduced her to the entire audience. The newly expanded family appeared in public this week at the taping of the Hollywood Christmas Parade Tree Lighting Concert at Universal Citywalk, which will air December 12 on the Hallmark Channel. Carrie and Wagner's two other children cheered their father on as he performed two songs. ""They were completely having fun,"" according to an onlooker. ""[Wagner] was in great spirits with his family. They were all celebrating together. The kids totally supported their dad, which was really cute.""

"(CNN) -- What are we afraid of? That's the one thing I still don't understand; the one question -- nearly a month removed -- I'd love to have answered. What in the world are we so afraid of? In its October 4 issue, Sports Illustrated released a seven-page excerpt from my new book, ""Sweetness: The Enigmatic Life of Walter Payton,"" a biography of the Chicago Bears' running back. The short piece concerned Payton's post-football struggles, ranging from depression to infidelity to suicide threats. It was, admittedly, a jarring look at a man who, to most Chicagoans, served as a beacon of light. Throughout his 13 seasons as a Bear, Payton wasn't merely a phenomenal running back. He was an NFL icon; one of the faces (and blinding smiles) of the league. Hence, to learn that Payton was -- what's the word? -- human, immediately rubbed many football fans (and, in particular, Chicago fans) the wrong way. In 17 years as a journalist, I've never received so many vicious letters, so many confrontational tweets, so many threatening e-mails. The general take (in sanitized terms): How dare you write a book about Sweetness when he's not here to defend himself? How dare you. To be honest, I was initially taken aback. You devote three years to a project, only to be judged on a sliver of a sliver of the full body of work. I felt the need to defend my intentions and stand up for my honor and convince every single naysayer that ""Sweetness"" was a detailed, exhaustively researched biography that delves into the ... blah, blah, blah. Now, I'm just mad. This is what biographies are supposed to do. From Manning Marable's astonishing ""Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention"" to Richard Ben Cramer's ""Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life"" to Jane Levy's ""The Last Boy: Mickey Mantle and the End of America's Childhood,"" portraits of our icons should be truthful, fair and--perhaps most important--unflinching. We should want and expect this. They are written neither to love a subject nor loathe a subject, but to fully understand a subject. In other words, to provide a history lesson. In the years I spent trying to grasp Walter Payton, I learned to love -- truly love -- a uniquely giving, empathetic, quirky man. The portrait of Payton that already existed in the popular consciousness had been an overly simplistic (ie: mindless) one: The hard-nosed gridiron warrior who cracked lots of jokes and always had time for the fans. Payton's background? No interest. Payton's motivations? Meh. Payton's struggles and conflicts and pains? No, thank you. So what if Payton's own autobiography, ""Never Die Easy,"" was an ode to the Chip Hilton school of gosh-golly-gee selective storytelling? Hey, it made us smile and sounded awfully good. Well, Walter Payton was so much more than good. Back in the fall of 1970, he was a key peg in the desegregation of the Marion County (Mississippi) School District; he was the black football player who -- by running 70-yard sweeps and walking with a quiet, confident dignity -- convinced skeptical white classmates (many of whom had never before spoken with a black person) that, hey, maybe this will work out OK. He went on to star at Jackson State University, where his brightest moment came not on the football field, but as a finalist on the Soul Train National College Dance Championship (he and his partner, Mary Jones, finished second -- a setback that haunted Payton as much as his failure to score a touchdown in Super Bowl XX). While in college, Payton changed his birth year from 1953 to 1954, inexplicably hoping the extra youth would give him in edge in Heisman Trophy balloting (it worked wonders -- he placed 14th). When he was drafted by the lowly Chicago Bears, he cried in disappointment -- literally, tears streamed down his face. When his father died in a Columbia, Mississippi, jail in 1978 (the police thought he was intoxicated; truth be told, he was suffering from a brain aneurism), he cried in devastation -- vowing to never refer to the place as his hometown again. Walter Payton signed every autograph request. Walter Payton dodged myriad interview requests. Walter Payton desperately wanted to be known as the greatest running back of all time. When Walter Payton became the NFL's all-time leading rusher in 1984, he shooed the media away. Walter Payton wanted people to know he didn't eat red meat. Walter Payton consumed Whoppers and Big Macs like a vacuum cleaner. Walter Payton was elated to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Walter Payton loathed the Hall of Fame induction ceremony -- knowing his wife and girlfriend would both be attending. When he retired after the 1987 season, Payton found himself searching for meaning in places where no meaning could be found. For 13 seasons he had been the toast of Chicago -- an incomparable running back and civic ambassador. Then, suddenly, it was over. His efforts to become an NFL owner fell short. His businesses yielded mixed results. His marriage was merely for show. He was lonely and angry and depressed, and -- at his absolute lowest -- he wrote suicide letters and contemplated taking his own life. The truth is harsh. Painful. Uncomfortable. And yet, it is also beautiful. Throughout his darkest days, when Payton saw no hope and no future, he continued to treat the people of Chicago as if they were his closest friends. On the streets of the Windy City, he'd offer hugs and smiles and pinches to complete strangers. He'd pose for pictures, sign autographs, tell the stories of Super Bowl XX or breaking Jim Brown's all-time rushing record for the 12,471st time. Never complaining. Never moaning. In the final months of his life, Payton was made aware his liver disease had morphed into bile duct cancer, that no transplant would be coming; that he was, quickly, dying. At that time, with nothing to gain, the man known as Sweetness did one public service announcement after another, urging people to save a life and sign up as organ donors. The impact: Thousands of new registers. That's Walter Payton. That's a story worth telling. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman says he took a lot of heat for the revelations in his Walter Payton biography .

"(Financial Times) -- When Macau unveiled record gambling revenues on Tuesday, the government was silent about the source of much of the cash fuelling the territory's boom: illegal money transfers from mainland China. From pawn shops offering money withdrawal services, to underground banks using human mules to transport cash across the border, Macau tolerates the illicit methods that mainland punters use to bring money into the former Portuguese colony, which reverted to Chinese control in 1999. Mainland tourists, who have made Macau the world's largest gambling centre, can legally bring only Rmb20,000 ($3,175) when crossing into the Chinese territory. But many gamblers bring more cash to the casino tables by using their Unionpay debit card to withdraw money -- for a fee. ""There is no risk. We pretend to sell the customer an expensive watch or a piece of jewellery, charge the amount in renminbi to the debit card, and then give him the equivalent amount in Macau patacas or Hong Kong dollars as if the customer had decided to return the object for an immediate cash refund,"" says the manager of a pawnshop up the street from the Grand Lisboa casino, Macau's oldest casino owned by Stanley Ho, the gambling tycoon. The manager says the cardholder's records will register the transaction as a purchase. Unionpay, which was formed by China's big banks, says it bans such transactions, but the company declined to comment on the fact that the practice remained widespread. The company said it no longer released data on how much cardholders spent in Macau. People familiar with the industry say the Macau government cannot afford to shut down the illegal services, which hundreds of pawn shops advertise publicly on neon signs. ""The Macau government's hands are tied,"" says one veteran Macau policeman. ""It is not going to initiate a crackdown, because over 75 per cent of its revenue comes from gaming taxes."" About 16m mainland Chinese visited Macau in 2011, an increase of more than 20 per cent on the previous year, and 60 per cent more than the 10m who visited in 2006. Analysts estimate that up to 30 per cent of Macau's gaming revenue could be channelled through illegal channels. ""Banking restrictions make it very difficult to transfer funds to Macau legitimately, but it is easy for people to find ways [around the rules],"" says a senior Chinese bank manager who gambles in Macau. While the debit card cashback service is the most visible source of money for the less well-heeled punters, those with deeper pockets have found different ways to avoid the restrictions. VIP punters -- whom analysts estimate generate 70 per cent of Macau's gaming revenues -- gamble on credit provided by so-called junket operators who seek out wealthy mainland gamblers. The junket operators receive commissions from the casinos or get a share of the profits. They, or their agents, sometimes use underground banks to return the money they have collected as debt on the mainland to Macau. The lenders use criminal gangs from Fujian and Guangdong provinces who in turn pay human mules as little as $5 -- compared with Guangdong's average daily wage of $7 -- to smuggle cash across the border. While the underground banks are part of what is known as the shadow banking system in China, providing credit to cash-strapped companies, their Macau-related business is limited to transferring money from other sources. One former junket operator and a Hong Kong owner of a mainland factory in Guangdong province, just across the border from Macau, described how operators also use Hong Kong business people who own companies on the mainland to transfer money illegally. He said operators handed over renminbi debts collected on the mainland to the factory owner, who used the money to pay his staff wages. Then, the owner sent the equivalent in Hong Kong dollars from his Hong Kong bank account to the operator's account in Macau. Both sides profited by agreeing a mutually beneficial exchange rate. There is no public data available to indicate exactly how much of Macau's gaming revenue comes from illegal channels, and casino operators and government officials refuse to speak about the issue. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau refused to comment. ""Neither the Macau government nor Beijing wishes to damage the Macau economy. There's good reason to keep the scale of illegal transactions a closely guarded secret so nobody needs to take action,"" says the police officer. While Beijing does not condone gambling on the mainland, it has so far not cracked down on the illegal transfers. Analysts say it is unlikely to take action as the Chinese Communist party does not want to destabilise Macau just 13 years after the city returned to Chinese rule. ""Beijing is unlikely to take measures such as tightening visa restrictions or clamping down on debit card cashback services, as long as Macau is seen as a safe and enjoyable place to visit and casino operators refrain from activities or comments that might portray the city in a bad light,"" says Grant Govertsen, the Macau-based managing partner at Union Gaming Research, a US research group. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Macau tolerates illicit methods to bring money into the former Portuguese colony .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- In a move that will further complicate international efforts to get Middle East peace negotiations restarted, the Israeli government Tuesday approved the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern Jerusalem neighborhood that was seized by Israel in 1967. The Israeli Interior ministry announced that a district planning committee had approved the construction of the housing and that the decision would be open for public objections for the next 60 days. The move brought quick condemnation from Palestinians who claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state. Palestinian officials said the action proved that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not serious about making peace. ""He said at the United Nations he was giving his hand in peace, but actually, he is digging in the land to build more settlements,"" said Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Shtayyeh. The Israeli move also drew international criticism, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemning it while U.S. officials expressed disappointment. ""Settlement expansion is illegal under international law, corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace,"" Hague said in a statement. ""We call on the government of Israel to revoke this decision."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the United States was disappointed by Israel's announcement, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it ""counterproductive to our efforts to resume direct negotiations between the parties."" Last week, the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- called on Israel and the Palestinians to resume peace talks within a month and set the end of 2012 as the deadline for their completion. The Quartet also called on both sides to ""to refrain from provocative actions,"" a veiled reference to Israeli settlement building in land Israel occupied after 1967. Shtayyeh called Israel's move "" a slap in the face of the Quartet and the whole international community, which is saying 'stop settlements.' "" In an interview with the daily Jerusalem Post, Netanyahu defended Israel's right to build in Jerusalem. ""We plan in Jerusalem, we build in Jerusalem. Period. The same way Israeli governments have been doing for years."" As for possible U.S. government criticism of the move, Netanyahu declared that the Americans ""know this -- they have followed this a long time. There is really nothing new."" In the interview, Netanyahu also said Israel would not initiate another settlement freeze to get talks started again. ""We already gave at the office,"" he said, referring to a 10-month freeze enacted by his government last year. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is expected to convene a PLO leadership meeting Thursday to discuss the Quartet proposal for the resumption of talks, but Netanyahu's comments and the announcement of Israeli construction on land that Palestinians maintain should form part of their future state is bound to further widen the large gap between the two sides. Abbas has said repeatedly that the Palestinians will not return to negotiations until Israel halted all settlement construction and accepted 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks. Israel, for its part, has maintained that negotiations should begin with no pre-conditions.","NEW: The United States calls the Israeli move disappointing .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Ten people were killed Monday in a suicide bombing outside a U.N. compound in Kandahar, Afghanistan, officials said. Three employees working for the U.N. Refugee Agency were killed in the attack, as well as two Afghan civilians and an Afghan National Police officer, according to officials. In addition, four assailants were killed, according to a press release from the local Kandahar government. Five others were injured, Afghan officials said. The attack began when a truck full of explosives blew up near the U.N. compound, according to the government release. The massive blast, which shattered the windows of buildings surrounding the compound, was followed by an hours-long gunbattle with police, who prevented the insurgents from breaching the compound. The U.N. Refugee Agency is ""seeking a fuller understanding of the circumstances of today's attack. Nevertheless the fact remains that people working for us have been wounded and killed and the functioning of our Kandahar office seriously disrupted,"" according to a statement from the group. Gen. Hamid Wardag, a local commander of the Afghan National Army, attributed the attack to the Taliban. ""This is a tragedy for UNHCR and for the families of the dead and wounded,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""It also underscores the great risks for humanitarian workers in Afghanistan."" The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also expressed its condolences to the families of the victims. Kandahar province has seen a rash of recent violence. On Thursday, insurgents launched attacks on a Provincial Reconstruction Team base and a military outpost, Afghan and NATO officials said. Insurgents fired small guns and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) toward the Provincial Reconstruction Team, said Agha Lali, a member of the Kandahar provincial council. Officials killed two of the attackers, according to a regional police chief. And on October 22, three U.S. service members were killed when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A child cries from hunger, but no tears come from her swollen eyes. A Zimbabwean family bury their relative, who died of cholera, 25km from Harare, Zimbabwe. Malnutrition has left this baby born in Zimbabwe fighting for her life. She is the face of an unfolding crisis in a country once known as Africa's bread basket. Today a loaf of bread costs $35 million worthless Zimbabwean dollars, and people are forced to sift through garbage piles for any morsel of food. Others huddle for warmth around a fire burning inside the shell of a broken-down van. All of these images were captured on video recently smuggled out of Zimbabwe by Solidarity Peace Trust, a South African human rights group.  Watch the disturbing images » . Zimbabwe's government maintains that the situation is being exaggerated by the West in an effort to exert pressure on President Robert Mugabe to leave office. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the desperate situation has triggered a widening cholera outbreak that has killed 775 people and infected more than 15,000. ""You have to eat in the same place you sleep right next to the buckets, the same buckets that we used as toilets,"" one cholera patient says on the video. ""There is no water to bathe."" And little to eat. Women foraging for food in the bush find dry branches with only a few berries. ""This packet of juice will be my supper tonight,"" one woman says. Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai -- who is still trying to form a unity government with Mugabe under a recent power-sharing deal -- said the situation can only be addressed once a ""legitimate government"" is in place. ""Once there is a legitimate government, it is up to that government to deal with the problems the country is facing, which are quite wide-ranging,"" Tsvangirai told CNN on Wednesday. ""But the immediate intervention of the health crisis has exacerbated the situation to the extent that it has now become an international crisis."" The WHO says the current cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has a high fatality rate because sufferers are either not able to reach health centers in time or that the health centers lack the capacity to treat the cases. ""The epidemic is clearly on the increase,"" Dr. Eric Laroche, a WHO official in Harare, told CNN on Wednesday. ""I think it's going to last for several months."" In addition to the WHO, the Red Cross has responded to the outbreak and is sending staff and medical supplies into Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's main hospitals have all but shut down and the small clinics equipped by international aid organizations are overcrowded and unable to cope with the thousands of cholera patients. Health workers inside Zimbabwe believe scores are dying at home. Laroche said the WHO is receiving cooperation from the government, but the health care system is abysmal. ""The quality of the care, the supplies that come inside Zimbabwe, also need to be restored,"" Laroche said. ""So there's a lot of work to do, because the health system is collapsing for the time being."" One Zimbabwean health care worker, who would not show his face on the video, said he fears the death toll will skyrocket. ""People are dying even at the health institution,"" he said. ""It's beyond control. We are going to witness so many deaths in the coming weeks."" He expressed frustration that so many people are dying from cholera, a disease that ""is both preventable and curable."" ""Nobody should die from cholera,"" he said. ""We are quite unfortunate."" Zimbabwe, already experiencing an economic crisis, was struck with the raging water-borne cholera in August. Health experts say the battle against the disease can only be won if Harare has adequate water-treating chemicals and disposes of refuse properly. Zimbabwe's information minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu said Tuesday that the country has enough chemicals to purify water and enough money to buy pipes to mend sanitation lines. He maintained that the outbreak is under control, blaming the West for causing the crisis as an excuse for military intervention. International leaders -- including U.S. President George W. Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Kenyan premier Raila Odinga -- have recently called for Mugabe to step down for failing to contain the cholera outbreak. Frustration inside Zimbabwe is building. Last week, doctors and nurses protested over the lack of medical supplies and other resources at the country's hospitals. Labor unions have protested over the deteriorating economy. Even soldiers once shielded from economic hardships by the Mugabe regime went on a rampage last week when they were unable to access wages from the country's banks. Human rights activist Elinor Sisulu, who has lived and worked in Zimbabwe and now coordinates civil action outside the country, called on African leaders to demand Mugabe step down before Zimbabwe explodes. ""In any population where you have high levels of desperation, anger and ... people arrive at the conclusion that we've tried a peaceful political process and this is not working, then anything can happen,"" she said. -- CNN's Nkepile Mabuse in Johannesburg, South Africa contributed to this report.","WHO: Nearly 775 people have died in Zimbabwe from cholera outbreak .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of a multi-state outbreak of listeriosis linked to bacteria-tainted cantaloupe, authorities assured the public that cantaloupe grown in places other than Colorado's Jensen Farms is safe. But if in doubt about a fruit's origin, they said, it's best to throw it out. The outbreak -- blamed on the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes -- was first reported September 12. As of Wednesday, it had grown to 72 cases in 18 states and had killed 13 people, officials with the Centers for Disease Control said. The number of cases is expected to rise, as it can take one to three weeks for a person who ingests the bacteria to show symptoms. All of the tainted cantaloupes were grown at Jensen Farms in Granada, Colorado, although they were shipped to 17 states -- Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Utah, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, New Mexico, North Carolina, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. ""It's important to know that if you know the cantaloupe that you have is not Jensen Farms, then it's OK to eat,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. ""But if you're in doubt, then throw it out."" The recalled cantaloupes may bear a green-and-white sticker that says, ""Product of USA-Frontera Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe,"" or a gray, yellow and green sticker that says, ""Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords."" But not all cantaloupes may have a sticker, Frieden said. Consumers are urged to ask the supermarket or supplier if they know where the cantaloupes came from. If the cantaloupe's origins remain unconfirmed, it should be disposed of, he said. However, the likelihood of tainted cantaloupes in the nation's food supply is decreasing, thanks to the fruit's short shelf life -- about two weeks, officials said. The recalled cantaloupes were shipped from July 29 through September 10, ""so we really are nearing the end of the shelf life of the product in addition to its recalled product,"" Sherri McGarry, a senior adviser with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), told reporters. The recall itself should be removing the cantaloupes from shelves, she said, but the shelf life means the tainted cantaloupes will not be edible much longer. ""But consumers do have their own practices so we need to be cognizant some folks may hold that a little bit longer than we might expect,"" she said. If consumers do have a cantaloupe from Jensen Farms, authorities recommend they don't try to wash off the bacteria. ""We want you to throw that product away,"" McGarry said. The fruits should be disposed of in a closed plastic bag and placed in a sealed trash can, to prevent people or animals from eating them, the CDC said. Refrigeration will not kill the Listeria bacteria, which can grow even at low temperatures, officials said. And the longer a contaminated food is stored in the refrigerator, the more opportunity the bacteria has to grow. ""It is very important that consumers clean their refrigerators and other food preparation surfaces"" in order to minimize risk, the FDA says on its website. After washing refrigerators, cutting boards and countertops, the agency recommends sanitizing them with a solution of one tablespoon chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water and drying them with a paper towel or cloth that has not been previously used. Jensen Farms has now ended its cantaloupe harvest for the season, so no new contaminated fruit will be entering the market, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said Wednesday. Although Jensen Farms does produce other products, there is no concern for any other product from the company, McGarry said. Listeriosis causes fever, muscle aches, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It rarely is a serious concern for healthy children and adults, the CDC said, but can be dangerous for older adults or those with weakened immune systems. It can be treated with antibiotics. The source of the outbreak -- the deadliest U.S. outbreak of a food-borne illness since 1998 -- remained under investigation. Officials could not give a figure Wednesday for the number of cantaloupes recalled.","Health officials say the only contaminated fruit is from Jensen Farms .
If consumers don't know where a melon came from, they can ask the store .
If there is any doubt about a cantaloupe's origin, it should be thrown out, officials say .

"(CNN) -- A double strike from Welsh winger Gareth Bale helped Tottenham to a 3-1 English Premier League win over QPR on Sunday, a result that lifts them up to fifth place in the table and keeps their unbeaten run going. Dutchman Rafael Van der Vaart was also on target for Harry Redknapp's side, who have not lost in 11 matches since their 5-1 home defeat by Manchester City back in August. Bale put the home side ahead in the 19th minute when he fired home an angled drive after a long ball from the back was headed on by Emmanuel Adebayor. And a rampant Tottenham doubled their advantage 13 minutes later when Van der Vaart picked up a mis-hit shot from Ledley King to place the ball inside the far post. QPR fought back after the break and halved the arrears on the hour mark when Jay Bothroyd nodded home from close range. But Tottenham sealed their victory with a superb goal 18 minutes from time, with Aaron Lennon and Bale exchanging a series of passes outside the box before Bale curled home a shot that gave keeper Paddy Kenny no chance. Manchester City still blaze a trail at the top of the table, with nine wins and a draw from 10 matches. They lie on 28 points, five clear of rivals Manchester United. Chelsea, Newcastle and Tottenham are all level on 19 points but Chelsea have played a game more and unbeaten Newcastle will move up to third position if they get at least a draw against Stoke on Monday night. Meanwhile, in Sunday's two German Bundesliga matches, Lukas Podolski netted twice in a 3-0 win over 10-man Augsburg. Poland midfielder Slawomir Peszko added a third for the home side, while the visitors had Torsten Oehrl sent off for a dangerous tacle with 14 minutes remaining. The win moves Cologne up to 11th place in the table with five wins and five defeats, but Augsburg are second bottom with just one win and eight points. Hamburg are just one point and one place above Augsburg after they drew 1-1 with Kaiserslautern on Sunday. The home side had Slobodan Rajkovic sent off in the 21st minute for elbowing Kaiserslautern captain Christian Tiffert and the visitors went ahead seven minutes before half-time through Pierre De Wit. But Peru striker Jose Paolo Guerrero levelled for the hosts in the second-half, although the point was enough to lift Kaiserslautern up a place to 13th in the table.","Welshman Gareth Bale scores twice as Tottenham defeat QPR 3-1 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The first recorded use of the phrase ""protest march"" was in 1913 to describe a demonstration organized by Mohandas Gandhi against the South African government's restrictions on Indian nationals. After Gandhi was arrested and the protests grew more heated in response, the South African government labeled the gatherings ""riots."" Ever since, impassioned groups of politically similarly situated people have been called either protesters or rioters. Which phrase you choose mainly depends on where your own political sympathies lie. This weekend, after protesters involved in the Occupy Wall Street actions were arrested by police, the New York Post called the demonstration a ""near riot"" while Salon said the occupation involved mostly ""beds, kitchens, peaceful barricades"" I'm not going to weigh in the relative merits of the Occupy Wall Street protests. Suffice it to say I'm sympathetic with their critique that our economy and political system is too beholden to the interests of Wall Street, overlooking or even abusing the middle class and the poor. In fact, polls show that more than two-thirds of Americans think major corporations, banks and financial institutions have too much power in our society. Yet I imagine there are some fed-up Americans nonetheless scratching their heads as to why a bunch of their fellow citizens are camped out in our nation's financial headquarters in New York. Sure we have problems. But we have a democracy. We get to vote. That's our power, right? Unfortunately, that's not always enough. We know the corporate lobbyists hold disproportionate sway over our elected officials compared with we, the people. For instance, members of the congressional supercommittee charged with reaching a bipartisan deficit reduction solution have received $41 million from the financial sector during their time in Congress. According to a new report by Public Campaign and National People's Action, at least 27 current or former aides to supercommittee members have worked as lobbyists for financial sector interests. Unfortunately, these dynamics affect both political parties. During his first presidential run, Barack Obama received more campaign donations from employees of investment banks and hedge funds than any other industry. Throughout the rest of the world, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, ordinary people are rising up together to protest impenetrable and unjust political regimes. Many of these protests are peaceful. Sadly, some are not. But if you look at people's movements in places like Libya and Syria and think they are justified because those nations have entrenched, totalitarian regimes, think again. America's financial and business titans may not use tanks and torture, but their power is nonetheless extraordinary and dangerous. If the blatant injustice and inequality of the Arab world seems a million miles away, note that according to the CIA, income inequality in the United States is greater than in Yemen. Frederick Douglass once said, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand."" Douglass knew of what he spoke. Because black people and poor whites weren't even allowed to vote in the early days of our Union, slavery could only be ended through protest. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, black and white Americans launched protests and outright revolts against the system of slavery. Many of those protests were peaceful. Sadly, some were not. But looking back, we don't condemn Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner and John Brown for their ""riots"" -- just as most Americans don't condemn the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Ella Baker, even though at the time, all these great heroes were attacked and tarnished for their protests. What is brave and noble through the distance of history can often seem disorderly and disruptive in the present. Think of the Boston Tea Party, which helped spark the American Revolution. The nervous British ruling class denounced it as a riot. And yes, that protest ultimately turned very violent. I do not condone violence. I believe in the power of protests to confront the ugliness of inequality and injustice with the beauty of people peacefully coming together and simply but strongly demanding change. Then again, I understand that when people are angry, it's hard to be quiet. In La Puente, California, Rose Mary Gudiel is facing foreclosure and ejection from her home after falling on hard times. Gudiel is staying in her home until she, her brother and her elderly parents are forcibly removed by One West, the bank to which she has repeatedly appealed for lenience. Gudiel is actively resisting the orders of police and government officials. Is that violence? Will it be violent when the bank and cops remove her? Where do we draw the line? The grandfather of protest -- or riots, depending on your perspective -- Gandhi deeply deplored violence. But Gandhi also said, ""It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence."" Indeed, people in the United States and across the globe are feeling increasingly impotent in the face of the growing power and wealth of Wall Street, dimming the rest of our prospects for a prosperous future. In the face of such injustice, I don't wonder why people protest. I wonder why more people don't join them. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","Sally Kohn: ""Occupy Wall Street"" is part of American tradition of protest .

"(CNN) -- Why does French dressmaker Chanel always seem chic? What does British seamstress Vivienne Westwood have that others don't? And even though it's been 25 years since ""Top Gun"", why does everybody still want a pair of Ray Bans? The short answer is, they're just really cool. It might be a subjective concept -- one man's cool Hawaiian party shirt is another's discarded Christmas gift -- but certain brands do seem to stay in fashion forever. It's a phenomenon highlighted by the UK's annual top 20 ""Cool Brands"" list released today. Top of the pile is Aston Martin, James Bond's car-maker of choice, followed by Apple and motorbike designer Harley Davidson. But numerous fashion labels make it onto the list, with Rolex highest among them at number four, followed by Nike, British designer Alexander McQueen and perennially cool Ray Ban sunglasses. Why denim never fades from fashion . So, how did these brands manage to acquire this ineffable quality -- at least in the eyes of the Brits? We ask chief executive of the Centre for Brand Analysis and ""CoolBrand"" council chairman Stephen Cheliotis for his six rules of cool. 1. Style is everything . From the door handles to the website and the tags on the clothes to marketing events: If people are to be persuaded a brand is the height of cool, the devil is in the detail, says Cheliotis. ""It's not just about making your clothes look good,"" he insists. ""Absolutely everything associated with the brand has to exude style -- from the packaging to the company website, to the type-face on the inside label."" 2. Never try too hard . No one likes a busybody and, says Cheliotis, even the word ""cool"" suggests a certain relaxed approach. ""The original idea of being cool is being laid back, not running around like a headless chicken trying desperately hard to please everyone."" This, he says, is true for people and fashion brands alike. So, if it feels like a brand is trying way too hard to impress -- chasing every trend going, for example -- then it probably won't. Celebrity fashion labels: The good, the bad and the ugly . 3. Stay true to the brand . It's not cool to fake it. In other words, if a company began life selling pretty knitwear, it should think very carefully before venturing into, say, leather jackets. ""You must always remain true to your roots,"" instructs Cheliotis. ""Shoppers want something authentic and it's obvious when you're out of your comfort zone."" Designer Alexander McQueen may have recently passed away, he adds, but it doesn't mean that his eponymous label should be tempted to change its style. ""As long as it (the label) sticks to his original vision it will probably stay on the list."" 4) Keep evolving . This might sound at odds with the previous rule but, according to Cheliotis, it's certainly not. ""One of the reasons we keep seeing the same brands on the list, like Nike and Rolex, is because they're always innovative, but at the same time they retain their core identity."" 5) Don't be promiscuous . Some fashion houses squander their hard fought cool rep by plastering a company logo on everything that moves. In Cheliotis' view, bootmaker Dr. Martens have been guilty in recent years of such profligacy. ""They were known for making really sturdy, simple and good quality footwear. Now they've plastered their name on everything, it's cheapened the brand and undermined their core product."" 6) Be humble . A stark word of warning for self-satisfied designers everywhere. ""Successful brands don't fixate over being cool, instead they just do their own their own thing, stick to their founding principles and follow what they think is right,"" says Cheliotis. In other words, if you think you're cool, you probably won't be for much longer.","Top ""Cool Brands"" list has been released, includes seven fashion labels .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a major blow to the Republican leadership, the U.S. House on Wednesday defeated a temporary spending measure that would have required spending cuts to offset additional money for federal disaster relief efforts. The vote was 195-230, with 48 Republicans joining all but a handful of minority Democrats in opposing the short-term spending plan that would keep the government funded for seven weeks after the end of the fiscal year on September 30. After the result, House Republican leaders met in Speaker John Boehner's office to decide if they would revise the measure and hold another vote on Thursday. Options under consideration included removing or changing the spending offsets opposed by Democrats, or reducing the total amount of spending to appease conservative Republicans. At issue was a short-term bill to fund government agencies through November 18 that would allocate fewer resources to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers for disaster response than the Democratic-led Senate approved last week. Additional funds are needed because of recent major floods from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee along the East Coast, and wildfires in Texas that required emergency responses exceeding the amount the agencies have left in their coffers to support recovery and rebuilding efforts. The House measure included a total of $3.6 billion in disaster relief money -- $1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year that begins October 1. In addition, House Republican leaders are insisting that the $1 billion in immediate disaster funding be offset with $1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel-efficient cars. Democrats objected to cutting spending for disaster funding, calling it unprecedented and politicizing emergency relief for Americans. Conservative Republicans, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, argued that the nation's expanding deficits require as much spending restraint as possible. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama asked Congress for a total of $5.1 billion in additional disaster aid --- $500 million of which was for immediate relief. Last week, the Senate bill that passed with bipartisan support included $6.9 billion for FEMA and other federal agencies for immediate disaster relief and for relief in 2012. The Senate version required no spending offsets. The impasse could leave the government without funding after September 30 if Congress fails to authorize further spending, which would cause a partial shutdown. Cantor, however, said no shutdown would occur. ""Suffice it to say there's not going to be a shutdown,"" Cantor told reporters. ""I think everybody needs to relax. We're trying to affect change in a way that we spend taxpayer dollars - that's what this whole thing is about. No one is denying anyone disaster aid if they need it, and we're trying to be responsible and to do the right thing."" Meanwhile, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, said his party would support the measure if the offset provision was removed. ""They put something in that was clearly, we think, a job killer,"" Hoyer said of the offset that would eliminate the loan program for manufacturing fuel-efficient vehicles. During floor debate on the measure, Hoyer and other Democrats complained that any kind of offset would be unprecedented for emergency funding to help Americans in need. ""Even if they had the best offset in the world, I still think it's wrong"" to require equivalent spending cuts when getting money to disaster victims, said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. To Hoyer, the defeat of the GOP measure ""says that we are continuing to struggle to do things in a bipartisan fashion."" If House Republicans ""expect our votes, they have to work with us,"" he said. ""They can't just give us something and say ... their way or the highway."" -- CNN's Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh, Kate Bolduan and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Remove the offset and Democrats will support it, Rep.

"Duncan, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Justin Boyles lay in bed, exhausted and depressed. His 385-pound body sank into the mattress with each breath he took. I have diabetes, he thought in disbelief. His 6-year-old daughter, Autumn, crawled on top of the king-sized comforter and stared at him with bright blue eyes. ""Daddy, will you get up and play?"" ""No, baby, I'm tired."" She sat back to think. Her mom had tried to explain why Justin was so sad, but Autumn didn't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications. ""Daddy, are you ever going to be healthy enough to ride a bike with me?"" The question broke Justin's heart. Tears started to roll down his face. ""Yes, very soon. I promise,"" he said. ""Do you pinky promise?"" she asked, holding out her tiny finger. Justin looped his last digit around hers and made the decision to change his life. All kinds of excuses . Shanon and Justin Boyles were high school sweethearts. The first time they hung out at 16, Justin took Shanon to church. He was smart, polite and made her laugh -- three qualities that helped Shanon overlook his size. ""As long as I can remember, I've been overweight,"" Justin says. ""I remember as a child coming home after school and having a stack of cookies and a giant glass of milk every day."" In high school Justin weighed close to 250 pounds; he was considered obese even at 6 feet 1. As an adult he lived on fast food and spent most of his nights as a security guard sitting down. He'd eat dinner at work -- frozen burritos, burgers and fries -- then stop off at Taco Bell on the way home for the advertised fourth meal. ""I was really kind of in my own little hole, and I didn't want to get out or do anything,"" he says. Shanon became worried. Any time their extended family tried to get together for a birthday party or holiday, Justin refused to go. ""He would have all kinds of excuses,"" she says. ""He was really depressed. He was down on himself real bad."" Most concerning was his lack of time with Autumn, who got upset when her father wouldn't play outside. ""She loves him. He's her hero,"" Shanon says. ""I [knew] why he was feeling that way... but there was nothing I could do about it."" Small steps for a big change . Since his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes in March -- and his pinky promise to Autumn -- Justin has lost more than 65 pounds. He walks around his neighborhood whenever he can and makes sure to do the little things like taking the stairs and returning his shopping cart. The family is also eating better with more vegetables, leaner meats and less sugar. For example, at dinner Justin usually eats a spinach leaf salad with tuna or baked chicken with broccoli. Shanon joins in; she's lost 20 pounds in less than six months on the new diet. The family recently took a trip to the Oklahoma State Fair and walked around all day, something they never would have done last year. ""I no longer lay in bed thinking that my weight is just too much to overcome,"" Justin says. ""I enjoy being out with family and friends and having a good time."" He only weighs in once a month to avoid becoming obsessed with the numbers on the scale. He hopes to get down to 200 pounds, a weight at which his doctor said he would probably be able to go off his medications. ""I just want him to be healthy and happy. I don't care what weight he's at,"" Shanon says. The couple raised more than $7,500 for the American Diabetes Association's ""Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes"" in Oklahoma City on September 14. Their team wore matching black T-shirts with a new slogan: ""Do you pinky promise?"" On his website Justin has included a section where he asks readers to make their own promises -- to themselves or to their family -- to get healthy. ""[Autumn] taught me that you can do anything you put your mind to,"" he says. ""It doesn't take a big giant step.It takes doing a little something."" Justin still has a long way to go in his weight loss journey. But rest assured that he'll keep going -- you just don't break a pinky promise, especially one made to your little girl.

"(CNN) -- A Texas Rangers fan who fell over a railing while trying to catch a ball will have a place at Rangers Ballpark next season after the team erects a statue in his memory. Shannon Stone, a 39-year-old firefighter from Brownwood, Texas, fell to his death July 7. His 6-year-old son Cooper witnessed the accident. ""The statue, which is tentatively to be named Rangers Fans, is expected to be in place for the 2012 season,"" the Texas Rangers announced in a statement Monday. It will depict Stone and his son attending a Rangers game. ""The full-size bronze statue is likely to be located outside the home plate gate of Rangers Ballpark in Arlington,"" the Rangers said. The tragedy took place in the second inning of the ill-fated game. Star outfielder Josh Hamilton tossed a souvenir ball into the stands after a batter hit a foul ball. Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats. He fell about 20 feet and crashed head-first into an area near a scoreboard. Stone died of blunt-force trauma, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner. Rangers President Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, has said the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they already exceeded the city's code limits. The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation. Donated money has been earmarked to help the Stone family. The Rangers have donated an undisclosed sum, according to the team's website. Stone's widow, Jenny, said she appreciates Ryan and the Rangers during the family's time of loss. ""Shannon and Cooper had a special relationship, and we are touched and grateful that it will be memorialized at one of their favorite places,"" she said in the statement. ""Our hope is that this statue will not be a symbol of our family tragedy but rather a reminder of the importance of a family's love -- love of each other, love of spending time together, and love of the game.""

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Ophelia got even more powerful Friday night as it churned across the Atlantic toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center reported. A tropical storm watch was in effect for that mid-Atlantic island, but Ophelia's increasingly northerly path suggests it won't directly threaten the coastal United States. The system was disorganized and seemed to be weakening last week. But it has gained steam in recent days and earlier Friday was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane. According to the center's 8 p.m. update, Ophelia had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, which is 5 mph stronger than those recorded three hours earlier. Its center was located 480 miles south-southeast of Bermuda. Ophelia has also gotten faster, increasing in speed 4 mph as it heads north at around 16 mph. With an expected turn more to the north-northeast, the storm is expected to strike the eastern part of Bermuda late Saturday, reports the hurricane center. The Miami-based forecasters said that there could be fluctuations in Ophelia's intensity over the next 12 to 24 hours, followed by a gradual weakening. Hurricane-force winds extended about 30 miles from the storm's eye, center said. Tropical storm-force winds, which are winds between 39 mph and 73 mph, have been recorded 175 miles away. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Philippe has strengthened somewhat as it spins farther east in the Atlantic, with its eye some 1,100 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands as of 5 p.m. Friday. As of that update, its sustained winds were 50 mph, which is slightly stronger than the previous update. The hurricane center predicted ""some weakening"" over the next 48 hours, during which it was set to turn more toward the west-northwest.","NEW: Ophelia now has maximum sustained winds of 120 mph .

Mara Buxbaum, a rep for Penn, confirmed the Reuters report but declined to provide additional details. Venezuelan state media reported Friday that Chavez was part of the mediation process that resulted in the release of Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer on Wednesday. Upon their release, the men were flown to Muscat, Oman, where their families greeted them with elation. ""We're so happy we are free and so relieved we are free,"" Fattal said. ""Our deepest gratitude goes toward His Majesty Sultan Qaboos of Oman for obtaining our release. We're sincerely grateful for the government of Oman for hosting us and our families.""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A car bomber who penetrated Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone this week was targeting the Iraqi prime minister, authorities said Saturday. The attack Monday left two people dead and seven others injured in the Green Zone, which houses the nation's government offices as well as U.S. and other embassies. Police said the blast occurred at an outdoor parking lot that belongs to the Iraqi parliament. No more details were available immediately on whether lawmakers were among the casualties. Initial inquiries revealed an attempt to kill Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, according to Major Gen. Qassim Atta, the Baghdad security operations manager. The black car was loaded with explosives and had three ways to detonate: manual, electric and by cell phone, he said. ""The intelligence information we have indicates that the vehicle was supposed to enter the building and park there until the arrival of the prime minister,"" Atta said. Terrorists confessed that the car bomb was targeting the prime minister when he visits parliament in an upcoming session, according to Atta, who did not name the group behind the attacks. The prime minister was not there at the time of the attack, he said. The attacker was in a black Dodge with 20 kg (44 lb) of explosives, and was driving toward parliament when security forces stopped him because he did not have a proper badge. The driver parked at the parliament compound, where the car exploded. The attack comes amid a U.S. military withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country. All American troops are scheduled to be out by the end of the year. Iraqi security forces, including army and police officers, are to assume full responsibility after the withdrawal.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A typhoon that killed at least 39 people in the Philippines made landfall in southern China on Thursday. Chinese authorities evacuated 300,000 people as they prepared for the effects of Typhoon Nesat, a disaster-response agency reported. It is the strongest typhoon to hit China this year, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Nesat made landfall in southern China's Hainan province, bringing strong winds and rain to Wengitan Township and nearby areas, Xinhua reported. In addition to evacuations, authorities in southern China recalled ships and suspended scheduled flights and ferry trips as they steeled for the typhoon's effect, the news agency reported. The death toll from the storm in the Philippines, meanwhile, has increased. The storm killed 39 people, injured 43 others and left 31 missing, according to the most recent figures from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Nesat -- referred to in the Philippines as Pedring -- displaced thousands in the archipelago nation, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. A baby boy was among the dead when the typhoon slammed into the Philippines on Tuesday, authorities said. The storm struck the agricultural provinces of Isabela and Aurora the hardest. But storm alerts were also issued for more than 40 other areas, including metro Manila, the state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said. Nearly 680,000 people were affected by the typhoon in 31 provinces, the disaster council said. More than 120 people were rescued across the country, the council said, many of them from boats. Some roads around Manila were impassable due to flooding and falling debris, including branches that had been ripped off trees. Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi has been hailed as the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen following his extraordinary exploits for European champions Barcelona. The 22-year-old has scored 10 goals in his past four games, including two hat-tricks in consecutive Spanish league matches. The diminutive Argentina forward has kept Barcelona in the hunt for a second successive La Liga title, and his two goals against Stuttgart last Wednesday helped put the Champions League titleholders into the quarterfinals of Europe's premier club competition. Blog: Is Messi better than Maradona? Sunday's treble against Zaragoza was his third this season, and his fifth since making his debut in 2004, taking him to 25 league goals this campaign -- five more than closest rival Gonzalo Higuain of Real Madrid, and two past his tally from last season with 11 games still to play. Messi is now third on Barcelona's all-time scoring list, and has the chance to net his 200th goal for the club in Wednesday's league game against Osasuna. After the Zaragoza game, Barcelona president Joan Laporta compared Messi -- who was named 2009's best player in the world -- with the club's legendary former stars Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff. ""He's the best player in the world right now and the best ever,"" Laporta told Barcelona's Web site. ""Together with Cruyff and Maradona, he's the best we've seen at the club. ""He's a player who can change everything in a game, but he also works for the rest of the team. He's a real leader."" Coach Pep Guardiola said he had run out of superlatives to describe the performances of Messi, who has scored 11 of Barcelona's last 15 goals. ""He's been more than decisive, and you can tell he's feeling fit the way he gets involved in everything. I've run out of adjectives -- you'll have to put your own,"" Guardiola said. ""That he's capable of doing everything that he does at his age is something impressive. It doesn't make any sense."" Guardiola revealed that Messi had been in doubt for the Zaragoza game due to a gum infection in his mouth. ""He was in a lot of pain. But in the morning I asked him how he was and he told me that he was better. Before the game I asked if he wanted to play and he said yes, I asked him how many minutes and he told me the whole game,"" Guardiola told reporters. ""He always wants to play, whether it's the Champions League final or against a third-division side. For me it's difficult to leave him out, seeing the form he's in. He's an amateur in this sense, he always wants to play."" Messi has not always carried his amazing club form onto the international stage with Argentina, but he has the chance to redress that situation in June at the World Cup in South Africa. ""The person who most wants to see him succeed for Argentina is Messi himself, nobody should doubt that,"" Guardiola said.","Barcelona president Joan Laporta says Lionel Messi is best player world has ever seen .

"(CNN) -- Hindered by painful stings and strong currents, endurance swimmer Diana Nyad ended her latest attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida about two-thirds of the way through the crossing Sunday. The 62-year-old Nyad suffered jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war stings Saturday, while ocean cross-currents were pushing her off course, team captain Mark Sollinger said. She was pulled out of the water about 11 a.m. Sunday, about 67 nautical miles through the 103-nautical-mile passage. Treading water before being helped out of the water, Nyad said the man-of-war stings had paralyzed some of the muscles in her back, given her chills and nausea. Doctors warned her she could suffer long-term health problems if she suffered another sting. ""I've never been in any pain, ever, like that in my whole life,"" she said, adding, ""Now it's set me so far back, I just don't' have the lung capacity to swim the way I can."" It was her third attempt to make the swim from Cuba to Florida. Her first, in 1978, was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water. She made a second try in August, before she was pulled from the water after 60 miles and almost 29 hours of swimming. She blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey, and an 11-hour-long asthma attack. Her latest attempt, accompanied by shark divers, began just after 6 p.m. Friday from Havana's Hemingway Marina. The former world champion swimmer projected the swim would take close to 60 hours. There was a bit of excitement early Saturday afternoon as an oceanic whitetip shark swam near Nyad, but a diver on her team faced it off and it meandered away. The swimmer improved her performance late Saturday morning after struggling to maintain her usual stroke rate, her support team said. Fortified by chicken soup, Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident. Nyad got back in the water at 12:20 a.m. Sunday and swam for nearly 11 hours before packing it in. ""But for each of us, isn't life about determining your own finish line?"" she said in a statement on her website. ""This journey has always been about reaching your own other shore no matter what it is, and that dream continues.""

"(Health.com) -- People with depression are more likely to have a stroke than their mentally healthy peers, and their strokes are more likely to be fatal, according to a new analysis published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Depression is a relatively minor risk factor for stroke compared to high blood pressure (hypertension) and other health conditions and behaviors that damage blood vessels, the researchers say. Still, their analysis suggests that as many as 4% of the estimated 795,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year can be attributed to depression. ""If you have depression but no other health issues, you probably don't have to pay too much attention to stroke risk,"" says An Pan, Ph.D., the lead author of the analysis and a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. ""But if you are depressed and are also obese, or have hypertension or...unhealthy lifestyle factors, your risk is going to increase dramatically."" Health.com: The 10 most depressing states in the U.S. Pan and his colleagues combined data from 28 studies dating back to the mid-1990s that included about 318,000 people overall. Roughly 2.7% of the participants had a stroke during the studies, which ranged in length from two to 29 years. Compared to those who showed no signs of depression, people who received a depression diagnosis from a doctor or who reported feeling depressed were 45% more likely to have a stroke and 55% more likely to die from a stroke, the researchers found. Depression increased the risk of ischemic stroke, in which a blood vessel becomes blocked and cannot send blood to the brain. But it did not measurably raise the risk of the other major type, hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel leaks or bursts open. Health.com: 12 signs of depression in men . The new study is the latest in a long line of research linking depression to chronic disease and serious physical health problems. ""We knew that depression raises a person's risk of developing diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,"" Pan says. ""We also knew that depression can occur after patients suffer a stroke. We just didn't have strong enough evidence to know if the reverse was true, or what really comes first."" Researchers have already established that depression increases the risk of heart attacks (and especially fatal ones), so it makes sense that depression would have a similar association with stroke, says Norman Rosenthal, M.D., a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, in Washington, D.C. ""Strokes and heart attacks both represent blood vessels becoming blocked and blood being withheld from a vital organ, whether it's the heart or the brain,"" says Rosenthal, who was not involved in the new study. ""They're essentially the same disease."" Health.com: Careers with high rates of depression . Depression could contribute to strokes in many ways, Pan says. For starters, people who are depressed are more likely to smoke or drink heavily, to follow an unhealthy diet, and to neglect their personal health. Most of the studies included in the analysis controlled for these and other risk factors, but the data suggests that at least some of the stroke risk in depressed people can be explained by an unhealthy lifestyle. There are other possibilities, as well, that aren't as easily measured. Depression can increase the production of stress hormones in the body, for instance, and can trigger dangerous inflammation in the blood vessels. ""Little things, like keeping up good dental hygiene or socializing with friends, all affect inflammation levels -- and these are things that a depressed person is less likely to do,"" says Rosenthal. Depression may also cause people to slack on taking medications needed to control other stroke-related conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. On the other hand, some medications prescribed for depression -- most notably the class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics -- have been shown to cause weight gain and obesity, a known risk factor for stroke. More research is needed to determine whether depression drugs contribute to stroke risk. Doctors should monitor weight gain and blood pressure levels in patients taking these drugs, but there's no reason for patients to stop taking them, Pan says.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain told supporters Saturday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, which has become hobbled in recent weeks by allegations of sexual harassment and an Atlanta woman's claim that they carried on a 13-year affair. While he will still be able to raise and spend campaign funds because he did not officially drop out, Cain's White House bid is effectively over. Cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife, his family and his supporters. Cain and his wife, Gloria, held hands as they walked up to the podium where Cain made his remarks in Atlanta. The crowd chanted, ""Gloria! Gloria!"" before the candidate spoke. Even as he stepped aside under the weight of the allegations that have dogged him, Cain said that he was at ""peace with my God"" and ""peace with my wife."" He repeatedly called the allegations ""false and untrue,"" and added that ""the (media) spin hurts."" ""I am not going to be silenced and I will not go away,"" Cain said, announcing what he called his Plan B: A website, TheCainSolutions.com, through which he will continue to advocate for his platform. His catchy ""9-9-9"" economic plan is not going anywhere, he said. ""Your support has been unwavering and undying,"" Cain told his supporters. He will endorse another of the Republican presidential hopefuls soon, he said. Other candidates were quick to react. ""Herman Cain provided an important voice to this process,"" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a statement. ""His ideas and energy generated tremendous enthusiasm for the conservative movement at a time it was so desperately needed to restore confidence in our country."" Fellow Georgian Newt Gingrich said the ""9-9-9"" plan ""got our country talking about the critical issue of how to reform our tax code and he elevated the dialogue of the Republican presidential primary in the process."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he knew the Cains made a ""difficult decision. He helped invigorate conservative voters and our nation with a discussion of major tax reform."" Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said Cain brought ""a unique and valuable voice to the debate over how to reform our country's uncompetitive tax code and turn around the economy. I understand his decision and wish him and his family the best."" Recently, Cain acknowledged that Ginger White's allegations of an affair have led to a drop in campaign contributions, and a Des Moines Register poll showed his support among likely Republican Iowa caucus-goers has fallen to 8%, down from 23% in October. The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.9 points, the newspaper said. Respondents said they were most concerned that Cain does not understand important issues, but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern, the newspaper said. This week, White told the news media that she and Cain engaged in an on-and-off affair for more than 13 years. She described the affair as ""very casual."" White issued a statement, through her attorney, after Cain's announcement Saturday. ""Ginger White respects Mr. Cain's decision regarding his campaign and indeed would have respected any decision he made,"" the statement said. ""That being said, she is disappointed that he has not apologized for the public statements he has made about her and other women who have spoken out."" In a fund-raising letter Tuesday night, Cain referred to White as ""troubled."" Two women -- Sharon Bialek and Karen Kraushaar -- previously accused Cain of sexually harassing them in the 1990s while he was head of the National Restaurant Association. Two other women also have said Cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association, but they have declined to be identified. Cain told the Union Leader in New Hampshire that he repeatedly gave White money to help her with ""month-to-month bills and expenses."" But he denied the relationship was sexual, as White contends. He said the two were friends. ""I send checks to a lot of people; I help a lot of people,"" Cain told Fox News on Thursday. ""That in itself is not proof. So the other allegation in terms of it being a 13-year physical relationship, that is her words against my word."" In the interview, Cain said his wife, knew nothing about White nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week. ""My wife now knows,"" he told the newspaper. ""My wife and I have talked about it, and I have explained it to her. My wife understands that I'm a soft-hearted, giving person."" Cain's announcement came a month before the Iowa caucuses, the first formal test of the primary season, scheduled for January 3. New Hampshire Republican officials who supported Cain began to survey their options Saturday, with several state representatives saying their support could go to Gingrich or Ron Paul. Cain's most prominent supporter in the state, former GOP state party chair Jack Kimball, said he would wait to learn who Cain would endorse before making his own decision. Cain told staffers earlier this week he was reassessing his campaign in the wake of White's allegation of an affair, and he acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that her account had led to a drop in contributions to his campaign. He said in the Thursday Union Leader interview that his wife's feelings, as well as the reaction from supporters and donors, would be important factors in deciding whether he will stay the race. Cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to, but quickly added that she wouldn't. Though Gloria Cain rarely makes public appearances or statements, she told Fox News last month that she believed the sexual harassment allegations were ""unfounded.""

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out Monday at ""the powers of arrogance,"" saying that both Sudan and Iran were subject to ""pressures"" from the West because of their political positions. ""They pressure Sudan and Iran; why? Because we stand against the powers of arrogance,"" Ahmadinejad said during a visit to Khartoum. Speaking to a crowd of cheering youths, students and supporters in Khartoum's Friendship Hall, Ahmadinejad criticized Europe and the United States for what he described as the ""stealing"" of Africa's wealth. ""They stole the riches of Africa,"" he said. ""Despite this wealth, we see poverty and deprivation."" Ahmadinejad arrived in Khartoum Monday morning on his way back to Iran after speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and after a brief stop in Mauritania. Western delegates walked out of his speech at the U.N.after he repeatedly condemned the United States and said some countries use the Holocaust as an ""excuse to pay ransom... to Zionists."" ""They don't want to see Sudan strong so they pressured it into a referendum,"" he said, in reference to the South Sudan referendum that led to the independence of South Sudan last July. ""Could there be a referendum in Europe, in the Basque (region of Spain) and other areas?"" he asked. ""I am sure if there was a neutral referendum in the U.S., some states would secede from the U.S.,"" he continued. ""The waves of consciences have started especially in the Muslim lands,"" he said, in reference to the popular revolutions that have sprung out in the Arab world. Earlier, Ahmadinejad and Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir met, along with a large team of ministers from both countries. ""We are looking for more economic cooperation with sisterly Iran,"" al-Bashir said in a meeting. ""We confirm our support for Iran's right to develop its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes,"" he added. In a joint statement by both governments, Iran stated that it was ""ready to transfer its experience in the science and manufacturing sectors, especially technical and engineering services, to improve Sudan's infrastructure.""","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visits Khartoum and speaks to supporters .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Score a personal best at the box office for Quentin Tarantino this weekend. ""Inglourious Basterds,"" his revisionist take on WWII starring Brad Pitt, grossed an estimated $37.6 million, besting the reigning box office champ ""District 9,"" and giving beleaguered studio The Weinstein Co. a little financial relief. ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a revisionist take on WWII starring Brad Pitt, grossed an estimated $37.6 million. ""Basterds'"" opening far surpasses Tarantino's previous best opener, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2,"" which brought in $25 million in April 2004. The critical question now is how ""Basterds"" will hold up during the next few weeks. Since Weinstein only has domestic rights to the movie -- Universal Pictures holds international -- a large overall gross stateside is mandatory for the company. Warner Bros. had a much harder time with its release ""Shorts"" from auteur Robert Rodriguez. Opening to only $6.6 million, the PG-rated kid flick landed in a weak 6th place finish for its opening frame. The only other new release to reach the top ten was Fox Searchlight's post-college flick ""Post Grad"" starring Alexis Bledel. Despite opening in 1,959 locations, the film grossed only an estimated $2.8 million for the three days. Among holdovers, ""District 9"" did incredibly well considering Basterds was angling directly for its male audience. The $30 million sci-fi movie from newcomer Neil Blomkamp dropped a scant 49% to $18.9 million putting its total ten day gross at an impressive $73 million. ""G.I. Joe"" also hung in for its third week in theaters. The high-octane actioner fell only 44 percent to $12.5 million. It's three-week cume now stands at $120 million. Female moviegoers helped keep ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" and ""Julie & Julia"" in the top five. ""Time Traveler"" dropped only 46 percent to $10 million its second week putting its ten-day gross at $37.4 million while ""Julie & Julia"" fell only 25 percent, which is remarkable considering the movie is in its third week of release. Grossing $9 million for the three days, the Meryl Streep, Amy Adams two-hander has now earned $59 million total. Thanks to the strong opening of ""Basterds"" and the solid hold of the incumbent films, the box office was up 26 percent compared to the same time last year. It's the third week in a row the box office was up after four weekends of unimpressive results. Next weekend's horror mash-up of ""Halloween II"" and ""The Final Destination 3-D"" should yield some positive results too. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court for the third time this year has stopped the pending capital punishment of a Texas inmate, giving lawyers for the man more time to file their appeals. The justices on Tuesday issued an order granting a stay of execution for Cleve Foster, about 2 1/2 hours before his scheduled lethal injection. The Gulf War veteran was convicted along with another man of the 2002 murder of Nyanuer ""Mary"" Pal, a Sudanese immigrant he met at a Fort Worth bar. The court indicated it would need more time to rule on the inmate's claims of prior ineffective assistance of counsel, and related claims of innocence of the murder. This is the third time Foster, 47, has been granted a high court reprieve. His previous scheduled execution was stopped in January and April, once after he had already been given his last meal. His April procedure was to be the state's first execution using a new sedative, the first in the lethal drug cocktail. A nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental forced corrections officials to announce they would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate that has alternately been used to put animals to sleep. Foster's lawyers had challenged that change, saying Texas foisted the new protocols so late, with little time for legal or medical review. The state has since executed several inmates with the new drug mixture, without noted complications. Foster has blamed his co-conspirator for the murder. His lawyers in their Supreme Court appeal presented letters from three fellow inmates who said co-defendant Sheldon Ward told them he acted alone in Pal's murder. The state countered Ward's statements to a psychologist implicating Foster as the mastermind behind the killing. They also said DNA from both men were found in the victim. Texas has a planned lethal injection Wednesday. Lawrence Brewer, 44, was one of two white men convicted in the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr., an African-American. That widely reported crime led to national movement to step up prosecutions and penalties for hate crimes. Brewer has no pending appeals. It would be the 11th execution this year in Texas, the most active death-penalty state. The current case is Foster v. Texas (11-6427).","Court grants Cleve Foster his third stay of execution .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have identified seven of the 10 people who died following a crash at an air show in Reno, Nevada, on Friday. The list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators. Seven people, including the pilot, were killed on the tarmac, while three others died at area hospitals. Almost 70 people were injured. The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the small World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determined what happened and why. NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it, this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said, parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. A preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.""","10 people died from the crash .

"(CNN) -- A partnership between NASA's Kennedy Space Center and Boeing will bring more than 100 jobs to Florida's Space Coast, the governor announced on Monday. ""Florida has five decades of leadership in the space industry, which makes our state the logical place for the next phase of space travel and exploration,"" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement. Boeing's plans include manufacturing and testing its Crew Space Transportation-100 spacecraft and locating its Commercial Crew program headquarters at Cape Canaveral. The move is expected to create 140 jobs in Florida by June 2013 and 550 by December 2015. Republican Rep. Sandy Adams called the announcement ""welcomed news"" as she recounted the devastating job losses her 24th Congressional District has suffered since the space shuttle program ended. It was a little more than a year ago that NASA laid off more than 1,200 workers, even after a bill that extended the retirement date of the shuttle program from February to July 2011. Thousands more, including shuttle workers and contractors, lost their jobs when the program ended. Despite the massive job losses, state and federal leaders have worked hard to preserve the history of the space center and produce new jobs that will secure economic growth for years to come. ""This marks the beginning of the vibrance of the economy of the Space Coast,"" Republican Rep. Bill Posey said. NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Beth Garver thanked the Obama administration and Congress for their support and called the agreement ""the latest sign of tangible progress"" as the space center transitions from a government-only facility to a commercial space port. The partnership is ""also part of a larger commitment on the part of NASA and the Obama administration to bring jobs and economic development to the Space Coast by building on all of Kennedy's world-class launch capabilities,"" Garver said. ""The Boeing Co. is helping lead the way in the next chapter of human spaceflight, and I am proud that they chose our community for their home,"" Adams said.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The lawyer trying to get two American hikers freed from prison in Iran was not able to get a signature on bail paperwork because a judge is on vacation until Tuesday, he told CNN Sunday. Bail has been paid for Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, lawyer Masoud Shafiee said, but he needs the signatures of two judges to prove it. He went to a judge's office Sunday, when he was in court on a separate case, to see if he could get the second signature, but was told that the judge is on vacation until Tuesday and that Shafiee will have to return then, the lawyer said. Separately, a delegation of American Muslim and Christian leaders asked Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to release the hikers, his office said Sunday. The four leaders who met with him in Tehran included Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a photo of the meeting showed. The head of the human rights department of the Iranian judiciary, Mohammad Javad Larijani, linked the case of Fattal and Bauer to America's treatment of detainees. ""If the U.S. is so sensitive about two of its spies and tries to free them, it should look at the way it treats other nationalities,"" he said in an interview Sunday with the semi-official Fars news agency. Fattal and Bauer have been held as spies for more than two years, after they apparently crossed an unmarked border between Iran and Iraq in July 2009. The two men and a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were seized while hiking in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Iranian authorities arrested them, claiming they were spies and had entered the country illegally. Shourd, who is Bauer's fiancee, was released last year for medical reasons, although authorities said her case remains open. Fattal and Bauer were convicted last month of spying and entering Iran illegally, and each was sentenced to eight years in prison. Ahmadinejad recently said they could be freed, raising hopes that have been dashed and raised again several times since then. He said in an interview with NBC's ""Today"" show that they will be released on humanitarian grounds ""in a couple of days."" But the judiciary shot back that only it could make decisions about their release. Shafiee then announced that all the paperwork had been filed for them to be freed on bail, but their release was delayed. He said he was ""very hopeful"" they would be released on Saturday, but the process is being held up by the lack of a judge's signature. Shafiee said he would not know for sure the amount of the bail or who paid it until he sees the signed document. Earlier reports put it at $500,000 for each American. An Omani official flew to Iran on Wednesday to help work on any negotiation, a Western diplomat told CNN at the time. Oman helped secure the release of Shourd, posting her bail last September, a senior Obama administration official said at the time. Ahmadinejad is slated to travel to New York for the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, the semi-official Mehr News Agency reported. He is expected to give a speech and meet with several other presidents and Iranians living in the United States. But his visit is not linked to moves to release the Americans, said Larijani of the Iranian judiciary. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","NEW: An Iranian official links the hikers' case to U.S. treatment of others .

"(CNN) -- Zainab Alhusni was a simple seamstress in Syria, well-loved by all her neighbors and friends. Now, in a tragic turn of events, she has become a symbol of the cruelty gripping that conflict-wracked nation. Alhusni was only 18 when she stepped away from her Homs residence last month to buy groceries. Her family never again saw her alive. She was whisked away by Syrian security forces to coax the surrender of her activist brother, and ended up beheaded and dismembered, a neighbor, activists and human rights groups say. Waleed Fares, a neighbor and family friend, told CNN on Monday that Zainab's father died when she was just a toddler, leaving her mother and three siblings to fend for themselves in a country with often-unfavorable conditions for a single mother. All four children dropped out of school at a young age so they could work as laborers to provide for their family, Fares said. Zainab dreamed of owning her own tailor shop, so she could support her impoverished family, he said. But she never had a chance to fulfill that dream. Her older brother, Mohammed, became a well-known activist in the family's hometown of Homs in western Syria, often leading the demonstrations against embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and treating the wounded. ""Protesters would carry Mohammed on their shoulders so he could lead the chants,"" Fares said. ""He was very loved by everyone. The protesters even had a chant they would say for him, using his nickname: 'Abu Ahmed, may Allah protect you!'"" Security forces pursued Mohammed Alhusni for months, raiding his family's home several times, causing the family to flee to a nearby neighborhood on July 25, Fares said. On July 27, Zainab Alhusni disappeared, leaving her family devastated and her siblings panicked and anxious, the neighbor said. ""If it had been her brother it would have been different. Taking Zainab, it became a matter of family honor and family pride. Her mother was beyond depressed. She seemed to be between life and death,"" Fares said. Neighbors and family friends called on each other to collect donations to ease the family's financial troubles, but this became the least of the Alhusni family's concerns. Several days after Zainab disappeared, security forces called the family and offered to meet them in a pro-Assad neighborhood where they would trade Zainab for her activist brother. ""The family did not trust the security forces. They would not even confirm to them that Zainab was alive, and they all believed it was a trap to take Mohammed, too,"" Fares said. On September 10, the family says, Mohammed was wounded in a demonstration. He came back to his loved ones a corpse. The family believes he was tortured to death. In a statement posted to YouTube, another brother, Yousif Alhusni, describes multiple gunshot wounds to Mohammed's chest and a single shot through his mouth. ""His arms were broken and there were cigarette burns to his face,"" he adds. The family went to collect Mohammed's body from a hospital when doctors told them another unclaimed body with the label ""Zainab Alhusni"" had been kept in the morgue's freezer for some time. When the family received the body, her head and arms had been chopped off. Chunks of her flesh were charred, appearing in places to have been melted or burned down to the bone. Authorities forced Zainab's mother to sign a document saying both her daughter and her son had been kidnapped and killed by an armed gang, Amnesty International said in an online statement . ""If it is confirmed that Zainab was in custody when she died, this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. The case also drew the antipathy of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which characterized the incident as ""appalling"" and an example of the ""targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces."" The ferocious Syrian government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-March when anti-government protests unfolded. The number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700, according to the U.N. human rights office. Some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000. Syrian authorities could not be reached for comment on the Alhusni case. The Syrian government has maintained armed gangs with foreign agendas, not the regime, are responsible for the violence that has plagued the Arab country for months. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims, or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria. ""Perhaps more than any other family they were chosen to be at the front lines of the Syrian revolution,"" Fares said of the Alhusni family. ""They were very poor, so they felt the brunt of the injustice more than any other family. For Mohammed at least, he felt he had nothing to lose."" The neighborhood where the family lived, Bab Alsibaa, held a rally for Zainab on Sunday, and people vowed the brutality that destroyed the Alhusni family could only strengthen their resolve. ""The case of Zainab Alhusni is not just for our town, or province, or even for the country of Syria. It is a human rights issue that should bring the attention of the world,"" Fares said. But despite Fares' insistence that ""after Zainab our chants are louder, our numbers greater,"" he admitted the people of Bab Alsibaa constantly worry about their female family members. ""Even stepping outside the home is a risk for women now,"" he said. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Syrian girl Zainab Alhusni dreamed of owning her own tailor shop, a neighbor says .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The last U.S. troops to occupy Camp Victory, once one of the largest and most high-profile American military bases in Iraq, left Friday afternoon as the Iraqi government assumed control of the sprawling complex near Baghdad's main airport. The United States signed over control of the base on Thursday and it became effective on Friday, Col. Barry Johnson, a U.S. Army spokesman said. No high-profile ceremony marked the transition, he said. The last group of service members stationed at Camp Victory began moving off-base around 12 p.m., he said. Within two hours, no U.S. troops remained, he said. The base -- formally known as Victory Base Complex -- once housed as many as 40,000 service members. It includes lavish palaces built by Saddam Hussein, some of which were used as barracks or dining facilities. Hussein, the country's leader until the U.S. invasion in 2003 deposed him, was among prisoners held in a maximum security prison on the base. The transition leaves the United States with five military bases in Iraq as it continues to draw down its forces there in preparation for a complete withdrawal by the end of the year. President Barack Obama ordered U.S. forces out of Iraq in October after the two countries were unable to reach an agreement on a continued presence of troops.","United States hands control of Camp Victory to Iraq .

"New York (CNN) -- Sgt. Dakota Meyer, the 23-year-old Marine who received the Medal of Honor earlier this month, wants to join another well-known outfit celebrated for bravery in the face of danger, the New York City Fire Department. Unfortunately, he missed the deadline to sign up, so he has to wait four more years. And when a federal judge agreed Monday to reopen the application window for one day to allow Meyer, and only Meyer, to apply, he said no, no special treatment. On September 15 Meyer met President Barack Obama and received the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House. Caught up in the bevy of activities surrounding the Medal of Honor ceremony, Meyer missed the deadline to apply to the FDNY, according to his attorney Keith Sullivan. ""The Fire Department would love to have him. Who wouldn't, whatever the organization?"" said Frank Dwyer, a spokesman for the FDNY. ""He's truly an example of what the military is all about, the best of what America has to offer."" According to Dwyer, the city generally offers the opportunity for members of the public to apply to become a New York City firefighter only every four years. Step one in the process is to sign up to take an entrance exam. This year, the window for potential candidates to sign up was July 15 through September 19, Dwyer said. Monday, Sullivan and the city filed a motion to allow them to reopen the official application period to allow Meyer to apply. The city sought to reopen the applications to all would-be candidates, but U.S. District Court Judge Nicholas Garaufis ruled that other applicants had plenty of time to sign up for the firefighter test, and the one-day window for a late application would only be open to Meyer, ""in view of Sergeant Meyer's recognized and truly exceptional military service,"" court documents said. ""We suggested in our court filing that the application period should be reopened for both Sgt. Meyer and the general public. However, we will respect the judge's decision,"" said Kate O'Brien Ahlers, spokeswoman for the New York City Law Department. Sullivan was disappointed in the court's decision and the city's decision to accept it. ""The city made it perfectly clear that additional applications would be too burdensome for them to process. I am actually ashamed for them.

Garaufis cited special recruitment efforts by the city intended to encourage members of black and Hispanic communities to apply to the FDNY. ""A brief, general re-opening of the application period, especially without any accompanying recruitment effort beyond the City's proposed updates of the New York City Fire Department's and City Administrative Services's websites, would create a serious risk of an adverse impact on the minority groups who are substantially under-represented in the ranks of the FDNY,"" Garaufis wrote in his decision.

"(CNN) -- American golfer Bill Haas said he was ""very lucky"" after securing the biggest win of his career on Sunday. The 29-year-old beat U.S Ryder Cup star Hunter Mahan on the third playoff hole at the Tour Championship in Atlanta to clinch the PGA's season-ending FedEx Cup and $11.44 million in prize money. Haas needed a dramatic save after hitting a water hazard before going on to sink a four-foot putt on the par-three 18th hole at East Lake to finally see off his compatriot, after the duo had finished tied on eight under par through 72 holes. The dramatic triumph saw Haas -- whose father Jay played in the Ryder Cup on three occasions and won nine times on the PGA Tour -- leap from 25th in the FedEx Cup standings to claim the $10 million jackpot. He also pocketed $1.44 million for winning the Tour Championship, the final event in the four-tournament series, but said he was unaware of his double success until he stepped up to collect both trophies. ""I knew I was on the line, meaning the only way I could win in my position at the start of the week was to win the tournament,"" Haas told CNN. ""Even with that happening I still could not win the FedEx Cup because other people who were way ahead of me, their points would have passed me. ""So in my head, focus on one task -- and that was to win this playoff -- and whatever happens after that, happens. The chips fell my way and I'm very lucky. "" It looked like Haas had blown his shot at glory when he hit a bogey and double bogey on the final two holes of Saturday's third round to lose a share of the lead, but a 68 on Sunday allowed him to haul himself back up the leaderboard. It then looked as if nerves might get the better of Haas when the playoff began, as he hit a loose shot into the crowd on the first additional hole before finding the water on the second. But the new world number 20 found the green with a stunning shot to force a third playoff hole, where his par putt proved enough for victory. ""When I got up there I'd heard the groans from the crowd,"" Haas said of the build-up to his incredible saving shot. ""I thought it was in the water, so I get up there and it is somewhat in the water. ""But it's not fully submerged, so in my head I said to myself, 'I do have some sort of shot here.' I hit the shot I thought I had to hit, and it came out perfect."" Haas has also put himself in contention for the upcoming Presidents Cup clash between the U.S. and an International team starting on November 14, with American captain Fred Couples due to announce his final wildcard pick on Tuesday. ""I'm not going to say it gets me to Australia,"" Haas told the PGA Tour's official website regarding the possibility of playing in the competition, which takes place in Melbourne. ""It definitely puts me in the talk up there with some of the guys that everybody has been talking about."" Haas hopes to use this win as a springboard for the rest of his career as he looks to match some of the illustrious names who have previously clinched the FedEx Cup. ""It's pretty sweet. You look at the names who have previously won this, I'm trying to work my way to their stature and their level of play. This is just another stepping stone, I think I can get up there,"" he said. ""It'll take a lot of work. Guys like Vijay (Singh), Jim Furyk and Tiger Woods, obviously they've put their time in, they've put their work in and I need to do the same. I've got to work hard to try and get better each and every year."" Mahan thought he had the tournament sewn up after Haas ended up in the water, but the 29-year-old admitted Haas was in the ascendancy once his magnificent recovery shot fell close to the hole. ""I thought I had one on the second playoff hole and then he hits it out of the water to two feet,"" Mahan said. ""It seemed like he was destined to win this week."" World number one Luke Donald knew a win at this event would be enough for him to claim the FedEx Cup, and in the process become the first man to top both the PGA and European Tour money lists. The Briton birdied three of the last five holes to finish one shot behind Haas and Mahan, in a three-way tie for third position along with South Korea's K.J Choi and Australian Aaron Baddeley. ""I guess this is what the FedExCup is all about,"" said Donald, who would have claimed victory in the series if he had finished alone in third. ""It's meant to be exciting."" Australian Jason Day fell away in the final two holes of the final round after he hit two bogeys to slide from eight under to finish in a tie for sixth place alongside compatriot Adam Scott and American Charles Howell III. ""Obviously I'm a little disappointed that I bogeyed the last two holes,"" Day, 23, said. ""But I was trying to win out there.""","Bill Haas clinches the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup titles after playoff .

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and four critically injured Tuesday in a series of highway pileups triggered by a dense dust storm on Interstate 10 in central Arizona, a state law enforcement official said. The dust storm moved through the Pichacho Peak area, about 40 miles north of Tucson, at about 12:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. ET) and caused ""minimal visibility"" on a stretch of Interstate 10 there, said Bart Graves, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. ""We have two chain reaction crashes in the westbound lanes,"" Graves said. ""All involve commercial vehicles and passenger cars. There is one confirmed fatality and two additional victims with life-threatening injuries."" Graves said 16 vehicles were involved in the chain reaction accidents at Pichacho Peak. ""We closed the eastbound lanes to allow emergency responders access to the scene,"" he said. ""Due to the poor visibility, all patients were transported by ground ambulance to Tucson area hospitals."" ""The dust continues to cause a major hindrance to DPS officers and other rescue personnel,"" Graves said. Another pileup, this one involving eight vehicles, occurred about an hour and a half later, 20 miles to the south on I-10, Graves said. Two people were critically injured in that incident, which occurred on the eastbound lanes of I-10. Graves said he could not estimate when the interstate would reopen in either direction.

"(CNN) -- Not every travel adventure involves tracking wild animals or hanging off a mountain. Some feats of endurance come in the form of festivals, and Munich's Oktoberfest is no exception. This annual beer-soaked event is under way now, but a visit to the charming Bavarian town of Munich is a treat year-round. Whether you're visiting in winter or in summer, there is sure to be plenty to do. Read on for tips in each season: . Take in the scenery when it's cold . CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux shares her tips for cold-weather explorations: . I arrived in Munich by train. The warm bright interiors of the train car and the boisterous passengers sharply contrasted with the increasingly snowy exterior as we left northern Italy, crossed the Alps and arrived in the neat metropolis. After spending four months studying in the incredibly beautiful yet utterly perplexing city of Venice, Italy, Munich stood out first and foremost for its order. Trains take you where you need to go, they run on time and the buildings all look like they could stand forever in their neat, thoughtful lines . Walking, biking or taking public transport allows visitors to take in the interesting architecture of the city. The city exhibits modern platzes, or squares, with glass buildings, impressive monuments and historic buildings galore. Share your photos and tips for Munich . Enjoy the Hofgarten, a lovely yet strangely haunting garden in the middle of the city replete with ornate buildings and statues. As is the case with many landmarks and buildings in this charming city, the garden was first constructed in the 17th century, then destroyed during World War II and rebuilt much the same. Around town, you'll notice some buildings with facades painted on to approximate a style lost in the war. Across town, pay a visit to Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. The main building was designed by Friedrich von Gärtner, an important architect from the mid 19th century, and features large beautiful halls. Plus a visit to a college area always pays off in good, cheap food options. Munich has a festival for every season. October boasts the übertraditional Oktoberfest, the summer months have outdoor concerts and Christmas carnivals fill the winter months. Keep these tips in mind if you go for the holiday markets: Rule No. 1, bundle up! The icy wind here comes off the mountains and will chill you to the core. Luckily, every outdoor Christmas market, or Christkindlmarkt, sells a variety of hot beverages including hot mulled wine or Glühwein. Don't be surprised when vendors hand you a beautiful ceramic mug full of wine. But don't walk away with the mug; you're just renting it. Return it after drinking and move on to the next market for more shopping and sipping. At the markets you'll find all manner of gifts and knickknacks from the classically Bavarian items to more modern crafts. The Tollwood Festival stands out as one of the largest in town. It also boasts musical and theatrical performances and a large variety of food from around the world. The No. 1 rule with these markets: pace yourself -- these warm oases in a cold season are all over town. Should market hopping make you ill, Munich has a very modern and well-run health care system. Perhaps I succumbed to the cold weather, the festival food or the bug that I heard was going around town, but whatever the reason, my host and I both found ourselves sick to the point of dehydration. After a quick train ride we arrived at an emergency room and were seen by a doctor almost immediately. The visit to a lovely doctor who spoke perfect English was a mere 35 Euro, including intravenous fluids. Afterward, I walked across the street, prescriptions in hand, shelled out 15 more Euro and felt right as rain. I never once showed ID or an insurance card. Getting sick should not rank high on your travel list, but if illness falls, fear not! Get outdoors and soak up the sun in summer . Read on for some warm-weather finds from CNN's Emily Smith. Munich is delightful in the warmer months. Locals and tourists alike flood the streets and fill cafes. Take advantage of the weather and spend as much time outdoors as possible. We rented bikes from a tour company opposite the train station. Being a nervous biker I was pleasantly surprised that motorists moved over, and I never felt at all unsafe. We opted for a tour that included both historical stops as well as a visit to a few beer gardens. In Munich, beer is big business year-round and Hofbrauhaus is one of the oldest and most popular places to indulge. Beer maidens carry giant mugs of frothy golden goodness between tables crammed family-style with tourists from all over the world. The mood is jovial and spirited, and the schnitzel isn't half bad either. Most of the food found at beer gardens is real stick to your ribs-type stuff. We dined on giant pretzels and bratwurst for the most part. The Chinese Tower Beer Garden, in the large city park called the English Garden, is also a must-try. Located at the base of a wooden pagoda, seating is predominantly outdoors and there is often a live brass band. If you opt for a guided tour, listen well and you'll learn some interesting facts. For example, beer gardens used to store beer in underground cellars beneath the shade of chestnut trees. The English garden, with its many chestnut trees, is beautiful and definitely worth a walk around. It's rather expansive so plot out a route and be aware of the Schönfeldwiese lawn -- it's a favorite of nudists. No judgment! Another fun outdoor activity off the garden can be found at the Eisbach River. There you'll come across something unexpected -- surfers! The river forms a natural standing wave that draws board riders to get their fix. There's usually a crowd but patience is rewarded with a spot on the bridge overlooking the wave. The sport has become so popular that the location now boasts multiple wave riding competitions. It helps to have a tour guide in a city like Munich -- the city is large and while easy to navigate it's nice to have someone point out the pockmarked buildings from the war instead of walking right by with your nose glued to a map. The city has a rich cultural history and is home to world-class museums and galleries. Munich is the kind of city where it's easy to mix the fun of beer garden hopping with the opportunity to get your knowledge on.","Munich is great during Oktoberfest, but it's also wonderful year-round .
In the cooler months, enjoy the beautiful scenery and browse holiday markets .
When it's warm, check out a beer garden and make time for some fun in the sun .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his second hat-trick in four days as titleholders Barcelona marched into the knockout stage of the European Champions League on a night of milestones for the Spanish club on Tuesday. The striker, a big favorite to win his third world player of the year award after heading the 2011 nominations before the match against Viktoria Plzen, passed a double century of goals for Barca to mark coach Josep Guardiola's 200th match in charge. The Czech champions capitulated to a 4-0 home defeat in the Group H game after having Marian Cisovsky sent off for a foul in the box on Messi, who scored the resulting penalty to open the scoring in the 24th minute with his milestone goal. The Argentine made it 2-0 in the second minute of first-half injury-time after combining with Adriano, and he sealed the rout in stoppage time after a superb backheel pass from central defender Gerard Pique set him free for his 202nd. Is Messi the only candidate for Ballon d'Or? Barca's third came in the 72nd minute when Cesc Fabregas -- among eight Barca players in the 23-man FIFA Ballon d'Or Shortlist -- headed home a cross by young winger Isaac Cuenca. Guardiola became only the fifth Barca boss to reach 200 games, suffering just 17 defeats. Messi has scored 160 of the 500 goals netted in that period. The clean sheet meant that Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes set a new club record of 877 minutes without conceding, beating the previous mark set by Miguel Reina in 1973. The win gave Barca 10 points from four games, leaving the Catalans two clear of second-placed AC Milan with two rounds to play. The Italian champions went through to the second round despite being held 1-1 by BATE Borisov in Belarus in an earlier kickoff. Milan went into the match denying reports that hospitalized striker Antonio Cassano had suffered a stroke. ""I think every patient has the right to privacy, the doctors are working on it and there's nothing more to say,"" chief executive Adriano Galliani told the club's website. ""I spoke to him today and he seemed in good form. There was of course a bit of fear because the whole thing was so unexpected."" Milan took the lead in the 22nd minute through striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who won possession out wide on the right and then burst into the box to receive Robinho's pass and score. But Borisov leveled 10 minutes after halftime with a penalty by Renan Bressan when Ignazio Abate fouled Artem Kontsevoy. Chelsea missed the chance to go through in Group E after being held to a 1-1 draw by Genk in Belgium, as David Luiz missed a penalty for the visitors. Captain John Terry was left on the bench after UK police confirmed he faces a formal investigation into claims the defender racially abused Queen's Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand. The London team, beaten 5-3 by Arsenal at the weekend, took a 26th-minute lead through Ramires but fellow Brazilian Luiz saw his spot-kick saved five minutes before the break. Jelle Vossen leveled just after the hour to leave Chelsea on eight points, and Genk on bottom with two. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen remained on six points after losing 3-1 at Valencia, who are a point further back following the second-fastest goal in Champions League history. Jonas netted just after 10 seconds, but Stefan Kiessling equalized on the half hour. However, Roberto Soldado (65) and Adil Rami (75) kept the Spanish side's hopes alive ahead of the final two games. Group F leaders Arsenal also failed to qualify for the last 16 after being held to a 0-0 draw at home to Marseille. The French side remained one point behind Arsenal, who have two wins and two draws. German champions Borussia Dortmund moved off the bottom with a 1-0 win over Greek club Olympiakos. Kevin Grosskreutz scored the only goal in the seventh minute with a spectacular strike to put Dortmund within three points of Marseille ahead of the trip to Arsenal on November 23. Group G was blown wide open when unfancied Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia shocked Europa League winners Porto 2-1 to stay top of the table. Ailton put the home side ahead three minutes before halftime with a penalty, but fellow Brazilian Hulk leveled from the spot for the Portuguese champions in the 89th minute. However, Gustavo Manduca headed a last-gasp winner to put Apoel a point clear of Zenit St. Petersburg. The Russian champions won 1-0 against Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk, who were left bottom on two points after center-back Nicolas Lombaerts headed the only goal in first-half injury-time.","Barcelona through to last 16 of the European Champions League .

"(CNN) -- A Robin van Persie hat-trick earned Arsenal a thrilling 5-3 win over their west London rivals Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the English Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea started the match strongly taking the lead in the 14th minute when Juan Mata delivered an inch-perfect cross for Frank Lampard to guide a header past Szczesny in the Arsenal goal. The home side continued to dominate possession but Arsenal hit back in the 36th minute when Aaron Ramsey threaded the ball through to Gervinho who selflessly squared the ball back for van Persie to side-foot past Petr Cech. Chelsea had a goal disallowed two minutes later with Ramires being ruled offside, but earned a deserved halftime lead when John Terry bundled the ball home from a corner kick in the 45th minute. Arsenal were far from finished though and hit back four minutes after the break as Alex Song played in Andre Santos who squeezed a shot underneath Cech to level the scores at 2-2. Six minutes later, Theo Walcott gave the Gunners the lead -- unleashing a fierce shot inside Cech's near post after outwitting three Chelsea defenders. A 25-yard strike from Mata restored parity for Chelsea in the 80th minute, but van Persie put Arsenal ahead again five minutes later, pouncing on a mistake by John Terry to slot home his second before lashing home his third in injury time to seal a remarkable win. Manchester United bounced back from the 6-1 battering from their city rivals last weekend edging past Everton 1-0 at Goodison Park. Havier Hernandez was on hand to side-foot home from a Patrice Evra cross in the 19th minute to give United the lead after they had made a bright opening to the match. Everton battled their way back into the match and came close to an equalizer -- Leighton Baines hitting the crossbar from a free-kick, while David De Gea saved smartly from Leon Osman. But despite the pressure, United held firm to cement second place in the table behind leaders, Manchester City who enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Edin Dzeko opened the scoring for City in the 52nd minute with Aleksandar Kolarov adding a second 15 minutes later. City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompany was sent off in the 75th minute for a challenge on Kevin Doyle -- the resulting penalty was converted by Stephen Hunt. But Adam Johnson (who came on for Dzeko midway through the second half) netted in injury time to ensure Robert Mancini's side maintained their five-point lead at the top of the table. First half goals from Charlie Adam and Andy Carroll proved enough for Liverpool who beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at The Hawthorns. Liverpool were awarded a penalty in the 9th minute when Luis Suarez was bundled over in the box -- Adam making no mistake with the spot kick. Suarez was involved again in the second, setting up Carroll who poked a shot past advancing West Brom keeper Ben Foster. Despite a host of chances in the second half Liverpool couldn't extend their lead, but the win lifts them to fifth. West Brom are 13th with 11 points. Norwich City came from two goals down to earn a 3-3 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers -- a result which keeps Steve Kean's side in the bottom three. Norwich are in eighth place. Sunderland also came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw against Aston Villa. Goals from Villa's Bulgarian midfielder Stiliyan Petrov (20th minute) and Richard Dunne (85th minute) were canceled out by Connor Wickham, who scored seven minutes before half time and Stephane Sessegnon who stole a point for Sunderland seconds before the final whistle. Swansea City continued their promising start to season with 3-1 over struggling Bolton Wanderers. The result moves them up to 10th place. Bolton, meanwhile, are second from bottom with six points, one point ahead of Wigan who suffered their third home defeat of the season losing 2-0 to Fulham. Goals from Clint Dempsey and Moussa Dembele lift Martin Jol's side up to 15th.","Robin van Persie hat-trick seals memorable Arsenal win at Stamford Bridge .

"(CNN) -- At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government's ongoing crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Among the dead was a 12-year-old boy shot to death when Syrian security forces fired on a funeral procession, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.. The funeral procession was for a protester killed Sunday, the observatory said. In addition, 17 people were killed during operations by the military and security forces in Hama as authorities searched for wanted activists and demonstrators, the organization said. Meanwhile, an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said parliamentary elections could be held in the country by the end of the year, Russian media reported earlier Monday. Bouthaina Shaaban, the political and media adviser to al-Assad, was in Moscow on Monday to speak to journalists on the situation in Syria. ""I can tentatively say that such elections may be held either at the end of this year or the beginning of next,"" Shaaban said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency. The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, is condemning the killing of a key Syrian opposition organizer who it says died while in the custody of Syria's security forces. Ghiyath Mattar, described as a key organizer of protests against al-Assad's regime, was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Damascus suburb of Darya, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement released Sunday. ""His brave commitment to confronting the regime's despicable violence with peaceful protest serves as an example for the Syrian people and for all those who suffer under the yoke of oppression,"" the statement said . Mattar was arrested along with leading opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and a number of other activists, Nuland said. Mattar was ""a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent,"" said one of Mattar's friends. ""His death is an attack by the regime on peace. His attack is saying, 'We want to destroy the messengers of peace in Syria and the ideals and values they hold."" ""His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader,"" said another man, a colleague of Mattar's. ""Everyone loved him and he had so many close friends and relatives."" Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution. On September 6, Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji's brother saying he was injured and needed help, according to the friend. In reality, security forces had forced the brother to call Sharbaji. The operation led to the arrests, the friend said. Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and an end to al-Assad's regime have been met by brute force. The government has maintained a consistent narrative: It is going after armed terrorists. But opposition activists say the regime is behind a systematic, sustained slaughter. Mattar, 26, was on the run for three months before being taken into custody, according to the Syrian Observatory. The group, citing reports from Mattar's fellow opposition members, said he was tortured to death. Syria's crackdown on protesters has been roundly condemned by many world leaders and the United Nations. The Arab League has publicly called for al-Assad's regime to show restraint and end the violence. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country. The European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and imposed a travel ban. Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, put the number killed in the unrest at 2,600, citing ""reliable sources on the ground,"" in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday during the commission's session. The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March. In her statement, Nuland repeated calls by the United States for al-Assad to step down. ""We call on the (al-Assad) regime to immediately cease all violence against the Syrian people and release all political prisoners. We again call on (al-Assad) to step aside and allow the Syrian people to embark upon the democratic transformation they demand,"" she said the in the statement. A video posted on YouTube purportedly showing the funeral of Mattar in Darya showed people marching in the street and chanting: ""We will sacrifice our lives and our blood for you, Ghiyath"" and ""Freedom, freedom, we are the youths of freedom."" Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died. CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Maxim Tkachenko, Mohammed Jamjoom and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 26 people were killed Monday, an opposition rights group says .

"(CNN) -- The head of JetBlue is apologizing for a ""confluence of events"" that left a plane filled with passengers stranded on the tarmac at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, over the weekend. Chief Operating Officer Rob Maruster said in a video posted on the company's blog and its YouTube Channel that the airline had six flights divert to Hartford during the freak weekend snowstorm ""due to various runway, congestion and other operational issues at Newark and JFK Airports"" and that the airline ""did not deplane those aircraft in our target time allotted."" One of those flights, JetBlue 504 from Fort Lauderdale spent nearly eight hours stranded on the tarmac before passengers were allowed to deplane. ""At no point in this weekend was safety ever compromised,"" Maruster said, stressing that safety was the airline's number one concern. ""But let's face it, you count on us at JetBlue for a lot more -- and we promise a lot more -- and we know we let some of you down over the course of this weekend and for that we are truly sorry."" Maruster said the airline intends to ""fully participate with the Department of Transportation and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend, and we're also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day, you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crewmembers and our operation."" ""We can only earn your loyalty and trust one flight at a time and we ask you to give us a second chance."" JetBlue Flight 504 departed Fort Lauderdale at 10:07 a.m. ET Saturday -- 32 minutes late. The flight made it to Newark -- just not to the runway, thanks to the weather before it was diverted to Hartford. It landed at 1:07 p.m. What came next was an eight-hour ordeal for passengers -- and crew -- as the plane sat stuck on the tarmac with little food or water. ""I got a problem here on the airplane. I'm going to need to have the cops onboard,"" a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on LiveATC.net, a website that monitors air traffic control conversations. ""I need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane."" Passenger Roseann Kozma explained the situation in a phone interview with CNN affiliate WTIC-TV from the plane. ""A couple passengers are fighting and there's a baby on here that's been crying the whole time,"" she said. ""We cannot go to the bathrooms anymore. There's no running water,"" said Todd Bailey, another passenger. ""They tell us that we're going to be going in soon, going in soon, going in soon -- and it just never happens."" Adding to the frustration and tension were passengers with medical conditions. ""I have a paraplegic that needs to come off,"" the pilot said. ""I have a diabetic here that's got an issue ... I've just got to get some help."" But the plane was still not at a gate, further frustrating the pilot. ""Look, you know, we can't seem to get any help from our own company,"" the pilot told the tower. ""I apologize for this, but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something. I don't care, take us anywhere."" The pilot, though frustrated, offered thanks to Bradley International officials. ""Listen, I just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth. Thank you very much,"" he said. ""It's Capt. Thompson over here on (Flight) 504 ... I think we've got more help from you guys than our own people."" The passengers broke into applause when the door finally opened, saying ""Let us out! Let us out! Let us out!"" Passengers deplaned around 9 p.m., according to JetBlue.","JetBlue head says the airline let some of its customers down .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday he supports the Obama administration's decision to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy banning gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military -- a move that was staunchly opposed by most top Republicans. ""I think the decision that's been made with respect to allowing gays to serve openly in the military is a good one"" Cheney told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union."" ""It's the right thing to do."" The policy, first enacted during the Clinton administration, was officially repealed on September 20. Over 14,000 people were kicked out of the military due to ""don't ask, don't tell."" The controversial repeal of the policy became a focal point of a GOP presidential debate last month when members of the audience booed a gay soldier who asked about the decision. President Barack Obama criticized the Republican presidential contenders on Saturday night for failing to rebuke the audience. ""We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,"" Obama told attendees at the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes equality for gays and lesbians.

"(CNN) -- A day after three Connecticut asset managers claimed the largest Powerball jackpot in the state's history, a public relations executive acting on their behalf issued a statement denying there was a fourth participant who wanted to remain anonymous. Throughout the day Monday there had been published reports that the three men who appeared with the winning check were only collecting on behalf of a client of their investment firm. ""While there has been much speculation and quite a bit of misinformation over the last 24 hours, this Trust, with its three trustees, has been established to manage the winnings in the most practical and expedient way possible so that we can achieve our strategic goal of helping those who can best benefit from these funds,"" said public relations executive Gary Lewi. ""And to be clear, there are a total of three trustees and there is no anonymous fourth participant."" The statement goes on to say that the financial advisers will set up a trust that will have as its focus -- among other things -- care for U.S. veterans and those returning home from deployment. Within 10 days the trust will distribute $1 million to selected veterans relief organizations within the tri-state region, Lewi said. Co-workers Tim Davidson, Brandon Lacoff and Greg Skidmore claimed the prize from the November 2 drawing, which netted them more than $100 million, at a presentation by the Connecticut Lottery Corp. Ranjit Singh, the manager of the Stamford BP gas station where the winning ticket was purchased, told CNN's Mary Snow that he is sure it was Tim Davidson who purchased the ticket. ""I do recognize him, I cannot forget the face."" Singh also said he remembers that he pushed Davidson to buy a ticket. The jackpot was $254 million, had the winners taken a multiyear payout. They opted instead for a one-time cash payout that totaled $103.6 million after taxes, according to Connecticut Lottery spokeswoman Linda Tarnowski. It was the 12th-largest jackpot in Powerball history, according to Anne Noble, president of the Connecticut Lottery. ""Everybody is extremely excited -- these numbers are huge,"" said the trio's attorney, Jason Kurland. ""This is going to benefit many people."" Kurland spoke on behalf of three winners, all asset managers at start-up firm Belpointe Asset Management in Greenwich, Connecticut. He said that the men will donate ""a significant amount"" of the winnings to charities in the state. Davidson bought the $1 ticket at a gas station in Stamford, Kurland said. After realizing they had a winning ticket the following morning, the three co-workers formed the Putnam Avenue Family Trust, each becoming a trustee. ""They have become their dream client,"" Kurland said. Skidmore was the only one of the three winners to speak at Monday's press conference. ""It feels good,"" he said. CNN's Mary Snow and Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","The three winners didn't represent a secretive client, a spokesman says in a statement .

"(CNN) -- World leaders are often measured by what they do in their first 100 days in office. But what about business leaders? As of Friday, it has been 100 days since Apple co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs passed the company torch to Tim Cook. Since that first day, August 24, Wall Street and legions of Apple fans have had their gazes fixed on Cook. As the man heading arguably the most influential and valuable technology company in the world, Cook wields a great deal of power. After Cook took over, Jobs held the role of executive chairman but lost his long battle with cancer some six weeks later, on October 5. The day before Jobs died, Cook led a news conference to announce the iPhone 4S. ""I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for 14 years,"" Cook said at that event. ""I am so incredibly proud of this company."" Analysts described the presentation as crisp but lacking the excitement of a Jobs production. ""It's not going to be the Steve Jobs show that generates headlines worldwide,"" John Jackson, an analyst at Boston-based market research firm CCS Insight who attended the keynote, said in a recent interview. ""These events aren't going to be the same as they ever were."" Even without Jobs' dramatic stage presence, the iPhone 4S became the fastest-selling phone over its launch weekend, selling 4 million units worldwide. Financial analysts worried that the aging glass-and-steel design would stunt sales, but the faster processor, better camera and Siri voice assistant -- plus the addition of a third major carrier, Sprint Nextel -- helped the smartphone maintain momentum. Siri, which Apple describes as beta software, has experienced occasional outages since its October launch, but iCloud has fared much better than Apple's previous endeavors into Internet services. About 20 million people activated their free iCloud accounts in its first week, Apple said. ITunes Match, a $25-a-year music synchronization service, was delayed by a few weeks but has received positive reviews. Like Jobs had done, Cook began e-mailing with some customers. He also personally addressed an inquiry by e-mail from Nancy Keenan, the president of a pro-choice foundation who was writing in response to a controversy over Siri directing abortion questions to pro-life clinics. ""These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone,"" Cook wrote. So after a few robust launches, and a few bumps in the road, where do Cook and Apple go from here? Jobs recruited Cook from Compaq Computer in 1998 to run Apple's operations. People who have worked with Cook at Apple describe him as quiet and confident, the peacekeeper at the conference room table. He'd entrust a roomful of Apple employees with company secrets and expect trust in return, according to Michael Grothaus, a former consultant for the company. Jobs was hands-on in product development and had a knack for identifying which markets were ripe for invasion. Walter Isaacson's new ""Steve Jobs"" biography reveals that digital textbooks and Internet-enabled TV sets were among Jobs' next areas of focus for Apple. In the book, Jobs said Cook is ""not a product person."" Analysts say Jobs provided guidance on products that wouldn't see store shelves for at least another year. But by August 2013, Jobs' magic touch is likely to have worn off and the products will be those of a Cook regime, said Gartner analyst Michael King. Cook hasn't been given reasons to run away from the challenge. He will be able to lean on a ""strong bench"" of executives that Jobs recruited and that Cook has long worked with, said Jackson, the analyst. ""It's going to be business as usual for Apple in Steve's absence,"" he said. Shortly after taking over, Cook broadened the role of Eddy Cue, a longtime executive working with Jobs. Cue is now the senior vice president of cloud services, which includes overseeing iCloud and iAds, the fledgling mobile advertising unit. To give Cook a strong financial incentive to stay, Apple's board of directors granted him a million shares of restricted stock. The first half will be made available to him five years from when Cook officially became CEO, and the rest will vest five years after that, as long as he stays. Cook had promised in a recent e-mail to his staff that Apple wouldn't change under his leadership, but he introduced at least one corporate program that would have been out of character for Jobs. In September, Apple began matching employees' charitable contributions up to $10,000. Jobs was not much of a philanthropist. ""Steve made our world a better place,"" Cook said at the Apple memorial for Jobs. ""He left his fingerprints all over society, all over the world. He also leaves behind a company that only he could have built and a spirit that will be the foundation for this company forever."" Cook has instilled confidence in investors during his brief stints as CEO. In the last 100 days, Apple stock has gone up 4.3%. Now, he will need to continue to build on Jobs' steady foundation.","Friday is Tim Cook's 100th day as official Apple CEO .

"(CNN) -- A Serbian tennis player has been banned for life and fined $100,000 after being found guilty of match-fixing offenses. David Savic has been punished for three violations of the 2010 Uniform Tennis Anti-Corruption Program in October 2010, it was revealed on Saturday. A Tennis Integrity Unit investigation found that the 26-year-old tried to contrive the outcome of an event, sought to persuade another player to not try to win and also offered money ""with the intention of negatively influencing a player's best efforts in any event."" Savic is currently ranked 659th in singles, with a highest standing of 363 in October 2009. He is a compatriot of world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who helped Serbia win the Davis Cup last year before winning three grand slam titles in 2011. Savic is the second man to be banned for life over match-fixing, following Austria's Daniel Kollerer in May. The Tennis Integrity Unit is run by the International Tennis Federation, the Grand Slam Committee and the men's ATP and women's WTA tours. Meanwhile, world No. 4 Andy Murray will face Donald Young in Sunday's Thailand Open final after the American upset second seed Gael Monfils. Young, ranked 55th, triumphed 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-5) against the Frenchman in Saturday's semis to reach his first top-level title match. He has already beaten Murray once this year, at Indian Wells, but lost to the Briton in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. Young will break into the men's top-50 next week, having started August in 128th place. The defeat dented 14th-ranked Monfils' hopes of reaching the season-ending ATP World Tour finals in London. Murray, who was runner-up in Bangkok in his first ATP final six years ago, is seeking his third title this year after winning 6-2 3-6 6-2 against another Frenchman, Gilles Simon. Agnieszka Radwanska boosted her hopes of qualifying for the season-ending WTA Championships in Turkey by winning the Tokyo Open title on Saturday. The Polish ninth seed defeated world No. 4 Vera Zvonareva for the third time this year, with the 22-year-old winning 6-3 6-2 to claim her sixth title. Zvonareva has already qualified for Istanbul, and is joined by Tokyo semifinalists Victoria Azarenka and Petra Kvitova, the 2011 Wimbledon champion. ""Before this tournament my chances of qualifying for the Championships were very small, but now they'll be better,"" Radwanska said. The China Open has also begun, with Italian seventh seed Francesca Schiavone and Russia's No. 16 Svetlana Kuznetsova winning first-round matches in Beijing on Saturday. Ninth seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany also went through, but Serbian 10th seed Jelena Jankovic was beaten 7-5 6-4 by Austria's Tamira Paszek.","Serbia's David Savic banned from tennis for life and fined $100,000 .

"(CNN) -- The Web fallout continued Friday over news that a hidden app could be tracking smartphone users' activity. Many bloggers and smartphone customers fretted about the privacy issues raised by Carrier IQ, an information-mining app secretly installed on many phones. But at the same time, other tech observers were beginning to say that some of those concerns may have been over the top. First, a recap: On Monday, researcher and developer Trevor Eckhart posted a 17-minute YouTube video apparently showing how the software -- designed as a diagnostic tool to find and help fix mobile network problems -- runs on his smartphone and logs every keystroke, every text and the full URL of every website he visits. News of the app's existence on millions of phones had bounced around on tech blogs for a while. But attention skyrocketed this week when Eckhart posted his video. By Thursday, it had turned into a rapidly developing story in which new information seemed to surface hourly. Mobile carriers and smartphone makers rushed to dispute claims made by Eckhart and others who said they confirmed his findings, explain their use of the app or announce that they once used it but plan to get rid of it. And Friday morning, the controversy made its way into the courts. A lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Carrier IQ, and phone makers Samsung and HTC, claiming that the app violates customer privacy. ""Given our dependence on smartphones, we rely on the assumption that our personal information is protected from third parties,"" attorney Steve W. Berman said in a written statement. ""Yet, it appears that Carrier IQ has violated this trust."" Berman's firm is representing several customers and is seeking to turn the complaint into a class-action lawsuit. The potential ramifications obviously had other privacy-minded folks concerned as well. ""A couple of things seem pretty clear,"" Jay Stanley, a senior privacy and technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union, said Friday. ""We don't know what the company was storing or accessing or what their clients were storing or accessing, but they seem to at least have the capability to store and access a lot of very personal information."" Many mobile customers seemed to focus their concerns on the fact that the software runs without their knowledge and appears difficult, if not impossible, to uninstall. For example, on Sprint's community forums, several topics had been created to discuss the issue. And customers weren't happy. ""There's no excuse to knowingly and willingly want to have that kind of invasive software, that potentially puts customers sensitive information at risk, on the phone,"" one customer wrote. ""This software may violate multiple privacy laws, and that alone ought to void our contracts."" Sprint said it uses the app to root out network problems but can't see user activity. Other wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers also responded. Verizon said it doesn't use the app, and Apple said it has stopped supporting it and plans to eliminate it altogether. By Thursday morning, some on the Web were trying to put the brakes on the fears, though. ""Okay, folks, before we complete this public lynching, is there any evidence that Carrier IQ actually transmitted inappropriate data?"" tweeted Declan McCullagh, a correspondent for tech site CNET. In a message posted to Pastebin, Dan Rosenberg, an analyst with Virtual Security Research, wrote that some of the fears about Carrier IQ have been overblown. ""After reverse engineering CarrierIQ myself, I have seen no evidence that they are collecting anything more than what they've publicly claimed: anonymized metrics data,"" he wrote. ""There's a big difference between 'look, it does something when I press a key' and 'it's sending all my keystrokes to the carrier!'.'"" ""In my opinion, the media has made it more malicious than it really is and I am not concerned about my phone usage at all,"" wrote Matthew Miller, a columnist with tech site ZDNet. ""It sounds to me like the software is designed to BENEFIT consumers and is not being used to track and target you."" But the ACLU's Stanley remains concerned. He cited promotional material on Carrier IQ's own website that notes its ability to track users' activities. ""If you look at their website, we don't know what their clients were buying, but we do know what they were selling,"" he said. ""What they're saying to the media doesn't seem to comport to what they tout on their own website."" Carrier IQ says the core purpose of its tool is to uncover broad trends across a network. Its software can help carriers find out where calls are dropping and why, and zero in on device glitches. For at least some of those who remain concerned (and there are no doubt many), there may be some hope of at least finding out if the app is running on their phones. A new app in the Android Market, Voodoo Carrier IQ detector, is designed to help you simply find the kit on your phone if it exists. It's only a day old and not perfect, developers say, but will continue to be tweaked.","Fallout continues over smartphone info-tracking app .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania prison guard accused of sexually and physically abusing more than 20 inmates has been arrested, according to the Allegheny County District Attorney's office. Harry Nicoletti, 59, was arrested Tuesday evening in Pittsburgh, and faces 92 counts of institutional sexual assault, official oppression, terroristic threats and simple assault. According to the criminal complaint, Nicoletti is accused of targeting male inmates convicted of sex crimes, particularly those convicted of crimes against children. The 34-page report details what authorities describe as a pattern of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse directed at the inmates. Nicoletti allegedly raped, slapped, bribed and exposed himself to inmates in the State Criminal Institution at Pittsburgh's ""F Block."" One inmate said that he assaulted 15 other inmates under Nicoletti's orders and was rewarded for doing so. He did not elaborate. Nicoletti told CNN affiliate KDKA that the allegations are false. CNN was unable to reach Nicoletti independently, and it could not be determined whether he has an attorney.

"(CNN) -- In the early morning hours Saturday, surviving remnants of a NASA satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere over a remote stretch of the southern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. space agency said Tuesday. Nick Johnson, NASA's chief scientist for orbital debris, said on the agency's website that the re-entry point was in the general vicinity of Christmas Island, south of Indonesia. ""It's unlikely that anyone actually observed the re-entry,"" Johnson said, adding that NASA has yet to receive any reports of a sighting from airplanes, ships or island inhabitants in the region. A NASA statement on the website, labeled the final status report on the falling satellite, said it entered the atmosphere at 0400 GMT Saturday, midnight on the U.S. East Coast, over ""a broad, remote ocean area in the Southern Hemisphere."" The exact coordinates cited by NASA were 14.1 degrees south latitude and 189.8 degrees east longitude (170.2 west longitude). According to the statement, debris would have landed 300 to 800 miles northeast of the re-entry point. The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite was launched in 1991 on a space shuttle mission and ceased its scientific life in 2005, the NASA statement said. It broke into pieces during re-entry, NASA said, with 26 chunks weighing a total of 1,200 pounds considered likely to reach the Earth's surface. According to NASA, space debris the size of the satellite's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year.","NASA has not received any reports of people seeing the falling debris .

"(CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah has revoked a flogging sentence for a woman who allegedly flouted the conservative kingdom's strict rules that prohibit women from driving a car, two sources with knowledge of the case said Wednesday. Amnesty International said a Saudi woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for getting behind the wheel, and had urged the dismantling of the ""whole system of women's subordination."" Authorities are not expected to release an official statement, but the woman will not be sentenced, according to a source close to the Royal Court. A source connected to the country's Interior Ministry also confirmed the revocation. The move comes just as the country's ruling elite promised greater political participation for women in the Islamic nation. On Sunday, King Abdullah announced two changes for women that would be historic for Saudi Arabia. He said women will be allowed to serve as members of the Shura Council, the appointed consultative council that advises the king. He also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections. It is unknown when those may ultimately take place. Amnesty said a court in Jeddah handed down the sentence Tuesday. Two other women are believed to be facing charges for driving, one in Jeddah and one in al-Khobar. The Women2Drive campaign said the woman who was sentenced to 10 lashes has appealed the sentence. She said she did not want to be identified or speak publicly about her case for her own safety. Women2Drive also said police pulled over women's rights activist Madeah Alajroush for driving in Riyadh on Tuesday. She was taken to police headquarters for questioning and released after she signed a pledge not to drive and called for a taxi home, a statement from Women2Drive said. The Women2Drive campaign on Facebook and Twitter encouraged women to drive as part of their normal daily activities rather than converge in one place.","Amnesty International says a woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for driving .

"(CNN) -- Despite current world player of year Lionel Messi's recent declaration that he wants to finish his career in his native Argentina, there are very real concerns about the current well-being of football in the soccer-mad South American nation. Messi may be the best player on the planet, but problems both on and off the pitch -- including Argentina's humiliating 4-0 defeat at the hands of Germany in the 2010 World Cup finals -- have put immense pressure on the national team to perform well in the Copa America tournament they currently host. There is no doubt that the tournament is being staged on the back of a traumatic few months for Argentine football. Serious crowd disorder, chronic financial problems, the continued drain of top talent to rich European clubs and the shock relegation of the mighty River Plate have all combined to leave many fans with furrowed brows. Add to this the apparent strength of traditional rivals Brazil, who have just won the Copa Libertadores -- the biggest club prize in South American football -- with Santos, and whose teams are managing to keep hold of their better players due to an improved national economy, and it is clear to see why many are questioning the health of the sport. River Plate's fate is a warning to Latin American giants . So far, the omens are not looking good. A late goal from Sergio Aguero rescued a point for Argentina in their opening group match against Bolivia. And things got even worse for the hosts in their second group game when they were booed off after a dreadful 0-0 draw against Colombia. Next Monday's final match against Costa Rica is now a must-win affair, with the very real possibility that Argentina might crash out of the tournament at the first hurdle. CNN's Buenos Aires correspondent Brian Byrnes summed up the mood that pervades many of the passionate followers of football in the nation. ""Argentina have some of the best players in the world and for some reason the team is not producing what it is capable of,"" said Byrnes. ""World-class players like Sergio Aguero (Atletico Madrid) and Gonzalo Higuain (Real Madrid) cannot even get in the side, while other nations would be proud to have players like that in their team, let alone on the bench. ""You only had to look at Lionel Messi's face after Wednesday's match. The team cannot get the best out of the world's top player and things are so bad that radio phone-ins and web sites are calling for the return of (former national coach) Diego Maradona, who was castigated after last year's World Cup failure."" Argentine football legend Osvaldo Ardiles also conceded that the national team have got problems at the moment. Ardiles, a key member of the Argentina side that won the World Cup for the first time on home soil in 1978, told CNN: ""We have drawn our first two games in the tournament and, to be honest, we were so bad that they could easily have been two defeats. Argentina booed off after goalless draw . ""Argentina are favorites for this tournament, and for them to miss out on reaching the knockout rounds would be unthinkable -- but Brazil also had a bad start (0-0 against Venezuela) so I don't agree that it is all doom and gloom yet. ""I also don't think Brazilian football is better than us at the moment. Both countries went out in the same stage of the World Cup finals, and although Santos won the Copa Libertadores, Argentina won it with Estudiantes in 2009 and Boca Juniors in 2007."" Ardiles continued: ""I do believe the future of Brazilian football is in a better state than ours. The Brazilian economy is strong and they are able to bring back some of their better players from Europe. I think that will really have an effect on the national team in four or five years time."" The tournament comes just a week after the dramatic demise of River Plate. The most famous football club in Argentina, and arguably the whole of the continent, are known as Los Millonarios (The Millionaires) for good reason. A roll-call of honor that has seen the club lift the Primera Division title a record 33 times, as well as two Copa Libertadores crowns and an Intercontinental Cup, proved a distant memory as a steady financial decline, coupled with poor results over the past three years, ultimately proved River Plate's undoing. Their demotion has sent shock waves throughout the country, resulting in a feeling of ""mourning,"" even for non-River Plate fans. Riots compound River Plate's relegation misery . However, Ardiles believes the fate of River Plate, and the current failings of the Argentine national team are not linked, and they should be viewed in completely different lights. ""It's a tragedy for River Plate's fans that the club were relegated, but I actually think it shows Argentine football is in a healthy state,"" he told CNN. ""Beforehand, people were saying that River Plate would never be allowed to be relegated, that somehow the football authorities would prevent it -- well, that did not happen. ""It is good that smaller clubs can beat the bigger clubs, it is healthy for football and shows a high standard. Football thrives on shocks and surprises, and there is something magical about that."" Byrnes followed the River Plate story closely and was present when the team were finally relegated. ""The River Plate relegation saga captivated the nation, not just football fans, and was front page news for weeks leading up to their decisive playoff match. ""The public as a whole viewed what happened at River Plate, the financial mismanagement of a great team, as symptomatic of what they perceive happens in Argentine politics and society as a whole -- hence the disbelief at their relegation."" Argentine soccer hooligans offered World Cup holiday . Byrnes continued: ""There is a very real social story to this. River were 'The Millionaires' not only for the wealth of the side but also for their fans -- who traditionally came from the upper-class north of Buenos Aires. ""That is why their demotion has been such a major story, it shows what can happen if there is mismanagement involved."" If the shock of River Plate's relegation was bad enough, the subsequent crowd disturbances that followed their demise were then graphically viewed around the world. ""Crowd trouble is endemic in Argentine football,"" added Byrnes. ""The police and football authorities seem unable to contain it, but what happened in the stadium that day was the worse I have ever seen. ""I was reporting live for CNN News, not sport, which gives you an indication how big the story was and, after the game, the supporters took their anger out on everybody, including the media. People in Argentina were embarrassed by those images going around the world."" With those images of crowd disturbances fresh in the memory, the Argentine national team are under real pressure to get a victory against Costa Rica on Monday. Anything but a win would see a great football nation suffer the ultimate ignominy on home soil.","Argentina are currently hosting the Copa America tournament .
The pressure is on the hosts to perform well in front of their home fans .

"(CNN) -- Italian champions AC Milan climbed to the top of Serie A for the first time this season on Friday with a 2-0 win over 10-man Genoa that was delayed for 10 minutes due to supporters fighting outside the stadium. The game was only 15 minutes old when tear gas started flowing into Genoa's Stadio Luigi Ferraris as police tried to control clashes between the clubs' supporters. The mid-table home side held out for almost an hour against a Milan team unbeaten in seven previous games -- six of them victories -- but the match turned when Kakha Kaladze was sent off against his former club. The Georgia international defender was booked for the second time after bringing down Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and the Sweden striker netted the resulting penalty for his eighth goal in 10 league games. ""In the first half we had three chances that we could have scored from and that would have opened up the game,"" Ibrahimovic told reporters. ""We're playing well, we've got a lot of confidence, also away from home. We're getting a lot of possession and scoring goals. Brazil forward Robinho was guilty of a shocking miss but Antonio Nocerino eventually doubled the lead with 10 minutes to play, scoring his fifth goal this season after being set up by fellow midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng. The victory put Massimiliano Allegri a point above Juventus -- who host second-bottom Cesena on Sunday -- with eight wins and three draws from 13 matches. Third-placed Udinese could join Milan on 27 points with victory away to the Rossoneri's city rivals Internazionale on Saturday. Meanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth place in Germany's Bundesliga with a 2-0 win at home to Hoffenheim on Friday. In-form Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed his sixth goal this season in the 10th minute, while Sidney Sam lobbed goalkeeper Tom Starke with 11 minutes to play to keep Leverkusen unbeaten in five matches in all competitions -- and 10th-placed Hoffenheim winless in as many matches. Leverkusen now trail Borussia Dortmund and Monchengladbach by four points ahead of the league leaders' clash on Saturday. If that match ends in a draw, third-placed Bayern Munich can return to the top with a draw or better at home to Werder Bremen.","AC Milan beat 10-man Genoa 2-0 to go one point clear in Serie A table .

"(CNN) -- About 80 people were arrested on the eighth day of protests in New York on Saturday, the greatest number since demonstrations started near Wall Street. Earlier arrests in the week totaled about 20 on previous days for similar charges, according to New York City Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The latest arrests include disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and assaulting a police officer, according to Browne. The protests started September 17 in lower Manhattan and are aimed at drawing attention to the role powerful financial interests played in America's spiraling economy. ""We've got a whole bunch of people sitting in Washington that can't figure it out,"" said organizer Bill Csapo. The mission is for "" 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up beds, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months,"" the official ""Occupy Wall Street"" website read. By Saturday, the site had a series of updates on arrests, including the exact location of a police van holding arrestees. One was described as having a ""very bad concussion, possibly life threatening"" and urged participants to demand medicare care for those affected. ""It's just letting people know that it's going on,"" Csapo said on the website. ""We need to call the police and tell them to let these people go."" CNN called police officials, but they declined to comment further on the extent of injuries or specific use of force. But descriptions by the website and some protesters present affirm the use of mace and Tasers. One midtown resident, Ryan Alley, claims he wasn't aware of the protests until he found himself among them. He said he was penned in by police while standing near a group of protesters, pushed against a wall and nearly arrested. ""They turned our backs, put us against the wall,"" Alley said. ""They're being very aggressive ... half the people here have no idea what's going on ... I'm actually very ashamed to be a New Yorker."" One woman with bloody lips stood with her hands zip-tied behind her back. ""I wasn't doing anything and I was punched!"" she called out to spectators. Csapo says the organization is worried about NYPD activity after nightfall. Despite the concerns, the ""resistance continues,"" the group says. ""We're occupying that square. We're not going anywhere,"" Csapo said about their new Liberty Plaza location near the former World Trade Center.","The latest arrests include disorderly conduct and resisting arrest .
The protests started September 17 in lower Manhattan .
They are aimed at drawing attention to the role of financial interests in the spiraling economy ."
"(CNN) -- Team Lotus reserve driver Karun Chandhok has told CNN it would be ""magic"" to be on the grid when Formula One makes its debut in his home country of India next month. Chandhok, 27, joined the CNN-sponsored team at the start of the 2011 season, and is currently behind first-choice drivers Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli in the pecking order. But Lotus team principal Tony Fernandes raised hopes of the former HRT driver taking part in the inaugural Delhi race when he said he would like to see Chandhok take to the track on October 30. ""I'd like him to. It's up to the team to see [whether he will],"" AirAsia chief Fernandes told Reuters. Veteran Trulli signs new deal at Lotus . On the issue of which racer would make way for Chandhok, Fernandes, who recently purchased English soccer team Queens Park Rangers, suggested Trulli would be the one to face the axe. ""Yes, I think Heikki [Kovalainen] is our number one driver, although Jarno's outqualified him [at the Italian Grand Prix]."" In response to Fernandes' admission, Chandhok said: ""It's obviously very nice to hear. He's the man who can make it happen. I've just got to wait and see what he decides. ""As a racing driver, the most emotional race is certainly your home grand prix. If I do get the opportunity to do it, it'll be fantastic, but as this moment it's a question only Tony can answer. ""To be an Indian driver on the grid for the first Indian Grand Prix would be magic. I've been very involved in the circuit; I've been visiting the site every month. To have the opportunity to drive would sort of complete that circle."" Chandhok was given a drive ahead of the veteran Italian Trulli, who extended his contract with Lotus last weekend, for the German Grand Prix in July, where he finished in last place. While Chandhok admitted dropping a driver can create a difficult situation for the team, he insisted his relationship with Trulli has been unaffected. ""It's not ideal, there's no doubt about that ... I experienced it last year [at HRT], my drive was given to Sakon Yamamoto in the second half of the season. It's tough. ""When they put me in the car in Germany ... it's a very difficult situation. It can be awkward. But I have to say Jarno was fantastic. He offered his advice and support all through the weekend. I have to say hats off to him, he was a model professional."" On his own future, Chandhok, who made his Formula One debut at the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, made no secret of his desire to earn a full-time seat with Lotus. But he said any decision on his future with the team would be made by Fernandes. ""I need to sit and figure things out with Tony and where we are and where we see the future. I'd like to stay with Tony, with Lotus, and in the future race for them full-time. That's my ambition. ""I'd love to race with these guys and Tony's got a fantastic vision of trying to build an Asian team and I'd love to be a part of that programme.""","Karun Chandhok has said it would be 'magic' to race in first Indian Grand Prix .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The pilot of a tugboat towing a barge that crashed into a sightseeing ""duck boat"" -- killing two tourists -- intends to plead guilty to a charge stemming from the July 2010 accident, federal prosecutors said Thursday . Matthew R. Devlin, 35, of Catskill, New York, has agreed to plead guilty to one count of misconduct of a ship operator causing death, according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for eastern Pennsylvania. He also will surrender his ship¹s mate license, the statement said. Devlin could be sentenced to up to 46 months in prison, the statement said. No sentencing date was given. The plea agreement closes the case, the statement said. Two tourists from Hungary -- one 16 years old, the other 20 -- died when a 250-foot sludge barge towed by the tugboat overran a disabled 33-foot ""Ride the Ducks"" tour boat on the Delaware River, plunging the amphibious vessel and its 35 passengers and two crew members underwater. According to National Transportation Safety Board findings, tugboat pilot Devlin made and received 21 cell phone calls in addition to surfing the web using a company laptop during his more than two hours at the wheel. The NTSB released its final report on June 21. The incident was ""another tragic example of the deadliness of distraction,"" Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the NTSB, said after the final report showed several people involved were on the cell phones or computers. After the accident, Devlin initially told his superiors and the Coast Guard that he was dealing with a serious family medical emergency involving his 6-year-old son. The sightseeing duck boat was anchored in the shipping channel after being shut down because the boat's operator saw smoke and feared an on-board fire. Lawyers who represented the families of the two victims released a statement Thursday saying the families ""are gratified that Federal prosecutors have acted to hold one of the responsible parties accountable in this tragedy that should have been avoided."" The statement from attorneys Robert J. Mongeluzzi, Andrew Duffy, Peter Ronai and Holly Ostrov Ronai added that the families ""expect the corporations who were involved to acknowledge their roles and act accordingly."" The statement did not elaborate.","Two tourists from Hungary died in the July 2010 accident .

"Moscow (CNN) -- President Dmitry Medvedev said Friday he had ceded his presidency bid to the country's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin because the latter is a more popular politician in Russia, who has higher chances to be elected. ""Prime Minister Putin is definitely the most authoritative politician in our country and his rating is somewhat higher (than mine),"" Medvedev said in a taped interview with Russia's national TV networks. Public opinion polls in Russia have invariably indicated that Putin has been ahead of Medvedev in popularity ever since they constructed their ruling tandem almost four years ago. According to the most recent poll, conducted by independent Levada Center, the approval rating of Medvedev stood at 62 per cent in September, compared to Putin's 68 per cent. In his Friday television interview Medvedev said that he and Putin belong to ""the same political force"" and have ""very close positions on all strategic and tactical issues"" and therefore shouldn't compete or quarrel. ""Can we possibly imagine, for instance, (U.S. President) Barack Obama competing with (Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton?"" Medvedev asked. ""Both of them were bidding for the presidential nomination ... Both were from the Democratic Party, and (the party) finally decided which of them should run to gain the best election result. Our decision was the same,"" Medvedev said. ""We want to achieve a political result, to win the elections -- the parliamentary elections in December and the presidential elections in March -- not to be nursing our ambitions,"" Medvedev said. ""Any responsible person's ambition is to serve his country, and I insist on that,"" he said. Commenting on the statements made by some people that the outcome of the Russian presidential elections is ""predetermined"", Medvedev said, ""I consider such statements absolutely irresponsible, deceitful, and even provocative."" ""The decisions made at the congress are only recommendations to the party to support two people in the elections, no more than that,"" he said. Last Saturday Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president in 2012. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of their roles. The announcement ended more than two years of speculation about whether Putin or Medvedev, his hand-picked successor, would seek to run for a second term. Putin had stepped down as president in 2008 because the Russian constitution at that time limited the office to two consecutive four-year terms. Under amendments to the constitution that came into force on December 31, 2008, the presidential term was extended to six years. This means that if Putin is elected in March 2012 for six years, he would be eligible to run for another six-year term after that, potentially keeping him in charge until 2024.","Medvedev says Putin has a better chance of being elected .

"(CNN) -- The mother of Lisa Irwin, an 11-month old Missouri girl missing for nearly two weeks, said in an interview she was drunk the night the infant disappeared. Deborah Bradley made the admission during an NBC interview, portions of which were aired Monday on ""Today."" She also said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. October 3, when she put the girl to bed, not at 10:30 p.m., as initially believed. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, came home from work to find the door unlocked, lights on and a window that had been tampered with at the family's Kansas City home. Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested. Police have accused her of killing Lisa, she said, and told her that she failed a lie detector test, with deception indicated when she was asked where Lisa was. ""I was the last one with her,"" a tearful Bradley said in the interview. ""And from judging on how the questioning went, that's kind of a fear that I have. And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her. And then I'll never see her again, and I'll never know what happened."" Asked how much she had been drinking that night, Bradley said, ""enough to be drunk."" But she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol. ""No, no, no,"" she told NBC. ""And if I thought there was a chance, I'd say it. No. No. I don't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that."" She said it's ""terrible"" that police may be focusing on her. ""My daughter is missing,"" she said. ""The last thing that I want to have to worry about is something like that. I shouldn't have to put any energy, any time or effort, into anything but finding her."" Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Irwin told NBC, ""No. There's no question to be had there. I know who she is. I know the kind of mother she is."" He said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Police have said three cell phones were also missing from the home along with Lisa. On Sunday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon ordered the one-day deployment of 25 National Guardsmen to help search for Lisa. Two anonymous benefactors have offered a $100,000 reward for Lisa's safe return, according to Bill Stanton, a private investigator working with the family. Irwin and Bradley told NBC they have refused to let authorities re-interview Lisa's older brothers. ""They said they heard noises (the night Lisa disappeared),"" Bradley said. ""I don't know if that was before we went to sleep or after."" She said she has not talked to her sons about it because she is reluctant to put them through ""anything else."" Asked what she would say to someone who might be holding Lisa, Bradley told NBC, ""She needs her family, and we need her. We're losing more sanity as each day progresses."" Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, according to police. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh, police said. At the time of her disappearance, she had a cold with a cough.","Deborah Bradley made the admission in an interview with NBC .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council met Monday to consider the Palestinians' bid for full membership in the world body and decided to meet again Wednesday morning, when they will send the matter to the admissions committee, said Security Council President Nawaf Salam of Lebanon. Salam said the decision was made to take the matter to the committee as required by Article 59 of the United Nations' rules of procedure. ""So, we have to wait until Wednesday morning,"" he said outside the Security Council. Though the debate is expected to be largely symbolic in the face of a promised American veto, the permanent observer of the Palestinian Authority to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, held out hope prior to Monday's Security Council meeting that the bid would be accepted. ""We hope that the Security Council will shoulder its responsibility and address this application with a positive attitude, especially since we have 139 countries that have recognized the state of Palestine so far, meaning more than two-thirds majority,"" he said. ""We are ready to govern ourselves."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made the bid for the United Nations to recognize an independent state of Palestine on Friday, a move Israel says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns. Abbas drew applause when the Palestinian leader raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. The time has come for a ""Palestinian Spring"" to join the Arab Spring in reshaping the Middle East, he said. ""My people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity."" But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, later taking his turn to address the General Assembly, said Palestinians are looking for a ""state without peace,"" ignoring security concerns important to Israel. He said Palestinians are armed not only with their ""hopes and dreams,"" a phrase Abbas had used in his speech, but with ""10,000 missiles, and Grad rockets supplied by Iran, not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into Gaza."" ""Palestinians should first make peace with Israel and then get their state,"" he said, adding that peace must arrive through a two-state solution that recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. If that occurs, Israel ""will be the first"" to recognize Palestinian statehood, the prime minister said. Abbas' move prompted a call from the Middle East ""Quartet"" for new peace talks intended to come up with a breakthrough by the end of next year. Representatives from the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union discussed the request Friday and issued a statement saying the bid is before the U.N. Security Council. The group called for a ""preparatory meeting"" to take place within one month to outline how peace might be negotiated. Each side would then be tasked with producing a comprehensive proposal on territory and security issues within three months and ""to have made substantial progress with six months,"" the statement said. Abbas' speech provoked cheers and chants from flag-waving Palestinians who watched the address on a big-screen television in a square in Ramallah, the West Bank. His speech was closely watched across the Middle East. The hundreds who gathered in Ramallah greeted the news that he had formally filed the request with cheers, song and dance. Demonstrations took place Friday in New York and in cities across the Middle East as demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and chanted slogans in shows of solidarity. On Friday, a Palestinian was killed and 17 were wounded in clashes with Israeli settlers and Israeli forces in the village of Qusra, Palestinian officials reported. The Israel Defense Forces said they had gone to the village after receiving a report that settlers and Palestinians were hurling stones at each other; when they arrived, about 300 Palestinians began attacking the IDF soldiers, who responded with riot-control methods and live fire. The IDF said it was investigating the incident. Also Friday, an Israeli man and his year-old son were killed when their car drove off the road near the settlement of Kiryat Arba. The Israeli police and IDF initially treated the incident as a routine road accident, but an examination of the body has led them to reassess that view. ""We confirmed he had been injured as a result of being struck in the head, which probably caused him to lose control of the car; this indicates to us the strong possibility that he was struck by Palestinian stone throwers in an act of terrorism,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The Palestinian Authority's Ministry of State, which records violent acts by settlers against Palestinians, said the number of violent incidents rose between September 18 and24. The ministry cited an incident in Qusra, where olive trees were set afire and stones thrown at cars carrying Palestinians. U.S. President Barack Obama has said he supports Palestinian statehood but reiterated a longstanding U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions. While a U.S. veto would block the bid for full U.N. membership, the General Assembly could still vote to upgrade the status of Palestinians, who currently hold the status of non-voting observer ""entity."" The body could change that status to permanent observer ""state,"" identical to the Vatican's standing at the United Nations. Hamas, the dominant of two Palestinian political groups, has maintained that neither a U.N. application nor direct negotiations with Israel would provide the Palestinian people ""with what they're looking for."" ""Abbas' emotional speech succeeded in moving people's feelings, but his description of Palestinian suffering is different from reality,"" said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. Hamas controls Gaza, while Abbas' Fatah organization holds the West Bank.

"(CNN) -- While snow from a massive winter storm system continued to fall Wednesday night in parts of the Northeast, millions in the Midwest were left to dig themselves out, brave dangerously frigid temperatures and cope with sporadic power outages. An Arctic cold front followed the storm that dumped nearly 2 feet of snow in some locales, complicating cleanup efforts and spurring freeze warnings that spanned much of the nation's midsection. In much of Wisconsin, for instance, wind chill values were expected between 20 and 25 degrees below zero Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Still, Green Bay Packers fans down in north Texas ahead of their team's Super Bowl showdown with the Pittsburgh Steelers only got a relative respite, temperature-wise. In Arlington, Texas, site of Sunday's game, there was a wind chill advisory in effect due to very cold conditions that made the temperature feel between zero and minus-10 degrees, and several inches of snow and ice had a debilitating effect in parts of Dallas, Fort Worth and their surrounding areas. ""It was funny to see a whole city shut down. Everything was closed,"" said Packers' defensive lineman Ryan Pickett. ""In Green Bay, this is just a normal day."" The problems facing Texas were largely because of icy conditions exacerbated by cold temperatures. Besides slick roads, Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement that the weather put an unprecedented demand on the state's energy grid, leading to power outages Wednesday that were expected to continue into Thursday. Furthermore, 50 power  plants were out statewide due to the extreme weather,  leading to a 10%-15% reduction in electricity production, said the  state's utility commission  spokesman Terry Hadley. The commission said in a statement  that rotating outages would be  limited to 10 to 45 minutes, unless equipment fails due to a power surge  during the restoration process. It's all part of the effects of a storm system that blanketed 30 states with a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain over several days, producing record-breaking accumulations in several Midwest locales, making for treacherous travel on snow-choked roadways and forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights. The huge  demand for information caused sporadic outages for the National Weather Service's  web servers, which struggled to handle a deluge of 10 million to 20  million hits per hour, officials said. The site normally get 70 million hits per day. The last of the storm was drenching the Northeast late Wednesday, dumping freezing rain and snow in much of southern New England. While the amounts were less there than what some had forecast previously, the cumulative effect of relentless precipitation had a crippling impact in places. In Massachusetts, for instance, a number of roofs collapsed under the weight of rain-soaked snow, including the roof of a large commercial building in the town of Easton, according to fire captain David Beals. Up to 100 employees were evacuated prior to the collapse, he said. No injuries were reported. About 800 miles away, residents of Chicago were recovering from the system, which at times hit the Windy City hard with its combination of strong gusts and blinding precipitation. O'Hare International Airport received a record-breaking 20.2 inches of snow, according to the weather service. Raymond Roscoe, chief of staff for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, said that many motorists remained stuck in their cars throughout the night, while others abandoned their vehicles. Police, fire department and sanitation crews spent much of the night pulling people out of their cars, he said. Roscoe said there were no reports of injuries. ""There were no cars or people on the street and you couldn't see the buildings nearby because of the thick snow,"" said city resident Sruthi Swaminathan. ""The only thing you could see clearly were the lights from the Chicago theater."" The good news was that the blizzard warnings for northeastern Illinois, including the Chicago metropolitan area, were called off. Still, even as the snow tapered off, forecasters said wind chills may fall to 20 to 40 degrees below zero late Wednesday. ""The wind on the lake shore is beyond belief,"" said Chicago resident Anni Glissman. ""It almost knocks you over."" Elsewhere, Illinois State Police carried out a rescue operation in Kankakee County after 20 cars were stranded in the snowstorm, where snowdrifts were measured at about 3 feet, the agency said. The rescued motorists were taken to temporary warming centers in Manteno or Peotone, said state police Sgt. Angie Kinstner. In Wisconsin, the Department of Transportation reported that Interstate 42 and Interstate 94 were impassable south of Milwaukee. The National Guard was making a sweep of the interstates for stranded motorists. On Wednesday night, President Barack Obama approved a request from Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and approved an emergency disaster declaration for all the state's 77 counties, a move that will expedite post-storm assistance, according to a statement from FEMA.  Fallin had declared a state of emergency on Monday in advance of the storm, a release from the state's Department of Emergency Management said. A 20-year-old Moore, Oklahoma, woman died after hitting her head while sledding during the storm, the statement said. Many others were injured in Oklahoma -- 77 in falls, four in carbon monoxide poisonings, 13 with cuts, 24 in road accidents, two with frostbite and five in other storm-related injuries, according to the state health department. In addition, the state highway patrol responded to 81 storm-related crashes and 278 calls from motorists seeking help. And nationwide, the storm crippled air travel through much of the Midwest and the Northeast, as major carriers cancelled thousands of flights that stranded tens of thousands of passengers. Airports were set to get back on track Thursday, with Amtrak also announcing that service should return to normal then along the Eastern seaboard. The other glimmer of hope came from the world's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil. Wednesday morning, from his perch right in the middle of the storm track in central Pennsylvania, Phil didn't see his shadow. According to a tradition dating back 100 years, that means spring will come early this year.

"(CNN) -- Last Wednesday, a Twitter fight erupted between technology experts Michael Arrington, founder and former editor of TechCrunch, and Vivek Wadhwa, a technology researcher and writer, after a screening of CNN's documentary, ""The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley."" Arrington said a few very clear things about his view of the state of diversity in Silicon Valley. Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a ""big brain."" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, ""You people don't make good CEOs."" First, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it. But not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software. Consumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers. But the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors. Why is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are ""like them"" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called ""pattern matching."" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of ""personhood,"" they are excited. Watch trailer for CNN documentary ""The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley"" These patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are ""better,"" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs. But if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got. To be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, ""You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?"" Never happens. But I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel ""comfortable"" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them. Soledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing) They focus on the ""patterns"" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of many investors' ideal pattern, but so are perhaps unacknowledged criteria like race, gender, cultural affinity, etc. On some level this should not be shocking, as it reflects socialization that all of us must work hard and consciously not to act on. Is this racist/sexist/ageist? Well, in this context, using incendiary labels is only likely to make people more defensive. The bigger question is, is it a problem? Absolutely. It's not just a personal impression. In a recent study, industry analyst CB Insights found that less than 1% of all venture capital money went to digital start-ups with African-American founders in 2010. Is it possible to overcome these barriers? I have. I have developed successful, best-selling, award-winning products and I have raised tens of millions of dollars. But it is only by a sheer persistence and focus that few other people -- white, black, or otherwise -- have. I would never suggest that I am smarter than anyone else, but my Arnold-Schwarzenegger-in-""Terminator""-like determination has made my successes possible. Yes, I have definitely had help and support, but compared to some, not so much. In fact, some people get far more support than others. For example, when a top tier venture capitalist writes a $5 million check to a 19-year-old with a barely beyond napkin stage idea, no customers and a fragile technology because they ""present well,"" then clearly something else is at work beyond merit. This exact scenario may not be common, but it does happen. But it does not happen for African-American, or for that matter, Latino or female entrepreneurs. So the bottom line is, if the level of determination that I have was required from everyone, no matter their race, on some kind of moderately equal basis, it would indeed be a level playing field -- a meritocracy. But it's not. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hank Williams.","Hank Williams:TechCrunch founder recently called Silicon Valley a meritocracy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 35-year-old Florida man accused of being a ""hackerazzi"" pleaded not guilty Tuesday in federal court to charges of hacking into celebrities' e-mail accounts. Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, is accused of hacking into e-mail accounts and devices belong to more than 50 people, including entertainers Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera, Mila Kunis, Simone Harouche and Renee Olstead, prosecutors said. During Tuesday's arraignment in Los Angeles, the federal judge increased Chaney's bail to $110,000 from $10,000 in the wake of three new accusations of cyberstalking -- including one celebrity victim who wasn't identified and was allegedly cyberstalked after authorities seized Chaney's computer earlier this year. Two other victims, including a 13-year-old, have told authorities that they were cyberstalked before the computer seizure, prosecutors said. Chaney was expected to post bail after his mother indicated she would put up the family home as collateral. If he posts bail, Chaney will be subject to electronic monitoring and can't possess any computers, the judge said. The judge set a December 27 trial date. Chaney allegedly accessed nude photos of some of the celebrities during the hacking, and a recently circulated nude photo of Johansson is part of the federal investigation, prosecutors said. Chaney also allegedly used public sources to mine data about his victims, which included both males and females, all associated with the entertainment industry, authorities said. Authorities allege that once Chaney hacked into a celebrity's e-mail account, he would use the contact lists to find other celebrities' e-mail accounts. This allowed him to add new victims, authorities charge. Johansson told Vanity Fair magazine she is not ashamed of the photo. ""I know my best angles,"" she said in an article published Tuesday. ""They were sent to my husband. ... There's nothing wrong with that."" Johansson is now divorced from her husband at the time, Ryan Reynolds. Chaney has been indicted on nine counts of computer hacking for gain, eight counts of aggravated identify theft and nine counts of illegal wiretapping, prosecutors said. If convicted of the 26 counts, Chaney would face a maximum of 121 years in federal prison, prosecutors said. The aggravated identity theft charge alone carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, prosecutors added. Last month, Chaney said he became ""addicted"" to the intrusion and ""didn't know how to stop."" ""I deeply apologize. I know what I did was probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience,"" Chaney told CNN affiliate WAWS/WTEV in Jacksonville, Florida, last month. ""And these people don't have privacy to begin with. And I was in that little sliver of privacy they do have,"" he said. In the interview, Chaney said the hacking ""started as curiosity and it turned into just being, you know, addicted to seeing the behind-the-scenes of what's going on with these people you see on the big screen every day."" ""It just happened and snowballed,"" he said, adding that he wishes it had never begun. Chaney said he felt ""almost relieved months ago"" when authorities seized his computer because ""I didn't know how to stop doing it myself. I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. It just -- I don't know."" Authorities allege that Chaney distributed photos of the celebrities that he obtained illegally and offered them to various celebrity blog sites, but he didn't seek money in exchange. Some of the illegally obtained files, including private photographs, were ultimately posted online ""as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,"" authorities said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Colombia is preparing to hand over to U.S. officials a Dallas teenager who was mistakenly deported after she ran away from home more than a year ago, the South American country's foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday night. Jakadrien Turner will be turned over to diplomatic officials Friday so she can be transported to the United States, the statement said. But the foreign ministry did not say when -- or how -- that will happen. The U.S. Embassy in Bogota is working with Colombian authorities but cannot provide additional details ""due to privacy considerations,"" said a U.S. State Department official who asked to remain anonymous per department policy. Jakadrien somehow wound up deported to Colombia after U.S. authorities mistook the girl, who lacked identification, for a Colombian national. Family members said Thursday night that they were thrilled at the news that the 15-year-old would be returning home. ""It's a giant step. I'm relieved, but I won't be completely relieved until I get her in my arms again,"" the girl's mother, Johnisa Turner, said. ""A weight has definitely been lifted."" Grandmother Lorene Turner said U.S. Embassy officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to U.S. officials. ""When I heard those words I didn't hear nothing else. I flipped out. I can't wait,"" she said. But Jakadrien's family was still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a U.S. citizen with no knowledge of Spanish -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name. The teen's family had been searching for her since she ran away in the fall of 2010. Her grandmother scoured Facebook looking for the girl, viewing Jakadrien's friends' pages for any information. ""There's no words,"" Johnisa Turner told CNN of the ordeal. ""It hasn't been easy at all."" The Colombian Institute for Family Welfare confirmed Thursday that Turner is in its custody, is pregnant, and entered the country as an adult. The institute said Colombian authorities learned about the case a month ago. After Jakadrien went missing, the family managed to track her to Houston, where she worked at a DJ club under a different name. They tried to get help from authorities there, to no avail. Then, to the family's surprise, they learned their teenage daughter was in Colombia, partying with men and smoking marijuana. They later learned from a detective that Jakadrien was pregnant. How Jakadrien got to Colombia is a mystery to the family. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency maintains she was arrested in Houston for theft and told them she was an adult from Colombia. The agency says authorities believed her story because she maintained her false identity throughout the process. They handed her over to an immigration judge, who ordered her removed from the country. ""At no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false,"" the agency says. It says criminal database searches and biometric verification revealed no information to invalidate Jakadrien's claims. The family's attorney, Ray Jackson, says it doesn't make sense. ""They dropped the ball,"" he said. He says the immigration agency took Jakadrien's fingerprints but failed to match them to the name she gave. The name matched a woman wanted by Interpol, Jackson says, so they ""shipped her on through."" The agency says it is taking the allegations very seriously and is ""fully and immediately investigating the matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of the case."" For months, family members said they frantically searched for signs of the missing teen. Jakadrien had run away once before, two weeks earlier, her mother said, and Jakadrien told her the family didn't give her enough freedom. Her good grades at school had dropped off, something Turner blamed on the normal problems of teenagers. In addition, Jakadrien's grandfather, her mother's father, had recently died. Turner said she contacted Dallas police, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Dallas transportation authorities. Nothing ever came of it, she said. Grandmother Lorene Turner said she then started following Jakadrien's best friend on Facebook. She eventually tracked her granddaughter to Houston, where she worked at a club under the name Tika Cortez. Johnisa Turner said she saw Jakadrien's face on the marquee on her birthday. ""Oh my god,"" the mother said when she saw it. ""Is this really happening? Is that my child?"" A picture on Cortez's Facebook page further confirmed for the family that the girl with the different name was their daughter. The picture had been taken of Jakadrien with her grandmother. Though her grandmother had been cut out of the picture, her hair still showed on the edge. Her mother said she told Dallas authorities what she had found. Then, Jakadrien's Facebook page suddenly said she was in Colombia. The family later learned she had been arrested in Houston for shoplifting, but they say they had no idea how she wound up in Colombia after the arrest. The family's concerns grew when the detective told them that Jakadrien is pregnant, her mother said. Johnisa Turner said she believes her daughter was coerced along the way, with someone promising her something that led her to maintain a fake story about who she is. Jackson says he believes something more sinister is going on. ""There has to be something behind this 15-year-old girl ending up in Colombia, besides the fact that ICE dropped the ball,"" he said. ""Of all the nicknames ... to pick one that's of Latino descent, for that to be a name that sticks and gets you deported, that doesn't make sense."" Pictures of Jakadrien in Colombia showed her sitting on men's laps smoking marijuana, her grandmother said. But Jakadrien, she said, seemed to be reaching out for help, listing on Facebook the names of everyone at parties, perhaps so she could be traced. Jackson says he doesn't believe Jakadrien was trying to fake her way out of the country by using the false name throughout the process. ""I don't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government,"" Jackson says. ""You know, kids are scared when they get around authorities. ... To think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity, it just doesn't make sense."" Colombia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that Jakadrien first arrived in Bogota after she was deported on May 23. The ministry said it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in Texas requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings, and how Jakadrien received work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government's ""Welcome Home"" program. Attorneys with the program made a sworn declaration in front of a notary with ""inexact information"" that allowed her to receive work papers, the foreign ministry said. ""Those lawyers are no longer providing services to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the statement said. The teen was placed in a protection program by the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare on December 1 after officials learned of her situation, the foreign ministry said. Ed Lavandera, Jorge Asdrubal Garcia Romero, Luis Carlos Velez and Nick Valencia contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: ""I flipped out. I can't wait,"" the teen's grandmother says .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide. A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods. But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats. Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction. ""The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,"" a Red Cross bulletin said. Bangkok's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate, with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. ""We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,"" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. ""The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. And the worst might not yet be over. Another high tide -- expected to reach about 4 meters (13 feet) high -- is forecast for Sunday morning. Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported. The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit. Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Kocha Olarn, Ivan Cabrera, Moni Basu, Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.","Some areas outside of central Bangkok are covered in waist-deep water .

"Lake Geneva, Wisconsin (CNN) -- For years, Jennifer Cervantes struggled to make ends meet. She worked 30 hours a week at Wal-Mart, but her paycheck -- along with child support and disability payments -- never seemed to cover living expenses for her and her five kids. Despite her best efforts, she kept falling further behind. ""Paying the rent, electric and gas -- it takes everything I have,"" she said. ""I don't like digging up change ... so I can buy the kids' food. I needed help somehow, somewhere."" Desperate, Cervantes decided to write a letter to Sal Dimiceli, whose newspaper column might be considered a ""Dear Abby"" for the down and out. Within a few weeks, Dimiceli showed up on her doorstep. They talked for a while, and then he offered to pay one month's rent as well as her outstanding gas and electric bills. He also went to the local grocery store and stocked the family's empty refrigerator. ""I was shocked,"" Cervantes said. ""I feel relieved. The kids are getting tired of macaroni cheese and Ramen soup every night."" It was just another day's work for Dimiceli, a 60-year-old real estate broker whose weekly column in the Lake Geneva Regional News focuses on people in dire straits. Through his column and his nonprofit, The Time Is Now To Help, Dimiceli has provided about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities. ""I'm just addicted to helping,"" he said. ""I don't have time to go to the show or golf. ... My fondness in life is helping my fellow Americans."" Dimiceli gets about 20 to 30 letters a week from people in the Lake Geneva area, and he investigates nearly all of them himself. He'll often visit people's homes to verify their circumstances. If someone appears to have a drug or alcohol problem, he refers them to other programs. And to make sure people are being honest about their situation, he'll open their cupboards to see how much food is in the house. ""I do not want to give a hard-earned dollar to someone who is taking advantage,"" he said. ""But once I verify that their need is genuine, my heart opens right up."" At that point, Dimiceli springs into action with his unique safety net. He'll start by meeting immediate needs, perhaps providing a hot meal or moving someone without heat into a warm motel room. Within a day or two, he'll take care of other basics, like paying overdue rent or turning on utilities. His rapid response is a point of personal pride. ""There's not any bureaucratic red tape, "" he said. ""I want to help people now."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . But Dimiceli doesn't stop there. He also goes over each recipient's budget and finds ways to stabilize their long-term situation -- maybe negotiating lower rent with their landlords, repairing their car or tapping his network of supporters to help find them a job. ""It's not just a Band-Aid to feed them for that day,"" Dimiceli said. ""We get them back on a track (so) that ... their pride is given back to them. They can catch up."" It's a level of personalized assistance that's almost hard to believe, but there are countless stories of Dimiceli's good works throughout Wisconsin and Illinois. The vast majority of people he helps are never even mentioned in his column. For nearly a year, Val and Al Hyner had been unemployed, using their savings to pay for a small motel room. With almost no money left, Val pawned her jewelry, including her wedding ring. Dimiceli showed up and helped the couple with gas cards and rent. And when he heard about Val's sacrifice, he dipped into his own pocket and made arrangements to get the ring back. ""Those that are in dire need, they'll sell all their personal belongings to survive,"" he said. ""I want to give them their self-esteem back. ... They need to hang onto parts of their life, and sentimental things are very important."" Such stories have become commonplace during the hard economic times of the past few years, and Dimiceli has been flooded with requests for help, even as his real estate business has taken a huge hit. He still gives away at least 20% of his income -- he estimates that he has given away a few million dollars of his own money over the years -- but in the last decade he has begun to rely more on donations to his nonprofit, which he started in 1989. He has also built a strong network of supporters to help him, along with his wife and four children. ""The movement has grown,"" he said. ""As fellow Americans, we're all together, helping each other. That's what it's all about."" Dimiceli is passionate about helping others because he knows what it's like to be poor. Born on the West Side of Chicago to a beautician and a tool-and-die maker, he said his family struggled because of his father's gambling habit. ""We moved like gypsies, being evicted a lot,"" he said. ""I know how it feels to watch your mother cry when the electricity is turned off and you have no food. ... It was hard."" When Dimiceli was 12, he got a job as a dishwasher so he could help out at home. Grateful, he promised God that if he ever became successful, he'd always help others in need. He has spent nearly all of his adult life making good on that vow. After he first found success as a rock concert promoter in the 1970s, Dimiceli began to give money to various charities. But when he realized that much of their money was spent on overhead, he decided he could do a better job himself and started helping people on his own around the Chicago area. He eventually started his nonprofit, vowing that every penny would go to help others. Dimiceli's philanthropy has gone through various phases. In the 1990s, he took an entire community in Illinois under his wing. But for the last decade or so, he has concentrated most of his work in the Wisconsin area where he now lives. Eight years ago, he was approached by a neighbor who knew about his work and asked him to write a column in the local paper. He agreed do it anonymously, adopting a pen name, W.C., to stand for With Christ. In recent years, he was persuaded to reveal his identity so that people would be encouraged to donate to his foundation. His column has become so popular that it now appears in a number of area papers. Dimiceli says that when he sees a pile of new letters, he gets anxious thinking about all of the people who need his help. He'll often work late into the night doing ""marathons of helping"" that leave him physically and emotionally exhausted. But every morning, he can't wait to start again. ""When people are in need, they often feel alone,"" he said. ""I want them to know someone cares about them. I want to (say): 'Come on, I have a little extra strength I want to share with you. Let's get you back on your feet.' "" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Endless stretches of beautiful white beaches, crystal clear water and stunning marine life: the west coast of Australia is an adventurer's playground. The often uncharted shores of the island continent offer travelers a unique mix of thrills and indulgence. This week the professional sailing world will turn its attention to West Australia's largest city, Perth, for one of the biggest events on the sport's calendar. The International Sailing Federation World Championships will be held in the coastal city. Twelve hundred athletes from 79 nations will take part in Perth 2011, the principle qualifier for the London 2012 Olympics. While those boats hit the water to battle it out for gold, most people prefer to take a more leisurely approach to one of the most rugged and striking coastlines in the world. ""The great thing about this coast is that the nature is still very much in charge,"" says John Longley, Perth 2011 event director and former America's Cup competitor. Despite the region being littered with protected inlets and charming swimming spots, some areas are not for the faint-hearted. ""It's wild country,"" says Longley. ""But the awards for the adventurous are plentiful."" Travelers who dare to explore can feel completely isolated from the rest of the world. It's a massive area with very few inhabitants. The state of Western Australia averages less than one person per square kilometer (0.4 square miles). ""You can quite easily find yourself sailing up to a bay and finding no one else around,"" says Lonely Planet writer Peter Dragicevich. The Swan River . The centerpiece of Perth, the Swan River is a perfect place to take in the city. At over one mile wide in parts and with several bays, finding a spot to drop anchor is not hard. Thanks to a thriving mining industry, Western Australia has flourished despite the current economic climate. Perth has been a big benefactor of the boom and the vibrancy of the city is not lost on visitors. ""Good restaurants in Perth are right up there with anywhere in the world,"" says Dragicevich. ""Everywhere people are pretty laidback and very welcoming of travelers."" Fremantle . Following the river, just south of Perth is Fremantle. This city is Western Australia's maritime home. ""If you're a keen sailing buff, it's a must see,"" says Dragicevich. Located along the water is the striking Western Australian Museum building which has a strong maritime flavor. The museum encompasses the Shipwreck Galleries which claims to be the leading maritime archeology museum in the southern hemisphere. ""WA has a history of shipwrecks and it does make for an interesting visit for the boatie,"" says Dragicevich. Voyage to bottom of the sea for Sir Francis Drake's remains . For travelers exploring the area by boat, Longley says Fremantle is the perfect pit stop for maintenance. ""The Fremantle Sailing Club is very well set up to receive cruising yachts."" Not too far west of Fremantle is Rottnest Island with plenty of bays to drop anchor in. With no cars allowed and beautiful inland waters, this island is perfect for a relaxing getaway. Margaret River . The Margaret River region in the state's south west is known for its world-class locally grown food and wine. But the area shouldn't be dismissed as one just for the wine lovers. Beautiful national parks border beaches with powdery sand and the world famous surf breaks make it ideal for those handy on a surf board. ""Some of the breaks have got names like 'suicide',"" explains Dragicevich. ""Those ones are not for beginners."" But right on the doorstep of the Margaret River is Geographe Bay with more family-friendly beaches ideal for swimming. Longley says sailors can find a well-established marina in the small city of Bunbury, located in the bay. Cape Naturaliste to Albany . The west coast of Australia is known as the ""humpback highway"" with tens of thousands of humpback whales passing on their annual migration to and from the Antarctic. There are many opportunities to see marine wildlife in its natural habitat up and down the coast, but one of the best spots to witness it first hand is in the very south-west corner of Australia. However, Longley warns that only the most competent of sailors should tackle this region. ""The western sides of the continent are always the wildest."" He explains there are few offshore reefs in this region, and while there are good windy conditions for sailing, it's not for the novice. ""Sailing around Cape Naturaliste, you're starting to get into pretty robust country and your skills need to go up a level,"" adds Longley. But if you make it to Albany this is where you're most likely to spot whales. North of Perth and beyond . The West Australian coastline north of Perth seems to stretch forever. Here more than ever sailors can feel completely isolated. North of the main port of Geraldton, Longley believes it's for only the most capable of mariners to explore. ""For those wanting an adventure, it's marvelous,"" he says. Longley adds that more and more superyachts are heading into these waters to discover the area. Even on land, travelers are struck by the remoteness of the region. ""One of the greatest joys of the West Australian coastline is the interaction you can have with the wildlife,"" says Dragicevich. There are opportunities to swim with dolphins right up and down the coast, and snorkeling at Ningaloo Reef is a highlight of the region. Shark attack hot spots identified on West Australian coast . Crocodiles can be found in the very north end of the state and there are sharks off many of the beaches. However Dragicevich says that while authorities are stepping up patrols in popular areas, the number of incidents involving humans are rare. ""It's certainly something to be aware of,"" he advises. ""Ask a local, but don't let it spoil your holiday because the odds are in your favor.""","The ISAF World Championships will be held in Western Australia this month .

"(Departures.com) -- St. Andrews and the surrounding Kingdom of Fife, on Scotland's east coast, present golfing visitors with such a bountiful harvest of links that there's no single ""correct"" itinerary that best covers the region. Many first-timers head straight for the slate of courses played in the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship -- the Old Course, modern classic Kingsbarns (greens fee, $295) and, crossing the nearby Tay Bridge into Angus, Carnoustie Golf Links (greens fee, $215). Perhaps the St. Andrews New Course (greens fee, $110), a tough-as-nails layout with the fastest greens in town, might be thrown in for good measure. These are all top choices, and of course the Old, with its supremely intricate design providing a different playing experience every time out, is an essential. But to make the most of one's time in St. Andrews, one should never simply be a big game hunter. Mixing in some of Fife's less-heralded courses adds quirk, variety, fun -- and likely a few more birdies. IN ST. ANDREWS . It's often overlooked that the St. Andrews Links Trust manages seven courses in and around the town, including the Balgove (greens fee, $20) and Strathtyrum (greens fee, $40) courses, both of which are beginner-friendly, with fewer hazards but the same wonderfully crisp links turf as their big brothers. Those looking for a stronger challenge on a full-sized course in town might try their hand at The Duke's (greens fee, $185), part of plumbing tycoon Herb Kohler's St. Andrews mini-empire. Renovated in 2006 by golf architect Tim Liddy, who also added five new holes, The Duke's is a stylish heathland design that would likely garner more attention were it situated in any other neighborhood. Holes like the seventh, a long dogleg right that begins with a dramatic drive from a hillside tee, and the 13th, a tricky par four with disarming views of St. Andrews, are well worth seeing. But make no mistake, this is not a links. While the turf is reasonably firm, The Duke's can't help but play more like an American course. For that reason, it's probably better to schedule a visit early in the itinerary, before all those little swing adjustments it takes to play links golf set in. Departures.com: Top hotel penthouses . OLD HICKORY . Fife's two newest courses opened the same week in the summer of 2008, and they couldn't be more different. One of them, the Links Trust's Castle Course (greens fee, $190), debuted with the hype of a Jerry Bruckheimer blockbuster -- and similarly mixed reviews. The other, which would not look at all out of place in an episode of Downton Abbey, opened (or, more accurately, reopened) quietly after a 69-year fallow period to become one of the most delightful golf experiences in Scotland. Tucked away in the verdant hills west of St. Andrews, Kingarrock Hickory Golf Course (greens fee, $40 for nine holes and $55 for 18) is a nine-hole, 2,022-yard country estate course that is played exclusively with antiquated equipment. Proprietor David Anderson, always nattily attired in tweeds and plus fours, provides visitors with hickory-shaft clubs and replica golf balls from either 1898 or 1924. These clubs -- for example, a mashie with a perfectly smooth face, a niblick resembling a designer spatula or a driver bearing the signature of a 19th-century Open champion -- are eccentric, to put it mildly, in both looks and performance. Hickory shafts bend far more readily than steel, and once out on the course, golfers quickly find that in order to make clean contact, their swing must take on a languid, half-speed rhythm. This adjustment builds an element of comedy into the proceedings -- even the most skilled players are bound to hit a few laughable shots -- but the beauty of it is that it's impossible to take this version of the game too seriously. It's still Real Golf, just on a smaller scale. After all, a par four of a mere 200 yards becomes plenty challenging when a good drive flies only about 150. The click of the soft ball against the persimmon clubhead reverberates through the player's hands and arms, a reminder of what modern technology, in its eternal quest for greater distance, has taken away from the game. Afterward, Anderson often joins visitors in the pro-shop cottage, where the yarns of the day are spun over ginger beer and homemade shortbread cookies. Kingarrock, in essence, is the kind of place that can change the way one thinks about golf. Departures.com: Perfect vacation villas to rent . THE CLIFF-HANGER . Catapulting back to the 21st century, a modern layout that's worth seeing is the Kittocks Course at the Fairmont St. Andrews (greens fee, $75-$140). The Fairmont property has always operated at a bit of a disadvantage because it's two miles outside of town (the resort runs shuttles back and forth), but it has a legitimate place on the scene. Many golfers gravitate toward the resort's Torrance Course, as it is considered the ""championship"" track (this August it hosted the Scottish Senior Open), but the Kittocks, designed by Bruce Devlin with an assist from a legendary Masters champion, the late Gene Sarazen, is almost as challenging and plays over a more appealing piece of land. Many holes either swoop down toward or run right along the North Sea -- the drivable par-four tenth by the cliff's edge is particularly exciting. Golfers frequently catch stirring glimpses of the St. Andrews skyline and the Grampian Mountains. Although the Kittocks Course is eminently walkable, golf carts are also permitted -- a point worth mentioning in a country where the motorized ""buggy"" is usually taboo. Given that visitors to St. Andrews frequently walk 36 holes or more a day for several days at a stretch, the chance to get off one's feet and still play a quality course should not be underestimated. Departures.com: Luxury safari camps . REAL CHARACTER . Time now for a classic. On the southern coast of Fife, about 20 minutes from St. Andrews, lies the former Royal Burgh of Elie and its eponymous links. The game has been played here in some form since 1548, and since 1875 the links have been overseen by The Golf House Club (greens fee, from $120). For pure charm, Elie has few peers -- this, along with its prime location between Edinburgh and St. Andrews, makes it a popular ""holiday club"" for members of both the Royal & Ancient Golf Club and the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (Muirfield). Elie's quirky character is evident from the very first hole, where tee shots are fired blindly over a hill. To ensure that the group ahead is safely out of range of the one that follows, a club member came up with a novel solution: The starter's hut is rigged with the periscope from a scrapped submarine, the HMS Excalibur. ""It's a sophisticated piece of equipment,"" says the starter, Ken Murray. ""The farther the distance [of the target], the better the resolution. On a clear day, I can swing it round and see them putting at Muirfield"" -- on the far side of the Firth of Forth, some eight miles away. Elie is a short course -- only 6,273 yards from the back tees -- but it's full of surprises. With its ball-eating rough, well-positioned bunkers and ingeniously contoured greens, it doesn't respect brute force without an equal degree of accuracy. It's a throwback to an age when golf courses were laid out in accordance with the natural terrain rather than forced into a standardized mold. Elie reaches its par of 70 through the unorthodox combination of 16 par-four holes and two par threes. The absence of par fives may come as a disappointment to flat-bellied bombers accustomed to chewing up such long holes, but they should still find an eagle chance or two: for example, the wonderful 288-yard tenth, a blind hole where a well-placed drive crests the rugged ridge and catches the downslope, then scrambles up to the green. But beware: With a helping wind, the long hitter runs the risk of driving the ball over the green and into perdition on the rocky beach. PUTTING AROUND . One of the best local diversions is the Himalayas Putting Course (fee, $3; The Links, St. Andrews), which probably delivers as much enjoyment per dollar as any course in Scotland. This tiny patch of land right next to the Old Course is one of the few bits of turf not controlled by the Links Trust -- it's owned by the St. Andrews Ladies Putting Club, which has operated the course since 1867. As the name might suggest, this continuous swath of green features some of the wildest, wooziest contouring anywhere, with humps, bumps and hollows galore to vex and delight golfers of all ages. The Himalayas has the same kind of lighthearted spirit as an inspired miniature golf course, but it's played on real links turf, so even the most serious players should find reason to smile. It's the perfect way to end a day at the Home of Golf. Departures.com: A global guide to yachting . Classic Golf Clubs . Should the temptation to return home with a set of hickories prove strong, consider paying a visit to Hamish Steedman and Ewan Glen at the St. Andrews Golf Company, a 130-year-old concern that's one of the world's last remaining manufacturers of playable hickory clubs. Sets start at $1,300; 20 St. Andrews Rd., Largoward, St. Andrews. Booking St. Andrews Old Course . For decades now, tee times at St. Andrews Old Course have been allotted through a byzantine ballot system. The drawing is conducted a day in advance, so visiting players -- unless they've made arrangements through a premium tour operator like Perry Golf or The Old Course Experience -- have to throw their names into the hat and cross their fingers. If it doesn't work out, they end up scrambling to find somewhere else to play on short notice. Fortunately, this policy is about to change. Starting in 2012, the ballot will be extended to two-day advance booking, which should make a world of difference.

"(Wired) -- Like Optimus Prime or Al Gore, the Droid Bionic is a robot in disguise. Sure, the Bionic looks like it's just a massive, industrial-styled phone, just like our favorite Transformer looked like nothing other than a badass eighteen-wheeler. But the Droid Bionic can also change into a laptop, a desktop workstation, and other things which are decidedly un-phone-like. We've been waiting to see a finished version of this phone since Motorola first showed off the Bionic in January. Though it was supposed to launch months ago on Verizon's 4G LTE network, Moto sent the phone back to the drawing board for improvements (ostensibly to better stack up against HTC's 4G LTE offering, the Thunderbolt). The phone came back as a connectivity beast with lots of optional peripheral attachments, turning the Bionic into a successor of sorts to the Atrix, Motorola's most recent dual-core, peripheral-enhanced handheld. Moto's premise is simple: Our phones are increasingly becoming more powerful, useful and versatile in our everyday lives. Why not allow them to adapt — or transform, if you will — to what we need them to be in different situations? The ""Lapdock,"" for instance, is literally a laptop shell driven by the Bionic. After plugging the phone into the station on the back hinge, the Bionic launches Motorola's ""webtop"" interface, which is essentially a desktop-lite environment powered by the phone's hardware. There's a catch to all of this connectivity, however: You'll have to pony up a lot of dough. The Lapdock accessory will run you $300, while the HD station — which gives you access to the same interface but lets you use your own keyboard, mouse and display — costs a C-note. Add a car charger, HDMI mini-display adaptor and navigation dock to that, and you're closing in on $1000. That's a hell of a lot of money to spend on tricking out your phone, even if it's no longer just a phone once you plug these things in. Of course, you don't have to buy an accessory to get a good experience out of a Bionic. But it somewhat misses the point if you don't. The draw of the device is in its shape-shifting capacity, a re-imagination of what a smartphone should be able to do. Otherwise, you'd probably be better off going with a similarly spec'd phone for a lower starting price — and those are definitely out there. Conceptually, ultra-connectivity is brilliant. With the Atrix and the Bionic, Motorola is trying to hard to differentiate from the existing glut of Android smartphones on the market. Execution, however, leaves much to be desired. Casual browsing on the Lapdock was wonky, stutter-filled and nothing like cruising the web on my tried-and-true laptop. The keys on the board were chintzy and small, most likely a casualty of keeping the cost of the peripheral below $300 (unlike the launch price of the Atrix's lapdock, which was a hefty $500). Desktop simulation on an HDTV through a webtop dock was a little less jerky, but still subpar. It takes some beef to run all the peripherals, and the handset itself is no slouch. Under the hood, this bad boy is packing more power than a Plymouth. It's running on a dual-core 1GHz chip backed by a gigabyte of RAM, 16GB of internal storage plus a microSD card slot. It ships with a 16GB card, but it can accept a card up to 32GB. Swiping through menu screens was snappier than most of the other phone I've tried this year — it's definitely one of the most responsive phones you can buy. My gaming experience on resource-heavy apps like Nova 2 HD was excellent. Given all the brawn, the Bionic requires a lot of juice to keep it running — and it certainly shows. After starting my day with a fully-charged phone, my battery was dead before the end of the workday. That's after moderate-to-heavy use. I made a few phone calls, used my data connection liberally, and pumped the screen brightness up to full blast (the display, by the way, isn't the sharpest I've seen). This is how we all use our phones, so I expected better battery performance. The real battery suck comes from the LTE radio. Leave your 4G turned on all day and you'll be dead before nightfall. Use your high-speed connectivity judiciously, however, and you may make it to midnight or beyond, even under normal use conditions. It's sad that we have to ration our own bandwidth use, but alas, that's the name of the game with today's devices. Thankfully, using Verizon's 4G network at full tilt is worth the energy drain. Our average download speeds clocked in around 10 Mbps in the San Francisco Bay Area on average, with upload speeds ranging from 4 to 6 Mbps. In short, the handset itself is speedy, powerful and — battery life aside — has all the stuff you want in a high-end smartphone. But so do four or five other Android options currently on the market. Unfortunately, the extra products that were supposed to tip the scales in the Bionic's favor end up falling far short of their potential. WIRED: Power, speed and connectivity options are damn near unrivaled in the mobile space. Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread is current, and well-skinned. HDMI, expandable microSD, DLNA, oh my! TIRED: Unless you're a baller, dropping this much coin on the Bionic and its accessories might leave you eating ramen noodles for a month. Battery life sucks.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Authorities expanded their search Friday for a 36-year-old Atlanta woman who was last heard from around Christmas and whose car was later found abandoned and running, according to police. No arrests have been made in the case of Stacey Nicole English, and there are no named suspects in her disappearance. Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos told CNN on Friday that authorities want to speak again with Robert Kirk, a St. Louis resident who earlier told police that he had stayed with English between December 24 and 26 in her residence in the Buckhead section of Atlanta. According to a police report, Kirk previously told investigators that English was ""acting peculiar and out of character"" during his stay, adding that ""she began screaming in the apartment and shouting biblical scriptures and indicating that the world was coming to an end."" He said that he left around 10:30 p.m. on December 26, after English ""began asking him if he was Satan"" and told him to leave ""her residence immediately."" A friend of the 36-year-old woman, Michelle Strothers, told police that she last saw English on that day or the next one. In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend ""appeared upset"" and told her ""she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her."" ""She also stated that Ms. English was acting out of character, and began discussing the end of the world and quoting biblical scriptures,"" said the police report. On Friday, search-and-rescue dogs joined mounted Atlanta police officers to comb part of south Atlanta, near the Aarons Amphitheatre at Lakewood, which sits in a fairground area, according to a police statement. English's car -- a white, 2006 Volvo -- had been earlier found in that area with its engine still running. ""We have no new updates to provide other than"" the enhanced search effort, Campos said Friday by e-mail. ""Investigators continue to pursue leads and work the case."" Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her ""several times a week"" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. They eventually used a spare key to enter her apartment, where they saw ""no sign of English,"" the police report said. In the apartment were English's iPad, cell phone and key fob allowing her entry to her apartment complex, all of which her parents said the woman always took with her. The mother, Cynthia Jamison, said that English ""was currently taking medication"" and had attempted suicide by overdose a little more than two years ago, according to police. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","Stacey Nicole English, 36, was last seen just after Christmas, witnesses tell police .

"(CNN) -- Morocco's king asked the head of a moderate Islamist party to form a government Tuesday, state media said, after the party claimed victory in the country's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms this summer. The Islamist Justice and Development Party, or PJD, is expected to form a coalition government after it won 107 of the 395 seats contested in Friday's vote. King Mohammed VI appointed Abdelilah Benkirane, the party's secretary-general, as head of the new government Tuesday and asked him to form a Cabinet, the official news agency MAP reported. Benkirane, a former managing director of three newspapers and a father of six, was elected secretary-general of the PJD in 2008, MAP says. According to its website, the PJD previously participated in elections in 1997, 2002 and 2007. The party won 46 seats in 2007 and 42 in 2002, after taking just nine seats in 1997. Lise Storm, senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, said the PJD's result this time round constituted ""remarkable progress -- much higher than anticipated by anyone, and also much, much better than any of the party's competitors."" The margin of victory for the PJD surprised many observers, she said, and suggests that those protesting against the country's governing elite in recent months are truly fed up. ""I think we are witnessing an Islamist wave in the Middle East, with so-called Islamist moderates winning not only in Turkey, but also in Tunisia and Morocco, and possibly also in Egypt,"" Storm said. ""It gives an indication of the sentiments of the general population in these countries, and (of) the state of the political opposition there too, as the Islamists in many cases have been the most visible opposition force, and the best organized too."" The PJD is more moderate than Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party or the Islamists who won power in Tunisian elections last month, Storm said. The party's online mission statement lists three values -- authenticity, justice and development -- and makes little mention of Islam. Authenticity ""has to be consistent with our values, culture and civilization, with the incorporation and respect for the cultural, linguistic and ethnic groups, within the space of the Islamic brotherhood,"" the statement says. Under the new constitution, approved by referendum in July, both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened. The changes -- which mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- came after thousands of Moroccans took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year, inspired by what became known as the Arab Spring. The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","The Justice and Development Party won 107 of 395 seats in Friday's election .

"(CNN) -- ""Joe Frazier is tied forever, almost by an umbilical chord, with Mohammad Ali because they obviously had a famous trilogy of fights, of which the first and the last were epic fights."" The words of respected boxing journalist Jeff Powell. Powell, a columnist for British newspaper The Mail has covered boxing all over the world and knew 'Smokin' Joe' -- who died on Monday aged 67 after a short battle with liver cancer -- both inside and outside the ring, having reported on his fights during the halcyon period of heavyweight boxing in the early 1970s. Speaking to CNN Sport following the announcement of Frazier's death, Powell said: ""In the American consciousness Joe is seen as the man who defined Ali in many ways. ""The first fight was called 'The Fight of the Century' and took place in Madison Square Garden in 1971. Ali had called Frazier an 'Uncle Tom' before the fight and it bought a racial dimension to it. ""When Frazier tore up the script and knocked down Ali, inflicting his first defeat, there were riots all over the country."" Powell added: ""Frazier was very much part of American folklore and respected around the world. He begrudged for many years the things Ali said about him, not only the 'Uncle Tom' insult, but also calling him a 'gorilla' before their epic 'Thrilla in Manila' in 1975. ""It took Joe a while to get over that -- but he was a nice guy and there is a strong sense of nostalgia about him passing, he is very much part of the fabric of American fight history."" The likes of Ali, Frazier, George Foreman and Ken Norton will go down in history as some of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time and Powell concedes that when they were all at the top of their game in the 1970's, the division was stronger than it has ever been. ""I think most people would probably put Joe in the top 10 heavyweights of all time,"" continued Powell. ""He had a fantastic left hook with which he not only knocked Ali down but broke his jaw in the first fight. ""But that was a tremendous heavyweight generation. If you won the world title back then, you did so against very good fighters. Joe took the title off Jimmy Ellis, who was a good fighter and lost it to George Foreman -- who we all know about too. ""There have been other great generations. Mike Tyson reinvigorated the division in the late 1980s, Evander Holyfield was a huge player and Lennox Lewis was a superb champion as well. ""But at times like this you do look back with a sense of nostalgia and romance. Looking back it probably wasn't too romantic, because it was a tough time, but that's the mood in America at the moment."" Not only was Frazier a world class fighter, but Powell knew him as a kindly man, who sadly ended up in some poverty towards the end of his life. ""Joe was a much simpler, straight-forward character than Ali. He liked the social life and had 11 children but unfortunately he was let down in a land deal which would have made him financially comfortable for life."" Powell added: ""He was a little resentful towards the end of his struggles with money. He was the one who didn't make as much as Ali and Foreman, who were the only two men to beat him, and was somewhat overshadowed from the public perspective by his relationship with Ali. ""But he was a formidable fighter in his own right and will always be remembered as the first man to beat Ali. That has bookmarked his place in history.""","Joe Frazier will always be associated with his epic trilogy of fights against Mohammad Ali .

"(CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed and numerous others injured in a reported grenade attack at a casino in Monterrey, Mexico, the capital of Nuevo Leon, according to attorney general in that northern state. The incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) at the Casino Royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived, and one threw three grenades into the building. There were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire. Between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions, said Cmdr. Angel Flores with the Green Cross. Video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building. Mexican President Felipe Calderon sent the following statement from his official Twitter account (translated from Spanish): ""With deep consternation, I express my solidarity with Nuevo Leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism."" He added more: ""These reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals. All the support to NL (Nuevo Leon)."" About five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities, local journalist Javier Estrada reported. Gustavo Madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino. He said his wife, Martha, and her sister, Miriam Gonzalez, were inside. Authorities have not identified any of the victims. So far, no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside. The Mexican Army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's top national security spokesman, said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that Calderon has spoken to the governor of Nuevo Leon to offer support. Poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible. ""They will pay for their crimes. ... We will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility."" The National Commission on Human Rights in Mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino. ""The priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the United Mexican States and international treaties. The commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law, carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence."" ""The National Commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons."" The NHRC says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians, psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities. Nuevo Leon, in northeastern Mexico, has seen several grenade attacks so far this year. On August 13, four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of Apodaca. In July, gunmen entered a downtown bar in Monterrey and shot 20 people dead. A public safety spokesman told CNN the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the El Sabino Gordo nightclub, where drugs were allegedly sold. Nuevo Leon and the neighboring states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups. The Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the United States. In November 2010, the federal government launched the Coordinated Operation Northeast, which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime.

"(CNN) -- Lori Berenson, an American activist convicted of aiding Peruvian terrorists, returned to Peru after spending the holidays with her family in New York, family members said. Berenson is on parole in Peru through 2015 but was given permission to leave the country to be with her family. The move was controversial because some believed that Berenson would not come back to Peru to complete her sentence. She returned Thursday night to Lima on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, said her mother, Rhoda Berenson. ""That is the law and she had to do it,"" she said. Rhoda Berenson said the family's time together was appreciated and that she expects her daughter to return to the United States at the end of her sentence in 2015. Under the permission granted by the court, Berenson could have remained in the United States until January 11. Berenson was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 for collaborating with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to attack the nation's Congress and overthrow the government. Her sentence was reduced to 20 years on appeal. She was released from Lima's Chorrillos Penitentiary in November 2010 after a Peruvian court granted her parole. In 2009, while in prison, Berenson gave birth to a son who was fathered by Apari, her estranged husband who is also her attorney. The boy lived with her in prison until her release.

"(CNN) -- A huge aid effort is under way in a remote area of South Sudan to help an estimated 60,000 people who fled their homes to escape roaming fighters, the United Nations said. Some 6,000 armed men from the Lou Nuer tribe marched on an area of Jonglei state, which is home to the rival Murle tribe, attacking the town of Pibor last weekend. Although the Lou Nuer fighters have left, following negotiations with U.N. peacekeepers and the South Sudan authorities, help is urgently needed for those who fled, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said Friday. The special representative for the U.N. Secretary-General in South Sudan, Hilda F. Johnson, is traveling to Pibor on Saturday to see the situation, UNMISS spokesman Kouider Zerrouk said. The South Sudan government has declared Jonglei a ""humanitarian disaster area"" and appealed for international help. Aid workers estimate that 60,000 people are in need of assistance and the U.N. World Food Programme voiced concern Friday that food shortages in the area ""could reach crisis levels."" It has already made emergency food deliveries. U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande said some of the people who fled into the bush to escape the fighters are starting to return to their homes, according to a statement. U.N planes are also trying to find other families still hiding out in the bush, she said. ""But there are a number of villages that were burned completely to the ground, for example, Likuangole, and in that case people are not coming back and that's because there is nothing to come back to,"" she said. Ethnic tensions in Jonglei state have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, leading to cattle raids and abduction of women and children. Government officials have urged the two ethnic groups to return women and children abducted in the spate of violence. The violence in Jonglei state is the latest to rock South Sudan, which officially gained its statehood in July after separating from neighboring Sudan to the north. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres is also in South Sudan this weekend, to see other areas affected by conflict. Among them will be a refugee site in Mabaan, where tens of thousands of refugees have sought help since fleeing fighting across the border in Sudan's Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. U.N. flights have delivered thousands of tents, kitchen sets, blankets, jerry cans, plastic sheets, sleeping mats, mosquito nets and other essential items to Mabaan and another refugee camp at Malakal in the past two-and-a-half weeks. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July, human rights monitors expressed concerns that long-standing grievances could end in violence consuming the region again. The United Nations estimates that more than 1,100 people died and 63,000 were displaced last year by inter-communal violence in Jonglei state, not taking into account the latest clashes. U.S. President Barack Obama gave his approval Friday for the sale of weapons and defense services to South Sudan. The decision could open the door to South Sudan acquiring air defenses. It has accused Sudan of carrying out aerial bombardments on its territory. The White House condemned air raids by the Sudan Armed Forces on South Sudan in November, saying: ""These provocative aerial bombardments greatly increase the potential for direct confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan. The memorandum sent by Obama Friday to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the ""furnishing of defense articles and defense services to the Republic of South Sudan will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.""

"(CNN)  -- A Malaysian model, who was set to become the first woman to be caned in the southeast Asian country for drinking beer in public, had her sentence postponed Monday until the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno's punishment is unique in that she has opted to go through with it. Authorities had picked up Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32, from her father's house Monday morning and were taking her to a prison in the eastern state of Pahang when the van turned around and brought her back. ""They sent her back to the house. They said the top official asked them not to bring her to Kuala Lumpur,"" said Kartika's father, Shukarno Abdul Muttalib. Authorities in Pahang said the delay would run until the month of fasting ends. Monday was the third day of Ramadan. An Islamic, or sharia, court in Pahang had fined Kartika -- a Muslim -- $1,400 (5,000 Malaysian ringgit) and sentenced her to six strokes with a rattan cane for drinking at a hotel bar two years ago. Kartika, a 32-year-old part-time model and mother of two, was visiting Malaysia from Singapore at the time. She pleaded guilty, paid the fine, and wanted her caning to be carried out in public.  Watch more on Kartika's release » . She said she lost her job as a nurse in Singapore and took up part-time modeling to support her husband in raising their two children. Her son has cerebral palsy; her daughter a heart condition. ""I want to move on. This case has been hanging over me for a long time,"" she told CNN last week. On Monday morning, Kartika hugged her children, bade a tearful goodbye to the throngs of people gathered at her father's house, and boarded the van. She was to be taken to a prison on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. The caning would have been carried out within seven days of that, making her the first woman to be caned in Malaysia under sharia law. Kartika's punishment is unique in that she has opted to go through with it. Two other Malaysians sentenced to the same fate have filed appeals, the Syariah (Sharia) Lawyers' Association of Malaysia said. The case drew widespread attention and condemnation, in and outside Malaysia. The moderate Muslim country has a dual-track justice system, in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil courts. Muslims -- who make up about 60 percent of the 28 million who populate the country -- are forbidden from consuming alcohol. Other religious groups are exempt. Though caning is used as a supplementary punishment in Malaysia for at least 40 crimes, such as rape or immigration violations, it is not meted out by Malaysia's civil court for alcohol consumption. But the country's civil system also cannot overrule a sharia court sentence. In this respect, Kartika would have been the first woman to be caned for violating the country's religious laws. ""Regardless of whether or not such penalties fall under Syariah law or civil law, we believe that these should be repealed, as they go against the fundamental human right to be free from torture and violence,"" said Haslinah Yaacob, vice president for the All Women's Action Society.

"New York (CNN) -- The occupiers of Wall Street have been portrayed by some as radicals, young kids without focus, ne'er-do-wells who'd do anything but get a job. But one woman used her time in at Zuccotti Park differently, and as a result she has gone from Occupy Wall Street to occupying an actual office on Wall Street. In the gathering of the so-called 99%, Tracy Postert had no idea she would be the one who would be working for the 1%. ""There were some days it was a carnival, or lots of music, drumming, costumes, marching, protesting,"" said Postert, describing the weeks she spent demonstrating at the park in downtown Manhattan. Frustrated with the economy, Postert says she jumped right into the Occupy Wall Street movement -- all in -- banging drums and washing paint- and dirt-covered sidewalks. She sounds like the protester stereotype, but she isn't; she has a doctorate in biochemistry. In the past few years, the biochemist said, she had found herself at times unemployed or underemployed. Until a few weeks ago she decided to change her protest sign to a ""Job Wanted"" sign and hunkered down in Zuccotti Park with a handful of résumés. ""Passers-by would say, 'Get a job,' and I didn't have a really good response to that,"" Postert told CNN. ""I wanted to say, 'Well, I'm trying to get a job,' but you know you can't really prove it."" Postert said. ""So I said, why don't I make a sign (and prove) that I am actively looking for a job?"" Within two days, she said, someone spotted her. They exchanged e-mails, and an offer followed. That someone was a top executive at a Wall Street financial firm -- in other words, the enemy. ""It might sound like it's a fish-out-of-water story -- (round) peg in a square hole -- but it's really not,"" said Wayne Kaufman, a market analyst at John Thomas Financial. ""She was standing there. She had her sign, she had her résumé, and I just passed by her and I chatted with her just for a brief few seconds. And she was obviously an intelligent person,"" Kaufman said. ""The résumé spoke for itself, it was very impressive,"" he said. ""So, I sent her an e-mail the next day and ... she responded almost immediately. ""I asked her if she wanted to come in for an interview; she said yes. I told her what I had in mind for her according to her skill set, and the rest is just history."" For now, Tracy is researching early stage biotech companies for John Thomas Financial. She says she plans to take a test that would allow her to become a broker, and thus a full-fledged member of the 1%. So what are her former Occupy Wall Street compatriots saying? ""I have been accused of being a traitor to both sides. Some people are saying that the whole time I was at Occupy Wall Street I was really a Wall Street insider,"" says Postert. She said she plans on keeping her sign. She pledged to protest again when she finds something she feels is worth protesting.","Tracy Postert was fully committed to the Occupy Wall Street protests, she tells CNN .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Four years ago, Matthew McConaughey's relationship with Brazilian model Camila Alves was revealed to PEOPLE in a 2007 cover story. ""She likes roughing it,"" a source said at the time. ""She doesn't complain when they go hiking for 10 days without clean clothes or a shower."" On Christmas Day, McConaughey's longtime love -- and mother of his two children, Levi, 3, and Vida, who turns 2 in January -- became his fiancÃ©. ""just asked camila to marry me,"" the actor, 42, wrote on his WhoSay account. ""merry Christmas."" Their road to engagement took nearly five years -- the couple met in 2006 -- but now that the question has been popped, PEOPLE takes a look at their show-stopping, not to mention sexy, romance. 'The Right Woman' When he was crowned PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive in 2005, McConaughey said he'd get married one day -- when ""I'm with the right woman and it's the right time."" A year later, he was facing engagement rumors. ""Everyone is convinced he'll be with her for a long time, if not forever,"" a source close to the actor told PEOPLE in October 2007 about the actor's relationship with the down-to-earth beauty, now 29. A month before, they had moved into a $1.1 million modular home in Malibu. They already had mystery matching rings. The couple continued to step out together. ""They were laughing the entire time,"" said an onlooker who glimpsed McConaughey and Alves at a Japanese restaurant in November 2007. ""What a great couple."" Baby on the Way . Their relationship quickly went from sexy to serious: In early 2008, McConaughey told his fans that he was starting a family with Alves. That summer, they welcomed their first son, Levi. ""He's a man -- he's my man -- and we're a family,"" Alves gushed months later. ""He's the best dad he can be -- 100 percent hands-on."" McConaughey called his leading lady ""the love of my life."" However, marriage wasn't on McConaughey's mind. ""It's just not something I plan on doing right now, and that I feel like I need to do right now,"" he told reporters in April 2009 while promoting his romantic comedy, ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past."" ""It's not an institution I'm against at all. I'm actually for it, believe in it and have seen it actually be very, very healthy for many relationships."" Kissing and Telling . The couple rung in the New Year with a new baby in 2010: daughter Vida. And with an acting career and a family life to balance, the actor was taking his romance with Alves to new heights. ""We went up to 3,000 feet and I had on hiking shoes and I was all set up and ready to go,"" he said in February 2011 about a trip with his ladylove to French Polynesia. ""[Alves] was wearing Havaianas sandals and a white skirt. I came down to the bottom of that hill afterward and had blood on me, [all] muddy ... and that girl didn't have a speck of dust on her."" The bachelor-turned-family man told PEOPLE in March 2011 that he was learning Portuguese, Alves's native language that she grew up speaking in Brazil. And perhaps his favorite word in Portuguese sheds some light on the romance between him and his now-fiancÃ©. ""Beijos,"" is his favorite expression, he said, which translates to ""kisses"" in English. See the full article at PEOPLE.com . © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- The new coach of Penn State's embattled football program acknowledged criticism from alumni over his hiring, vowing to work to earn their trust and saluting the team's iconic former head coach Joe Paterno. Bill O'Brien's selection as the Nittany Lions' next coach has stirred the ire of some former Penn State football players, angry that he didn't attend the university and had never before been a head coach. He becomes the 15th head football coach in the program's 125-year history after replacing interim coach Tom Bradley, a former player and longtime coach at Penn State. Bradley himself stepped in after school trustees fired Paterno in November after he didn't go far enough in reporting an alleged child sex abuse scandal involving former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky. O'Brien, most recently the offensive coordinator for the NFL's New England Patriots, said Saturday he is aware of the ""controversy,"" though he predicted that ""in time, we will find that we have more common interests and goals than not."" ""We admire one's loyalties to Penn State, Penn State football, its grand tradition, coach Paterno and all his football staffs,"" O'Brien said. ""We respectfully request the opportunity to earn your trust through communication and ... through our (shared) abilities, ethics, beliefs, work ethics and commitment to Penn State."" A riot erupted on the Pennsylvania school's campus after Paterno was dismissed, days after Sandusky was arrested and accused of sexually abusing young boys. Paterno, 84, who his family has said is being treated for lung cancer, left the program as the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history. O'Brien said Saturday that ""there will never be enough words to say what he did for this program -- as far as wins, as far as off-the-field (by) graduating student-athletes every single year."" The new coach said he hadn't met yet with predecessor, but he looked ""forward to that as soon as I can."" SI: Many Penn State alumni angry over choice . Paterno himself issued a statement Saturday, after news broke about O'Brien's selection. He referenced the fact that both men attended and played football at Brown University. ""I understand Bill O'Brien has been named head coach and I want to congratulate him on his appointment,"" Paterno said. ""I don't know Bill, but I respect his coaching record, and I am particularly pleased we share a connection to my alma mater, Brown."" Paterno defended the program under his watch, against criticisms that it made winning and control of the program the top priorities over developing student-athletes. ""Despite recent commentary to the contrary, Penn State football has always been about more than winning,"" he said. 'I came to Penn State with the simple but unshakeable view that this great institution could and should have a football program that is both fiercely competitive and deeply committed to education and community service. ""The proof of our success is the hundreds of former players who have graduated and gone on to become great husbands, fathers, businessmen and community leaders. I am hopeful this tradition will continue."" Patriots head coach Bill Belichick lauded O'Brien in a statement Saturday, calling him an ""inspirational leader"" for the team. ""Bill O'Brien has met every personal and professional challenge head on with great passion and competitiveness,"" Belichick said. ""This is a great match between a storied program and a old-school football coach. Bill will be up to the task."" Penn State's quarterback, Matt McGloin said earlier this week that he and other players are ""excited"" for a ""fresh start."" McGloin told CNN affiliate WBRE that he hopes the selection of O'Brien will help ""erase some of the things that have happened in the past year."" ""It should be exciting for everyone,"" said McGloin, acknowledging that some Penn State alumni have voiced dissatisfaction with the move since O'Brien didn't attend the State College school. ""The most important thing is that the players are happy."" The Penn State program is still reeling from the abuse allegations that surfaced this fall. Prosecutors have said that Sandusky sexually molested at least eight boys, some of them in Penn State facilities, over a 14-year period. That includes a 2002 shower incident in which a former Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, said he saw Sandusky possibly sodomizing a boy, saying that what he saw was ""extremely sexual in nature,"" according to grand jury testimony. He told Paterno, who told then-athletic director Tim Curley, according to a grand jury report. Law enforcement authorities, however, didn't become aware of that allegation until years later. Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president who oversaw campus police, are charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child sexual abuse related to the 2002 incident. O'Brien did not mention the sex abuse scandal in his opening remarks Saturday. He did say that the ""standard for Penn State football remains very high."" ""There is so much pride in Penn State, and we will never take that for granted,"" he said. According to his biography on Patriots.com, the NFL team's official website, the Nittany Lions' new football coach grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts. O'Brien began his coaching career at Brown, his alma mater, before going on to take jobs at Georgia Tech, Maryland and Duke. He joined the Patriots in 2007 as a coaching assistant, rapidly rising up the ranks in the subsequent years. ""The Penn State football program has a great legacy and has contributed enormously to our university community,"" university President Rodney A. Erickson said in a statement. ""A program of this caliber requires a special kind of leader -- a leader who will embrace that legacy and maintain the university's commitment to excellence on the field and in the classroom. We have that leader in Coach O'Brien, and I look forward to working with him in his new role.""

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut paramedic has been charged in the alleged sexual assault last month of a woman who was only semiconscious in the back of an ambulance, according to police. Mark Powell, 49, was charged with first-degree sexual assault and unlawful restraint after he turned himself over to authorities Thursday, according to Hamden Police Capt. Ronald Smith. Smith said the 22-year-old woman received emergency medical treatment after hitting her head on Christmas Day and was transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital. It was during that time in the ambulance that the alleged victim, who was strapped to a stretcher, was assaulted, Smith said, citing the woman's account. The woman said she waited three days to report the incident because she was embarrassed and afraid, according to Smith. The American Medical Response released a statement earlier this week saying that Powell has been placed on administrative leave. ""AMR takes very seriously our responsibility to provide safe care and transport for our patients, and we do not tolerate any kind of abusive behavior,"" said Charles Babson, General Manager of American Medical Response. Powell has been released on $25,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court January 19. It is unclear whether he has retained legal counsel.","Police say the paramedic sexually assaulted a woman in the back of an ambulance .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Over the past few days, anti-Gadhafi forces have made ""significant advances"" -- in the northwest and in the regions of Misrata and al-Brega -- a spokesman for NATO's military operation told reporters Tuesday. ""Anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli,"" said Col. Roland Lavoie, who described the advances as ""the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months."" Since the end of July, as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished, thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains, he said. Since Friday, the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces, he said. And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west, he added. Over the last week, NATO warplanes have damaged or destroyed some 150 military targets as part of Operation Unified Protector, Lavoie said. ""Our assessment, without going into details, is that the Gadhafi regime does not have anymore an effective operational capability,"" he said. Lavoie said that rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli, but added that the regions were ""still contested."" However, Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were ""cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors"" and had secured the coastal road, a key supply pipeline into Tripoli. Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control, ""there's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs,"" Lavoie said. Still, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed optimism. ""I think the sense is that Gadhafi's days are numbered,"" she told reporters in Washington. But a spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view. ""We are doing very well,"" Ibrahim Musa told reporters. ""It's true that it's a bit slow -- people are still saying that we're not acting immediately and that we're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs. That's true but, God willing, we are able to lead this battle successfully. We will achieve peace and victory."" He added, ""We are fighting NATO -- not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members. Our war is with the crusaders."" If rebels gain control of Zawiya, that would be a major stride in putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power. ""We will be very careful entering Tripoli, which we hope to do by the end of this month,"" said Col. Ahmed Banni, military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council. Banni said there is intelligence that some Gadhafi forces are moving to Tripoli from other fronts -- Terhouna in the southeast and Sirte farther east. He said those forces have taken off their uniforms to blend in with the population, a ""dangerous"" sign those troops are preparing for a ""bloody war."" He said rebels in Tripoli recently were supplied with arms. But, he said, ""We asked them to stay put until the zero hour."" Col. Jumma Ibrahim, a spokesman for the rebels' western command, said Gadhafi forces controlled most of the eastern part of the city and were shelling rebels with Grad missiles and artillery. ""There are still skirmishes with the brigades in the city center, with snipers taking positions,"" Col. Ibrahim said. ""The fight is now urban warfare there at the moment. There have been a lot injured among our ranks but it is hard to give a number."" The rebels claim control of towns west of Zawiya to near Ras Jedeir. These include Surman and Subratha. ""It is a huge deal and a decisive defeat for his forces in that region. All these areas are liberated,"" Banni said. Col. Ibrahim said Garyan, south of Tripoli's city center, had been taken by rebels but Gadhafi loyalists were shelling them from a nearby town. There has been ""fierce fighting"" in Terhouna. He said rebel forces were surrounding Zlitan in the south, east and northeast and fighting Gadhafi forces. He said there's been fighting in the industrial area of al-Brega, where rebels control the residential areas except for one controlled by the Gadhafi government. Gadhafi forces also control the industrial area, Banni said. ""He is trying his hardest to prevent us from access to $35 million worth of daily oil money under normal circumstances in al-Brega,"" Banni said. ""If we control the port and the refinery in the industrial area, we'd have that money.""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- A Russian-led bloc of post-Soviet nations has agreed to establish a rapid-reaction military force to combat terrorists and respond to regional emergencies, Russian media reported Wednesday. Russian navy soldiers stand guard during a military ceremony. The decision came a day after reports that Kyrgyzstan is planning to close a strategically important U.S. military base that Washington uses to transport troops and supplies into Afghanistan. On Wednesday, the Collective Security Treaty Organization -- made up of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- decided on the rapid-reaction force at a Kremlin summit, the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti reported. The group's security council ""spent a long time discussing the central issue of forming collective reaction forces and, generally, of rapid reaction to possible threats,"" said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, according to Russian news agency Interfax. ""Everyone agreed that the formation of joint forces is necessary,"" he said. Officials told Russian media that all the members had signed the agreement, though Uzbekistan submitted a special provision. Uzbekistan doesn't mind contributing military units to the rapid-reaction force ""but does not consider it necessary for the moment"" to attach emergency responders, drug-control forces and other special services, organization spokesman Vitaly Strugovets told Interfax. Russian media reported that the force will be used to fight military aggressors, conduct anti-terror operations, battle regional drug trafficking and respond to natural disasters. The force will be based in Russia under a single command, with member nations contributing military units. On Tuesday, Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced at a Moscow news conference that ""all due procedures"" were being initiated to close Manas Air Base, RIA-Novosti reported. The announcement was made after news reports of a multimillion-dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan. Gen. David Petraeus, who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, was in Kyrgyzstan last month, partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base. He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss ""at all"" the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was ""no foundation"" for news reports about the issue. The United States is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban. Petraeus described Manas as having ""an important role in the deployment of these forces"" and in refueling aircraft. The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a Kyrgyz citizen was killed by a U.S. airman in December 2006. The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan, and the dead man's family was offered compensation. Petraeus said in January that the investigation was being reopened. As he announced the base closure Tuesday, Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry into the accident and his government's ""inability to provide security to its citizens"" was proving a serious concern.  Medvedev also weighed in on the issue Wednesday, saying the base closure shouldn't hamper anti-terrorism operations, according to Interfax. ""It would be great if their numbers meant there were fewer terrorists, but such action depends on other things as well,"" he said.","Seven nations agree to form rapid-reaction force .
Russian media say force will fight terrorism, respond to disasters .
It will be based in Russia under a single command .

"(CNN) -- The defense budget is going down. Thursday, President Obama personally announced a new strategy to align with the new limits created by the Budget Control Act of last fall. The announcement was light on the budget details to emphasize ""strategy."" But strategy documents come and go -- it's in budgets that we'll see actual change. The biggest change is a smaller Army — reports suggest troop numbers down to levels last seen in the late 1990s. This change is justified by the strategy's de-emphasis of stability operations like Iraq and Afghanistan and renewed focus on Asia, where naval and air forces are the main tool. If the strategy's blueprint is followed, we could see a fundamental change to our force structure and military posture—more airpower and naval, and fewer ground forces. But everyone Thursday went out of their way to hedge at every turn. Most notably, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey stressed that we weren't giving up the capacity to fight land wars. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said his theme was reversibility. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said our military will never do just one thing. The President said our military will be ready for the full range of contingencies and threats. These statements don't sound like an overhaul in the Defense Department is imminent to reflect this new strategy. Rather, the administration will more likely make some marginal changes to meet the new budget realities. The Army will still prepare to fight high-intensity land campaigns. The Air Force will still prepare to achieve air superiority. The Navy will still prepare to maintain a presence on the seas. And the Marines will still prepare to land on the beaches. The world is an uncertain place and some hedging is a good thing to protect against surprises. But the United States has a dominant military capable of handling a lot of surprises and will maintain its strength even if we see much deeper cuts in the next decade— even cuts at the levels of previous big reductions in defense spending. The strategy was unveiled today to justify just shy of $500 billion in cuts over the next ten years, which would leave the budget in 2021 just 8% less than it is today compared to an average from previous builddowns of 30% less after ten years. The decline in war costs will account for some of that difference. But even at the levels of savings mandated by the sequester triggered by the supercommittee's failure to reach a deficit reduction deal, the base defense budget would decrease by less than 20% after ten years. If we were truly to tailor our force structure to a strategy, we could find significantly greater savings. If we embrace the current strategy document, the Army could be significantly smaller and still have a cadre to build upon if we needed to conduct another long-term stability operation. Of course, the point was raised in the press conference that we didn't plan on doing stability operations in Afghanistan or Iraq. If we instead accept that we will do more stability operations, we could cut back the Navy and Air Force to focus on the Army and still have plenty of forces to respond to events in the Pacific. It doesn't appear the administration will take the budget to the logical ends of the strategy rolled out today. We would have a better defense—at any spending level—if we actually made budget decisions based on strategy rather than by letting institutional concerns determine what makes up the budget. The press conference Thursday highlighted two key facts about the defense budget. The topline is determined largely by external events—like our economy and fiscal crises. But the budget that meets that topline is determined largely by the institutions within the Pentagon. We may be at an inflection point, as the president said, but it is unlikely that inflection will affect the Pentagon that much. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russell Rumbaugh.","President Obama announced a new strategy to align with defense budget cuts .

"(CNN) -- World Twenty20 champions Pakistan were left stunned after none of their players were signed up for the lucrative Indian Premier League cricket tournament in Tuesday's auction. With this year's budget slashed from $2 million per team to just $750,000, only 11 of the 66 international players on offer were snapped up. West Indies all-rounder Kieron Pollard and veteran New Zealand pace bowler Shane Bond were the biggest winners as the Mumbai Indians and the Kolkata Knight Riders respectively used their entire allocated funds to sign them for the 2010 season. But Pakistan's Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi, one of the world's most explosive players in the limited-overs format, failed to secure a place along with teammates highly-rated Mohammad Aamer, Umar Gul and Umar Akmal. Afridi's manager blamed the Indian government for continuing its long-running tensions with Pakistan. ""I'd heard prior to the auction that franchises were being advised not to bid for Pakistani players as the players from Pakistan would not be issued with visas by the Indian government, and that is precisely what has happened,"" Umar Khan told www.pakpassion.net. ""The Indian Premier League have been using Afridi's name and pictures to publicize the tournament and to build up the hype, and he was expected to be one of the most popular players amongst the franchises."" Big-hitting all-rounder Afridi was stunned to be left out, having played for the Deccan Chargers in 2008 but did not feature last year as the team won the title. ""I'm stunned by the omission and, yes, I'm obviously very disappointed as I was really looking forward to playing once again in the Indian Premier League and testing my skills against the world's best players and against friends and colleagues,"" he said. ""I thought I would be picked and am very surprised at the outcome of the auction."" Pollard was sought by four teams, with Mumbai heading off Kolkata, the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Chennai Super Kings after making a sealed-envelope final bid. The 22-year-old Pollard, who has played only 15 one-dayers and 10 Twenty20 internationals, takes $750,000 as his payment while the undisclosed extra money goes to the IPL. The 34-year-old Bond, who has retired from Test cricket to prolong his career, has been welcomed into the IPL fold despite having signed up with its unsanctioned rival Indian Cricket League, which has not been staged since 2008. He went into the auction with a $100,000 reserve price tag, but both Kolkata and the Chargers bid the full amount for him. West Indies fast bowler Kemar Roach went to the Chargers for $720,000 while Delhi Daredevils signed South Africa fast bowler Wayne Parnell for $610,000 -- $510,000 more than his reserve price. Former India batsman Mohammad Kaif was sold to the Kings XI Punjab franchise for $250,000 after his contract was bought out by the Rajasthan Royals, while Bangalore signed England one-day specialist Eoin Morgan for $220,000. Rajasthan also snapped up former Australia batsman Damien Martyn ($100,000) and his compatriot Adam Voges ($50,000), while Chennai Super Kings signed South Africa's Justin Kemp ($100,000) and Sri Lanka's Thissara Perera ($50,000). In the only other sale, Punjab bought South Africa's Yusuf Abdulla for $50,000. Meanwhile, India reached 122-1 in their second innings at stumps on the third day of the opening Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong, having bowled out the home side for 242. The tourists narrowly avoided conceding a first-innings deficit for the first time against cricket's lowest-ranked Test nation, with Bangladesh falling one run short after resuming on 59-3 after bad light and fogged delayed the start of play on Tuesday. Mahmudullah scored a personal best 69 as he added 108 for the seventh wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim (44), but spinner Amit Mishra cleaned up the tail to finish with three wickets to match the feat of left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan. Mishra was then unbeaten on 24 at stumps along with opener Gautam Gambhir, who made 47 after putting on 90 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag (45). CNN's Harmeet Singh contributed to this report.","No Pakistan players are bought in auction for lucrative Indian Premier League cricket series .

"(CNN) -- When I was a youth pastor at a small, evangelical church in Kalamazoo, Michigan, I used to accompany my pastor and other members of our congregation into some of the city's neighborhoods where gang activity and gun violence were most prevalent. We would stand on the corner next to the drug dealers and talk to them about why it was important to turn their lives around. Some would listen. Others would walk away. All gave us respect, even if they didn't agree with what we had to say. And I believe they did so because we respected them. We didn't call them names or discount how they felt. We met them where they were -- literally and figuratively. In a lot of ways, hearing Rick Santorum talk about social issues, particularly gay rights, reminds me of those days. Like those drug dealers, I'm sure he can't see how he destroys his community. Like those drug dealers, Santorum is probably doing what he thinks he needs to do. And like those drug dealers, what Santorum is pushing is addictive, poisonous and a trigger to violence we see all around us. His anti-gay rhetoric justifies, for some people, the bullying in school, the senseless beatings of people perceived to be gay and the under-reported murders of transgender people. The truth is that the disrespectful tone in which Santorum talks about GLBT people, in the name of religion, gives permission for our lives to be equally disrespected. Disregarded. Sometimes, the impulse is to return the fire, matching name-calling with name-calling. I, too, have found myself so ticked off by Santorum's words that I've called him everything but a child of God. That's when I come to my senses and try to remember the one thing he seems to forget. We're all God's children. We're all brothers and sisters. And like brothers and sisters, we won't always agree. Sometimes we will fight. But we can't get so caught up in our disagreements that we forget that what bonds us is far more important than what divides us. Being respectful doesn't mean you have to give up your religion. Opinion: To Rick Santorum: Here's how to support a gay child . Still, as much as it pains me to admit, Rick Santorum is my brother. I don't support the way he sows seeds of discord for political gain, but I can't allow him to drag me down so far that I hate him. Just as I didn't hate the drug dealers and gang bangers who were poisoning the Kalamazoo neighborhoods. Instead we all must go to the figurative street corner and find a way to respectfully engage. After all, Santorum's views are not just his. More than 30,000 Iowans last week said they wanted to see him in the White House. This week thousands in New Hampshire might say the same. Calling social conservatives names might help blow off steam, but it's not going to change their hearts. And you cannot change a person's mind without first changing his or her heart. Some will listen. Some will walk away. But neither group is going anywhere without at least getting to the place of respect. Now I'm sure some are surprised to learn that I was heavily involved in the evangelical church. Others are shocked to read I lived in a small town called Kalamazoo. But we are all more than we appear to be. Santorum is more than his homophobic rhetoric. I am more than a gay guy who opposes it. And if we were to sit across from each other with a cup of coffee, I'm sure we would find the labels we assign to constituent groups and such wouldn't do any of us justice. Sound touchy feely? It is. But that doesn't mean it isn't true. Rick Santorum's significance has nothing to do with the election -- it's that he gives voice and seeming legitimacy to a lot of people who think it's OK to fire someone for being gay. Getting upset by such a notion is natural. Slapping them with a name like bigot is understandable. But then what? Santorum's campaign presents us with the uncomfortable but necessary task of dealing with that question. Santorum said he would love his son just the same if his son were to tell him he was gay. Whether that's true is debatable, but what isn't debatable is the importance for fair minded people to push for a country where, if Santorum's son were gay, he wouldn't feel society hates him for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Rick Santorum's anti-gay rhetoric helps create climate of hate .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel makes no secret that it sees Iran is its biggest threat but the scale of the threat is less clear cut. Israel's recent military exercises are seen by some as a show of strength to Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not missed an opportunity to name Iran as the number one threat, and like his predecessors he has said Israel will not tolerate a nuclear Iran. Tests are ongoing for Israel's arrow missile system, designed to intercept incoming rockets -- although Israel does not openly say which direction they'd come from. Last week, CNN filmed Netanyahu aboard an F15 fighter-bomber jet while touring the Hatzerim air force base near Beersheva. He said: ""My biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending Israel."" Last month, two Israeli warships and a submarine made a rare journey through Egypt's Suez canal. Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz. The official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran. Estimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely. In February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon. But an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material. The official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity. Dore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, ""The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran. But it's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the North Koreans. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an Iranian bomb. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means, and Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself. But Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life. ""We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone."" Efraim Kam, an Israeli analyst on Middle East affairs and author of ""From Terror to Nuclear Bombs: The Significance of the Iranian Threat,"" estimates that ""theoretically"" Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year. But even if Israel's conviction is correct that Iran wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire, does that mean it would use it against Israel? Kam said: ""My personal view is that Iran would not do it because they understand that Israel does have a nuclear arsenal. It has to take that into account and because the U.S. will deter Iran as well. ""If you ask me, can you guarantee they will not use it, then no I can't."" But that question is a step too far for Israel. It is far more concerned with what a nuclear Iran could do to the balance of the Middle East and the likely nuclear race that would follow with many of Israel's neighbors. As Gold says: ""What is a prime minister of Israel supposed to do when he sees that threat growing to his east?""","Senior Israeli lawmakers have Iran top of the country's threat list .
They believe U.S. attempts at negotiation could fall short .
Former diplomat says it is believed Iran still has secret sites for nuclear program .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pakistan's military insists that the NATO strike last month that killed more than two dozen Pakistani soldiers near the Afghan border was deliberate. In an effort to pre-empt the results of NATO's official investigation, due out next week, the Pakistani Embassy in Washington invited reporters for a detailed briefing on the incident. Pakistani military officials at the briefing contended that NATO forces knew they were firing at Pakistani troops throughout the attack and even apologized as they kept firing, evidence they say supports their assertions the attack was deliberate. U.S. officials have said it was a regrettable case of mistaken identity and miscommunication when NATO attacked the area in support of a nearby U.S.-Afghan joint patrol that believed it was under fire from the Taliban. ""I have a story to tell and this is the story of those brave people who left us in the middle of a cold, November night on a barren mountain top,"" a senior Pakistani defense official began. Using maps, photos and PowerPoint charts, he offered a painstaking recreation of the incident from the Pakistani military's point of view, based on interviews with surviving troops and residents where the attack took place. He and embassy officials at the briefing spoke on the condition of anonymity, preferring for their military and civilian leadership in Islamabad to speak on the record. At issue is whether Pakistani troops were the target of the attacks. The Pakistani officials at the briefing argued that well-established operating procedures and an intricate system for operational information sharing were deliberately ignored, which led to the tragic incident that killed 24 Pakistani ""martyrs."" American officials told CNN that U.S. forces checked first with their Pakistani counterparts before launching the strike. Before calling in airstrikes, the U.S. forces checked with a Pakistani liaison team. They were not seeking permission -- because the airstrikes were described as a matter of self-defense -- but were making sure Pakistani troops weren't in what was called a poorly marked border area, the officials said. After that consultation, the U.S. believed there were no Pakistani forces nearby, which turned out not to be true. U.S. military officials would not comment on the Pakistani assertions, citing the ongoing investigation. But in the past few weeks, U.S. officials have denied vehemently the charge by Pakistan's military that this was a deliberate attack. ""What I can say, absolutely, and I can't imagine anyone in this room wouldn't believe me -- we did not attack a border post, a Pakistan military border post, intentionally,"" Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech in Washington last week. ""If you think we did, I'd have to ask you in return what in the world would we hope to gain by doing that? So I can say that categorically. Dempsey said, ""They believe we did this intentionally in some way to either discredit them or goad them into further action."" Pentagon spokesman George Little said, ""We know enough at this point to say with certainty this was not an intentional attack on Pakistani forces. The Pakistanis are our partners; it defies reason that we would attack them."" But Pakistani officials at the embassy briefing said that not only were the coordinates incorrect, covering an area nine miles north of the attack, but Pakistan's chain of command was in the process of reviewing them when NATO helicopters began the striking Pakistani outpost ""Volcano"" shortly after midnight. Pakistan only returned fire after its first post was fired upon, which prompted NATO to strike against the second post, ""Boulder,"" the officials said, adding that the commanding officer who ran up the hill to the area with a rescue team was killed. A NATO officer at the joint coordination outpost in the area even apologized to his Pakistani liaison in the middle of the attack for relaying the wrong location of the area NATO planes were about to fire on, preventing Pakistan from warning this was a friendly post, according to the Pakistani officials. Even after NATO officer acknowledged at about 1:15 a.m. that it was firing on the outposts and confirmed it was pulling back its helicopters, the Pakistanis maintain there was continued fire on the two posts by U.S. attack helicopters and an AC-130 gunship for about another hour until about 2:20 a.m. Neither claim could be verified with NATO and American officials. Could NATO forces have mistaken the two border posts on the Afghan border for extremist bases, as U.S. officials have suggested? Highly unlikely, the senior Pakistani defense official said at the briefing. First of all, the structures stood in plain view on the top of a barren ridge -- a place he said, which terrorists probably wouldn't be inclined to use as a hideout. Photos of both posts that suffered the attack show the structures made of stone and sandbags sitting on high ground. A slide at the presentation called ""Mistaken Identity Not Possible"" tried to casts further doubt on the U.S. argument. The slide detailed several ways Pakistan and its NATO counterparts keep track of each other's activities at the border. The defense official claimed that NATO was even monitoring the Pakistani border posts' radio transmissions reporting it was under fire by NATO aircraft. What's more, he said, the Pakistani military has shown its counterparts at several coordination centers maps of where it has outposts so as to avoid such misunderstandings. ""It's something which just doesn't make any sense to me given the kind of coordination mechanism we have, the kind of information-sharing we have, given the fact that these locations are mutually known to both sides,"" he said. The official would not speculate as to why NATO would deliberately attack two Pakistani outposts about 300 yards from the border, but would only say this was the official conclusion of the Pakistani leadership. The incident has exacerbated an already fractious relationship between the United States and Pakistan, whose military has been on the defensive since the secret raid by U.S. Navy SEALs that killed Osama bin Laden in May. Since the attack on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, close to Pakistani military installations, tensions have been at record levels. But last month's attack seems to have been the last straw, with Pakistan shutting NATO supply routes until it receives an official apology. The United States has expressed ""condolences"" for the loss of the Pakistani soldiers but won't go as far as to issue an ""apology"" until the NATO investigation is complete. Pakistan has explicitly refused to coordinate with investigation, saying it doesn't trust NATO. Regardless of the results of the investigation, officials say the incident has further solidified Pakistani military and public opinion against cooperation with NATO and the United States. ""There is a sense of outrage,"" one senior official said. ""It's there on the street, amongst the leadership -- political as well as military -- and among the rank and file of the military. The sheer magnitude of this thing is unbelievable.""","Pakistani military officials say NATO forces knew they were firing at Pakistani troops .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is expected to ask the Obama administration for additional troops and equipment, according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with Gen. Stanley McChrystal's thinking. Gen. Stanley McChrystal's report on the war's status will be delivered in August, the source says. The request will be for troops and equipment for conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as more assets to deal with roadside bombs and explosives, said the official, who declined to be identified because McChrystal's request has not been formally transmitted to the Pentagon. The request could be made in coming weeks after McChrystal completes a ""troop-to-task review"" to calculate whether there are enough U.S. troops in Afghanistan -- and the right mix of troops -- to carry out the military's war plan at an acceptable level of risk, the official said. The review could also lead to a request for additional troops for either combat or training of Afghan forces, but the official emphasized McChrystal has not made a decision on that. The military already has tasked an additional 4,000 troops to train Afghan forces. The official said McChrystal is likely to submit his recommendations to Defense Secretary Robert Gates as a series of options, with each option having a level of risk attached to it. ""This will start the discussion"" within the highest levels of the administration about whether to send a significant number of additional troops, the official said. Gates has signaled he would be open to sending more troops if it could be demonstrated they are needed. But he also has expressed caution that the United States not send so many troops that it has too heavy a footprint in the country. The troop-to-task review will follow McChrystal's assessment of the war, due 60 days after he took command in mid-June. That report is expected to be sent to Gates and NATO's secretary general by August 14, the official said. It will discuss a detailed strategy for success of the counterinsurgency mission, such as the need for U.S. and Afghan forces to conduct more integrated operations and the need to focus on population centers. It is also expected to call for an increase in the number of Afghan security forces. ""This will be a really frank and honest discussion of how things are, and what it takes to get the job done,"" the official said.","Gen. Stanley McChrystal also will ask for equipment, source says .

"(CNN) -- Britain on Saturday demanded the release of Gilad Shalit as the Israeli soldier marked his 24th birthday in Hamas' captivity. ""The thoughts of many in Britain are with Gilad Shalit and his family,"" the Foreign Office said. ""His detention is unjustifiable and unacceptable. The British Government demands his immediate and unconditional release."" Shalit has been held captive since June 25, 2006, when Palestinian militants from Gaza captured him. The militants had tunneled into Israel and attacked an Israeli army outpost near the Gaza-Israel-Egypt border, killing two soldiers in the assault. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him. Since being imprisoned by Hamas, Shalit has not been allowed any contact with the outside world, nor any visits by the Red Cross. Details of his incarceration and physical condition remain unknown. In October 2009, Hamas released a tape of Shalit as a proof of life, in which he urged the Israeli government to do more for his safe release. Shalit's family has been working to free the soldier and ramped up their efforts during the current holy month of Ramadan. Noam Shalit, the soldier's father, recently appealed directly to Palestinians in Gaza to put pressure on their Hamas leadership for a prisoner swap during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends September 9. The father has repeated his stance that the Israeli government should release 1,000 prisoners, including 450 whose release Hamas has demanded in exchange for his son. He has been holding a vigil outside the home of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since early July, when he led a march to his doorstep to support a prisoner exchange as a way to release his son. This Ramadan is different than the previous four, Shalit said, because there is now a deal that was put on the table at the beginning of the year by a German mediator. ""If the two sides of the conflict show some flexibility, it will be possible to make an agreement,"" Shalit said. Such an agreement, Shalit said, would benefit thousands of Palestinian families who would have their fathers and sons back to celebrate the festival of Ramadan. ""I would welcome any release of Palestinian prisoners, but I would welcome the release of one Israeli prisoner,"" said the emotional Shalit, raising a solitary finger. The issue of Shalit came up after British Prime Minister David Cameron issued tough talk about the Palestinian territory of Gaza during a visit to Turkey, comments seen as criticism of Israel. ""Let me also be clear that the situation in Gaza has to change. Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions. Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp,"" Cameron said. He also referred to the territory as a ""prison camp."" Residents of Gaza say they have suffered greatly under an Israeli goods blockade implemented since Hamas took control of the territory after elections in 2006. But Israel says its tough measures are necessary to stop weapons from reaching Hamas militants intent on destroying Israel. Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to Britain, reacted quickly to the prime minister's remark, saying that Hamas is responsible for the misery in Gaza and raised the issue of Shalit's captivity. ""We know that the prime minister would also share our grave concerns about our own prisoner in the Gaza Strip, Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage there for over four years, without receiving a single Red Cross visit,"" Prosor said.","Shalit has been held captive since June 2006 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Nearly 6.2 million students in the United States between the ages of 16 and 24 in 2007 dropped out of high school, fueling what a report released Tuesday called ""a persistent high school dropout crisis."" A new report on high school dropouts in the United States calls for a national re-enrollment strategy. The total represents 16 percent of all people in the United States in that age range in 2007. Most of the dropouts were Latino or black, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, Illinois. ""Because of the widespread, pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out, a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of America's national education agenda,"" the report says. However, the report notes, the ""absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country."" Despite the funding cutbacks, there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including Chicago; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Portland, Oregon, the report says. ""These programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead-end dropouts, but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school,"" the study says. ""The most successful programs are small (80-150 students), offering comprehensive after-school and summer activities, led by experienced principals and teachers, focused on learning in the real world, well-funded with local school site program and fiscal control, and track specific, measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains, enrollment, attendance, credit gains, promotions and graduations."" Jesse Williams, 22, was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree. She said a street shooting in which one friend died and two were wounded was the start of her losing interest in school. ""My junior year I dropped out,"" she said at a summit in Washington on Tuesday. ""Too much gang violence, teachers discriminating because of the color of my skin, or where I come from."" Now re-enrolled in a Chicago school dedicated to bringing dropouts back to education, Williams said, ""They help me in my classwork. I have a mentor that checks up on me monthly. She goes to my house, sees if there's anything that I need."" Researchers for the study analyzed the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Surveys, household data from the Current Population Survey, national data on GED certificate awards and other official sources to examine the problem at the national level and in the nation's 12 largest states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Men and blacks and Hispanics of both genders are among those particularly prone to dropping out of high school. ""As these data show, this dropout crisis is disproportionately affecting America's communities of color,"" said Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League. ""Youth from all communities deserve an equal chance at educational success."" Among the findings in the report, ""Left Behind in America: The Nation's Dropout Crisis:"" The dropout situation at the state level was similarly widespread: . The report emphasized the importance of having at least a high school education. ""In the current global economy, having at least a high school diploma is a critical step for avoiding poverty, and a college degree is a prerequisite for a well-paying job,"" the study says. ""The costs of dropping out of high school today are substantial and have risen over time, especially for young men, who find it almost impossible to earn an adequate income to take care of themselves and their families."" The report goes on to note: ""Americans without a high school diploma have considerably lower earning power and job opportunities in today's workforce. Over a working lifetime from ages 18-64, high school dropouts are estimated to earn $400,000 less than those that graduated from high school. For males, the lifetime earnings loss is nearly $485,000 and exceeds $500,000 in many large states. Due to their lower lifetime earnings and other sources of market incomes, dropouts will contribute far less in federal, state and local taxes than they will receive in cash benefits, in-kind transfers and correctional costs. Over their lifetimes, this will impose a net fiscal burden on the rest of society. ""By contrast, adults with high school diplomas contribute major fiscal benefits to the country over their lifetime. The combined lifetime fiscal benefits -- including the payment of payroll, federal, and state income taxes --- could amount to more than $250,000 per graduated student. Such a public fiscal benefit more than outweighs the estimated cost of enrolling a student who has dropped out.""","Newly released study examines rates of high school dropouts .
