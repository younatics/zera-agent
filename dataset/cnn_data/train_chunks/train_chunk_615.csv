A 33-year-old Massachusetts woman has been convicted of indecent assault and battery after a jury heard she 'created her own house of horrors' at the home of two children she was babysitting. Crystal Goodis, of Norton, was hired by a mother to babysit her then-four-and-a-half year old daughter and three-year-old son in 2009. The mother testified that she stopped engaging her services three months later after noticing changes in her children. Goodis was convicted after a two-day trial by a jury . of three men and three women and Judge Debra Shopteese ordered her to . serve 18 months of a two-and-a-half year sentence. Ghoulish: Goodis' interest in the horror genre was used as evidence in the court that she dressed up in scary costumes to scare her two charges, a four-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy . According to the Sun Chronicle, the mother hired Goodis, who was the daughter of a co-worker and friend of her mother, to babysit in the spring of 2009. The mother testified that she terminated Goodis' employment after her daughter locked herself in a closet . and screamed uncontrollably after kicking Goodis in the shin so hard she . had to use an ice-pack. The mother said her daughter also began wetting the bed, her son displayed nervous tics and both children began suffering nightmares. Horror show: Crystal Goodis was accused by the prosecution of creating a 'house of horrors' at the home of the children she was babysitting . The children testified that Goodis had punched and kicked them on the first day she babysat them in 2009, and the girl, now aged 8, said Goodis touched her private areas. The boy, now 6, told the court that the defendant laid on top of him. According to the Sun Chronicle, Goodis is an enthusiast of the horror genre. She showed the children horror films, the court heard, and dressed up in vampire and werewolf costumes to scare them. The children's mother said she was not aware of the abuse until 10 months after it occurred when she caught her daughter acting out inappropriate behavior. Dark side: After being babysat by Goodis, the two children experienced nightmares, bed-wetting and behavioral issues . The girl testified that she and her brother had not told their parents about the abuse earlier because Goodis had threatened to come back and hurt them if they told anyone. 'This woman created her own house of horrors at their home in Norton,' Assistant District Attorney Karin Welker told the jury. Goodis denied the charges against her and spoke out in her own defense. She told the court the allegations were made up by the children. Trusted: Goodis was the daughter of a colleague of the mother of the two children she was hired to babysit . 'Absolutely not. I would never do anything like that, ever. I’m not the type of person who could do anything like that,' Goodis said when her lawyer, Paula Plouffe, asked her whether she had committed the abuse. Don't tell mom: Crystal Goodis, 33, has been entered on the sex offender registry after abusing two children and threatening them so they didn't tell their parents . She said that although she'd worked . for horror-themed businesses during Halloween, she'd never been allowed . to take any costumes home, and the work had occurred before she began . babysitting the children. Goodis . admitted in court to initially denying knowing her accusers until . pressed by detectives, but said she was nervous and felt intimidated by . police. She also admitted she'd last babysat when she was a teenager. Plouffe said the . children had made up allegations of abuse against her client because . they preferred a previous babysitter, and blamed Goodis for losing her. She said the 'inappropriate behavior' demonstrated by the girl could . have been learned from someone else. The Twitter feed belonging to Goodis expresses a love of the zombie TV show The Walking Dead and makes no mention of the trial. Her last tweet was on June 9. Goodis was placed on probation for 20 years, must register as a sex . offender and give a DNA sample, and undergo a sex offender and mental health . evaluation. Once released from prison, Goodis will have to abide by probation conditions including having no contact or employment with children under 12, and must stay away from children, including her own nieces and nephews, until she's completed her sex offender counseling. 'We need to let people know this cannot be tolerated,' the mother said in her victim-impact statement. She said the children were undergoing counseling at St Anne's Hospital in Fall River and that the family had drawn closer together in the aftermath of the abuse and were hoping for a punishment suitable for someone with the responsibility of caring for children. 'We need to let people know this cannot be tolerated,' the mother said. Goodis' mother and a friend who testified in her defense left the courtroom in tears following the verdict, while Goodis received the news stoically with an expressionless face, reported the Sun Chronicle.","Massachusetts woman Crystal Goodis was convicted on Thursday of molesting and assaulting a four-year-old girl she was babysitting .

A man left paralyzed after heroically diving into a creek to save a 4-year-old girl from drowning has received thousands of dollars in support to pay for his medical bills. Strangers have already pledged $60,000 to help Michael Patterson, 43, who broke his neck in three places while saving the life of 4-year-old Javea Jones from drowning in a northwest Georgian creek, according to the Friends of Mike Patterson Trust. The paralyzed father faced huge medical bills without any insurance, until strangers established the trust to benefit him. 'I did not realize that there was still kindness in this world like there is. I kind of thought the world had grown cold until this happened to my son,' Patterson's mother Vickie Jones Roberson told WSB-TV. Hero: Michael Patterson, 43, became paralyzed after saving a 4-year-old girl from drowning . Gratitude: After his accident, three strangers established the Friends of Mike Patterson Trust to help pay for his medical costs. Strangers sent this card to the Intensive Care Unit . Patterson, of Rockmart, Ga., was visiting the Euharlee Creek with his son on June 8 when a young girl was dragged underwater. Authorities say Jones had been playing in the creek and stepped into a section of deep water. The girl was dragged under water, her mother Carlisa said, describing it as the worst moment of her life - until the Good Samaritan took action. She described Patterson as a 'hero' and an 'angel'. In the hospital, Patterson explained his actions. 'I just did what I would hope anybody . else would’ve done for me,' Patterson said to his mother, according to TODAY. 'He has always been like that – someone else first,' Roberson told WSB-TV. Good Samaritan: Michael Patterson, seen right at the hospital, told his mom he did what he hoped others would do for him . Patterson struck his head during the rescue, breaking his neck in three places and leaving him with a severed spinal cord. Both Jones' mother and Patterson's nine-year-old son witnessed the horrific moment that his father broke his neck on hitting the water. He was unconscious in the water for three minutes before being dragged out by bystanders. EMTs performed CPR before he was taken to the Redmond Regional Medical Center. He is now paralyzed. Remarkably, it was the second time in two weeks that Patterson had saved someone's life--he also pulled a truck driver to safety when his rig caught on fire. Roberson said her son recently started a job installing sheet rock and doesn't have health insurance. She told TODAY the family is trying to transfer him to the an Atlanta nonprofit hospital Shepherd Center which specializes in spinal cord rehabilitation. Devoted father: Michael Patterson's son Cole was with him when he saved the girl . Tragic: Michael Patterson mumbled to his mom from the hospital that he didn't want to die. 'I want to live,' he said . She told WSB-TV: 'Pray and pray, and have a lot of faith. That's all I can do.' The Friends of Mike Patterson Trust was established Wednesday to help him and his family by three people who did not know Patterson before the accident. 'We are trying to help his family raise money for this hero,' the trust's GoFundMe page reads. As of Thursday morning, Patterson was in a medically-induced coma and back on a ventilator, according to the group's Facebook page. On Tuesday he was originally taken off the respirator but after bacteria-filled creek water entered his lungs gave him pneumonia, he got worse Wednesday night, TODAY reported. He could remain paralyzed from the waist down with some movement in his right arm for the rest of his life. His mother told TODAY Patterson is still not aware of his paralysis. 'This is his worst nightmare,' she said. 'But he has a heart of gold, and I do know with all my heart that he’s not going to give up.' Roberson told TODAY his son mumbled from his hospital bed that he wanted to live. 'I don’t want to die, I want to live,' Patterson said. Rescued: After he saved Javea Jones, pictured, the girl's mother called Michael Patterson a 'hero' and an 'angel' Family day: The two parents had brought their children to play at this creek in Georgia before the day took a tragic turn . His mother said she feels blessed, despite what happened. 'I'm blessed. Regardless of everything that has happened and that my heart is broken, I am still blessed. I know that because of all the people who have reached out,' Roberson told WSB-TV. Thanking her son's supporters, who have come from around the world, Roberson said: 'You are all awesome, every one of you'. 'It's like angels taking care of an angel that they knew needed him,' she said.

Curiosity may have killed the cat but it caused just a little bit of embarrassment for this inquisitive cow. The animal got its head stuck in a tree in the middle of a field in Monkmoor, Shropshire, yesterday afternoon. It took a team of six firefighters from Shropshire Fire and Rescue an hour-and-a-half to free the young bullock. Trapped: The bullock with its head stuck in the tree in the field in Shrewsbury.

Emergency workers initially tried to free the . animal using strops but were forced to admit defeat and use a harness . and a crane instead.

After being winched up and released . from the tree, the animal was said to be distressed but uninjured and . was later reunited with it's herd in a nearby field. Neil Grove, Shrewsbury station manager for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was a very strange incident indeed.

The bullock was later lifted up and released from the tree distressed but uninjured . 'What he was looking for, I don’t know . and we don’t know how long he was in there.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:38 EST, 11 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:15 EST, 12 June 2013 . The crisis in A&E departments is being fuelled by a shocking rise in the elderly and frail being rushed to hospital in ambulances because there is no-where else for them to go. Shocking new figures reveal that more than two thirds of the extra 330,000 patients admitted taken to casualty by ambulance are aged 80 or over. And among the over-90s, there was a 66 per cent increase from 2009-10 to 2011-12, sparking claims that deep cuts in social care totalling £1.7billion were piling pressure on emergency departments. Rise: In two years the number of people aged over 90 take to hospital by ambulance rose from 165,910 to 275,883 . Row: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham who unearthed the figures, called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to take urgent action to address the problem . Health ministers were challenged over the statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre in the Commons yesterday. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed they ‘put a human face on the A&E crisis and paint a very sad picture indeed’. He added: 'I am today calling on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to take decisive action to improve care for the most elderly people in our society.' Cuts to social care budgets across England mean elderly people and their relatives have little choice but to dial 999 to call an ambulance for help. There are also warnings that once older people are admitted to hospital they cannot be discharged because of a lack of care available in communities. Jeremy Hunt did not visit an A&E department until seven months after becoming Health Secretary, it has emerged. He took up the post on September 4 last year but only went to St Thomas’ Hospital - opposite Parliament across the River Thames - on April 3 this year. In the Commons today shadow health minister Jamie Reed said that hospital waiting times in England were at the worst levels seen for a decade. He asked Mr Hunt: 'Do you actually regret waiting for six months before visiting an A&E unit and finding for yourself what damage your policies were doing to the frontline of the NHS?' But Mr Hunt hit back at Labour’s own health failures, pointing out that the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, which witnessed unusually high mortality rates, took place on their watch. He added: 'We’ll take no lessons on being connected with the frontline from the party that missed 50 warning signs about what was happening in Mid Staffs.' This so-called bed-blocking creates a backlog which means A&E departments cannot admit new people. The chaos in A&E this year has been blamed on patients struggling to access out-of-hours care and the bungled introduction of the new 111 NHS advice line. But official statistics reveal the dramatic increase in the elderly and their relatives dialling 999 has been building for the last three years. In 2009-10 there were 165,910 people aged over 90 taken to A&E by an ambulance. Two years later the number had rocketed by 66 per cent to 275,883. Over the same period, the number of patients aged 80-89 rose by 19 per cent from 635,834 to 757,555 in 2011-12. The rises were in stark contrast to other age groups, notably among children where the numbers fell by four per cent among the under-10s and almost 20 per cent for 10-19-year-olds. Mr Burnham, who unearthed the ‘deeply . troubling’ figures, said they show how ‘that something has gone . seriously amiss with the way we care for very frail and very elderly . people’. He told MailOnline: ‘The question we have to ask is why are 100,000 more over-90s coming into A&E by ambulance. ‘In . many of these cases older people end up in ambulances simply because . there isn’t better or more appropriate care available at home.The . thought of someone over 90 coming into hospital via ambulance and what . that must entail should make any politician pause for thought. ‘The . sheer disorientation of the whole experience of going to A&E, it is . the worse place really for them to be yet they are ending up there in . ever greater numbers.’ Crisis: The government has been urged to act over the crisis in A&E, triggered by delays in out-of-hours care, the 111 NHS advice line and cuts to social care . Among all people turning up at A&E, the increase in attendance was also highest amongst the over 90s . Mr Burnham pointed to figures showing how the total social care budget had fallen by £1.7billion from 2009-10 to 2011-12. ‘Further cuts are planned this year and this problem will only get worse if no action is taken,’ Mr Burnham added. In the Commons he  urged ministers to investigate the dramatic increases urgently and work to 'prevent the collapse of social care'. Health minister Dan Poulter said both parties 'recognise quite rightly that there is a long-term challenge in providing more integrated joined up care to look after older people'. But he claimed that Labour had 'failed to adequately invest in this area throughout its time in government'. Last week a damning report revealed waiting times for A&E patients are at their highest point for nearly a decade. The influential King’s Fund think tank said more than 300,000 patients waited for four hours or longer during the first three months of this year – nearly 6 per cent of all patients. Chaos in out-of-hours care and the botched launch of the Government’s 111 non-emergency number have been accused of pushing many hospitals to breaking point, with senior A&E doctors warning they can no longer guarantee safe care for patients.","There were an extra 100,000 emergency 999 calls for people aged over 90 in 2011-12, compared to 2009-10 .

A runaway wallaby sparked a police hunt involving six officers after he was spotted making a dash for freedom near Birmingham . Three-year-old Colin jumped a 6ft fence to escape from his pen in Solihull, West Midlands, before hopping back home five hours later, his owners revealed today. The meandering marsupial escaped last night and sightings were reported over four miles away from the half-acre field he shares with seven other wallabies. Police were called when a shocked motorist spotted the unusual sight and filmed the fugitive on his mobile at around 11.45pm. Despite six officers turning up to try and catch Colin he disappeared into the night and it was down to owners Jon Cloke, 46, and wife Angela, 46, to track him down. He was eventually found cowering in a field just yards from where he had originally escaped after his countryside walkabout. Mr Cloke drove around for 90 minutes in the dark and cornered Colin before returning at sunrise to capture him. Today he said: 'The police rang us about 12.30am. There’s no-one around here who owns wallabies so I knew it was ours. Mr Cloke, who breeds the animals at his farm, said he had never known one to escape before. He said: 'They didn’t tell me how far it had got but it was spotted near a lane by Balsall Common so it was a few miles away. He must have been missing for about five hours. 'When I found it, it was nearly back and was in the field near where they are all kept – so he’s pretty much much made his own way home. They are quite shy so it’s odd that somebody got a picture of him.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On the run: A shocked motorist spotted the white marsupial while he was on his late night adventure and filmed him on his mobile . Angela described Colin as the ‘rogue’ in the furry family-of-eight and said he must have got homesick and come back. 'My husband had a drive around. He went out about 12.30am and got back about 2am. 'He tracked it down but his wallaby net had fallen off the truck so he couldn’t catch it. 'He secured it in a field overnight and went back out this morning and managed to corner it with a man who works for us and they managed to catch it. Back home: Colin was eventually found five hours later in a field just yards from where he had escaped from . Owner: Angela Cloke, 46, and her husband Jon have bred the animals on their farm for eight years . 'It had basically come back to where it lives to see its mates. He must have got lonely and decided to come home.' White wallabies are mistakenly called 'albino' - locals in their native Tasmania refer to them as 'painted wallabies' because they are not truly albino. Wallabies are simply small kangaroos. There are about 30 species of wallaby across Australia. They can live up to 40 years, run up to 30mph and leap up to 6ft high. Herbivores and nocturnal, they come out to graze in the late afternoon until early the next morning. Like many grass eaters they re-chew and re-digest their food by 'chewing the cud'. Pregnancy lasts just a month, then the baby 'joey' lives in the mother's pouch for about eight months. Wallabies can produce two different kinds of milk at the same time: one for the tiny baby and another, richer blend for its big brother or sister. An adult male is called a buck, boomer or jack, and the female a doe, flyer or jill. A group of wallabies is called a mob. The . couple have bred the animals – native to remote Bruny Island in . Tasmania, Australia – on their farm near Knowle, Solihull, for eight . years. They have have lived on their farm for 23 years and have three sons, Ben, 20, Tom, 17, and Sam, 14. The couple’s main business is through . the sale of eggs but they also keep an exotic menagerie of sheep, eight . llamas, four pigs, 12 cows, seven cats, ornamental pheasants and a . chocolate labrador. Solihull Police tweeted a picture of the furry fugitive on Friday morning initially mistaking it for a kangaroo. They wrote: 'Kangaroo on the loose in Knowle, Solihull.' Seven minutes later cops joked they had ‘jumped to the wrong conclusion’ and admitted it was actually a wallaby. They wrote: 'Correction for the Kangaroo incident in Knowle, it was a Wallaby, jumped to wrong conclusion.' In a final tweet four minutes afterwards, police wrote: 'Kangaroo / Wallaby incident. Situation now under control.' A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed officers had attended the area on Thursday evening in search of the rogue animal. She said: 'At around 11.45pm on June 13 we were called to a report of a Wallaby hopping along Old Green Lane in the Knowle area of Solihull. 'Police attended and located the owner who confirmed the animal had escaped from its pen. 'The wallaby returned home of its own accord.'","Colin the wallaby escaped from his pen in Solihull last night .

For a Prime Minister who has previously been accused of having a penchant for ‘chillaxing’ on the job, it is a mental image that could go both ways. David Cameron has admitted to working in his pyjamas – because he gets up so early. The Prime Minister said he begins work in Number 10 early each morning before changing into one of his smart work suits he is usually seen in. Appearing on the BBC to answer questions sent in from around the world, Mr Cameron was asked if he found it difficult living and working in the same place. One viewer from Turkey asked: ‘Do you sometimes have to do work as Prime Minister in your pyjamas?’ Mr Cameron told the World Have Your Say programme: ‘I get up pretty early in the morning and I start work before I get dressed into all of this [my suit]. So I suppose the short answer to that is, yes.’ The admission is likely to reinforce Mr Cameron’s reputation for informality but counter criticism that he does not work long enough hours. The Prime Minister has previously been accused of taking too much time off to ‘chillax’ – a term coined for ‘relaxing’ and ‘chilling out’–  when he is meant to be running the country. Reputation: David Cameron, watching football with Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, reputedly likes to 'chillax' regularly . He has disclosed he likes to go to bed early, as well as running and play tennis at least once a week. A Number 10 source also told the Spectator last year that the Prime Minister spent a ‘scary, crazy amount of time playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad’, a computer game. However, Mr Cameron has always insisted that he works ‘incredibly hard’.","David Cameron starts his work every day in his pajamas .

Treasury frustration with the Ministry of Defence’s outspoken opposition to spending cuts boiled over yesterday, as a senior minister ridiculed the department for having ‘more horses than tanks’. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander made the jibe after senior generals joined Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in warning that further cuts would damage the Armed Forces. General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, told Sky News that further spending reductions could prove ‘quite dangerous, quite soon’. He added: ‘We have got to the point in certain areas where we can’t go any further without seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of success on future battlefields.’ Battle: The British military has more than 500 horses but fewer than 230 tanks, Treasury minister Danny Alexander noted as he insisted the Ministry of Defence had 'plenty of room' to make savings . Mr Alexander, who is charged with . finding £11.5billion in cuts for the year 2015-16, responded by saying: . ‘Of course in a department that has more horses than it has tanks, there . is room for efficiency savings without affecting our overall military . output, which is what we need to maintain.’ Official figures show the MoD has . more than 500 horses, including 417 on ceremonial duties and 82 held by . the Defence Animal Centre. The Parachute Regiment also keep two ponies . as mascots. By contrast, cuts following the last strategic defence and security review have left the Army with only 227 Challenger 2 tanks. However, a defence source said Mr . Alexander’s claim was meaningless, as reducing the number of horses . retained for ceremonial duties like Trooping the Colour would have . virtually no impact on the department’s finances. Cuts: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander praised the 13 departments who have settled their savings for 2015-16 . They said: ‘I don’t think it’s a very . helpful contribution. Horses play a proud ceremonial role in the Armed . Forces, and modern warfare is not based on tanks.’ The row came as David Cameron sought . to calm Tory fears about military cuts by confirming there would be no . further reduction in military personnel. Under current plans the size of . the Army will be slashed from 102,000 three years ago to 82,000 by . 2015. There had been fears that the number . could be cut again. But speaking at a Downing Street press conference, . Mr Cameron said: ‘We are not going to be making further cuts to the . numbers of our Army, Navy or Air Force. ‘They know what they have available and I think we can be very proud of the job that they do. ‘No department can be excluded from . being efficient, from saving money, from making sure we get the best . possible value for every pound that we take from the taxpayers and . spend. ‘But our taxpayers and our country . can be secure in the knowledge that we have the fourth-largest [defence] . budget in the world and we have some of the finest armed forces in the . world and while I’m Prime Minister that is the way it will always stay.’ Labour’s Treasury spokesman Chris . Leslie said it was astonishing that ministers were fighting their . spending battles in public, adding: ‘It’s totally chaotic for the . Government to be conducting spending negotiations in public this way, . with big departments like defence yet to reach agreement.’ But Mr Alexander said: ‘Although none . of the spending choices we make are easy, ensuring the UK can pay its . way in the world is vital to our long-term prosperity.’ Military horses have a unique role in both the history and day-to-day life of the British army. As many as 100 mounted officers used to help guard the monarch, accompanying them on any trip they made by road. Now the MoD has  more than 500 horses. The daily Changing of the Guard ceremony involves up to 15 horses if the Queen is in London and 12 if she is away. The Queen’s Life Guard sentries and their mounts are on duty every day outside Buckingham Palace, offering round-the-clock protection to the Royal household. Today’s popular Trooping the Colour ceremony also has the British cavalry at its heart. The procession, which marks the official birthday of the Sovereign, takes place every year in June on Horse Guards Parade. It has been a British infantry tradition since 1748. More than 200 of the Army’s horses line the route, forming the body of the parade and pulling the Queen’s coach. The event has become so popular with spectators that tickets regularly sell out.Crowds even gather to watch the rehearsals that take place two weeks before.","Danny Alexander questions need for horses at a time of austerity .

They work tirelessly to give their patients the best possible care, going far beyond the call of duty with no thought of reward. But last night, five of the NHS’s unsung heroes finally got the recognition they deserve. GP Ronan Moran was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s first Health Hero Awards, in association with Lloydspharmacy and ITV’s This Morning. He and four other heroes met David Cameron at Number 10 before going on to an awards ceremony and dinner hosted by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford at the Marriott Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square. Celebrities including Esther Rantzen took a back seat as they listened to the inspirational stories of the men and women who have gone the extra mile for their patients. All five Health Heroes were nominated by our readers for the prestigious accolade, which aimed to highlight positive and inspiring stories at a time when there are so many reports of neglect and carelessness. Dr Moran, 62, received his nomination from Greta Armitage. Dr Moran, whose practice is in Feltham, West London, cared for her late husband, John, after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In Mr Armitage’s last weeks, Dr Moran would visit the couple at home every day, often late in the evening. Mrs Armitage said: ‘It was because of this really exceptional support [from Dr Moran] that I was able to fulfil John’s ambition which was to die at home.’ When her husband passed away, Mrs Armitage rang the locum doctor on call as it was late at night. Instead, Dr Moran arrived. Mrs Armitage described how his presence was a great comfort to her, and how Dr Moran helped wash her husband and change his clothes and bedding. She said Dr Moran told her he wanted her husband to leave his home with dignity. That level of service, dedication and care was said to be typical of Dr Moran, described by colleagues as an ‘inspiration’. Last night he was presented with the award, and a £5,000 holiday, by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Accepting it, Dr Moran said: ‘I am very humbled. I think it is a great privilege.’ Daily Mail Health Hero Awards finalists from left to right Surgeon David Albert, Dr Ronan Moran, volunteer driver Ron King, charity founder Cathy Ryan and seated Margaret Cameron . His fellow heroes included Margaret Cameron, a nursing assistant for dementia sufferers in Doncaster. She was nominated by Mary Beardsley, a senior nursing sister, for her dedication and compassion. At 69 she still works full-time, helping to run three day care centres for dementia sufferers. Colleagues said her ‘understanding and natural warmth set her apart’ and that patients often ask for her by name when she is not working, despite having severe memory problems. They said she encouraged her patients to engage in therapies thanks to her ‘strength of personality’, and scoured car boot sales looking for objects to help stimulate her patients. GP Ronan Moran was presented with the award by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . David Albert, 57, an ear, nose and . throat surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, was nominated by Cheryl . Towse, from Essex, for his treatment of her son, Theo. She . described how he gave Theo his personal phone numbers, would come in on . his days off to treat him and sing to him when he was  scared. Ron King, 79, a retired bus driver in Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, is a volunteer who takes cancer patients to hospital for treatment. He was nominated by Roger Hilliard, whose father has leukaemia. Cathy Ryan, 56, a community matron in Southwold, Suffolk, was nominated by Marian Proctor for her work setting up a charity that has improved the lives of countless carers and their patients, including Marian’s mother. Mr Cameron said: ‘The Awards provide an ideal opportunity to highlight what our National Health Service is about and why we should all be proud of the care it provides. ‘The number of people nominated for the award shows there are unsung heroes dedicated to the task of providing compassionate care in hospitals, surgeries and clinics across the country.’","GP Ronan Moran named overall winner of Daily Mail's Health Hero Awards .

"By . Victoria Bischoff . PUBLISHED: . 19:20 EST, 14 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 14 June 2013 . Plans to scrap exorbitant roaming charges for using a mobile phone abroad have been unveiled. EU lawmakers have tabled proposals to stop mobile phone giants charging sky-high prices to holidaymakers in Europe. The move would mean phone users would be charged no extra for making or receiving a call abroad than they would normally pay at home. Roaming charges: Mobile phone operators will be forced to slash their tariffs in the EU . If the proposal is given the green light it could knock hundreds of pounds off the bills of UK holidaymakers, who on average spend an extra £120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad, according to price comparison website uSwitch. A ban on roaming charges would follow a cap that has already been agreed. From July 1, calls made by British travellers in the EU will cost a maximum of €0.24 (20p) a minute, or €0.07 (6p) a minute to receive one. Text messages are €0.08 (7p) each and downloading one megabyte of data – the equivalent of sending around 40 emails or browsing five web pages – is capped at €0.45 (38p). On top of this no one can be charged more than €50 (£43) in one billing period, over their normal monthly contract. These charges were expected to fall further next year, but the EU now plans to ban them altogether. Receiving a text in Europe has been free since 2009. Ernest Doku, from uSwitch, said: ‘Around one in seven Brits arrive home from holiday to a massive phone bill due to the charges they have racked up on foreign turf. ‘Scrapping all roaming charges in EU countries is a real win for consumers. Not only will we be better protected from the shock of these steep bills, but the doors will be open to foreign networks looking for a piece of the market in Britain, which could mean cheaper mobile deals too.’ Caps on charges for using mobile phones in Europe have been in place since 2007. At the time phone companies were estimated to make around £3.4billion from these fees. Since that first crackdown, British holidaymakers have saved an estimated £1.5billion. However, while charges have fallen by around three-quarters since the first cap, mobile phone usage abroad has risen by 630 per cent. As a result the amount phone firms make from roaming charges is thought to total tens of billions of euros. A British person who travels abroad for 15 days a year, checks a few emails every day, and uses the internet for half an hour would still pay around £75. Holiday concerns: Going on holiday will now be far less expensive thanks to caps on mobile phone bills . If the ban on the charges  goes ahead, it could mean holidaymakers are just charged the standard rate in their contract and would be able to use any inclusive call and text minutes they have, from as early as July 2014. However, industry experts believe an outright ban would lead to firms hiking normal prices to recoup some of the lost income. Neelie Kroes, the digital commissioner of the European Union, said: ‘I have said from day one in this job that roaming charges should go. ‘I want to show the EU is useful to people’s lives.’ A spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘Roaming charges is the one thing everyone agrees on. ‘Members of the European Parliament will want to get the ban agreed sooner rather than later so they can go to the elections in May next year and say “look what we did”.’ The EU aims to publish a legal proposal for the ban at the end of July which will then be put to national leaders in October.","Phone users will be charged no more for calls than they would be at home .

"By . James Forsyth . PUBLISHED: . 19:02 EST, 23 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:03 EST, 25 March 2013 . Tories have despaired at Cameron's conduct over Leveson after he forged a late-night press regulation policy at Ed Miliband's office . It was meant to be the week when the Tories’ Election campaign began. The Budget was designed to arm every Tory MP with a message for the doorstep. But instead this became the week where David Cameron landed himself with a problem that will bedevil him all the way to polling day. The problem is a system of press regulation that has alarmed nearly every newspaper in the land and infuriated several Tory Secretaries of State. Compounding this problem is that this wasn’t a deal made in Downing Street, but in Ed Miliband’s office. One despairing Cabinet Minister says when he woke up and heard what had happened, he put his pillow over his head and considered resigning. It is little wonder then that Lynton Crosby, the man Cameron hired to deliver a Tory victory at the next Election, is so concerned by events. A friend remarks ruefully: ‘Lynton told them to sort minimum alcohol pricing and Leveson as they were both distractions from the main message. But this certainly isn’t what he had in mind on Leveson.’ This was a U-turn with added political incompetence – for ten days previously, Cameron had called off cross-party talks saying the distance between the parties was unbridgeable. Even one of his longest-standing allies admits the deal was ‘terrible and ridiculous’. One No 10 aide defends the agreement but concedes: ‘No one was thinking through how it looks.’ Labour's negotiators are incredulous at how the Tories handled things – allowing Oliver Letwin to be summoned from his bed to late-night talks and to arrive without any political support. One says: ‘We couldn’t believe they hadn’t created a  better, stronger team. They were so apolitical about it.’ The fact the mild-mannered, consensual Letwin was doing this job at all reveals how politically naive No 10 can be. One Secretary of State points out that ‘when you’re in a knife fight with Miliband on the issue he’s used to define himself, it is risky to send in a healer not a warrior’. Mild-mannered, consensual policy minister Oliver Letwin was called from his bed to the talks on press regulation . This week’s events have led to a growing feeling in Tory circles that Crosby, the man who led Boris Johnson to victory twice in London, needs to go full-time. If he doesn’t, political mistakes will keep on happening – making his job and a General Election victory impossible. One Minister who knows the Cameron operation well insists that Crosby ‘won’t be able to do what he needs to do unless he’s around every day’. Crosby is already proving hugely influential. One Osborne ally tells me ‘to say that this was Lynton’s Budget as much as George’s Budget is an exaggeration. But there’s some truth to it.’ So far, he has fitted into the team better than expected. Many thought the straight-talking Australian’s style wouldn’t suit the more genteel Cameron circle. But even Andrew Cooper, Cameron’s chief strategist, who was expected to clash spectacularly with Crosby, is getting on with him. The unpolitical nature of No 10 has long been a source of irritation to Tory Cabinet Ministers. At a political Cabinet meeting last year, several Ministers complained forcefully to Cameron about it. There are signs that their message is starting to get through. Oliver Dowden, the recently appointed deputy chief of staff, is proving adept at pushing Tory changes through the Whitehall machine. And Ameet Gill, who has been with Cameron since he became leader, has now been put in charge of the Government’s daily agenda, bringing a sense of energy and discipline to it. Acknowledging that there’s a problem, Cameron has taken to telling people he wants the Government’s message to be ‘cleaner and clearer’. But if the Tories are to be in with a fighting chance at the Election, they’ll need to realise they’re in a political battle now. The Budget showed that when they remember that, they are competitive. But last week revealed what disasters happen when they fail to grasp this. Cyprus is in the middle of the longest . bank holiday in history and, when banks do reopen, there will be strict . limits on how much money people can take out. But the UK Government . believes the island isn’t going to end up being the first to quit the . single currency. One senior figure says: ‘Angela Merkel is playing . hardball but she doesn’t want the economic danger of Cyprus leaving the . euro.’ But one Minister concedes that the situation is moving so fast it . is hard to know what will happen next, especially given that Germany . was reluctant to see Cyprus even join the EU in 2004. If the Cypriots do . leave, it’ll be the cheapest place in Europe to holiday this summer. David Cameron will head north of the border in the coming weeks as the Government continues to plot how to beat Alex Salmond in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Salmond, for his part, is missing no opportunity to get under the  skin of Cabinet Ministers, by signing off letters to them: ‘Yours for  an independent Scotland.’ But Patrick McLoughlin, the no-nonsense Transport Secretary, has come up with a simple response. He finishes his own correspondence to Salmond: ‘Yours for a United Kingdom.’ Former BBC producer Thea Rogers is said to be behind the Budget's slick presentation and improving Osborne's media performances . The night before the Budget, George . Osborne and his Treasury team sat eating takeaway Domino’s pizza as they . went through the details one last time. There was a certain . nervousness. They knew Osborne couldn’t afford for this Budget to . unravel as the last one had. Today, it is clear it hasn’t. Much of the damage done to the . Chancellor’s reputation on the Tory backbenches by last year’s events . has been repaired. Osborne’s political capital and confidence are also . returning. As one Cabinet ally proclaims: ‘We’ve got the full George . back.’ Osborne has done much to try to avoid a repeat of last year’s problems. He’s strengthened his ministerial team, bringing in Greg Clark, one of . the cleverest Tories in Parliament, and Sajid Javid, a former banker and . one of the stars of the new Tory intake. He’s also bolstered his office . with two new advisers. Neil O’Brien, former head of think-tank Policy . Exchange, is responsible for the Chancellor’s refrain that the . Government is for ‘people who work hard and want to get on’. The other . arrival is former BBC producer Thea Rogers, left, who worked with the . Corporation’s Political Editor Nick Robinson. Insiders credit her with . the slick presentation of the Budget and improving Osborne’s media . performances. But the real challenge for Osborne and his team will come with the . spending review in June, which must set out a further £11.5 billion of . cuts. It is hard to see how the numbers can be made to add up, given . there will be no further savings from welfare, and the Lib Dems are . determined to protect the budget of Vince Cable’s Business Department, . which they believe to be key to growth. This means the only option appears to be big cuts in the Tory-run Home . Office and Defence. This won’t go down well with their Ministers, who . have already spoken out against more cuts. One Treasury source concedes the spending review will ‘get noisy’ but is . adamant they ‘will get it done’. If Osborne can manage to square this . circle, his political authority really will be restored.","Cameron summoned policy minister Oliver Letwin to press regulation talks .

Army, Navy and RAF personnel are poised to take over duties from prison and probation officers if they conduct an illegal strike. The Ministry of Defence confirmed servicemen and women are being trained for the positions as trade unions consider industrial action over the private running of jails. Forces are learning how to conduct non-prisoner-facing duties such as patrolling jail borders and checking CCTV. Change of pace: Army personnel are among those who will be on prison duty if the strike goes ahead . After being deployed they will have six hours notice to reach the prisons if a strike does take place. Six state-run British prisons and one other are up for competitive tender and their futures are set to be decided within a few weeks. Private security firms G4S, Sodexo and Serco are among the bidders and if they win they may choose to make some prison staff redundant which could provoke strikes. Officers and ranks from 12 RAF bases were brought in for training in Cambridgeshire at RAF Wittering. An MoD spokesman explained: 'The Armed Forces routinely train for a range of contingencies, but such training does not mean that personnel will necessarily deploy. 'The MOD has a long-standing contingency arrangement with the Ministry of Justice to provide assistance in the event of unlawful strike action by prison officers.' Training: Members of the RAF have already gone to Cambridgeshire to learn the required skills . A tasking order sent to RAF officers by Headquarters Air Command shows the National Offender Management Scheme (NOMS) has notified the MoD that they will need help, as revealed by the Daily Telegraph. The order reads: 'NOMS has given the MoD official notice in order to force generate and train personnel to undertake non-prisoner-facing duties in support of NOMS in the event of industrial action in prisons in England and Wales. 'From the day of activation, personnel will be held at six hours notice to arrive at identified prisons. 'All personnel will be able to maintain this state of readiness from their parent unit.' The Prison Officers' Association denied all knowledge of the strike on Friday night but because they are banned by law from taking industrial action they rarely declare their intentions in advance. In May around 80 per cent of jails lost their staff to a surprise strike targeted against public sector reforms, although it only lasted a few hours. Exercise was cancelled and prisoners were kept in their cells with only a few staff on hand to provide them with food and medication. Even criminal court proceedings were put on hold because captives could not be taken to court as the guards had left their posts to protest. The Ministry of Justice insisted on Friday night that they are planning to avoid a strike and will try to keep close relations with unions in order to do so. Servicemen and women are no strangers to helping out where required, with over 18,000 assisting at the London 2012 Olympics.","Forces will take up non-prisoner-facing roles if necessary .

Flawed: Jeremy Hunt told the Commons said that he was unhappy with the analysis which lead to the planned axing of units in Leeds, Leicester and London . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday suspended controversial plans to close three children’s heart surgery units. Mr Hunt acted after an independent report said the closures were based on flawed analysis. The guidance from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) comes after a bitter fightback by threatened units at Leeds General Infirmary, Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and the Royal Brompton in west London. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons he was unhappy at the way a £6million review proposed axing units in Leeds, Leicester and London. He said a new independent panel had found 'too many questions unanswered' and the closure programme was being suspended. The Safe and Sustainable Review has proposed . closing units at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI), Glenfield Hospital in . Leicester and the Royal Brompton in west London. But the decision was heavily criticised and campaigners . have fought ferociously against the plans. A new report by the Independent Reconfiguration Panel (IRP) found serious problems with the way the running of the review, Mr Hunt told MPs. He has now asked NHS England to continue with the process of looking into the reorganisation of children's heart surgery and asked them to report back by the end of July. He said that while the IRP agrees with the need for change in the services the NHS provides, it found the Safe and Sustainable Review 'was based on a flawed analysis of the impact of incomplete proposals and leaves too may questions about sustainability and implementation'. Mr Hunt added: ‘This is clearly a serious criticism of the safe and sustainable process. ‘I therefore accept their recommendation that the proposals cannot go ahead in their current form and am suspending the review today.’ The decision was welcomed by campaigners, who had warned children in need of heart surgery and their families. would have to travel too far to reach their nearest unit if the closures went ahead. Welcome: Campaigners were delighted at the news that the closures were to be halted. Lisa Rushworth is pictured with her son Jack, 11, from York, as he recovers from heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary .

Relief: Karen Middleton with her son Liam Hey, aged four, from Leeds and former patient and now Save Our Surgery campaigner Joe Barry, aged 16, (right) welcomed the news that the closure process had been suspended . Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘I think we have to be frank with people that we can't expect really technical surgery - like children's heart operations, to be carried out at every hospital in the country. ‘As the parent of a desperately ill child, wanting to get the best care for that child, you need to know that you're getting something that is world best. ‘For really technical operations you can't get that everywhere. Clearly the conclusion is that this process, which started in 2008, hasn't been carried out properly so we need to make a re-start.’ Uncertainty: Children's heart surgery at Royal Brompton Hospital in west London had been to to end but the closure has now been suspended . The original decision to close the . three units was part of a general review of children's heart services . across England based on the premise that there was a need to concentrate . expertise in more specialist centres. The . Safe and Sustainable review followed the landmark inquiry into . children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary between 1990 and . 1995, where up to 35 children and babies died as a result of poor care. In . the wake of the inquiry, it was recommended that paediatric cardiac . units be set a target for the number of operations per year, and surgery . be concentrated in a few specialist centres in order to ensure quality . of care. The proposals had suggested the . institutions which were to house the specialist surgery centres were: . Evelina Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Trust, . Great Ormond Street, both in London, Southampton General Hospital, . Birmingham Children's Hospital, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the . Freeman Hospital in Newcastle and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in . Liverpool. John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford was originally part of the . consultation process but it suspended its children's heart programme in 2010 following a spate of deaths. Safety: Units at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and Leeds General Infirmary were also earmarked for closure by a £6million review, which has now been identified as 'flawed' Senior medical figures today insisted that major changes still needed to go ahead. Dr Jacqueline Cornish, NHS England . clinical director for children and young people, said there was a . ‘compelling case for change’. ‘We will have a plan by the end of . July, then we would hope to move to implementation of whatever this plan . is going to show us by 12 months' time,’ she told BBC Radio 4's The . World At One. ‘This is ambitious but I think it shows the gravity . with which we take this and our complete ambition to do this in the . interests of getting improved children's outcomes, making it safer and . making the entire surgical service sustainable. ‘We understand this . is a highly emotionally-charged issue but what we are attempting to do . is outline a national service for children.’ Lord Ribeiro, chairman of the IRP, said: ‘We have listened to a wide cross-section of individuals and organisations during recent months, giving us the opportunity to meet and hear from many parents, children, frontline staff, local charities and volunteers involved in these services. ‘The focus of this review and the panel's advice is fundamentally about the long-term future and best interests of children with congenital heart disease. ‘The critical factor to consider, in the panel's view, is that engagement of all interested parties is the key to achieving improvements for patients and families without unnecessary delay. ‘There is now a real opportunity to involve patients, public and other stakeholders in taking work forward as set out in the Panel's recommendations.’","Units were threatened at Leeds General Infirmary, Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and the Royal Brompton in London .

A spat between Nick Clegg and Boris Johnson descended into a war of words... over who was the lazier. It began when the Deputy Prime Minister branded the London Mayor a ‘slacker’. Air war: Nick Clegg, pictured during his weekly show today, accused Boris Johnson of being a 'slacker' for only hosting a radio show once a month . Mr Johnson retorted that Mr Clegg was . an ‘idle bum’ with only a ‘ceremonial post’ in government. The row . erupted yesterday after it was revealed that Mr Johnson is to host a . monthly phone-in show on London radio station LBC. Who do you think is the biggest slacker? He will take questions for 45 minutes . on the breakfast show, mediated by Nick Ferrari. But Mr Clegg, who . answers questions on LBC for half an hour each week, dismissed the Tory . Mayor’s effort as inadequate. The Liberal Democrat leader told . listeners to his Call Clegg show: ‘I’m going to call him Slacker Johnson . from now on. He’s only on once a month. If imitation is the sincerest . form of flattery, I’m delighted he is trying to follow in my footsteps, . but he should put the hours in. ‘Every week – I want to see Slacker Johnson every week.’ Hitting back at the jibe, the London . Mayor made his contempt for Mr Clegg clear, accusing the Deputy Prime . Minister of not having a proper job. ‘Good to see Nick’s got spare time in [his] ceremonial role as Lib leader,’ Mr Johnson said, before branding him an ‘idle bum’.

Clare Burke was filmed after a widower upset at the desecration of his wife’s final resting place hid a CCTV camera in a nearby tree. Ron Wilks, 77, saw Burke throwing dead flowers and gravel on to the grave of his wife Jill and their one-day-old granddaughter Hayley Reynolds. Scroll down for video .

Disrespect: Burke also emptied bags of dead flowers onto Mrs Wilks' grave . Satisfied: Burke is captured walking away from the vandalised grave by the spycam . Burke attacked the grave because she had a grudge against Mr Wilks, a court was told. She resented him because he had become engaged to a woman who used to date her former partner. Prosecutor Sharon Jomaa told Cheltenham magistrates that the hidden  camera showed Burke emptying carrier bags full of dead flowers and gravel  over the grave. Claire Burke repeatedly desecrated the grave of Jill Wilks and her one-day-old granddaughter . She would pull up live flowers and ‘plant’ dead ones in flower holders at the burial plot at Coney Hill Cemetery in Gloucester, she said. ‘The matter was very distressing for all the family and for Mr Wilks’s daughter Debbie, the mother of  the one-day-old baby,’ she told  the court. She said Burke had ‘no relationship with Jill Wilks or the baby and there is no reason for her to go anywhere near the grave’. The court heard that Mr Wilks, of Tuffley, Gloucester, had known Burke as a client through his work for a finance group. He said he had put a camera in a conifer tree in February, expecting to see that children were responsible for the vandalism. He was appalled to see it was Burke and was shocked that she could do such a ‘despicable’ thing, the court heard. Mark Anderson, defending, said Burke apologised for her actions. ‘She fully accepts what she has done and that it was utterly wrong, she is very sorry,’ he said. ‘Her temper had just boiled over. ‘Any interference with a grave is a reprehensible act and it was intended to cause distress. There is a great deal of background in this case but none can justify what she did and she doesn’t suggest that it does.’ Ron Wilkes, 78, with his daughter Debbie Reynolds whose daughter Hayley shares the grave which was vandalised with her grandmother Jill . The grave of Jill Wilks at Coney Hill cemetery, Gloucester was vandalised by pensioner Claire Burke . Clare Burke trashed the grave of Jill Wilks at Coney Hill, Gloucestershire on multiple occasions by removing new flowers and replacing them with dead ones . The family of the late Jill Wilks said Claire Burke from Abbeydale had shown no remorse for her actions . He added: ‘There is a history of antagonism and on this occasion it boiled over.’ Chairman of the bench Hilary Davidson said Burke’s actions caused the family ‘immense distress’, but added: ‘We have heard you apologise sincerely and say that you won’t do it again. ‘I cannot imagine what Mr Wilks has felt like – and his daughter. ‘It is hard to know how to punish you for this, considering the distress caused.’ Burke, of Oxmoor, Gloucestershire, admitted a charge of harassment. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and a two-year restraining order prohibiting her from contacting Mr Wilks or his fiancee or going near the grave. She was also ordered to pay  £100 costs. After the trial, Mr Wilks said:  ‘This has been going on for a long time. At first I thought it was children messing around but it was happening so often that I realised it was malicious. ‘It makes no sense to me why  she did it. She has shown no remorse to us.’","Clare Burke, 79, trashed grave of Jill Wilks and one-day-old granddaughter .

It's usually the length of a skirt that puts schoolgirls at odds with teachers over uniform policy. But the headmistress at one primary school has issued a fashion clampdown – on frilly socks. Elaborate ‘princess socks’, decorated with frills, bows and ribbons, are considered a ‘trip hazard’. Any pupil who flouts the rules will be told to replace them with another pair from Primark. A playground craze has seen pupils wearing increasingly elaborate 'princess' socks decorated with frills, bows and ribbons. But they have been banned at Kingsholm Primary School, in Gloucester . Headmistress Jan Buckland turned against the flowery footwear after a pupil fell over - and sent a letter home to the parents of the 438 pupils, citing health and safety fears. She imposed a blanket ban on frills larger than 3cm . The ban at Kingsholm Primary School in . Gloucester came after one girl suffered a fall which was judged – in a . health and safety assessment form – to have been caused by the garments. Parent Tracy Rudge, 42, started the playground craze by making them for . her six-year-old daughter Lily-Jo. They proved so popular she made hundreds of pairs for her daughter’s classmates, which she sells for £2.50 a pair. The cleaner has now accused school officials of going ‘health and safety mad’. ‘My daughter could fall and break her arm doing PE, but she’s not allowed to wear frilly socks? ‘It’s a joke – shoelaces are a million times more dangerous than the socks,’ she said. 'The parents of more than 400 pupils were told that frills larger than . 3cm (1.1ins) were banned following an incident in the playground. However, mother-of-three Mrs Rudge says the fall was not caused by the . socks – and many parents are defying the ban. Any child found now breaching the order will be forced to change into a . plain pair bought from Primark, and parents given a ‘reminder’ letter. Headmistress Jan Buckland said it was clear the items were a ‘trip . hazard’. ‘The governing body and I decided that a ban was appropriate . because the frill had been trailing on the floor,’ she said. ‘If parents are defiant, the kids will have to change out of them  if they arrive in the building wearing them.’ The school refused to answer questions about what would happen to the children if they continued to flout the ban.

Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s shocking so much Parliamentary staff time is being wasted surfing websites that clearly have nothing to do with their jobs. 'Taxpayers expect MPs, assisted by their staff, to be spending their . time representing constituents and scrutinising the Government, not . playing online games. ‘It’s important that this information is in the public domain so that . taxpayers can see exactly how the time they are paying for is actually . being spent.’ The figures also reveal an extraordinary number of visits to supermarket shopping websites and computer gaming sites and the controversial music downloading site Grooveshark, which is being sued by records labels for alleged copyright offences. Separate figures reveal that MPs and their staff made more than 2,000 calls to the speaking clock last year - despite working within earshot of Big Ben.

The U.S. government stopped trials of the experimental HIV vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent HIV infection or reduce the amount of HIV in the blood. The research, started in 2009, it is just the latest in a series of failed attempts to develop a vaccine for the virus. The study, called HVTN 505, had enrolled 2,504 volunteers in 19 U.S. cities. Scientists are trying to develop a vaccine for the HIV virus but progress is slow . ‘This trial has provided a clear, swift answer about a specific vaccine strategy,' Mitchell Warren, executive director of the nonprofit group AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention, told Reuters. It's not the answer we hoped for, but the search doesn't end here. ‘Researchers need to unpack the data from this trial to understand more about why this strategy didn't prevent infection.’ The review board has recommended that no further vaccinations be given. The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which sponsored the study, said it would continue to follow study participants to further evaluate the trial data. The HVTN 505 trial tested a two-part vaccine strategy designed to first prime the immune system and then provide a vaccine 'boost'. The vaccine itself was based on a common cold virus that was used to sneak HIV genes into the body and grab the attention of the immune system. So far, there are no vaccines approved to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Several HIV trials are still underway or in planning stages, including a follow-up to a Thai trial which in 2009 showed a vaccine combination cut HIV infections by 31.2 percent. Killer: The HIV virus attacks the body's immune system . Although the finding was not strong enough to approve the vaccine, it offered the first glimpse that a vaccine could work. Both of these vaccines - the one in the Thai study and the HVTN 505 study - are largely designed to train immune system cells known as T-cells to recognize and kill cells already infected with HIV. Researchers are studying other approaches, including vaccines that activate powerful antibodies to prevent HIV from infecting cells in the first place. Matthew Rose, a vaccine advocate for AVAC who participated in the HVTN 505 study, said he remains hopeful in the search for a vaccine. 'These results do not change the fundamental view that an AIDS vaccine remains critical to any long-term strategy to end the AIDS epidemic,' he said.","Study called HVTN 505 was found not to prevent infection or reduce levels of virus in blood .

The coast path is popular with walkers, . but officials have closed off the area and are urging people to stay . away for fear of more rock falls. The . crew of an Army safety boat monitoring their nearby firing ranges . alerted the coastguard to the landslide yesterday at 8am. A spokesman for Portland Coastguard . said: ‘It is quite extraordinary. A massive fall has taken out part of . the cliff, it is huge. 'The . cliff has broken away right from the top and has left a pile of chalk . that is as high as the cliffs. There have been several landslides along . the coastline recently but this is by far and away the biggest. ‘The . message is for people to stay away from the area and not to ignore the . signs that are going up advising them not to go any further.’ Meanwhile two ramblers were photographed deciding to walk dangerously close . to the edge hours after the slippage yesterday.

It's unfair for the coastguard to imply that we were stupid to walk near a collapsed cliff despite their warning.’ Yesterday's landslip is the latest in a series that have changed the face of the protected Jurassic Coast.

Richard Edmonds, chief geologist for the Jurassic Coast, said: ‘Today's (Tuesday's) landslip is an exceptionally big rock fall. ‘The land along parts of the Jurassic Coast is made up of soft clay rock and when it gets saturated by heavy rain over long periods followed by dry weather like we have had, landslips take place. We have also had some big seas recently lapping at the base of the cliffs. 'So that may have been a factor in what has happened. These landslips are taking parts of the coastal path away.

But the bonus will be paid only to children predicted to get a D grade at GCSE who achieve at least a C in both subjects. The scheme, at Oldbury Academy in the West Midlands, was criticised last night for promoting mediocrity by focusing on C grades – the standard by which a school’s performance in league tables is measured. Pupils at Oldbury Academy in the West Midlands are being offered cash bribes to do better in their GCSEs . It has also been attacked as divisive . because it excludes high-achieving pupils as well as those who are . expected to fail but who instead end up with a good pass. The controversial policy is understood to apply to 49 Year 11 pupils sitting GCSEs this summer – at a potential cost of £9,800. Last year 60 per cent of pupils there . who sat the exams achieved a C grade or higher, compared with a . national average for state-funded schools of 56.1 per cent. Christopher Hill, 29, a University of . Birmingham teaching fellow whose father used to work at the specialist . sports academy, wrote to Education Secretary Michael Gove and schools . regulator Ofsted to complain about the policy. He said yesterday: ‘Times are hard . and many services are being cut. Is it therefore justifiable to spend . money in this way when the same funding could be used to provide . important and educationally valuable experiences for many more of its . pupils?’ The controversial scheme is believed to apply to Year 11 children sitting their GCSEs this summer (file photo) Parents were also furious. A mother . of a Year 11 pupil, who asked not to be named, said: ‘My daughter has . been predicted A and B grades and I’ve heard nothing about any rewards. It’s a bit of a kick in the teeth for kids who just get their head down . and get on with it.’ Another mother said: ‘It just promotes mediocrity. I believe it will only segregate pupils.’ Oldbury Academy headteacher John . Martin defended the initiative, claiming it prepared children for . real-life situations where hard work is rewarded. ‘Students need to demonstrate significant progress before being considered for recognition through our rewards scheme,’ he said. But Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman . of the Commons Education Select Committee, said: ‘This is a distortion . based on the importance of a C grade to the school, instead of its . importance to the child. It’s the wrong way round. Pupils will be given £200 if they achieve GCSE grades that are much better than those predicted . ‘Children who have worked very hard . to get themselves to the level where they are predicted to get a C will . feel that those who haven’t put in as much application are being . rewarded.’ Fellow Tory Chris Skidmore added: . ‘They are trying to play the system. It should be teachers who are paid . by results and penalised if they don’t do well enough.’ The Department for Education . confirmed schools can offer incentives. It said: ‘They are free to do . with their money whatever they think is best.’ But Professor Alan Smithers, director . of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham . University, warned that bribes often backfire because of the resentment . they cause among children who miss out. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has this week criticised schools for pitching mixed ability classes at average pupils.

Shocking: This carer, who was later disciplined by her employer, 'mooned' at the camera, set up by the family of Muriel Price, 83 . The neglect of the elderly in their own homes by care workers could become the next big health scandal, a minister said yesterday. The warning came after film from secret cameras showed carers treating an incontinent 83-year-old grandmother disrespectfully. Muriel Price received help in her own home after the death of her husband, Les, who had been her primary carer. But footage taken from cameras installed by her grandson recorded her distress after carers failed to turn up, or the lack of respect from some who did. It captures a care worker, who appears to be aware of the camera, ‘mooning’ at the lens as she walks behind the pensioner. Mrs Price is also seen sobbing as she waits for her carer to arrive after spending more than 13 hours in bed. She is heard to cry out: ‘Disgusting this is, absolutely disgusting. It’s not good enough. I can’t put up with it much longer.’ A carer is seen sticking her finger in Mrs Price’s food to check it is hot, while another changes an incontinence pad in view of the street. Mrs Price is diabetic and has special dietary needs, but one carer is filmed admitting she cannot cook, adding: ‘I can’t fry an egg. I am really that rubbish at cooking. Why they send me to people at dinner time, it’s beyond me.’ Mrs Price’s grandson Darryl set up two cameras at her home in Blackpool, Lancashire, to monitor her and provide help if she fell. Instead, footage taken over nearly a month shows carers turning up late or not at all at least 12 times. Mr Price said: ‘To see someone in your family treated with no dignity – you feel guilty. You’ve trusted this company to look after them.’ 83-year-old Muriel Price - was neglected by her care worker for up to 45 minutes at a time. Care Minister Norman Lamb warns the next abuse scandal may come in the home care sector . The footage, which was broadcast by BBC News, shows several visits are much shorter than the one hour the carers are contracted for. Mrs Price, who is now in a care home, said: ‘The way they treat old people is wrong, just wrong. Worried: Norman Lamb fears a scandal is growing over the current care system . ‘You’d be waiting for your tea and you didn’t get any ’cause they never turned up, they never bothered. ‘And you’d ring them up and they’d say we’ll be sending someone along but they never did. I’m lucky I have a family to look after me. 'Those that haven’t got a family, God help them, poor devils.’The story is the latest showing neglect of older people to have been highlighted by the Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last night, Care Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘It’s just shocking and depressing because this is neglect in your own home. 'When it’s behind a closed front door individuals are particularly vulnerable. Anything can happen. 'This is a complete assault on your dignity.' ‘We know this is not an isolated case. There is some very good care, but where poor care exists we should not tolerate it. 'The next big scandal could occur in this sector.’ The Price family say they repeatedly contacted Mosaic Community Care with their complaints.

It said: ‘Mosaic go above and beyond legal requirements when employing carers to ensure all staff are capable of delivering quality care.’ Mosaic said the footage was taken in 2010 and a carer involved had not worked for the firm since. A spokesman said the family hired Mosaic again in 2011 ‘and were therefore clearly happy with the service’.","Home care worker caught disrespecting her elderly charge .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 07:01 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:22 EST, 29 April 2013 . A father-of-one who has survived cancer three times has described himself as the 'luckiest, unlucky' person alive. John Willis, 37, has battled testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers all in just three years. Miraculously, he has survived each one. John Willis (pictured with his wife Angela) has had testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers . Incredibly, the stomach cancer was not related to the lymph node and testicular cancers, meaning that he developed two completely unconnected cancers. Professor Karol Sikora, a world renown oncologist, told MailOnline that the chances of being diagnosed with two different forms of cancer in a year is one in a million. Leading oncologist Professor Karol Sikora told MailOnline that the chance of getting two different cancers in a year was one in a million. He said testicular cancer is rare - only about 2,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with it each year - and that stomach cancer is very unusual in people as young as Mr Willis. Therefore, he explained that Mr Willis has been exceptionally unlucky, particularly as there is no link between testicular cancer and stomach cancer  - and neither is hereditary. However, Professor Sikora added that the cancer is most likely to reoccur within the first few years meaning that if Mr Willis is still cancer-free at 40, his prognosis will be very good. He said: 'It does happen but it is very unusual. Only about 2,000 men in the UK get testicular cancer every year. Stomach cancer is a bit more common but to get both, and at such a young age, is one in a million.' He added: 'I don't know of any association between these cancers and neither is hereditary so it seems he has been extremely unlucky.' However, the professor went on to explain that if Mr Willis is still clear of the cancer by the time he is 40 then he will have a normal life expectancy as it is most likely to reoccur within the first few years. Mr Willis, from Portchester, Hampshire, said: ‘I remember being on holiday in Spain in June and I sat down awkwardly, which caused me a pain in my testicle. ‘It really hurt, and the pain was still there two months later. ‘I knew I needed to visit my doctor, and after I'd been to see him, he sent me off for a screening. ‘A week later I was told they had found a tumour in my testicle. ‘I always had a feeling there was something wrong, so I wasn't too surprised when I was told the news. I got treated straight away.’ Mr Willis was treated for all three cancers at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth . Surgeons removed Mr Willis's left testicle within three weeks of the diagnosis in August 2010. He was told that the cancer was a seminoma - one of the most treatable forms of testicular cancer - and he underwent a course of chemotherapy. Mr Willis, who has daughter Maisie, 14, with wife Angela, 38, set up a website blogging about his experience and urged men to check for cancer. However, more bad news was on its way - doctors found a tumour in his stomach during a routine scan at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, Hampshire, in October 2011. Mr Willis describes himself as the 'luckiest, unlucky' person alive . Mr Willis said: ‘I went in for a CT scan and doctors found a tumour the size of a snooker ball in my stomach. ‘I hadn't felt any pain, or had any idea it was there.’ Surgeons removed the tumour - which was unrelated to the testicular cancer - in November 2011 and Mr Willis thought that his ordeal was over. However, in November 2012, following a third trip for a check-up, he was dealt yet another devastating blow. Mr Willis said: ‘I got a phone call from my consultant to say one of my lymph glands was bigger than it should be. ‘I couldn't believe it. It was the third time in two-and-a-half years that I'd been diagnosed with cancer.’ On this occasion, his testicular cancer had returned, but in his lymph nodes. In January this year, he began a nine week course of chemotherapy. Mr Willis said: ‘It takes it out of me. I feel like I'm the luckiest, unlucky person. ‘I can't seem to get to a year without doctors finding something else. ‘My family have been brilliant throughout. All this has given me a different outlook on life, and made me less miserable.’ Mr Willis has now been clear of the stomach cancer for 18 months and recent scans have shown that  his lymph nodes are no longer affected either. He is hoping to return to work next month. Julia Frater, Cancer Research UK’s senior information nurse, said: 'The chances of developing two different types of cancer that are unrelated to each other at the age of 37 is about one in 1.5 million, so it’s very unusual indeed. 'In this kind of scenario treatment will be tailored to the individual, with cancer specialists taking into account the patient’s full medical history. 'Cancer Research UK’s helpline nurses are pleased to respond to any questions about cancer and can be contacted on freephone 0808 800 4040.'","John Willis, 37, has had testicular, stomach and lymph node cancers .

Karen Croule, 54, was left fighting for her life after a freak accident on her allotment left her severely burnt . A woman who suffered horrendous burns has become the first in world to have her injuries treated with Botox. Karen Croule, 54, was left fighting for her life after a freak accident at an allotment near her home in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, left her ablaze. She suffered burns to her face, neck and hands and needed several skin grafts. Amazingly, she pulled through but was left with a constant itch, which is common for burns sufferers. In a world first, doctors have cured the itch by giving her injections of Botox. The doctor believes that the treatment was successful because the Botox injections reduce sweating and it is the damaged sweat glands that cause the itching. The mother-of-two said: 'The itching was driving me crackers. I wasn't sleeping so I couldn't go back to work. I became really depressed. I couldn't see an end.' The itching sensation is caused by nerves re-growing, or by dry skin due to the lack of natural oil produced because oil glands are often damaged by the burn. As the nerves grow and start to receive and send messages, they can create a severe itching sensation. Mrs Croule, a family support worker, was enjoying a day out with her family at her allotment when a stray spark from a garden chimney set her jacket alight, causing an instant fireball. Her quick-thinking son pushed her to the ground to try to put out the blaze but she had already suffered horrendous burns. Mrs Croule was taken to the specialist burns unit at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre by air ambulance. She said: 'I had to be operated on sat up and needed lots of skin grafts. They had to rebuild my neck. I was on a lot of morphine and it was all horrendous, but the staff were fantastic.' She suffered serious burns to her face, neck and hands and needed several skin grafts. But as the burns healed, she was left with an unbearably itchy neck which meant she was unable to sleep . Mrs Croule even had to have balloons placed underneath the skin of her neck to stretch it - this created undamaged skin that could be used to repair the wounds. Medics would not allow her to look at her injuries and no mirrors were allowed in her room. She said: 'They said I had to come to terms with it when I was ready.' After a month in hospital she was allowed home and saw her disfigurement for the first time. She said: 'I just burst into tears.' But as her wounds healed, she started experiencing itching day and night. She said: 'Once I started, I couldn't stop. I'd often draw blood. I was desperate.' Doctors tried various treatments but nothing worked. It was then that consultant plastic surgeon, Mr Peter Brooks, came up with the idea of using Botox. Consultant Peter Brooks thought he could relieve the itching using Botox injections. Mrs Croule was the first person in the world to have this treatment for burns . He said: 'Botox can be used to treat . various things. There are lots of good medical uses for Botox including . sweating. It's not just used for cosmetic surgery.' He had been researching the subject for . some time and asked Mrs Croule if she would like to take part in a trial . - the first of its kind in the world. Mrs Croule had balloons placed under her skin to stretch it as a way of creating new undamaged skin . She said: 'I was quite taken aback . when Mr Brooks mentioned Botox. I just thought celebrities used it but I . was willing to try anything. 'I had relief as soon as I had the first injection. There was no itching whatsoever. 'It was a total life saver because I could start sleeping. Now, I'm back at work. I've got my life back. 'I'm not sure if it's made me look any younger though!' Mr Brooks said: 'Botox blocks muscle contraction and reduces sweating. People with burns often have their sweat glands destroyed but the nerves are still there, which could, I believed, be the cause of itching. 'I put those things together and thought there was a good chance Botox would work. 'Karen had relief almost immediately. We have now treated over 50 patients successfully without problems.' The hospital is now planning to run a trial across the world to show Botox is better for chronic burns itching than any other treatments are. The Queen's Medical Centre will lead the trial and there will also be centres across the UK looking into the effects.","Karen Croule was left fighting for life after a bonfire spark ignited her jacket .

An allotment holder who has refused to grow vegetables has lost a legal battle to be allowed to stay on his land. Michael Rock decided to plant fruit trees after he found himself with so many spare vegetables that he had to throw them away. After Hastings Borough Council won the right to evict him from his plot last week, he pledged to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights and insisted: 'This is not over.' Battle: Michael Rock has been thrown off his allotment because he is only growing fruit trees . Mr Rock, 61, appeared at Hastings County Court last week for his suit against the council, which owns Bembrook Allotments in East Sussex. The writer has had his plot at the site for six years, and in 2008 decided to stop growing vegetables when he found himself with so many potatoes, leeks and onions that he could neither eat them nor give them away. Legal battle: Mr Rock is hoping to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights . To replace them, he paid £600 for 13 fruit trees, planting a mixture of pear, plum, apple, cherry and apricot trees. But when council workers carried out a 'plot inspection', they told Mr Rock he was not 'cultivating the land properly', and warned him he must grow vegetables again if he did not want to be evicted from the allotment. Council rules introduced last year . dictate that three quarters of every plot should be 'planted with . productive crops or other plants', in order to prevent plot holders from . neglected the highly sought-after land. Clive . Read, a landscape technician for the council, told the hearing last . week: 'I don't believe that growing fruit trees as a monoculture is an . appropriate use of an allotment.' Mr . Rock, who represented himself in court, said he had followed 'expert . advice' in growing his fruit trees, and that the contract he signed with . the council in 2007 did not say he wasn't allowed to grow only fruit . trees. He said he had . even started growing ferns, roses and artichokes to 'meet the council . half-way', but told the court: 'I feel like I'm a spider in the room . that you want to crush because you don't like the look of me.' District . Judge Geoffrey Smith said the argument came down to a 'dispute over the . fundamental meaning of the word cultivation' and said it was a . 'difficult case'. Protest: The keen gardener started growing fruit after he found himself with too many vegetables . In the end, however, the judge sided with the council, telling the court: 'I find as a fact that the cultivation of 13 fruit trees on that area of land with only grass in between them is not something which meets the stipulation of 75 per cent cultivation within two years.' Mr Rock was ordered to pay £750 in court costs and told to be off the land in two months unless he met council cultivation rules. Speaking to the Hastings Observer after the case, Mr Rock pledged to take his case to a higher court, saying: 'This is not over. I'm not evicted yet and I will appeal. I will take it to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. 'I hope in the end to win the case and for the council to be more understanding of the way people live their lives.' A spokesman for the council said previously: 'The rules were agreed unanimously and we believe they are fair and reasonable and have the support of the vast majority of allotment holders. 'The major change is the introduction of rules which help us ensure that tenants do cultivate their plots.'","Michael Rock, 61, planted fruit trees after amassing surplus of vegetables .

Hundreds of mourners have paid tribute to teenager Georgia Williams, whose body was discovered in woodland after she went missing from her home. Family, friends and teachers attending the funeral of the 17-year-old have paid tribute to the 'bright and caring' young woman they knew. About 800 mourners turned out for a church service celebrating the life of Georgia Williams in her home town of Wellington, Shropshire, today. Georgia Williams mother and father Lynette and Steven, and her sister Scarlett, asked people to wear bright colours at the funeral service for their daughter . Georgia's father helped to bear the coffin, made of wicker, to the waiting hearse and away to a private cremation service .

Georgia left her parents' house on May 26, telling them she was going to see friends - and they never saw her alive again. The teenager's body was discovered in woodland near Wrexham, North Wales, a few days later. Rev Mark Ireland, vicar of All Saints' Church in Wellington, addressed mourners saying: 'We come not so much to mourn a death, but to celebrate a life.' Her family had asked people attending the . funeral to wear bright colours, reflecting Georgia's personality and . the spirit of the service, with many following that advice. Among the mourners were the Chief . Constable of West Mercia Police David Shaw, and other senior officers . from the force where Georgia's father Steven is a serving detective. Georgia's headteacher, Chay Davies called on people 'to take inspiration' from the cadet, who was always 'willing to muck in' Cadets formed a guard of honour for the funeral cortege and throughout the service in a special tribute . The teenager's commanding officer Flight Lieutenant Philippa Bartlett described Georgia as 'a genuine person, brilliant and caring but most of all a bubbly character' Chay Davies, her head teacher at Ercall Wood Technology College - where she was head girl - said 'her genuine willingness to help people shone through' when she was interviewed for the position. He said she could always be relied on to get involved and told how at a charity drag day she pulled off a 'very convincing swagger' while walking along the catwalk, sporting 'a painted-on beard' and 'loving every minute', drawing laughter from the mourners. Mr Davies called on people 'to take inspiration from Georgia' and be judged not by their wealth or possessions but 'by the quality of the relationships we have with the people around us'. 'Today, our whole community shows how valued Georgia is.' Her teacher Mary Parry-Sargeant recalled Georgia was not afraid to muck in and 'was equally happy drilling holes as making the tea'. Mourners were told to make sure Georgia's life made a lasting different to people in the town . The funeral followed the birth of a charity in Georgia's name, which will help support young people and organisations that were significant to her . Friends gathered to say goodbye to the popular former head girl, whose disappearance sparked a massive search by police . 'She had excellent people skills, and understood how to appreciate people,' she added. She said that a two-seater aeroplane students at the college are building, as part of a programme backed by aircraft-maker Boeing and the Royal Aeronautical Society, would be named The Georgia. 'Every time it flies a part of her will take to the skies,' said Mrs Parry-Sargeant. Georgia was as busy outside school as she was in lessons, and helped out on match days at AFC Telford United as well as being a cadet corporal with 1130 Squadron, Air Cadets. Cadets formed a guard of honour for the funeral cortege and throughout the service in a special tribute. Her commanding officer Flight . Lieutenant Philippa Bartlett described Georgia as 'a genuine person, . brilliant and caring but most of all a bubbly character'. She recalled how Georgia, representing the cadets in competition at swimming, had 'done her make-up' before taking to the pool. The vicar at the service told the mourners: 'in years to come people will remember Georgia's death as a turning point, when Wellington rediscovered its soul' Among the mourners were the Chief Constable of West Mercia Police David Shaw, and other senior officers from the force where Georgia's father Steven is a serving detective . The order of the service thanked all of those who had supported the family through the devastating events of the last few weeks . Flt Lt Bartlett added that Georgia would always advised colleagues who were feeling low or miserable to get 'a can of 'Man-Up, Princess'', drawing mirth from the gathered mourners. Mr Ireland later directly addressed Georgia's family - mother Lynette, father Steven and big sister Scarlett - saying: 'You are not alone in bearing this loss.' He added: 'We haven't lost what you have lost, but we can stand with you and we will continue to do so.' He closed his address by asking people to make sure Georgia's life made a lasting different to people in the town. He said that if they did so 'in years to come people will remember Georgia's death as a turning point, when Wellington rediscovered its soul'. His words came following the creation earlier this week of the Georgia Williams Trust, a charity which will help support young people and organisations that were significant to her. As the service ended, Georgia's father helped to bear the coffin, made of wicker, to the waiting hearse and away to a private cremation service flanked by police outriders on motorcycles. Jamie Reynolds, 22, of Wellington, has been charged with her murder. He is in custody and will next appear at Stafford Crown Court on September 6.","Family asked people to wear bright colours to reflect Georgia's personality .

When staff examined the unfortunate dog, they found pieces of Velcro and a chocolate sweet stuck in his fur. Assistant manager Emma Cooper said Womble's 2lb burden of hair put immense strain on his body, and estimated that it had been a year since he was last groomed.

'He can't have been there long because he was dry, but it's terrible that the past owners have left him in that state. It's a very extreme case we've had to deal with. 'Womble would have been in real distress and certainly in my time here, it's the worst case I can remember of an overgrown dog.' Lhasa Apsos are usually groomed every three or four months to keep their fast-growing fur in decent condition. Pet: Womble has now found a new home with a loving owner who agreed to adopt the dog . Playful: Womble is now back on top form after handlers helped him get over his harrowing ordeal . 'Womble is a lovely, little active dog and is so different now than what he was like before he was shaven,' Ms Cooper said. He was named Womble after the furry television characters who live on Wimbledon Common. Amanda Sands, manager at Dogs Trust Leeds, said: 'In the 27 years that I have worked here, this is the worst case of matted fur I have seen on a dog. 'It's astounding a dog can be left to get into this kind of condition, and then abandoned. With his fur trimmed, he can now feel the ground beneath his feet and the wind on his skin.

An Australian woman is attempting to become the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage. Chloe McCardel, 29, is setting off on the 103-mile (166-km) swim today. The treacherous body of water known as the Florida Straits is the Holy Grail for marathon swimmers and has been conquered only once, by Susie Maroney, also Australian, who used a protective cage at age 22 during her 1997 swim that glided on ocean currents and enabled her to make the journey in just 25 hours. Since 2011, four unsuccessful, uncaged swims have been attempted, three by American Diana Nyad and one by Australian Penny Palfrey, and in all, 20 people have tried and failed, McCardel said in a press conference on Tuesday at the Hemingway Marina west of Havana. 'It's the hardest marathon swim in the entire world,' the blond, well-tanned 28-year-old told reporters. 'This is like winning a World Cup in soccer or getting a world record and a gold medal at the Olympic Games, but it's possibly harder because no one has been able to do it,' said McCardel, who works as a first aid trainer in Melbourne. McCardel trains 50 weeks a year and has a record of accomplishment that includes two double crossings of the English Channel. She'll use so-called English Channel marathon rules, meaning she can't touch the boats that will accompany her during what she estimates will be a 60-hour journey, hopefully ending on the shores of Key West, Florida.

He said: ‘According to an eyewitness, . he saw the couple in the pool, he went to the sauna and eight minutes . later he came out and saw Komba’s face in the pool and Josephine was . lying on his back. ‘He thought they were mucking around, a . couples thing, he didn’t take any notice of them.

Lower-priced shampoo can leave hair cleaner than much more expensive products, researchers have claimed. Cambridge University scientists studied 20 brands and top of the shampoos was L’Oreal’s Elvive Nutri-gloss Light shampoo which costs just £3.99 for a large bottle. Advertising: Cheryl Cole is the face of the cosmetics giant L'Oréal which came out top in tests . It left locks cleaner than products which cost up to £100 a tub. The tests were carried out by Colm Durkan, a researcher into . nanotechnology - particles so small that 300 million would fit on a . pinhead. Dr Durkan, who is also a scientist at specialist firm CambridgeNano, . used one of the world’s most powerful microscopes to measure how well a . selection of shampoos cleaned hair. By comparing unwashed and washed hair, he was able to look at how . effective the various products were at removing tiny bits of dirt and . grease. And roughness of the hair provided clues to the amount of chemical residue they left behind. The L’Oreal product left hair the cleanest. Dr Durkan told the Sunday Times: ‘A clean hair under the microscope . looks like a smooth surface, whereas dirty hair is covered with . particles of grease or dust. ‘What surprised me the most was that I couldn’t see any difference . between what the most expensive shampoos do compared with other cheaper . ones.’ Costly: The Philip B Russian Amber Imperial shampoo is £100 for 355ml . L’Oreal’s shampoo also left the fewest residues. In contrast, the tests showed Philip B Russian Amber Imperial Shampoo, . which costs up to £100 for a large tub, to leave behind ‘significant . residues’. Another luxury product, Oribe’s Shampoo for Beautiful Color, also left sizeable deposits. However, hair care companies point that that leaving residues behind isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For instance, they could contain conditioning or anti-dandruff treatments. Oribe said: ‘Cleansing is only one element of a high-performance shampoo. ‘Adding moisture, treating the scalp and aiding colour retention are equally important.’ A spokesman for Philip B said its product deposits amino acids - building blocks of proteins - on the hair. Chris Flower, of the trade body, the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery . Association, said: ‘These days the difference between shampoos is less . about how effective they are at cleaning the hair and more about the . additional benefits, which may be conditioning, protection from heat or . other damage. ‘Measuring the roughness of hair or deposits left after cleaning is just a part of the story.’ The UK market in hair care products is worth almost £1.5billion, with . home hair dyes proving particularly popular in recent years. Shampoo is, however, the most popular product, accounting for almost a quarter of the sales. A spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor International said . recently: ‘In good times as well as in bad times, consumers do not stop . buying and using shampoo, but they keep an eye on promotions such as . “buy one for £3.50 or buy two for £5”. ‘UK consumers are keen on these kinds of offers, and they have proven successful.’ Renewed interest in dry shampoo has also boosted sales.","L'Oréal's Elvive Nutri-Gloss shampoo comes out on top in study .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 19 March 2013 . Labour MP Jim Sheridan questioned why 'parasitical' journalists are allowed to report from Parliament . Labour MP Jim Sheridan today launched an extraordinary attack on the media, demanding to know why the ‘parasitical elements of the Press’ are allowed into Parliament. The remarks came as MPs grilled media campaigners Hacked Off, including Max Mosley who warned that if newspapers refuse to sign up to a new regulator Parliament should intervene. The Commons Culture committee was taking evidence after the three main political parties reached a deal on a Royal Charter to create a powerful new watchdog to regulate the Press. Mr Sheridan, a member of the committee, voiced concerns ‘parasitical elements of press’. He said: 'What concerns me is the parasitical elements within the press who abuse their position in here (Parliament) in terms of hiding behind their pen and calling people names,’ he said in comments apparently aimed at some parliamentary sketch writers. ‘That's the so-called brave people. I don't understand why they are allowed to come into this place and behave in the way that they do.’ He also accused reporters of ‘hiding behind their pens’. It raises the extraordinary prospect of journalists being banned from reporting from within Parliament, which has been allowed since 1771. Instead of attacking the Press, Mr Sheridan was supposed to be holding to account Hacked Off, the campaign group which has pushed for tougher regulation of the Press. Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘laughable’ for Hacked Off to pose as champions of a free press. Mr Davies, one of 14 Conservative MPs who rebelled last night over a Commons amendment enabling the courts to impose exemplary damages on newspapers which do not sign up to the new regulator, said: ‘You are not here to represent a free press. ‘You're here to represent people who on the one hand court publicity for all it's worth if there's a financial return for them but don't like the negative publicity that sometimes goes with it. ‘You're here representing the Hugh Grants of the world. You are not here representing the free press of the world.’ Former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley told MPs claimed the new press regulator plan was a 'win-win' for the industry . Jim Sheridan, Labour MP for Paisley & Renfrewshire North is a former shipyard worker who also worked as a newspaper printer for the Paisley Daily Express before getting into politics through the traditional trade union route with the TGWU. He came under fire during the expenses scandal when it was revealed he used his allowances to reclaim the cost of a 42-inch plasma TV, leather bed and hundreds of pounds worth of furniture. The Daily Telegraph revealed that in 2005/06 financial year, he used his second homes allowance to pay a £991.95 bill for a Memory foam mattress and 'ivory leather bed'. A further £500 spent on furniture and household accessories that year was also claimed on his expenses. Between January and April 2006, he reclaimed £699 for a three-seater sofa, £829 for a two-seater sofa bed, £219 for a coffee table and £199 for a lamp table. Asked about his expense claims, he said his constituency was too far from London to commute. He lives in Erskine, Renfrewshire with his wife Jean. They have a son and daughter. But his comments were rejected by Prof Brian Cathcart from Hacked Off who accused some newspapers of trying to distort the Leveson recommendations in an attempt to undermine them. He said: ‘I think that a great deal of the response to this debate - the whole Leveson inquiry - has been hysterical and some of it has involved an abuse of the power of the press. ‘The distortion in the reporting of the Leveson inquiry as it progressed was pretty shocking. The distortion in the reporting of the report when it appeared was extraordinary.’ Former Formula 1 boss Mr Mosley claimed the new system would ‘change the climate completely, and actually in the interests of the press’. He added: ‘Because when they finally make their minds up, which I’m sure they will, that’s its more economical to be part of the regulator, they will save vast amounts in legal costs themselves. ‘It seems to me win-win. They’ve got themselves into a frame of mind where anything remotely legal is somehow a threat to their freedom, which is simply not the case.’ He warned that if the industry does not sign up to the scheme, Parliament should intervene. Hugh Tomlinson QC, a leading member of the group, said the newspapers had had the chance to make their case to the Leveson inquiry and should now accept its findings. Giving evidence to the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Hacked Off director Brian Cathcart accused some newspapers of an ‘abuse’ of their power in an attempt to protect their own position. Last night some of the biggest . national newspaper publishers warned there were a number of ‘deeply . contentious issues’ surrounding plans agreed by the three main political . parties for a new regulator established by royal charter. However . Mr Tomlinson, who was one of four Hacked Off representatives present at . the late night talks where the deal was hammered out, said newspapers . were not entitled to a fresh chance to influence ministers. The Prime Minister, pictured leaving Number 10 ahead of his statement, hailed the deal which would secure upfront apologies and million-pound fines . Recommendation: Lord Justice Leveson called for a new Press regulator underpinned by statute . He said: ‘We don't think they are entitled to lobby. ‘There was a public inquiry where they were represented by a total of eight or 10 different QCs who argued their case, they have brought their evidence, the judge considered it, the judge came to his conclusion. ‘We think that the press shouldn't have a second bite of the cherry trying to lobby ministers again with arguments that failed in front of the public inquiry. We continue to think that those recommendations ought to be implemented.’","Jim Sheridan accused journalists of 'hiding behind their pens'

Shocked: Uma Rupanya, wife of Richard de Wit who has been accused of murdering British backpacker Sarah Groves in India . The wife of the Dutch tourist accused of murdering a British backpacker in India yesterday told how her children had asked her: ‘Why has daddy killed that woman?’ Thai bride Uma Rupanya said her husband of ten years, Richard de Wit, had become increasingly paranoid and psychotic before abandoning the family six months ago to go travelling. The first she learned of her husband’s alleged crime was when Dutch officers arrived to tell her that de Wit, 43, had confessed to the murder of former public schoolgirl Sarah Groves, 24, on a houseboat. Miss Groves, a fitness instructor from Guernsey, was stabbed 45 times in a frenzied 15-minute knife attack at Lake Dal, near Kashmir’s capital Srinagar. Yesterday Miss Rupanya, who is blind in one eye and suffers from multiple sclerosis, said she does not know what to say to her two daughters, aged 12 and ten. ‘I want to protect them but don’t know how,’ she said. Jobless de Wit, said to be 7ft tall, fled the murder scene in a stolen rowing boat, which capsized before he swam to shore. He was arrested by police, dripping wet, with £2,000 stuffed in his underwear and wearing no shoes, 50 miles away. According to Indian police, he later said he murdered Miss Groves after being taken over by the devil. Yesterday, Miss Rupanya, 31, said she was in a state of shock and felt immense sorrow for Miss Groves’s family. She told the Daily Mail: ‘My husband left us in November. He was seeing a psychiatrist but had become increasingly irrational and paranoid. ‘He believed the Government was out to get him, that spies were following him, that the house was bugged. ‘He had stopped taking his anti-psychotic medication also. 'He said he had to leave for his and our safety. I was very worried about him but never expected something like this to happen. ‘It’s . just so awful. He was a good father to our children, he was never . violent towards me and he did not take drugs, although I have heard that . he started to smoke cannabis after he left us. ‘I feel angry as he left me with a few thousands euros to live on, he knew I couldn’t work or provide for the children myself because of my disability. 'I just have to try to be strong and be a good mother the best I can but it is a very dark time for us. Suspect: The wife of Richard de Wit (left), who is accused of murdering British backpacker Sarah Groves (seen right last November) in India, claims his mental state had deteriorated before he went travelling six months ago . ‘My children are very angry too. They . ask me “why has daddy killed that woman?” I don’t know what to say. I . want to protect them but don’t know how.’ De . Wit, a former councillor for an extreme right-wing party in his home . town of Ridderkerk, met his wife while on holiday in Thailand 13 years . ago when he went into her brother’s clothes shop where she worked as a . sales assistant. They had their two daughters before . marrying in November 2002.  At the time, Miss Rupanya was seriously ill . after giving birth to their second child so the ceremony took place from . her hospital bed in Rotterdam’s Erasmus Hospital. Speaking from the tiny apartment they shared together in the town of Capelle aan den Ijssel, she said: ‘Richard never worked. He stayed at home and played on the computer. 'At the weekend he would take our children to the museum. ‘After he left us, he would phone and email to see how we were. But I felt very let down. ‘The last time I spoke to him was two days before the murder. He seemed OK and said he was enjoying India. I still can’t believe this has happened.’ De Wit, who has two children from a previous relationship, posted a rambling video online shortly before he left for India detailing his delusional fears that the Dutch authorities were after him and were trying to frame him for a fictitious bomb plot. He remains in custody in India.","Sarah Groves, 24, was stabbed 40 times in Kashmir on Saturday morning .

"By . Julie Moult and Rebecca English . UPDATED: . 03:49 EST, 8 October 2011 . Prince Harry arrived in the U.S. last night on a two-month elite helicopter training programme, paving the way for a second tour of duty in Afghanistan. The third in line to the throne will split his time between Naval Air Facility El Centro, close to the Mexican border in California, and Gila Bend in rural Arizona where he will be taught advanced techniques of flying the Apache attack choppers he once described as 'awesome'. Exercise Crimson Eagle will take place in locations that replicate the brutal terrain of Afghanistan - over soaring mountains and vast desert with temperatures that reach well in excess of 110 degrees. Arrival: Prince Harry lands at U.S. airbase at El Centro, he will be . training for two months - and be treated like any of the . other students . The rigorous training is reserved for the British Army's Air Corp's top flying talent and will see 20 men complete the final stage of the ‘Conversion to Role’ course which focuses on honing aviation environmental skills and live firing and includes techniques such as ground skimming and night flying. Lt Col Peter Bullen, the exercise director, said: 'He (Harry)is treated exactly the same as any other. He would not want to be treated any differently.' El Centro's commanding officer, Captain Devon Jones, added: 'We will treat him as we do all our visiting personnel. We are going to do operations as normal. 'We welcome all our UK counterparts, he is part of the British contingent. The base facilities are open to him as any other.' Challenging conditions: El Centro regularly welcomes foreign students, as the dusty environment are similar to those in Afghanistan . Apache training: The course is the final part of a 16-month study period - the next stop could be Afghanistan for the pilots . Playboy playmate Laura Croft has said that she will be happy to show Harry the sights at Las Vegas . Assuming, as expected, he passes the course, Captain Wales - as he is known in his professional life - will be one of a select number of pilots to have expertise in the £46 million, two-person, helicopters of which Britain has a fleet of 67. He will be categorised as Limited Combat Ready and will have at least four months of further training before he is available to return to the field as an Apache pilot. It has long been known the prince is keen to return to combat after his first deployment in 2007 was cut short after ten weeks, much to his disappointment, because of security fears. If he is deployed next year his main tasks will be to provide air cover for ground troops and to seek and destroy Taliban positions. The Apaches are vital tools in the fight against the Taliban specifically designed to destroy tanks and can operate in all weathers, day or night. They can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in a matter of seconds. The aircraft carry a mix of weapons including rockets, Hellfire missiles and a 30mm chain gun. Exercise Crimson Eagle is the culmination of 16 months hard work by Harry and his fellow servicemen who graduated from the Army Air Corps Wattisham base in Suffolk in the spring. A spokesman for the MoD warned there would be little free time for Harry, 27. 'It is an intensive training exercise with limited downtime,' said the spokesman. 'Whatever spare time Captain Wales will be afforded with his fellow colleagues, he will spend privately. 'He is travelling to the United States in a military capacity and will not be undertaking any Royal or public engagements.' Harry will have some down time to visit the bright lights of Las Vegas . But his two months in the states won't be all hard work and he will have some time off to explore his new surroundings. Lt Col Bullen said: 'We are not placing specific restriction on downtime. Their down time is spent at their discretion.' Ministers have been told that 200 Al Qaeda extremists with expertise in aviation terrorism are planning a ‘spectacular’ atrocity. Members of the worldwide terror network are plotting in a ‘safe space’ in Yemen – and Britain is a top target, according to MI6. David Cameron and his National Security Council have been warned by intelligence chiefs that Al Qaeda is still capable of launching a major strike against British, American or European airliners ten years after the 9/11 atrocities. A senior ministerial source told the Mail: ‘We know they are looking around the whole of Europe trying to find a weak link. When they spot an opening we expect them to go for it again.’ The Prince may struggle to find a great deal nearby to keep him entertained, however. The nearby town of El Centro has a population of 40,000, it is dominated by agriculture and fast food joints. Twenty minutes drive away is the Mexican border but the soldiers are banned from crossing the border because of the security fears. Should he want to venture further afield, the vibrant city of San Diego is within two hours drive, as is the desert resort of Palm Springs. He will fair even worse when he transfers to Gila Bend, half way through his three month stay, which has been described as a 'one horse town'. There is just one bar in the Best Western hotel which bizarrely is modelled on a space ship. The one bright light on the horizon for Harry's social life is that he is free to visit Las Vegas - a traditional spot for a bit of rest and relaxation a month into the course. Asked by the Mail if the Prince and his fellow trainees would be allowed to visit the wild party town, Lt Col Bullen said: 'Absolutely, if they want to fund it themselves and that's what floats their boat, then absolutely they can go.' Asked specifically about Harry, he added: 'If he wants to, then yes, if that is what interests him.' And already the Harry Hunters of America are getting excited about the prospect of having a Prince in Sin City. US reality TV star and former Playboy playmate Laura Croft wants to be his guide. She asked: 'He’s been labelled a party animal so who better than me to show him the world’s party capital?'.","Two-month course is final phase of 16-month training programme for British Army pilots before deployment .

American protestors will join in protests in Pakistan against drone attacks to ‘apologise on behalf of those with a conscience’. Campaigners from the anti-war group Code Pink, are visiting Pakistan to make contact with people affected by the drone strikes and draw the attention of the American public to the impact of attacks. Organised in conjunction with a British advocacy group, the rally is to take place today in one of the Pakistani capital's busiest market places. The protesters will recite anti-drone chants, wear bright pink clothes and carry banners. Scroll down for video . Pink protest: American anti-war group Code Pink (pictured is a campaigner on a previous protest) will hold a demonstration in Pakistan against U.S. drone attacks . Medea Benjamin, one of the group’s founders said yesterday: ‘We are here to say, on behalf of those Americans with a conscience, that we apologize to the people of Pakistan for the killing and suffering (caused by the drones).’ The drone strike program in Pakistan has a controversial history, with conflicting reports on its impact from the U.S. government, Pakistani officials and independent organisations. American officials insist that the choice and execution of the strikes, which begun under former President George W. Bush and ramped up under President Barack Obama, meet strict standards and that civilian deaths or injuries are extremely rare. Drone attacks are said to have killed . far more people than the United States acknowledges, traumatised . innocent residents and been largely ineffective according to a study . released last month by Stanford Law School and New York University's . School of Law. Civilians account for a significant portion of those . killed, the study said. Highlight attacks: Code Pink want to draw attention to the impact where drone attacks occur (pictured is the site of a 2008 attack) which are given conflicting reports on their impact by American, Pakistani and independent organisations . 'Apologise': American protesters will join demonstrations in Pakistan against U.S. drone attacks to 'apologise to the people of Pakistan for the killing and suffering' (pictured is a U.S. unmanned predator drone) The drone program is deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where the national parliament voted in April to end any authorisation for it. Code Pink's demonstration on Friday is the precursor to a bigger, more ambitious protest over drone strikes in which the group plans to participate over the weekend. Pakistani politician Imran Khan insisted the march to the country’s restive tribal areas, where Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants have strongholds, will happen as planned despite security fears and doubts over whether authorities would allow it. Western journalists and anti-drone . campaigners will join political party Pakistan Tekreek-e-Insaaf or . Pakistan Movement for Justice (PIT), headed by Mr Khan, in a convoy from . Islamabad to South Waziristan at the weekend to protest against U.S. drone strikes. The march, . which includes the British head of charity Reprieve Clive Stafford Smith . and 30 American anti-drone campaigners, plan to visited areas where . access is strictly controlled by Pakistan and independent access for . foreigners is banned. March will go on: Cricket legend turned politician Imran Khan insists the peach march against the use of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan will go on despite conflicting reports of whether protesters will have access to restricted areas they plan to visit . There have been conflicting reports this week about whether protesters have permission to enter South Waziristan and if so, by whom but cricketing legend turned politician, Mr Khan, insists it will go on. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban told AFP that the umbrella militia, which is fighting an insurgency against the government and whose members are killed by U.S. missiles, had not yet formulated its position on the march but Mr Khan said the Taliban had given their agreement through intermediaries in the tribal areas. He said: ‘The tribes have got in touch with the militants and the tribes have told us that it's fine, they have no objections to it . ‘I still don't understand, why is the government going to stop us when they know neither the militants are objecting to this, neither the tribal areas are objecting to this and certainly the army's not objecting to this?’ According to The Daily Times, Mr Khan said: ‘Of drones I think two words – it’s immoral and it’s insane. Anti-war: Code Pink, an all-women organisation, have become known for their anti-war demonstrations in Washington (protester pictured in 2006 march) ‘Immoral because you cannot justify eliminating suspects and insane because it’s counterproductive. ‘All it does is it turns more people against the US, hatred grows and the beneficiaries of this insanity are the militants.’ Mr Khan said the protesters, which plan . to march to the village of Kotkai and rally there, will not be stopped . if authorities intervene. They will just hold the rally wherever they . are stopped. Code Pink activists say that if the . march is stopped, they will invite people from the area affected by the . drone strikes to join them in a large gathering in Islamabad. They say they are also considering the possibility of a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in the capital. The women-led organisation became known for anti-war demonstrations in Washington during the U.S. build up in Iraq. The group has held protests over a range of different international issues. They have regularly disrupted high-profile congressional hearings relating to war and national defence issues, as well as interrupting speeches by foreign officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Among the activists with the Code Pink delegation in Pakistan at the moment is Ann Wright, a former U.S. Army colonel and State Department official who quit her post to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In an appearance this week on the Pakistani television station Geo TV, Wright said that U.S. drone strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and are fuelling anti-American sentiment in the region. When the Pakistani television host asked Wright to respond to accusations that she was a radical activist, she said: ‘I'm a radical peace activist.’ VIDEO: Pakistan's Imran Khan leads anti-drone protest .","American anti-war group Code Pink will protest in Pakistan today .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 21:00 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:16 EST, 31 January 2013 . Patients are having to wait five and a half hours in ambulances parked outside A&E because there are not enough beds. Some relatives are arriving at hospital to visit their loved ones only to find they are still ‘queued up’ outside the main entrance. Last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted. Waiting time: Last week some 4,500 patients waited in ambulances for at least half an hour before they were admitted, according to figures obtained by Labour . Since the beginning of November there have been more than 68,000 such cases, a rise of a third compared to the same period last year. Figures obtained by Labour show that one patient brought in by Great Western Ambulance Trust in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes. Another taken to hospital by West Midlands Ambulance Trust waited five hours and five minutes. Warning: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: 'These chaotic scenes in A&E take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s' But there is concern that keeping ambulances outside hospitals for so long puts other patients waiting for help at risk. One unnamed paramedic, who works in Hertfordshire said: ‘Someone will die this winter as a result of no ambulance being available at the time of the emergency. It is not a matter of if, but when.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘These chaotic scenes in A&E take us straight back to the bad old days of the mid-1990s. ‘Up and down the country, ambulances are unable to dispatch patients, hospitals are full to bursting and people are waiting on trolleys in corridors. ‘The Government must take urgent action to ensure all A&Es have enough staff to provide safe standards of patient care and meet national standards.’ Another unnamed paramedic, who works in North East England said: ‘Families of sick people arrive at hospitals and expect to find them in a bed, but they are still outside in an ambulance. The frustration of ambulance staff is beyond belief’ Many emergency departments have become increasingly overstretched over the last few years and at times they are just too busy to admit new patients. But there is also concern that staff are deliberately making patients wait outside so they can meet targets and avoid fines. The rules state that hospitals ensure that at least 95 per cent of patients spend no more than four hours in A&E before they are discharged or taken to other wards. Yet the clock only starts once patients are admitted, so managers will be inclined to leave them outside when they are very busy. Delay: One patient brought in by Great Western Ambulance Trust in the last two months was made to wait 5 hours and 42 minutes . Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The public will be deeply concerned by these figures, and deserve to expect the quickest access to A&E possible. ‘Long periods of waiting in an ambulance clearly adds to the stress and discomfort patients are already experiencing. ‘The Government needs to act to address the severe service pressures that lead to these unacceptable bottlenecks.’ NHS figures show that the number of emergency admissions has risen by 8 per cent in a year to 17.6 million. This rise has partly been blamed on the failure of GP out-of-hours services as well as the increasing elderly population. Meanwhile officials are considering renaming A&E units either ‘999’ or ‘111’ departments. A report from NHS Commissioning Board recommends that all emergency departments are classified into treating either emergency cases or just urgent. Those responsible for emergency care would be known as 999 units, while those looking after urgent cases would be 111 centres. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients in A&E compared to two years ago and despite the additional pressure overall it is coping well.’","Nearly 4,500 patients forced to wait for at least half an hour last week .

'The school could have gone about this differently and got the boys up in assembly and congratulated them in front of the school, but instead they told younger pupils that skinhead hair is not an acceptable part of the uniform.' In a letter sent to the school, Billy’s father, Gary, 45, expressed disappointment at the decision and asked what values the school were teaching. He said: 'It’s a strange one really.

The helmsman was knocked off his feet . by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel, leaving it 'buckled' and impossible to steer. He . suffered a suspected broken jaw, putting him out of . action and forcing him to join the ill crew below deck. WATCH THE RESCUE BELOW . Rescue operation: A lifeboat comes to the aid of a novice yacht crew who got into difficulties after their captain allegedly ignored their concerns and continued sailing into a Force 10 storm off the Kent coast . Some were left with hypothermia as the vessel, called Liquid Vortex, became stricken in winds of up 55mph off the coast of Dungeness, Kent, the trial was told. It led to the yacht making a May Day call to the coastguard, indicating an 'imminent emergency'. Despite the chaos, the skipper believed he had everything 'under control', it was alleged. Eventually, they were plucked to safety by coastguard helicopter and two RNLI lifeboats. But attempts to tow the Beneteau First 40.7 yacht to port were hampered when the rope snapped twice and later ripped off its anchor point, the court heard. VIDEO: Rookie yacht crew rescued in rough seas after sailing into Force 10 storm . 'Skipper ignored warnings': Five of the crew were so seasick after being tossed around in 20ft waves they were unable to man the £105,000 pounds race cruiser, called Liquid Vortex, a court heard . A lifeboat man who risked his life leaping onto the stricken vessel to help with the rescue was later commended for his bravery. The cruiser was skippered by Charles . Sturrock, 51, and owned by Hot Liquid Sailing, under the sole . directorship of Jason Manning, 36. Sturrock, from Little Wenlock, . Shropshire, denies four charges of failing to discharge his duties . properly as a ship's master, contrary to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. It is alleged the 'manner of his acts or omissions caused or were likely to cause loss, destruction, death or injury'. Manning, from Eastleigh, Hants, denies three charges of failing to discharge a duty, contrary to the same act. Liquid Vortex was heading downwind from Southampton, Hants, to Ramsgate, Kent, when the fiasco started. It left the marina two hours late at 2.30pm on January 2 this year, heading east along the south coast on an overnight trip. 'Lives put in danger': The trial heard that the helmsman was knocked off his feet by a massive wave and bashed his head on the wheel, leaving it 'buckled' and impossible to steer . This was despite the weather forecast that morning warning: 'Storm force ten (winds) expected later'. Force . ten winds hit 63mph and whipped up foam-capped waves of 41ft, with an . over-hanging crest. On land, such gusts would be strong enough to uproot . trees. Furthermore, the vessel was not . equipped with an illuminated compass for nighttime sailing and had no . way of measuring its speed, the court heard. It carried 'storm sails' intended for use in strong winds but the crew failed to use them. Sturrock was joined on board by his daughter and five adult novices who had paid £225 each for the trip, which was due to last four days and take them to the London Boat Show. In fact they were rescued just 15 hours after setting sail. Many of the crew had little more than the most basic sailing qualifications and were trained to sail in 'familiar waters' during the day. When some of the crew expressed their concerns about sailing at night in bad weather, they were ignored, the court heard. Prosecutor Mary Gibbons, representing the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said Sturrock and Manning were responsible for a number of safety breaches. She said: 'The morning the crew assembled, a shipping forecast was issued at 10.30am which said 'southwest, storm Force 10 expected later'. 'That information was available to them before the voyage began and indicated the weather that was expected after 7pm that evening. 'Both Sturrock and Manning would have known there were gale force ten warnings in the period the vessel was going to be at sea had it gone all the way to Ramsgate. 'They should have taken the decision at that point not to embark on the journey.' The court heard that two hours into the journey another forecast repeated the storm warnings, which were also ignored. Accused: Skipper Charles Sturrock (left) denies four charges of failing to discharge his duties properly as a ship's master, contrary to the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, while the sailing school's director Jason Manning (right) has pleaded not guilty to three counts of failing to discharge a duty, contrary to the same act . Miss Gibbons said: 'At this time, they were still in the Solent, coming out. 'It . was not quite dark and there were many choices available to the . skipper. He could have turned back or headed to a port of refuge, which . he did not do. 'It would . have been an uncomfortable return to Southampton but they would have had . the shelter of the Isle of Wight. After a three hour straight sail they . could have been safely back at home. 'By . not exercising his judgement, Sturrock put the vessel, those on board . and third parties - including the rescue teams - at risk of loss, . destruction or personal injury. And that is what happened. 'He ignored the weather and ports of refuge until he was left with no option but to plough on.' Miss Gibbons said the crew had . expressed their own concerns about the weather and the journey prior to . setting sail but they were ignored. She said: 'The crew stated at a briefing before they set sail that they had limited experience. Prosecutor Mary Gibbons . 'They were told the voyage would be sailing straight through the night unless there was a reason to go into port. 'The crew was surprised at this and expressed their views. 'Furthermore, one inquired about the incoming bad weather and did suggest ports of refuge along the way. These suggestions were not taken up by Sturrock because he was keen to press on.' The court was played a recording of the vessel's Pan Pan call in which the coastguard was told five of the crew had gone down with sea sickness. A May Day call about an hour later, at 6.21am, told the coastguard the helmsman had possibly broken his jaw after falling on the wheel. Their calls prompted a rescue operation, in which the helmsman and several crew were winched to safety and taken to hospital. Miss Gibbons said: 'The coastguard took the decision to launch the RNLI. However, Sturrock did not feel that a lifeboat was necessary. 'Despite the diminished number of functioning crew, he felt everything was under control.' Liquid Vortex was towed to Ramsgate harbour. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sailing school sent crew out on night trip 'despite dire weather warnings'

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured in his Witney constituency, insisted the Philpott case raised questions about the welfare state . The case of child killer Mick Philpott does raise ‘wider questions’ about Britain’s benefits system, David Cameron insisted last night. The Prime Minister defied vitriolic attacks from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to back Chancellor George Osborne in arguing that the Philpott case highlights the need for reform of the welfare system. In a direct reference to the case, Mr Cameron said welfare handouts should not be seen as a ‘lifestyle choice’. He added: ‘I think what George Osborne said was absolutely right. ‘He said Philpott was the one to blame for his crimes, that he should be held responsible. 'But what the Chancellor went on to say was that we should ask some wider questions about our welfare system, how much it costs and the signals that it sends. ‘And we do want to make clear that welfare is there to help people who work hard, it shouldn’t be there as a sort of lifestyle choice, and that’s entirely legitimate.’ Mr Cameron’s intervention in the row underlines Tory determination not to back down in the growing national debate sparked by public outrage over the Philpott case. Philpott, a father of 17, was jailed for life on Thursday for the manslaughter of six of his children after setting fire to the family home in Derby. His wife Mairead and accomplice Paul Mosley were each jailed for 17 years. Scroll down for video . 'Why are we funding lifestyles like that?' Chancellor George Osborne has linked the case of jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott (right), who was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire, to the need for reform of the benefits system . Scrounger: Mick Philpott (pictured with his wife Mairead, centre, his mother Peggy, right, and sons Jesse, right in green, and John, far right) claimed thousands of pounds in benefit and refused to get a job . The jury at Nottingham Crown Court . had heard that one of the motivations for Philpott’s crimes was his . desire to get his hands on the benefits money which vanished when his . live-in lover left with their five children. Did the benefits system contribute to the Philpott fire killings? Philpott, who had not worked for . almost a decade, is said to have enjoyed an income equivalent to that of . a £100,000 salary as a result of the benefits and earnings of his wife . and his lover. Mr Osborne faced a ferocious attack . from Labour and many Lib Dems after saying the Philpott case raised . questions about whether the taxpayer should be ‘subsidising lifestyles . like that’. Lib Dem president Tim Farron described Mr Osborne’s comments as ‘incendiary and incredibly stigmatising’. Former Lib Dem children’s minister . Sarah Teather said: ‘I am shocked and appalled that George Osborne has . stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic . deaths of six young children.’ Shameless: Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe, who filmed a documentary about Philpott's lifestyle, said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way . Hated by the nation: Mick Philpott's infamous appearance on the Jeremy Kyle Show in 2009 when he was roundly criticised for demanding a bigger council house for his expanding brood . Front-page news: Yesterday's Daily Mail on Philpott's conviction . Senior Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott . even suggested Mr Osborne should consider resigning. ‘If George Osborne . can’t see how wrong it is to play politics with six children’s deaths . he’s not fit to be Chancellor,’ he said. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘We . should have a proper debate about welfare reform. But for the Chancellor . to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive . and demeans his office.’ Even Mr Osborne’s Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander refused to back him yesterday, saying politicians should ‘let that case lie’. But senior Tories believe there is . widespread support for further reform of the welfare state – and . revulsion at those seen as milking it. Downing Street sources said Mr . Cameron believed further radical reforms of the welfare system were . needed, although these are unlikely before the election because of Lib . Dem opposition. Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was completely legitimate to debate the wider issues raised by the Philpott case. On the attack: Labour's Dame Anne Begg and Shadow work and pensions minister Stephen Timms have accused Osborne of acting 'cynically' He said: ‘Nothing can excuse the individual moral and criminal responsibility for this crime. ‘But we would be abdicating our . responsibility as a society if we did not look at whether there is some . link with the climate of dependency that our bloated welfare system has . helped to create.’ Some Labour figures also warned there was a danger that Labour would end up on the wrong side of public opinion. Philip Collins, a former speech . writer to Tony Blair, said: ‘The grotesque Mick Philpott became the . stooge embodiment of all that is said to be wrong with a culture in . which the idle take the rise out of the working population. ‘We may look back on this as the week . in which the Coalition began to speak again to the British public while . the forgetful Labour party slunk back on to the sofa.’ Former Labour general secretary Peter . Watt said Labour was in danger of becoming the ‘party of the poor’ that . ‘does not really care about the middle classes’. The reaction from the opposition front bench was condemned by Labour activist and blogger Dan Hodges, who said Mr Balls had ‘plunged’ into a trap set by the Tories. ‘Labour’s strategy on Philpott and welfare is suicidal,’ he said. ‘The Tories want lots of stories tomorrow that have the phrases “Mick Philpott”, “Welfare”, and “Labour defends welfare”. They’re going to get them. ‘You don’t need to be a master strategist to make a monkey of the Labour Party on the issue of welfare. Labour should back a welfare freeze, in the same way it backs a freeze in public sector wages.’ Mr Hodges added that on Philpott Labour should say: ‘We’re not  commenting. This is a terrible tragedy, our thoughts are with the victims.’","Prime Minister says Philpott was to blame for his crimes but welfare cannot be a 'lifestyle choice'

Bills for long-term care in old age are to be capped at £75,000 in England, in a £1billion move to be funded by dragging more people into the inheritance tax net, it was announced today. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the 'historic' reforms would save thousands of people from having to sell their family home to pay for care and give them  'greater peace of mind'. 'We need to become a society where people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pension,' he said, adding that all governments have 'long failed to tackle' the issue. Scroll down for video . Announcement: Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt makes a statement to MPs in the House of Commons in central London where he said that that elderly care bills are to be capped at £75,000 . 'Whilst there are many other things . that need to be done to prepare for an ageing population, these reforms . do herald a historic change in the way that care and support is funded . in this country.' The inheritance tax threshold will be . frozen until at least 2019 to help fund the £75,000 cap on care home . bills for the elderly. It means that thousands more middle-class . families every year will be dragged into paying the 40 per cent tax. Sources . close to Chancellor George Osborne confirmed that some of the funding . for radical reform of social care will come from an unexpected freeze in . the amount people can inherit free of tax. Stealth tax? Sources close to George Osborne say the inheritance tax threshold is to be frozen to fund a £75,000 cap on care home bills . The move risks angering Conservative MPs . who remember Mr Osborne pledging in 2007, before the financial crisis, . to increase the threshold to £1million. Instead it has been fixed at £325,000 since the election and will remain at that level until at least April 2019. The Coalition will announce today that the state will fund all social care for any individual once the £75,000 cap has been reached. The state will also begin to help with costs if a person’s savings and assets fall below a threshold of £123,000, rather than £23,250 at present. But the National Pensioners Convention argues that the £75,000 cap is too high and warns that elderly people will continue to lose their homes as they grapple to meet mounting care costs. The reforms are expected to cost £1billion a year, 80 per cent of which will come from increased employer national insurance contributions – mainly in the public sector – as a flat-rate state pension replaces the state second pension. But the remaining 20 per cent will come from the inheritance ‘stealth tax’. If the threshold for the tax, frozen since 2009, increased in line with inflation every year until 2019 it would be expected to reach £420,000. But instead it will be fixed at £325,000 – although just two months ago the Chancellor suggested he would increase the allowance in two years. As a result, 5,000 more families a year . are expected to be pulled into the inheritance tax trap, and will pay an . average of £95,000 more than they would have done if the allowance had . been increased. George Osborne's pledge in 2007 . A Government source said: ‘The result of the social care reforms will be that 100,000 people who would have had to pay will be helped. The inheritance tax allowance has been frozen since 2009, but it’s also been made transferable so a couple now has a threshold of £650,000. ‘Yes, it will bring 5,000 more people into inheritance tax but it will help more than 100,000 who currently suffer for daring to do the right thing and saving for retirement. ‘Those who have worked and saved all . their life and bought a property won’t have it taken away just because . they did the right thing. That’s only fair. ‘We are going to protect their inheritance.’ Hit with taxes: Ros Altmann (right), a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said well-off pensioners with expensive houses would be hit by the inheritance tax changes while Peter Bone (left) said it looks as if the Government is 'giving with one hand, and taking away with the other' However, Conservative MPs expressed alarm. Right-winger Peter Bone said: ‘It starts to look as if we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.’ The Coalition is setting the £75,000 cap despite the Dilnot Commission, established by Government to review care funding in England, recommending a lower benchmark. The commission proposed a cap of between £20,000 and £50,000 and said £35,000 would be 'the most appropriate and fair' figure. But chairman Andrew Dilnot said the difference between the recommendation and the Government's figure is not large enough to create problems. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'We said it should be between £20,000 and £50,000 in 2010-11 prices. 'The cap being proposed is £75,000 in 2017 prices, that’s the equivalent of £61,000 in our terms, £11,000 higher than the top end of our range. 'But I recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it doesn’t seem to me that it is so different as to radically transform the basis of the system.' But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention (NPC), said: ‘People are still going to lose their homes to pay for this, £75,000 is a hugely high cap. 'In actual fact, Dilnot said 35 or 50. But in any case, we didn’t think Dilnot was the right answer either because it doesn’t deal with the actual care system.' Ms Gibson called for a 1.5p in the pound income tax to pay for a national care system 'free at the point of delivery'. Neil Duncan-Jordan, also from the NPC, said he could see little difference between the freezing of the inheritance tax threshold and Labour’s plan before the election for a ‘death tax’ to pay for care. Ros Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said relatively  well-off pensioners with expensive houses – particularly in the South-East – would be hit by the inheritance tax changes. ‘Many people who end up not needing any expensive care in their old age will end up paying lots of inheritance tax to those who do,’ she added.","It means thousands of middle-class families will have to pay 40 per cent tax .

Apparently leaked images show what seems to be the Galaxy S IV smartphone, Samsung's next-generation flagship mobile which is set for launch this week. The pictures, if legitimate, confirm several of the widespread rumours about the forthcoming phones specifications, particularly the upgrade to a massive 5in screen. The handset, dubbed 'GT-I9502', is apparently customised for Chinese carrier Unicom. It is said to have a 'Universal5410' 1.8GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX 544MP graphics processor. Is this the next Samsung Galaxy? These pictures, . which appeared earlier today on Chinese mobile forum 52 Samsung, appear . to show a version of the forthcoming handset . customised for the Chinese market . You might need bigger pockets: The pictures appear to back up rumours that the S IV will have a 5in screen - with the device dwarfing the hand of the man who has taken the photographs . The images were uploaded to Chinese forum 52 Samsung just hours ago and were quickly picked up and republished by respected tech site The Verge. A reporter for the site says the Universal5410 is probably a codename for the Exynos Octa 5410, an eight core processor which has been widely speculated to be at the heart of the new Galaxy. Aside from the screen-size upgrade, the pictures show a mobile that is broadly similar to the last-generation Galaxy, complete with oblong home button.

Smartphone arms race: It is believed the new handset could have a 1920x1080 display and boast a 13MP camera as Samsung tries to leap ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars . 'The phone will track a user’s eyes to determine where to scroll', a Samsung employee told the New York Times. In January Samsung filed for a trademark in Europe for the name 'Eye Scroll', which is believed to refer to the new feature. It also filed for the 'Samsung Eye Scroll' trademark in the United States in February, describing the service as 'Computer application software having a feature of sensing eye movements and scrolling displays of mobile devices, namely, mobile phones, smartphones and tablet computers according to eye movements; digital cameras; mobile telephones; smartphones; tablet computers.'

The police are 'frantically ringing around' victims of abuse at the hands of Jimmy Savile in a bid to reassure them their identities will not be revealed by Operation Yewtree detective now going on Big Brother, a source has said. Detectives from Operation Yewtree were today contacting anyone who were interviewed by ex-detective constable Dan Neal, who entered the show last night. The former policeman tried to avoid discussing his law enforcement career during his first night in the house, describing himself as 'unemployed' and telling host Emma Willis he was looking for a 'change' in his life'. 'I'd done ten and a half years in the police and I've worked really hard and achieved a lot,' he said. 'I just need a change. I wanted to explore the creative side of my personality.' Grand entrance: The former officer entering the Big Brother house on Friday night . Yesterday lawyer Liz Dux, head of the . abuse department of Slater&Gordon which represents 62 alleged . victims of Britain's most prolific paedophile, said: 'This is extremely . traumatic for some of the victims. Fame game: Former Detective Constable Dan Neal, 33, pictured, has caused controversy after quitting the Yewtree Operation to pursue celebrity in reality show Big Brother . 'They have poured their hearts out to this detective - some of them disclosing details which they haven't yet told their family. 'Now they fear that him appearing on Big Brother will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed. 'It's . not just the fear of what might come out on nation television, it's . also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates . when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment. 'We . know the format of this show involves giving contestants copious . amounts of alcohol, we just don't know what information he might divulge . during the programme.' She added: 'Channel 5 have been incredibly irresponsible adding this former detective to the Big Brother house. 'They . must have known it was likely to cause distress for victims. But I can . only imagine they thought his appearance would be good for the show's . publicity. 'Why else would he have been selected for the show if not to talk about all the salacious details of the Savile investigation? 'When the victims gave their . statements to police, they hoped for closure to an extremely distressing . period of their lives. Seeing Mr Neal on Big Brother has reopened this . wound. We hoped Operation Yewtree would give victims the confidence to . come forward, but this publicity stunt risks undermining that work.' Bosses at Scotland Yard are said to be . at furious former detective constable's decision to seek celebrity status on the back of . Britain's biggest sexual abuse investigation. Concerns: A Scotland Yard child abuse detective who worked on Operation Yewtree will enter the Big Brother House, probably on Friday . They have raised concerns his appearance on the show could compromise Operation Yewtree. And to highlight the level of concern . felt among top brass at Scotland Yard, detectives are currently calling . every alleged victim who has had contact with Mr Neal to offer . reassurance. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Victims remain our priority. 'We are endeavouring to make contact with individuals who may have had face to face contact with the officer.' Channel 5 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme. A spokesman said: 'Channel 5 takes . its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and, as has been made clear . to New Scotland Yard, extensive procedures are in place to ensure that . nothing will be broadcast during the course of Big Brother which would . involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality, invading . the privacy of others, committing libel or a contempt of Court.' Revealed: The officer will be inside the new Big Brother house (pictured), which has been unveiled as producers gear up for this summer's new series . Until recently, the gay father-of-one, 33, had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex . attacks, either with the help of paedophile Savile or working alone. But he is expected to be one of the show's most controversial contestants when he enters the house tonight. 'I think there will be some concern within the force', he told the Daily Express. Mr Neal, from . Ongar, Essex, said that he did not want to jeopardise a case he had . worked on during the past eight months, adding: 'I can't talk about the . content of the investigation but there may be a few concerned faces . within my old department.' Paedophile: Operation Yewtree was launched after Jimmy Savile's decades of sexual abuse were uncovered, which the officer reportedly told BB producers was 'upsetting' and 'draining' A Met Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports concerning the proposed media appearance of a former detective constable. 'We've . been in contact with Channel 5 and made them fully aware of potential . risks and their responsibility to live investigations. 'All officers joining and leaving the Met are required to sign the Official Secrets Act.' It is unclear if the former detective applied to be a contestant on the . reality TV show while working for the Metropolitan Police. But it is understood Mr Neal quit his job last month and auditions for the reality show opened in January. Arrested stars include Jim Davidson, Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis, . Freddie Starr, and Gary Glitter. They all deny the allegations. Big Brother 2013 launches tonight on Channel 5 with a 'secrets and lies' theme, which includes a prison inside the house. His decision to become a reality star will shock Scotland Yard and producers . have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on Yewtree and . its 400 lines of inquiry was 'upsetting' and 'draining'. A show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work . but understands 'it is only natural' that other contestants will try to get 'as much . gossip as possible' about the investigation. Mr Neal also spoke about the hours he . spent sifting through evidence linked to Savile's decades of sexual abuse. He also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased . they had been able to make a difference to victims. 'The housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this. Leaving . the police force to go into the Big Brother house is a massive move,' a show . insider told the Daily Star. 'Their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join . the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the . house. 'This person has seen a lot of bad things while working on Operation . Yewtree. They will know what can and can’t be said inside the house but it’s . only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as . possible.' Channel 5 sought to allay fears something broadcast on Big Brother could compromise the on-going investigation. A . spokesman said: 'Extensive procedures are in place to ensure nothing . will be broadcast with which would involve the former police officer . breaching confidentiality, committing libel or a contempt of court.' New pictures released this week revealed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the . duration of this year's show. Ready for action: The theme this year is Secret & Lies and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison . Not long now: This year will see Emma Willis take over the main hosting duties to replace Brian Dowling, but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the Met . Not only have producers added an . outdoor shower, no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action, . but they've also included a snug treehouse in the garden. Its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building. Other . features include an outside shower, a 'prison' for any bad behaving . contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom.

Neither James Adair nor Ben Stenning had rowed a boat before they drunkenly agreed to row the Indian Ocean. And these amazing pictures show just how committed the two 32-year-olds were to living up to Ernest Hemingway's famous words: 'Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk.' After spending their £15,000 life savings on an ocean rowing boat and undertaking just three months of training on the river Thames, the pair not only succeeded in crossing the Indian Ocean, but also in becoming the first ever pair in history to row it without a support boat. Their heroics and pictures have now been revealed for the first time in the book Rowing after the White Whale, written by James Adair. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fresh-faced: Ben Stenning (left) and James Adair (right) at their graduation ball at St Andrews in 2004, where they first discussed rowing an ocean, only for their friends to dismiss the idea as a pipe dream . Eight years on: James (left) and Ben (right) after succeeding in crossing the Indian Ocean after 116 days at sea. This was taken the night they were dramatically rescued one mile out from the Mauritian coast after a freak wave capsized their boat and dumped them in the sea for five hours as their family waited anxiously onshore . What a team: The pair rowing together about two weeks into the trip judging by the length of their beards . Ocean sunset: Ben with his back to the setting sun as he smiles for the camera after a hard day's rowing . Rough seas: Ben with his trusty headband on, working up a sweat on the high seas . The pair lost about three stone and survived on a diet of freeze-dried food, rationed cigarettes, whisky and a sense of humour. Their fresh water-making machine broke which meant they also had to use a hand pump for two hours a day on top of the 12-hour shifts they each put in on the oars . Strong arms: James at the hand-pump. It took an hour to make a litre of fresh water. And a minute to drink . He said: 'Rowing After the White Whale is an account of our unsupported . row across the Indian Ocean, a journey which fewer people have completed . than have walked on the moon. We yearned for a big adventure and we . certainly got what we asked for. 'It's a story of moonbows and meteor showers, passing whales and thieving fish, lurking sharks and giant squid; it is part adventure narrative, part blue water history, part meditation on nature and part memoir.' Despite warnings that emergency rescue teams could take up to two days to reach them, and against their better judgement, they set off from Perth, Australia in Spring last year. For the following 116 days their home was a one ton, 26ft, self-righting ocean rowing boat, packed with 300 . kilos of dry foods (mainly curry), navigation equipment, a desalinator, some whisky and cigarettes (rationed to one each a day), and their self-imposed limit of three books each. While one slept in a seven foot by four foot water-tight cabin the other rowed for two hours. What makes the feat even more impressive is that James, at 14, contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, a debilitating illness which affects the peripheral nervous system and left him in a coma for a month, totally paralysed but conscious. Route: The pair managed to cross the Indian Ocean in 116 days despite having no experience prior to their trip . This was taken minutes after they were rescued from the sea. A helicopter had tried and failed to locate them. Fortunately for James and Ben, two locals headed out on their boat to help the search party and spotted them after finding a floating oar from their wrecked boat. Their family waiting onshore had started to fear the worst . His recovery took over a year and left . him with paralysed feet. Ben stood on a stonefish while growing up in . Africa and underwent two years of operations as tropical disease doctors . battled to save his leg. The newly-released book 'Rowing after the White Whale', written by rower James Adair . As the book explains, the adventure . was something the pair discussed as St Andrews University, with their . friends dismissing it as nothing but a pipe dream. After graduating in History (James) and English (Ben) the pair lived together in a flat in Brixton, south . London and soon became unhappy with their respective jobs. Ben said: 'It stemmed from not being . happy with what we were doing. We were living in an awful, . mouse-infested flat, I was a fully integrated accounting software . salesman and hadn't sold anything in the six months I had been there. James was doing a law course he wasn't really interested in. 'An article about Jim Shekhdar, the first person to complete a solo . unassisted non-stop crossing of the Pacific Ocean, had just come out and . over red wine on a wintery Sunday evening, just as the pay-as-you-go . electricity was about to run out, we decided to give it a go."" Both . men contributed £400 a month to their boat fund, which they used to buy . a £15,000 craft that has twice crossed the Atlantic with previous . owners. But he journey was far from plain sailing, or rather rowing. Just after the halfway mark a giant wave smashed down on the boat just as James was stepping out of the cabin, breaking the onboard navigation system (GPS) and desalinator system. 'We were forced to use a handheld GPS which just gave co-ordinates but nothing else (unlike the proper GPS which showed speed and course which you can use to plot you way. 'But dwindling batteries meant we only switched handheld on now and then and just used the compass to navigate.' Tweets made by the pair during the journey. Humour was something they relied on to keep spirits high. Often they would row all day only to find that the current had actually pushed them back. On their last day, just as they caught sight of land for the first time in 116 days and their family and friends arrived to greet them, another huge wave, this time only bigger, capsized their boat and threw them both overboard. Ben managed to rescue a flare from the boat, which he let off, only for the flare's cap to backfire in to James' leg. With blood streaming into the depths of the shark-infested water, the pair clung together for five hours until a local rescue team miraculously found them and brought them to dry land and into the arms of their parents who had all but given up hope of find them alive. Rowing After the White Whale: A Crossing of the Indian Ocean by Hand, published by Birlinn, is now on sale priced £12.99. Reunited: James with wife Tory who had flown out to greet him. She brought with her Boost chocolate bars, something he had craved while at sea. Prior to setting off she had given him a packet of letters for the journey.

Britain’s major stores are offering a ‘half-price high street’ in a desperate bid to shift a mountain of summer stock. The recent cold weather means retailers have been forced to offer big savings on everything from summer dresses and bikinis to barbecues and patio furniture. Debenhams, House of Fraser and Laura Ashley have launched half-price sales, and John Lewis has been dragged into the fray because it must match many of the reductions under its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ price promise. Catch them while you can: We list some of the bargains on the high street . Its sales were down by 5.2 per cent last week on the year before, when takings were boosted by products linked to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The price cuts are so deep that the average cost of all products other than food is down compared with a year ago – the first time this has happened in three years. Clothes and shoes are down by 5.7 per cent, and electrical goods by 5.2 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium. DIY and garden products, seen as non-essentials, are also showing big falls. On Monday a BRC study is expected to confirm shoppers have deserted many town centres as a result of the cost of living squeeze and a switch to online shopping. Cheap finds: Clothes and shoes are down by 5.7 per cent and electrical goods by 5.2 per cent compared to last year . Retailers are having to sacrifice profit margins as a result of the ‘desperation sales’. Shares . in the Home Retail Group, which owns Argos and Homebase, fell sharply . earlier this week after it revealed it has had to make big cuts. At Argos margins were down by 0.75 of a point and at Homebase by 2 per cent, as the disappointing start to summer hit seasonal sales of outdoor toys, barbecues, garden furniture and lawn mowers. Desperation sales: One-off sale events and online discounts offer some of the best deals . Argos is promoting ‘The Big Sale’, which includes reductions of up to 60 per cent on garden patio furniture. John Lewis will launch its clearance sales online on Wednesday and in stores on Thursday. Marks & Spencer has held one-off bargain events, such as 20 per cent off all menswear this week. Gap was promoting a 15 per cent off one-day sale on its website yesterday, while electrical retailer Currys is offering up to 40 per cent off large kitchen appliances and up to £300 off large flatscreen TVs. The sales are designed to tempt customers suffering the longest squeeze on incomes ever recorded, with price rises having outpaced increases in pay for four years. The failure of major chains like Comet, Game, Clinton Cards and JJB Sports reflect the difficulties faced by retailers. At the same time, value chains such as Primark and Aldi are thriving. Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King suggested one way to help stores fight off the threat from cheaper internet rivals, who do not have to pay business rates, is to introduce a new web sales tax. The money might be redistributed to cut rates or the cost of parking. ‘The burden of taxation falls very heavily on bricks and mortar retailers. I think we need to rebalance the tax burden,’ he said.","Unseasonably cold weather has left Summer goods on the shelves .

Newly discovered fossils have given fresh insights into how the predecessors of dinosaurs developed 10million years after most of life was wiped out in Earth's largest ever extinction. Seven expeditions to Tanzania, Zambia . and Antarctica have uncovered some of the earliest fossils of . pre-dinosaur creatures ever found. They shed new light on how herbivore species - that eventually gave rise to dinosaurs - were able to compete after ancient species were decimated in a mass extinction 252million years ago. Dicynodon was once a dominant herbivore but was decimated in the mass extinction 252million years ago. New research shows the catastrophe allowed other herbivores to compete and eventually gave rise to dinosaurs . Ken Angielczyk of the Field Museum of Natural History and Roger Smith of the Iziko South African Museum cast a large skull of a Late Permian dicynodont in Zambia . Snapshots taken of life before and after catastrophic event show how the dispersal and destruction of so many species allowed others - including the ancestors of the first dinosaurs - to thrive. Up to 96 per cent of all marine life and 70 per cent of land animals were killed in the mass extinction, known as The Great Dying. The stars on this paleogeographic map of southern Pangea indicate the five areas were the most Permian and Triassic fossils are found . It included the only known extinction of insects. Palaeontologists from The University of Washington say the newly discovered fossils reveal a lineage of animals thought to have led to dinosaurs in Tanzania and Zambia. Before the mass extinction creatures such as the pig-sized Dicynodon - a dominant plant-eating species - thrived across southern Pangaea- the name given to the landmass in which all the world's continents were once joined together. Dicynodon disappeared after the extinction and newly emerging herbivores were able to compete. Paleontologist Christian Sidor  said: . 'After the extinction animals weren't as uniformly and widely . distributed as before. We had to go looking in some fairly unorthodox . places.' Another creature called an archosaur lived in Tanzania and Zambia but were not distributed across southern Pangaea, as had been the pattern for four-legged animals before the extinction. After the ancient extinction, some animals, like Asilisaurus, pictured, were restricted in where they lived . Palaeontologists from The University of Washington found fossilized remains of a new species of the Asilisaurus dinosaur in the Manda Beds of Tanzania . Archosaurs, whose living relatives . are birds and crocodilians, are of interest to scientists because it is . thought that they led the first dinosaurs. Animals like Asilisaurus, a dinosaur-like . animal, and Nyasasaurus parringtoni, a dog-sized creature with a . five-foot-long tail, which could be the earliest dinosaur, are believed to have evolved from them. Professor . Sidor said: 'Early archosaurs being found mainly in Tanzania is an . example of how fragmented animal communities became after the . extinction.' As well as travel to southern Africa and Antarctica, researchers combed through existing fossil collections in museums. Richard Lane, programme director in NSF's Division of Earth Sciences, said: 'These scientists have identified an outcome of mass extinctions - that species ecologically marginalized before the extinction may be ""freed up"" to experience evolutionary bursts then dominate after the extinction.' The researchers created two 'snapshots' of four-legged animals on Earth about five million years before, and about 10 million years after the mass extinction event. Roger Smith of the Iziko South African Museum holds a fossil skeleton of Prolacerta collected during an expedition to Antarctica . Analysis of the findings showed that before the extinction, 35 per cent of four-legged species were found in two or more of the five areas studied and some stretched for 1,600 miles. Ten million years after the extinction, just seven per cent of species were found in two or more regions. The research began in the early 2000s when expeditions were organised to sites in Tanzania that had not been visited since the 1960s and in Zambia where there had been little work since the 1980s. Two expeditions to Antarctica provided additional finds, as did efforts to look at museum fossils that had not been fully documented or named. The fossils turned out to hold a treasure trove of information, the scientists say, on life some 250 million years ago. The paper of the findings that will be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Seven fossil collection expeditions made to Tanzania, Zambia and Antarctica .

Queen of Shops Mary Portas has condemned the Government over a decision to allow Tesco to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at Margate. The retail guru, who was hired by David Cameron to find ways to rescue dying town centres like Margate, described the decision as ‘a very sad day’. She has become an outspoken champion of small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the impact of large supermarkets. Battle: Retail guru Mary Portas has been hired to revive Britain's ailing high streets . However, she has effectively been overruled by the equally combative Eric Pickles, the Secretary for communities and local government, who has approved the Margate scheme. The new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront. The news will confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets. For her key recommendations, which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres, have both been rejected. Threat: Mary Portas argues that places like Margate need to be protected from the impact of large supermarkets so that small businesses have a fighting chance . Rather a penny-pinching and lack lustre funding scheme, called the Portas Pilots, has been set up to give small grants to a few town centre committees to support things like local markets. Last night, she condemned Mr Pickles’ decision to back the scheme, saying: ‘This is a sad day for Margate. ‘The time, energy and genuine care the people of Margate have put into rebuilding their high street is being completely undermined by the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles MP who has signed off an 82,000 square feet edge-of-town Tesco development. ‘If Government really believes in town centre first, how can they do this?’ She was selected by the Prime Minister to front a review of high streets on the strength of her record as a Channel 4 TV presenter, where she was shown helping small independent traders turn around failing businesses. Overruled: Secretary of State for Communities Eric Pickles MP has signed off an 82,000 square feet Tesco development in Margate despite Miss Portas' protestations . However, it is clear that she has been left disappointed by the outcome of an initiative that has been dismissed by retail industry experts as mere window dressing. ‘I did this in between running a business, in between filming and having a family. You try your best…I just wish I had been better advised,’ she said. In April, Miss Portas accused the former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, of talking ‘crap’ when he described the rise of supermarkets as progress. She said: ‘That's absolutely crap. What happens is that 50p of every pound is spent on food. If you take that off the high street and put it into a 40,000ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything under one roof, then you start to take away not only the food shops, but also the chemist, the fashion shops, the butcher… you start to displace the whole high street.’ One episode of her Channel 4 TV series ‘Mary Queen of the High Street’ involved focusing on Margate and breathing new life in to its shopping streets. Last year, she told residents she was keen to help their fight against Tesco, saying she was ‘passionate’ about the effects of big stores diverting business away from high streets. Expertise: David Cameron hired Miss Portas to be his retail expert back in 2011, charged with tackling the decline of towns all around Britain . Miss Portas wrote to Mr Pickles last year urging him to reject the Tesco plan which she described it as a ‘disturbing threat’ to Margate. Retail expert, Bill Grimsey, the former chief executive of Wickes, described the news on Twitter as a ‘Slap in the face for Portas’. Local trader Robin Vaughn-Lyons, former chairman of the Margate Town Team, said he feared a lot of smaller businesses could end up closing as a result of the new Tesco. ‘I don't think it's good for our seafront at all... I'm sure it's going to take business away from coffee shops, local cafes, and things like that,’ he said. Designer Wayne Hemingway is at the forefront of a campaign to redevelop Margate’s seafront around a heritage-themed amusement park. The new Tesco store would sit alongside this and could, in theory, wreck the design. Regeneration: Designer Wayne Hemingway is also supposed to be saving Margate's town centre with a heritage-themed amusement park . Mr Hemingway said he hoped Tesco could be persuaded to give its store a vintage feel. ‘We will kick them in the b******* until they say they will,’ he said. A letter to the developers from Mr Pickles’ department said the supermarket plan was ‘acceptable’ and ‘would perform the economic, social and environmental roles of sustainable development towards which it aims’. While the Government has given its approval, the application is still at the centre of a judicial review supported by residents which could overturn the decision. Tesco said: ‘Tesco is a tenant in this developer-led project. The developer’s application is now subject to a judicial review. We look forward to the outcome.’","An 82,000 square foot Tesco is arriving in Margate, outraging Mary Portas .

Hacked Off lobbyist John Dickinson-Lilley failed to declare a parliamentary pass he had for eight months . But he left that role last October and under parliamentary rules, the register should have been updated within a month of him starting work at Hacked Off, the campaign fronted by actor Hugh Grant. It was not until two days ago, after being contacted by journalists, that Mr Dickinson-Lilley called the registrar at the House of Lords and asked for the register to be updated. Mr Dickinson-Lilley, a top blind ski racer, obtained his pass through Lord Low of Dalston, who worked with him three years ago at the Royal National Institute of Blind people. The peer, vice president of the RNIB, is a strong supporter of Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations on press regulation and in a Lords debate in January said press  freedom must be seen as a ‘qualified freedom.’ Dickingson-Lilley is a strong supporter of Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations on press regulation . Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said:  ‘It is ironical that (Lord Low and  Mr Dickinson-Lilley) were arguing for increased regulation yet they couldn’t meet their own regulatory requirements. ‘Concern has been expressed about possible abuses to the parliamentary pass system both from the lobbying point of view and from a security point of view. ‘It is of crucial importance that all the official people actually know  and are fully aware about the circumstances under which a pass has  been issued.’ Lord Low said: ‘I counter-signed John Dickinson-Lilley’s form updating his details of employment in December 2012. This was submitted by John in person to the pass office whose role is, in the case of an existing pass holder, to pass it on to the Lords Registrar of Interest so that Category 1 can be updated. ‘It is regrettable that his form seems to have been lost.’ Hacked Off said Mr Dickinson- Lilley’s role had been disclosed on its website, adding: ‘John meets with Lord Low regularly to advise him on special educational needs issues.’","John Dickinson-Lilley began helping Hacked Off in November .

In 1840, the students of Durham were banned from local pubs, forced to wear gowns wherever they walked and even prohibited from entering sweet shops. But these rules were often broken - and the riotous alcohol-fuelled life associated with many students today was just as prevalent as 170 years ago. These days were documented in a fascinating set of comic strips about the raucous life of Victorian Durham University theology student Edward Bradley. The comic strips, written under the pen name of 'Cuthbert Bede', detail the alcohol-fuelled life of Victorian Durham University theology student Edward Bradley . The 18-year-old created the semi-autobiographical strips about the adventures of a ‘freshmonne’ - the predecessor to a first-year ‘fresher’ of today. They show how he was overawed upon his arrival in the city and was 'by no means certain as to where on earth he can be going' in an omnibus. Later on the student is encouraged over dinner to the 'freshman's wine' and 'finds the reality far beyond his expectation' when he becomes drunk. He is then 'assisted to his own rooms' by other students and 'passes an uneasy night on his hearth-rug' before the maid finds him there in the morning. The strips - written under the pen . name of 'Cuthbert Bede' - were found in a city library and restored by . Alex Morgan, 20, of Guildford, Surrey. The . second-year theology student at Durham University discovered them while . working on a film project about the city entitled The Durham Story. The semi-autobiographical strips were found in a city library and restored by student Alex Morgan, 20, of Guildford, Surrey . Universities acted like a parent in the 1840s, according to Mr Morgan, with servants even making sure students' lights were turned out at night. Pictured is a drawing of a university boat crew dinner . He told MailOnline: ‘I stumbled across them in the archives and thought they were cracking. This guy has frozen in time a window on student life. ‘This is freshers’ week, 1840s-style. As a “freshmonne” he matriculated here in 1845 and graduated in 1848. ‘He goes off to dinner and sketches a . very naive young fresher. He probably thinks the other guys are taking . advantage of him. The cleaner then finds him face down on the rug.’ Mr Morgan said universities acted like a . parent in the 1840s. ‘You had a bedtime and servants went round to make . sure your light was turned off,’ he added. Modern-day Durham University students set a trend last December for 'Porting', which involved pouring bottles of Port over their heads while being filmed .

Morgan pointed out that Victorian students came up with equally bizarre . ideas in their spare time, such as trying to wake up as many citizens . of the city as possible at night. ‘Alcohol is not a new thing - if . anything, you would have more alcohol then, with every meal. The . students had a lot of time on their hands' - Student Alex Morgan . He said: ‘Students would climb to the top of the castle keep and would take their hunting horn. One bloke used to blow his horn across the city and see how many people he could wake up. ‘He kept a score chart with his friends. You got one point for getting someone out of bed and three points for getting someone out of bed with a nightcap on. ‘Alcohol is not a new thing - if anything, you would have more alcohol then, with every meal. The students had a lot of time on their hands. ‘They weren’t allowed out of college . after 10pm.

It is not only modern-day students who spend their spare time coming up with bizarre ideas - students throughout the ages have been involved in odd trends . In the past, Durham students set a trend for trying to wake up as many citizens of the city as possible at night . ‘The young men here would have wanted to get into mischief, but they weren’t allowed into local bars and would have to wear their gowns wherever they go.’ He added: ‘But from the very first years there are records of students breaking both those rules in one go - and then being caught. ‘The original rules of the university were very strict – how well they were lived out was debatable. Also the playing of dice, cards and gambling were banned, or going into a confectionery shop.’ Mr Bradley went on to be an Anglican priest. The comic strips pictured here formed the basis for a bestselling novel he later had printed called The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green.","Raucous life of Victorian student at Durham documented in comic strip .

Late care: New Government proposal could see schools staying open until 6pm, Education and Childcare Minister Liz Truss said . The school day could be lengthened and parents drafted in to run after-hour clubs to reduce the burden of childcare on working mothers and fathers, the government is proposing. Schools could stay open as late as 6pm under new plans to increase ‘school wrap-around childcare’ which are expected to be announced ‘shortly’, Childcare and Education Minister Liz Truss told a group of mothers yesterday. The proposals will set out plans for longer school days, which could see local childcare providers called in to look after pupils from 3pm or parents asked to run local school clubs, the minister said. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, recently called for longer school days and a cut in the length of holidays to make  life easier for working parents. Ms Truss said: ‘We are hoping to have new proposals out shortly, particularly on schools-based childcare and how we’re going to enable more schools to offer that.’ When challenged by one of the mothers present on how it could work, Ms Truss said: ‘This doesn’t mean teachers working longer hours. 'It can mean private sector nursery providers, voluntary sector providers or parents running an after school club.’ In her speech to about 50 working women, who are part of the networking group Citymothers, the Conservative minister said: ‘We want more schools to be involved in childcare. 'It’s crazy in this country that we have so many schools open 9am-3pm and then empty afterwards, when they have brilliant facilities. Many parents want to work longer than 9am-3pm. ‘We’re doing work to enable schools to be able to offer more of those services. 'There are some very good examples of schools that already offer 8am-6pm provision, either using teaching staff, teaching assistants, local nursery staff. There are many ﬂexible ways it can be done.' Share the load: The later hours would see after school clubs run from 3pm-6pm by private sector nursery providers, voluntary sector providers or parents . Ms Truss, tipped for a promotion in a reshufﬂe next month, called on parents to be ‘more demanding’ of schools to stay open longer and make the burden of childcare easier. ‘In the case of schools they have an . opportunity to do more,’ she said. Parental support: The proposal is set to ease the burden of childcare on working parents . ‘As parents we need to be more . demanding of our system.’ Under the proposals, the minister also wants school nurseries to be allowed to admit two-year-olds, in order to help parents return to work. Currently nurseries have to seek permission and are only entitled to take on three to four-year-olds. During her speech, Ms Truss criticised the ‘complex’ childcare system, where British childcare costs are the second highest in Europe, behind only Switzerland. ‘Our parents pay more than double what parents in France and Germany are paying on childcare,’ she said, adding that government money put into the system doesn’t ‘ﬂow through to the frontline’ as well as it should. ‘At the moment we have a system that isn’t working for parents.’ She also defended controversial changes to the childcare vouchers system, which at present is only available for a ﬁfth of employees. The new system will make tax breaks available per child, although it will be less generous to higher-rate taxpayers.","Government to announce plans to keep schools open until 6pm .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 24 October 2011 . Racial harassment charges against a woman who displayed a golliwog in her window have been dropped. Jena Mason, a 65-year-old grandmother, was arrested after her black neighbour Rosemarie O'Donnell complained about the toy to police. Today at Lowestoft Magistrates' Court, Chris McCann, head of the complex casework unit at the East of England Crown Prosecution Service, offered no evidence. Charges dropped: Jena Mason, pictured at an earlier court hearing, will not now face a racial harassment case over putting a golliwog in the window of her manor house in Worlingham, Suffolk . Dispute: Rosemarie O'Donnell and her . husband Stephen (right) had accused Mrs Mason, of . harassment. Mrs O’Donnell complained that the golliwog was a racial taunt . following a long dispute between the two households . In a hearing lasting less than five minutes, he said a 'review has been carried out at the highest level'. Mrs . Mason, who did not attend today's hearing, had been due to stand trial . after denying that she displayed an item likely to cause . racially-aggravated harassment. Mr McCann said Mrs O'Donnell and her husband Stephen had been informed. He . said: 'To establish that an offence has been committed, it would have . been necessary to prove that Jena Mason was the person who placed the . doll in such a prominent position likely to cause her neighbours . racially-aggravated harassment, alarm or distress. Controversial: The golliwog was pictured in the window of Mrs Mason's home in Worlingham, Suffolk . 'On the evidence available, it is not possible to show exactly who was responsible for placing the doll in the window. 'Despite . further inquiry and review, we have determined that the evidence is . insufficient and there is not a realistic prospect of conviction. 'We . appreciate that this case has caused the O'Donnell family a great deal . of upset and we have met with them to explain our reasons for not . pursuing a prosecution.' Outside . court, solicitor James Hartley said: 'I have spoken to Mrs Mason and . she now wants to focus on rebuilding her relationship with her . neighbours.' The row erupted after a disagreement between the neighbours over plans by Mrs Mason and her husband Terry, who live in a listed . manor house in the village of Worlingham in Suffolk, to build new stables on their land. Stylish: The O'Donnells' £1million barn conversion has six bedrooms . Elegant: Mrs Mason's listed manor house in the village of Worlingham .

But the O’Donnells, who occupy a . £1million barn conversion behind a red-brick wall, hired a planning . consultant to object to the application, citing boundary and . right-of-way issues, traffic increase and problems from disposing of . liquid and solid waste from the horses. Neighbours: But the two families fell out over a planning application . They have also complained about the Masons’ dogs allegedly coming on to their land. Then the golly appeared in a ground floor annexe . window of the Masons' home near the main entrance to the barn. Days after the local council granted . planning permission, Mrs O’Donnell, 48, made a formal complaint to police . about it, and supplied a photograph. The businesswoman and mother of two, who has Jamaican roots, said the sight of it left her ‘shocked and upset’. Mrs Mason was arrested, questioned at Lowestoft police station, charged and bailed.

One of only six working Apple 1 machines which founder Steve Jobs sold from his parents' garage, is tipped to fetch over £250,000 at auction. Capable of only the most basic computing, just 200 Apple 1 machines were made in the garage of Steve Jobs' parents by Jobs and co-founder Steve Wozniak. But as the computer that gave birth to the Apple empire, including the MacBook, iPod, iPhone and iPad, it is among the most prized Apple products in the world. The first ever Apple computer which founder Steve Jobs sold from his parents' garage is expected to fetch £250,000 at auction. The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. How the Apple 1 works . The eye-catching price-tag of the original Apple caused wild speculation as to the reasons behind selling for $666 - the number of the Devil. But the number was classic Apple; it was design for the sake of it. Beauty for no reason other than because it looked nice. Steve Wozinak once revealed: 'I simply like triple digit numbers with all the things I'm involved with. The cost of making the Apple 1 was around $540 or there about and we agreed on the best markup, retail price above the cost of building it, which worked out to $666. 'Jobs then tacked on the 66 cents to make it an eye-catcher price for the ads with the sale and promotion publications of it to the public.' The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. They cost 666.66 US dollars although buyers would have been expected to cough up extra to add a monitor, keyboard and cassette player. The Apple 1 came with a tiny 8K memory - around 600,000 times less than is standard with today's Apple computers. It would not even have the capacity to store one song. This example comes with all the original gizmos needed to make it run and is one of only six of the 46 surviving Apple 1s still working. It even carries Wozniak's signature on the motherboard, and also included in the auction is a company letter signed by Jobs. The machine runs on the 'Basic'  software system, which had to be loaded using a cassette. Only two working Apple 1s have ever . been auctioned; the first fetching around 241,000 pounds last year and . the second selling for a record 412,500 pounds just months later. The Apple machine has even been signed by Apple computer wiz Steve Wozniak, who created the firm with Steve Jobs in 1976, building 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California . Only two working Apple 1s have ever been auctioned; the first fetching around £241,000 last year and the second selling for a record £412,500 just months later . The Apple founders created the personal computer in 1976 and presented it at a Palo Alto computer club, but there were few takers at the time. Paul Terrell, owner of a retail chain called Byte Shop, placed an order for 50 of the machines and sold them for $666.66 retail - once Wozniak and Jobs agreed to assemble the circuit boards rather than offer them as kits. The pair then produced 150 more and sold them to friends and other vendors. Fewer than 50 original Apple 1s are believed to survive, with only six known to be in working condition. In a nod to the technology created by Jobs and Wozniak, potential buyers can even follow the auction online on their iPads. Uwe Breker, auctioneer, said: 'The Apple 1 really is the symbol for the American dream. 'Two students had an idea, built and marketed it, and 35 years later it is the highest valued company ever. 'Steve Wozniak designed the Apple 1 computer, the first fully assembled computer kit, in 1976 and Steve Jobs took on the task of selling it. 'In Jobs' parents garage the pair built 200 Apple machines and sold 50 to a computer shop called Byte. 'The shop marketed it with the slogan 'Byte into an Apple' which gave Jobs the idea for the iconic logo we know so well today. The main board of the Apple machine, which is expected to sell for £250,000 . The gadgets comes with all manuals & certificates, making it a unique purchase . The heart of the machine: The 6502 microprocessor which powered the Apple 1, which was chosen because of its low cost . 'As with all Apple products the Apple 1 wasn't around long before a better model was launched, but a legend had begun. 'The rest is history. Apple is now the most valuable country in the world and interest in their early items only increased after Jobs' death. 'You couldn't actually do very much with the Apple 1. You had to load your program each time on a cassette and it only had eight kilobytes of memory - enough for only the most basic of word processing. 'From the 200 built only 46 remain but just six of them are working - and this is one of them. 'That makes it even more rare than it would be already - plus this one is signed on its motherboard by Steve Wozniak. 'This item was bought by a software company owner 30 years ago and when he saw our Apple 1 auction last November in which one sold for 640,000 US dollars he thought now was the time to sell.'

A homeless alcoholic conned pub staff into believing he was TV star Louis Theroux to get a free room, a court heard. Allan Debenham, 39, pleaded guilty to two charges of making a false representation by claiming he was 'Louis Theroux from the BBC'. Debenham had booked a room at the £70 per night Duke of York at Shepton Beauchamp, near Ilminster, Somerset, in the name of the documentary maker, magistrates in Yeovil were told. Debenham provided staff at the pub with a telephone number for the BBC’s finance department and an order number to arrange payment for his three-night stay. The homeless alcoholic also pretended to be Mr Theroux’s personal assistant and got them to put two bottles of wine on his room tab. He was only rumbled when staff became suspicious when the PA telephoned again asked for two bottles of wine and 'some fags' to be taken to Debenham’s room. The defendant, of Hamilton Road, Taunton, pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly making a false representation by claiming he was Theroux. Prosecutor Emma Chetland told South Somerset Magistrates’ Court that on the evening of April 21 a man called the pub saying he was 'Louis Theroux from the BBC' and made a reservation for three nights. 'Later the pub receives another telephone call purporting to be from Louis Theroux’s PA who gives a telephone number for the BBC’s finance department and an order number to arrange payment,' Miss Chetland said. Impression: The man pretended to be journalist Louis Theroux, and asked for the hotel bill to be sent to the BBC . 'He also asks for two bottles of wine to . be left outside the room. The PA rings again and asks for two bottles . of cava and some fags - to use his words - to be left outside the same . room. 'The person taking the call becomes suspicious at the use of the word ‘fags’ rather than cigarettes. They go upstairs and find the door to the room locked. They call the telephone number that was left and find it to be unobtainable and they call the BBC who tell them the order number is not one they recognise.' Sad case: Mr Debenham turned to alcohol after losing his job, partner and home at the end of last year . Pub staff called police and Debenham was arrested. Investigations revealed that the defendant had also booked a taxi to take him to the pub. 'The taxi was booked in the name of Louis Theroux and they were told they might not recognise that person as he had put on a bit of weight but they should send the bill to the BBC,' Miss Chetland added. The court heard that Debenham defrauded the owners of the pub out of £165 - the cost of two nights and the two bottles of wine - and the taxi firm of a £14.70 fare. Chris Ivory, defending, described it as a 'sad case' with Debenham turning to alcohol after losing his job, his partner and his home at the end of last year. 'As a result Mr Debenham had turned to alcohol. He was desperate and he didn’t have anywhere to go,' he said. 'In desperation he tried it on. He managed to get a couple of nights free accommodation and he accepts the prosecution case in respect of that. 'April was a month that was pretty much a blur to him.' Mr Ivory said Debenham is seeking help for his alcohol addiction from Turning Point and has been provided with accommodation. Magistrates adjourned sentence until June 25 for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Veronica Horman, chairwoman of the bench, told him: 'It is good news that you are in touch with Turning Point because once you have recognised you have reached the lowest point the only way is up.'","Allan Debenham pleaded guilty to charges of making a false representation .

An innocent man falsely accused of being a flasher by two vindictive girls spoke of his ‘living nightmare’ yesterday after the pair were jailed. The two teenagers told police that they were in a car when Jason  McCue, 34, approached them and  exposed himself. The father of two was arrested a couple of days after the alleged incident in June last year. He was forced to give DNA samples, his fingerprints were taken along with intimate body samples before he was charged with indecent exposure. Jailed: Ella Cooper and Lucie Rhimes, both 18, who invented the claims against father-of-two Jason McCue . Lucie Rhimes and Ella Cooper, both 18, backed up their allegations by making detailed statements to the police. Facing two years in jail for indecent exposure, Mr McCue was hauled before magistrates three times. At the third hearing the distraught Mr McCue again maintained his innocence and was told he would face trial by jury at Crown court. But just before the trial was set to begin in January, Rhimes confessed that the whole story had been made up. Rhimes of Chorley, Lancashire,  admitted she had tried to frame Mr McCue after he had a disagreement with one of their families. At Preston Crown Court, Rhimes, 18, and Cooper, 18, of Preston admitted perverting the course of justice and were each jailed for eight months. After his name was finally cleared, Mr McCue revealed how the malicious allegations had turned his life upside down and that he had suffered a breakdown. He said: ‘I’ve been through months of pure hell. If they wanted to ruin me, it worked. ‘The false accusations have caused mayhem for me and my family, and the doctor has had to sign me off with depression.’ Mr McCue, a builder, said: ‘Things like this can ruin a man’s life, and people should know the massive impact it’s had. 'I’ve been feeling embarrassed and ashamed for something I’ve not even done, because it’s easy for people to jump to conclusions. ‘My mum [who lives in Australia] is ill with cancer and I had been planning to look after her, but I couldn’t leave the country until this was sorted out. Imagine how that felt. False claims: Lucie Rhimes, 18, is believed to have invented the claims to smear Mr McCue following a long-running dispute . ‘These girls may have thought it was some kind of joke but it was not a joke for me – things got well and truly out of control.’ Mr McCue had been walking down a street in Ashton-on-Ribble, Lancashire, when he saw Cooper at the wheel of her car at traffic lights with Rhimes in the passenger seat. Later, Cooper told her mother that Mr McCue had approached their car and exposed himself, and police were called in. Officers were eventually alerted to the lies just days before the Crown court trial was due to start. Prosecutors offered no evidence against Mr McCue and a formal not guilty verdict  was recorded. Smear: Lucie Rhimes was jailed after admitting perverting the course of justice . His partner Donna Masterson, 39, said: ‘There was never any doubt in my mind about Jay’s innocence, but people point the finger. 'It’s affected the whole family. It’s put a strain on our relationship. ‘Jay has been ill, and I have children who have to go to the same school as the girls’ families. I’d still have liked to have seen these girls get longer sentences. They didn’t show any remorse the whole time. ‘No matter what the vendetta someone has against a family, you cannot do that to someone. It’s the worst thing that someone can say about a man.’ She added: ‘When we found out that the case had been dropped just before it was meant to go to court, it was the best feeling ever. ‘It was great, knowing that the truth was out and the record had been set straight.’ Sentencing the pair, Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘In this case the most serious aspect is that an innocent man was wrongly charged with an unpleasant offence which has caused him distress and anguish, and affected his personal life and employment opportunities because, unfortunately, when mud is thrown it sticks. ‘This was an offence motivated by malice. You caused this man to suffer for a six-month period.’","Jason McCue was wrongly charged with indecent exposure after false claims .

Skylar had left his house with two friends to go to a nearby store when he was struck by a dark-coloured Ford Expedition, 1997 to 2002, which suffered damage to the hood and passenger side in the impact. Skylar's twin Zachary and his brother Sam, 14, have joined their father in appealing for members of the public to come forward. Mr Marion said: 'He didn't even have a chance to fight. The person who hit him is just a coward. They're living, they're breathing, they're worried about turning themselves in. Take responsibility. Give Skylar some peace.' Mountain Road where Skylar was killed has numerous accidents every year because of the lack of any pavements. More than 20 people have been killed along the 11-mile roadway since the early 1990s, many of them in their teens. Skylar's family are now trying to get this changed.

A further 15 people are confirmed as suffering from the disease. All those affected are aged between their late-40s and mid-70s. The person who died was being treated at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where officials are waiting for a cause of death from the coroner. No further details were released. The person who died was being treated at University Hospital of North Staffordshire where officials are waiting for a cause of death from the coroner. No further details were released . A sokesman for University Hospital of . North Staffordshire said: 'The trust is currently treating 11 patients . confirmed with Legionnaires' disease who are all in a stable or . improving condition. 'One patient has sadly died. 'Three patients are well enough to go home and have been discharged.' The number of confirmed cases has been steadily rising since news of the outbreak first emerged on Tuesday. Public . and environmental health experts from the HPA, the Health and Safety . Executive, the NHS in Stoke and Stoke-on-Trent City Council continue to . work together to identify and investigate possible sources. Health investigators are currently searching up to 12 buildings in the city for the source of the deadly bug. The results of samples taken from all seven water cooling towers in the city are still awaited. The towers, which are condensers for air conditioning systems, have also been treated with chlorine as a precaution. All . of the patients affected live in the Longton, Meir and Fenton areas of . Stoke-on-Trent and are aged between their late 40s and mid 70s. Legionnaires' disease, also known as Legionellosis, is associated with poorly maintained air conditioning cooling towers and potable water systems . Professor . Harsh Duggal, director of the Health Protection Agency's health . protection unit in Stafford, said: 'Our investigation into possible . sources continues and we have been able to obtain detailed information . on the movements of those affected. 'Early . microbiology typing results back from the HPA laboratories show samples . taken from some of the patients look very similar. 'This is consistent with the people having caught their infection from the same environmental source. 'We . are taking detailed histories of the movements of the patients to see . if there are similar patterns which would indicate a local source of . infection. 'We are now working with HPA experts in mapping the outbreak and our partners to pinpoint possible sources.' Pensioner Pattricka De-igo, 74, of Fenton, Staffs, was rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in a critical condition last weekend. Killer: Three people died after an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Edinburgh at the end of May . GPs in the affected communities are being told to look out for any patients showing symptoms of the potentially fatal disease. Longton GP Dr James McCarthy said: 'We have had a letter from the HPA asking us to be vigilant about Legionnaires' Disease.' Legionnaires' Disease is caught by breathing in infected water mainly from poorly-maintained or designed air conditioning systems. It cannot be passed between people. Stoke-on-Trent's director of public health Dr Zafar Iqbal said: 'Legionnaires' Disease is a rare but potentially life-threatening illness. 'You cannot catch Legionnaires' Disease from drinking water. 'The early symptoms include a 'flu-like' illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough and fever which can then lead to pneumonia. 'As with any pneumonia, the patient can become very unwell. 'Diarrhoea and confusion might occur, as well as chest and breathing symptoms. However, Legionnaires' Disease can be effectively treated with a course of antibiotics and this is best done as early as possible.'

A year ago she was gliding majestically down the Thames at the head of the Diamond Jubilee flotilla. But this week the £1million royal barge Gloriana had a rather more undignified outing on the river. She lost her gilded crown figurehead after becoming jammed under one of the stone arches of Kew Bridge, where the 94ft barge had drifted after her engines failed. The Queen's rowbarge Gloriana has been damaged after it crashed into a bridge when its engines failed . The barge was carried into the bridge by the incoming tide after its engines had stopped working . While RNLI crew were discussing the best way to help the barge, it came free and was blown to the other side of the span . The winds then blew her back against the bridge, scraping her side and knocking the crown into the water. To make matters worse, a lifeboat sent out from Chiswick to rescue her ended up punching a golfball-sized hole in her side. RNLI spokesman David Clarke said: ‘The lifeboat attempted to get between the barge and the arch to prevent her from getting jammed again but couldn’t get there in time. The side of the boat was damaged and its wooden 'crown' was knocked off after it became trapped against the side of the bridge . A photographer said the RNLI crew created a hole in the side of the barge during the rescue attempt . An onlooker said the Gloriana's skipper was 'furious' with the RNLI crew after they damaged the boat during the attempted rescue . RNLI Chiswick has said it was important the boat was rescued as the tide was still rising, meaning it could have become even more firmly wedged under the bridge . The 94ft Royal rowbarge was unique among the vessels which took part in the flotilla to mark last year's Diamond Jubilee in that it was the only one specially commissioned for the event. Originally it was intended that the Queen or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would be on board but Her Majesty travelled along the Thames on the Spirit of Chartwell. Gloriana was designed to resemble vessels in Canaletto's famous painting of an 18th century river pageant on the Thames. It was rowed by eighteen oarsmen, including Britain's greatest Olympian Sir Steven Redgrave, during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations . Its construction was funded by Lord Sterling and it was the first Royal barge to be built for a century after being painstakingly put together over four years by 60 craftsmen. 'The aft platform of the lifeboat came into contact with the port quarter of the barge causing slight damage. ‘It was important that the recovery was carried out quickly as the tide was rising. 'Gloriana would have become even more firmly wedged under the bridge causing further damage to her superstructure.’ The barge was eventually brought under control and towed to Kew Pier. Gloriana, powered by 18 rowers on the day of the jubilee pageant, had been carrying two elderly passengers and two crew members when her engines failed on Thursday evening. Lord Sterling, the former P&O chairman who built Gloriana, said the damage was ‘quite superficial’ and would be repaired. He added that the problem was caused by a new battery unit which ‘had a mind of its own’. The rowbarge Gloriana leads the man-powered part of the 1,000-boat flotilla in the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee River Pageant last year . The barge was one of the star attractions in last summer's Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant . The crew managed to free the barge from its position but the rescue attempt caused further damage .

Chemist chain Boots is to remove in-store signs advertising science toys for boys after complaints from customers over gender stereotyping on Twitter and Facebook. Shoppers complained about the high street chain suggesting toys from the Science Museum were for boys. Yesterday the high street pharmacist said it was wrong to have labelled the toys according to gender, in a statement posted on its Facebook page. Science experiments for boys, tea-sets for girls: How Boots labelled its toys before the customer outcry . The statement said: 'Thank you to all our customers who have taken the time to share their thoughts with us on the signs we use in the toys and games area of our stores. 'We've always been proud of supporting women in science and in particular in their careers in pharmacy, and we were dismayed that our attempts to help customers shop our store hasn't worked in the way we wanted it to. 'It was never our intention to stereotype certain toys. It's clear we have got this signage wrong, and we're taking immediate steps to remove it from store.' The campaign to stop the gender stereotyping began after Twitter user Sean E Gray noticed Science Museum toys being labelled for boys and toy tea sets for girls in a Boots store. Under a sign saying 'boys' toys' were kits from the Science Museum involving magnets, rockets and clocks.  On the next shelf, under the sign 'girls' toys' were mini tea-sets and doll-making kits. He took a photograph and put it on Twitter, saying 'Not impressed'.  The campaign was taken up by Twitter account @LetToysBeToys, and within hours, the Science Museum had joined the campaign too. 'It was never our intention to stereotype': Boots admitted its signage was wrong on its Facebook page . They tweeted: 'We would love for @Bootsofficial to sell our products to girls as well as boys but they need you to tell them'. The museum added: 'We think science is for both boys and girls but the retailers decide what products they sell.' Sean E Gray, whose photograph of the toys sparked the campaign that led to Boots changing its signage, told MailOnline: 'I thought I might annoy a manager somewhere enough to change something but I had no idea that there'd be this much support. 'It's fantastic.' The high street chemist yesterday admitted it had got its signage wrong and promised to remove it from stores . Megan Perryman, of the @LetToysBeToys campaign, said children were interested in a wide range of toys, and it was limiting to both sexes to label toys as for one or the other. She said: 'We are campaigning about gender signage in toy shops as we know that girls are interested in science and boys are interested in toys that are often labelled 'for girls'. 'It is wrong to deny children access to toys because of their gender.' Earlier this year Harrods had to apologise after stocking books entitled 'How To Be Gorgeous' with a picture of a pouting girl on the cover and 'How To Be Clever' with a picture of a boy on the cover. It followed a Twitter storm after the Knightsbridge department store, which had recently redesigned its toy department as 'gender-neutral' sold the books which apparently encouraged girls to 'look stylish' and boys to learn 'incredible ways to remember things'. - Megan Perryman, of LetToysBeToys . Last year the company that makes Lego toy construction bricks was criticised for sexism after producing a line of female figurines that loved parties and animals. Critics said the purple and pink-packaged Lego Friends range, which had five female characters and sets including a bakery and pet shop, was reinforcing gender stereotypes. But the Danish firm said its feminine range was hugely popular, and resulted in a 35 per cent profit hike. Gender-neutral toys such as white, rather than pink, dolls' houses with male as well as female figurines, have become increasingly popular as parents become more concerned about the effects gender specific toys have on their offspring. Traditionally, little girls have been given tea-sets, toy cookers, and nurses' uniforms, which encourage them to learn that their place is in the home or looking after others, while boys are given tools, vehicles, soldiers and farms. Researchers say that girls can learn through toy make-up sets and junior hair kits that their value in society depends upon their appearance, while boys are taught to aspire to white-collar occupations when they are given play sets featuring doctors, lawyers and policemen.","Science Museum experiment kits 'for boys' and tea-sets 'for girls' in Boots .

The father responsible for the Christmas Day shooting in Texas that left seven dead told a 911 dispatcher 'I am . shooting people' while cries of 'help, help' were heard in the background, police say. One of the victims of the shooting sent text messages before her 56-year-old uncle opened fire on the gathering, saying he was dressed as Santa Claus and wanted to be 'all fatherly'. Aziz Yazdanpanah, who had marital and financial problems, allegedly killed his estranged wife, their two teenage children, his wife's sister, brother-in-law and niece before turning the gun on himself. Scroll down for video . 'All fatherly': Aziz Yazdanpanah murdered his niece Sara Fatemeh Zarei and six other family members, minutes after she sent texts to a friend about him dressed as Santa Claus at their Texas home . They were at an apartment in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Grapevine, where his wife and children had been staying. Yazdanpanah's niece, 22-year-old Sara Fatemeh Zarei, sent a text to a friend just before 11am saying they had arrived at the apartment and that Yazdanpanah was there. 'Soo we're here. We just got here and my uncle is here too. Dressed as Santa. Awesome,' she said in one text. At 11:15 am she texted: 'Now he wants to be all fatherly and win father of the year.' Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling said police believe that after Yazdanpanah shot his six family members, he called 911 at 11:34 am and then shot himself. Police arrived about three minutes later and found everyone dead. It appeared they had been opening presents around their Christmas tree just before the attack. A recording of the 911 call released yesterday revealed someone saying: 'Help, help' and then 'I am . shooting people.' Police said those words, muffled by the caller's . labored breathing, couldn't be heard by the dispatcher on Christmas Day but were . audible when investigators used a different software system. They believe the call was made by Yazdanpanah. Distress: Relatives comfort one another during a candlelight vigil for victims of a shooting at Parr Park in Grapevine, Texas last night . In our prayers: Neighbours and family members gathered for a candlelit vigil and laid flowers last night after the Christmas Day shooting which left seven dead . Authorities believe that in addition to killing his wife of 24 years, 55-year-old Fatemah Rahmati, their 19-year-old daughter Nona and 14-year-old son Ali, Yazdanpanah also killed his wife's sister, 58-year-old Zohreh Rahmaty, her husband, 59-year-old Mohamad Hossein Zarei and their daughter, Sara. Eberling said one of the two weapons, a 9 mm, was purchased in 1996 and registered to Yazdanpanah. The other weapon was a .40 caliber. The medical examiner's office said Yazdanpanah's son, daughter, niece and sister-in-law were shot multiple times in the head. His wife was shot once in the head and his brother-in-law was shot multiple times in the head, chest and stomach. High hopes: The couple's daughter Nona had dreamed of going to law school . Police believe that before Yazdanpanah killed himself, he tried to stage the scene by placing one of the two guns used in the hand of his deceased brother-in-law, Mohamad Zarei, Eberling said. 'I think he was probably overwhelmed when it was all said and done and decided to take his life instead,' said Eberling, who added that Mohamad Zarei had been shot with both weapons. Eberling said Yazdanpanah was the only one to fire the two weapons found at the scene. A gun was also found in his hand. Eberling has said that detectives believe Yazdanpanah's marital and financial troubles led him to kill his family, but added that his exact thought process that morning may never be known. 'We really don't have a clear idea of why he did this,' Eberling said. 'Sometimes there's not a really good explanation for irrational behavior.' Federal court records show Yazdanpanah was placed on three years' probation in 1996 after pleading guilty to one count of subscribing to a false income tax return. He was fined $1,000 and required to pay $30,119 in restitution. Three years later, Yazdanpanah and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy. That case was discharged in a matter of months. Mashy Modjdehi, a friend of Yazdanpanah's wife who owns a beauty salon in nearby Plano, said the family's financial troubles intensified about four years ago when Yazdanpanah stopped working in the mortgage business. Modjdehi said Yazdanpanah had long forbidden Rahmati, who holds a state cosmetology license, to work. But once he became unemployed, his wife held down jobs at two spas, the friend said. [caption . Rahmati, known to family and friends as Nasrin, had filed for bankruptcy in August 2010, and told her attorney she hoped the proceedings would stave off foreclosure of the home. She separated from Yazdanpanah in the midst of the bankruptcy and the proceedings were later dismissed because she failed to make the plan payments, said the attorney, George Barnes. Barnes said Yazdanpanah listed his occupation as 'self-employed'. Rahmati moved out of the couple's home in Colleyville in April with the couple's two children and into the apartment complex two miles away, Modjdehi said. Yazdanpanah, often referred to as 'Bob,' remained in the Colleyville home, currently valued on the tax rolls at $336,200, and was often seen working in his yard. Neighbors said there were few signs of discord. Wife: Nasrin Rahmaty, centre, was also murdered by her estranged husband on Christmas day . Gunned down: The Zarei family - Hossein Zarei, Zohreh Rahmaty and Sahra Zarei were also shot by Aziz on Christmas morning . The couple's daughter graduated from Colleyville Heritage High School this year and was attending a local community college. A friend said she hoped to go to school in California and become a lawyer. The friend, Yiselle Alvarenga, said Nona had hinted in August that things were becoming increasingly difficult in her life but didn't go into details. Alvarenga said she knew that Nona's father was 'really strict' but that 'her mom was more understanding.' Just hours before the families were . killed, the Yazdanpanah and Zarei families had thrown a large Christmas . Eve party at their ranch. Dozens of friends and relatives celebrated . late into the night, according to WFAA8.com. Crime scene: Police officers stand outside an apartment where seven people were shot and killed on Christmas day in Grapvine, Texas .

James Czywczynski, whose family has . owned the property since 1968, is trying to sell the 40-acre fraction of . the historic landmark for $3.9 million. He has given the Oglala Sioux Tribe until today to agree to the price or plans to open it up to outside investors. Chief Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a traditional chief said: 'The reason he asked . for $3.9m is because of the land's historical significance, based on the . deaths of hundreds of our relatives. If someone turns a buck on our . ancestors' misery then shame on them.' Anger: The Wounded Knee Massacre site and mass grave -the site where U.S. troops killed up to 300 Native American men, women and children in 1890 is up for sale . Up for sale: The 40-acre property in South Dakota is on the market for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million) Sale: James Czywczynski, 74, is trying to sell a 40-acre fraction of the landmark for $3.9 million to the Oglala Sioux Tribe. But leaders on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation say the asking price for a property appraised at less than $7,000 is just too much . The last major bloodshed of the American Indian wars occurred on December 29 when the U.S. troops went into the camp to disarm the men. According to the U.S. version of the story, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote resisted attempts to disarm him that morning and in the struggle a shot was fired. U.S. troops then opened fire in response and a small number of Lakota fighters who still had guns fired back. The 7th Cavalry overwhelmed the Lakota warriors and began shooting haphazardly killing men, women and children of the Lakota Sioux  - they also wounded at least 51. U.S. Military authorities awarded twenty troopers the Medial of Honor for the massacre. Along with its proximity to the burial grounds, the land includes the site of a former trading post burned down during the 1973 Wounded Knee uprising, in which hundreds of American Indian Movement protesters occupied the town built at the site of the 1890 massacre. The 71-day standoff that left two tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded is credited with raising awareness about Native American struggles and giving rise to a wider protest movement that lasted the rest of the decade. He didn't return calls . this week to The Associated Press seeking information about the . prospective buyers. The ultimatum has caused anger among many tribal members and descendants of the massacre victims. 'I know we are at the 11th hour, but . selling this massacre site and using the victims as a selling pitch is, . for lack of a better word, it's grotesque,' said Nathan Blindman, 56, . whose grandfather was 10 when he survived the massacre . 'To use the murdered children, the . murdered teenagers, the unborn, women screaming and running for their . lives, using that as a selling pitch ... that has got to be the most . barbaric thing ever to use as a selling pitch.' Czywczynski acknowledges the . historical significance adds value to each parcel of land, which have . each been at less than $7,000 apiece, according to records reviewed by . the AP.

Reservation, home to the Oglala Sioux Tribe, but many of the . descendants of the massacre victims and survivors are members of several . different Lakota tribes, said Joseph Brings Plenty, a former chairman . of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a traditional chief. Brings Plenty said the tribes are not in a position to pay millions of dollars for the land. Although tribal members are not . opposed to development that would preserve, beautify or better educate . the public about the land and its history, they are opposed to . commercialization, he said. 'You don't go and dance on grandma and grandpa's grave to turn a hefty dollar sign,' he said. Tribal members and descendants have . reached out to President Barack Obama to make the site a National . Monument, which would better guard the site against development and . commercialization, Brings Plenty said. But even if an outside investor buys . the land with intent to develop, there will be obstacles, said Craig . Dillon, an Oglala Sioux Tribal Council member.

Frozen: 'Big Foot,' the leader of the Sioux tribe, lies frozen on the battlefield of Wounded Knee, South Dakota . The tribe could pass new laws preventing the buyer from actually building at the site. 'Whoever buys that is still going to have to deal with the tribe,' Dillon said. 'Access is going to be an issue. Development is going to be an issue. I'm not threatening anybody, but my . tone is be aware you have to deal with the tribe if you purchase it.' There are nearly 2,500 national . historic landmarks across the country, with the vast majority of them . owned by private landowners, said Don Stevens, chief of the History and . National Register Program in the Midwest Region for the National Park . Service.

Gathering: A crowd gathers to mark the 30th anniversary of the American Indian Movement standoff near the gravesite at Wounded Knee, S.D . 'We advocate for preservation and we . always express concern about potential harm for their care,' Stevens . said, adding that the NPS does not have any legal authority. Still, a site can lose its designation . if it does not retain its physical integrity, he said. One example is . Soldier Field in Chicago, which lost the designation when it was . remodeled a decade ago because it changed its physical character. As for the Wounded Knee site, Stevens said any development could potentially affect the Historic Landmark designation. 'Certainly you would hear a hue and . cry about that type of thing,' he said. 'And certainly if we saw . something going up, we'd express our concern, even if we don't have a . legal jurisdiction to intercede, we'd express our concern.'","The 40-acre property is being offered for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million)

Jack, from Market Drayton, Shropshire, regularly waddles into the Crown Pub and has become a firm favourite with the other drinkers. The sight of geese being driven through a village street was once a familiar sight in the British countryside, but now the landlord gives the friendly fowl free range of the pub. Neck it: Pub landlord Rob Andrews serves Jack the goose a pint of his favourite cider. The friendly fowl is owned by Sally Barnett . Sally Barnett and Keith Burgess are Jack's owners and even serve him a drink on his very own beer towel. His visits have made him a local celebrity and he now boasts more than 1,300 friends on Facebook. Ms Barnett, 41, said: 'We take Jack almost everywhere with us, so we didn't even think twice about taking him to the pub with us too. 'The first time we went to the pub, we asked if we could leave him in the beer garden, but as it started to get a bit colder, the landlady suggested we bring him inside - and it's stayed that way ever since. Gulping goose: Jack is well-loved by the other bar patrons and wanders around 'chatting to them' 'He's really sociable and loves ""chatting away"" to everyone, he's become part of the furniture down there now.' It's not just at the pub where his fans can spot him - Jack's also been known to show up at the town's weekly markets and even goes on camping trips with his owners. Ms Barnett said: 'Jack is as much a part of our family as a dog would be. As a baby he used to sleep on our bed and he eats in the kitchen with us. 'He has a lead and we take him everywhere we can. He'll nip to the supermarket and wait outside while we do the shop - he always attracts a lot of attention. 'We feel like his parents, so we like to have him with us as much as possible.' The couple decided to adopt a goose after looking after a gosling for their friend. Ms Barnett said: 'We'd been looking after a baby goose for one of our friends, and really suddenly it died.' Brew to a goose: Ms Barnett bought Jack after she was upset when a gosling she was looking after died . She added: ''We were both absolutely devastated and realised that it might be nice to get a gosling of our own. 'I researched on the internet and a farm not far from us had some geese to sell so I went down to have a look. 'I was initially given a white goose but a grey one, which turned out to be Jack, caught my eye so I asked for him instead. 'We connected straight away and he didn't stop chatting to me for the whole car journey home. He's been a huge part of our lives ever since.' Since Jack was first brought home, he has been treated to a life of luxury by his owners. Popular: Jack has amassed 1,300 friends on Facebook and is a common sight on the streets of Market Drayton . Pampered: His owner admits he has a cushy life and lets him live in her home . 'When we first got him we left him outside but he'd just honk and honk so we brought him into the house,' Ms Barnett said. 'As soon as he was in the house, he was much calmer - and quieter. 'He used to have a wash in our bath, but now that he's bigger he has his own paddling pool that he uses. 'He eats out of a china bowl in the kitchen - although he's forever stealing food that we leave out. I caught him with a bread roll the other day.'

A Chicago Blackhawks' fan who was hit in the face 'like an arrow' by a hard, rubber hockey puck during game one of the Stanley Cup playoffs on Wednesday and required surgery to repair a 'bone-deep' gash above her eyebrow is recovering at home. Dr. Patricia Higgins, 55, a family practitioner in a Chicago suburb attended the game with her 26-year-old daughter when a puck came over the glass and hit her in the face. The result: a 1-and-a-half-inch, bone-deep gash extending from the top of her nose to above her right eyebrow. Ouch! Patricia Higgins didn't even get to keep the puck that hit her in the face . The wound required 'a ton of internal and . external stitches' from a plastic surgeon but did not cause any internal . damage, her daughter Caitlin Higgins told the Chicago Sun-Times. “She’ll have a nice shiner for a while,” the younger Higgins told the paper.

Higgins' mother, who did not wish to be identified by the paper, says she was watching the game at home on television when she heard someone was hit with a puck.

Hamdi Ulukaya came to the U.S. with just $3,000 in his pocket and in the last five years has created a billion dollar business . To those who say the American Dream no longer exists, consider the story of Hamdi Ulukaya, a Turkish Kurd who came to the U.S. with $3,000 in his pocket and has in the last five years created a billion dollar business. Ulukaya, 41, is the man behind Chobani, a runaway success story which has become the leading Greek yogurt brand in the U.S. with annual sales of more than $1 billion. In a short space of time Ulukaya has taken an idea based on food that his parents used to make back in Turkey and turned into a one of the fastest growing brands in the country. The company currently employs about . 3,000 people around the world, user 40 million pounds of domestically . produced milk per week, and has helped turn an economically depressed . region of upstate New York into a capital of Greek yogurt production. One . of seven brothers, Ulukaya came to the U.S. in 1994 to study and learn . English. He came from Ilic, a small town in the Kurdish region of . Anatolia, 400 miles east of Ankara, where his family had tended sheep . and made cheese and yogurt. He studies took him to SUNY Albany, in upstate New York, where the rolling hills reminded him of home. After . an assignment to write an essay about making something, he wrote about . making feta cheese as his father did back in Turkey. When his father visited he complained . about the quality of the feta cheese his son bought and told him he . could make better himself. In five years Chobani has become the leading Greek yogurt brand in the U.S. with annual sales of more than $1 billion . In . 2002 Ulukaya started Euphrates, which continues to make cow’s milk feta . and sell it to wholesalers. The process of setting up a business was a . steep learning curve but he learned quickly and after several years of . struggling had established a small scale operation. ‘What . you brought wasn’t the money or the clothes, you brought what you . learned from your culture. Mine was learning from my father how he dealt . with the business, and the products which he loved,’ he told The Daily . Beast. In 2005, he . took the bold decision to take out a loan and buy a rundown 85-year-old . yogurt plant in New Berlin that Kraft was selling for several hundred . thousand dollars. For his new venture he once again looked to the foods he knew from his childhood and decided to create a strained yogurt. For decades, Pepsico, Coca-Cola, General Mills, and Kraft had pushed processed, sugary, unhealthy yogurts into stores because they thought that was what American palates demanded. Capacity at the Chobani plant in New Berlin, New York state has grown from about 55,000 cases per week to nearly two million . But with another brand of strained . yogurt - Fage - proving a success at specialty stores, Ulukaya felt the . time was right for something different. In . September 2007, after two years of testing he was finally ready to go . to market with Chobani, which means shepherd in Turkish. Part . of the yogurts subsequent success has been due to making the product . thicker but without adding sugar – a bold decision consisting American . tastes. Fortunately for Ulukaya his timing was also good as his product, offers a lot of protein without much cholesterol or carbs, appealed to health conscious consumers. Another factor in Chobani's success has been down to Ulukaya's business acumen as he insisted it should be placed in the main dairy area in supermarkets, rather than in the area for specialty and natural products. Chobani: Even Hamdi Ulukaya's German Shepherd dogs enjoy eating it . Chobani started as a coastal phenomenon - spreading from the New York area to the Eastern Seaboard before gaining traction in the Midwest and West. Capacity at the New Berlin plant has grown from about 55,000 cases per week to nearly two million. In December 2012, a new $450 million plant - twice the size of the New Berlin plant - opened in Twin Falls, Idaho, a town of 44,000 about 130 miles southeast of Boise.",Turkish Kurd Hamdi Ulukaya has created the country's leading Greek yogurt brand in just five years .

The unusual concept is part of an initiative by the company to help some of the millions of Americans who can’t afford to eat on a regular basis.

When the cashiers take meal orders, they hand receipts to customers which show how much the food would normally cost, and then the customer decides how much to leave in the box or to take off their credit card. The first cafe opened in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton in May 2010 and since then four others have opened in Dearborn, Portland, Chicago and Boston.

Didier Evrard, a top European missile developer who was selected to run the A350 programme because of its complexity, smiled broadly but refused to relax. 'I will still be nervous until it comes back. I'm an engineer so I have to be connected to the ground and make sure everything is fine,' he said during the flight. Competition for wide-bodied jets is expected to dominate next week's Paris Airshow, where the A350 could steal attention with a brief roar over the aviation industry's largest showcase.

A large crowd gathered at the runway at the Airbus factory in Toulouse to see A350's first flight . The Airbus A350 will be a rival to Boeing's problematic Dreamliner jets which had to be grounded following battery failures . Airbus is finalising orders from . Singapore Airlines , Kuwait Airways and Air France and may add a new . customer at the June 17-23 show, analysts say. Evrard said that Airbus would soon add . a customer in the United States, where industry sources say that United . Airlines is negotiating to upgrade and expand an existing order to 35 . jets. Airbus initially . dismissed the threat posed by the new generation of mid-sized aircraft . as it focused on building the world's largest airliner, the A380 . superjumbo. But faced with . burgeoning Dreamliner sales, it changed tack and overhauled the design . of the A350 by adopting similar composites technology in 2006. Airbus plans to offer three variants of the A350 XWB, with the smallest, the A350 800, a rival to Boeing's Dreamliner 787-9 and 787-8 jets . The sleek jet with curled wingtips took off with a crew of six wearing parachutes and orange jumpsuits and with tonnes of test equipment on board . The high-tech jet, the company's first all-new plane in eight years, is built primarily from carbon composites and features fly-by-wire technology . To . boost sales, Boeing is expected to confirm plans to build a larger . version of its Dreamliner. It is also overhauling its 777 with new . engines and wings. The A350 is due to enter service in the . second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was . launched as Europe's answer to the light-weight 787 Dreamliner. Airbus plan to offer three variants of the A350. The A350-800 is designed to compete . with Boeing's 787-9 and 787-8 Dreamliners. It will have space for 270 . passengers with a range of 8,500 nautical miles. The two aircraft are almost identical in terms of speed, capacity, range and cost. CRUISING SPEED: Mach 0.85 . CAPACITY:  270 (3 class configuration) RANGE: 8,500 nautical miles . COST: $245.5 million . CRUISING SPEED: Mach 0.85 . CAPACITY: 255-290 (3 class configuration) RANGE: 8,000 - 8,500 nautical miles .

The A350-900, a rival to Boeing's . 777-200ER, is expected to seat 314 passengers in a three-class layout . with a range of 8,100 nautical miles. Boeing, still recovering from problems . with the lithium batteries on its 787 Dreamliner, currently dominates . the long-haul market with the 787 and 777. 'The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,' Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus's parent company EADS, said late Thursday. Airbus . made the decision to drop Lithium-Ion batteries and switch to . traditional nickel-cadmium cells for the A350 in the wake of the . Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 'exploding battery' mystery.

Overheated: The charred battery from the Dreamliner plane which made an emergency landing on January 16 in Takamatsu, is inspected by the manufacturer at the headquarters of GS Yuasa Corp in Kyoto, western Japan . Airbus . said it had taken the decision to prevent further delays in initial . deliveries of the A350 amid uncertainty over whether investigations into . Boeing's battery problems would lead to a regulation overhaul. All 50 of Boeing's Dreamliners were grounded following two on-board fires, believed to have been sparked by faulty batteries.

A Californian woman is suing Yosemite National Park for $3.5 million after contracting a deadly virus while vacationing there. Cathy Carrillo fell ill with the hantavirus after visiting the iconic park in June last year - leaving her unable to talk or walk and confining her to hospital for three weeks of treatment in critical care. One year later, Carrillo still has reduced lung capacity and problems communicating, caused she says, by the deadly disease which is spread through the inhalation of rodent feces. Scroll Down for Video . Cathy Carillo is speaking out about the terrifying experience she went through after contracting the hantavirus at Yosemite park last June . Cathy Carrillo of Chino Hills was among the nine confirmed cases of people who became ill with the hantavirus. Three of them died. Investigators discovered that mice were living in the double-walled tents at Yosemite - which have since been changed to single wall tents along with 18,000 mouse traps and hantavirus warnings. 'I couldn't walk at all, I couldn't move my arms or anything,' said Cathy Carrillo to ABC News 7. 'The doctors at the hospital said I was a miracle because they didn't know if I was going to pull through.' Cathy Carrillo spent three weeks in critical care in hospital after contracting the hantavirus while in Yosemite . Cathy Carrillo fell ill in June 2012 while vacationing with her husband and son (right) at the iconic national park . Carillo and her husband and son stayed at Yosemite's Curry Village tents in June of last year - falling ill two days after she returned home. 'I started getting chills and fever, so I just assumed I had the flu,' she said. Having come down with the hantavirus, which can cause irregular heart beats and kidney failure, Carillo was hospitalized. 'The virus is in the waste and it becomes aerosol, and it's breathed in and that's what happens, it comes in through the lungs,' said her attorney Mark Algorria. 'Most people die of this illness, it's a very severe illness.' The hantavirus has a mortality rate of 30 percent and during a 2011 outbreak in the park this increased to 50 percent. A view of the locked tents in the Curry Village section of Yosemite National Park in California September 8, 2012 following the outbreak of the hantavirus . Yosemite officials confirmed that the virus Carilllo caught did originate in the Curry Village and now Carillo and her husband are suing the Delaware North Company who maintain the parks resorts, for negligence. According to Algorri, the Delaware North Company knew about the virus as far back as 2008. 'They've known about it, they did not warn about it, and they did not maintain this premise, the park, in a safe condition,' he said to ABC News 7. The Delaware North Company said that it would not comment on the pending litigation but released an email to ABC News 7. Attorney Mark Algorri (left) and Cathy Crillo speak during an interview with ABC 7 News . Following the outbreak Yosemite handed out leaflets informing visitors of the potential threat of the hantavirus . 'All the Yosemite Valley cases of hantavirus were associated with a double-wall, insulated tent cabin design, which have all been removed.' The lawsuit against Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts at Yosemite claims the defendants acted in a conscious and reckless disregard for the rights and safety of others. Attorney Mark Algorri said, 'The fact they knew about it, really didn't warn about it. The Carrillos went up there, been up there, never knew this problem existed. It was really kept on the down low.' Cathy says she still suffers from fatigue and diminished lung capacity. She adds it's been especially tough for her husband and kids.

Ryan Ferguson was 21 when he sentenced to 40 years in prison for a murder his friend Chuck Erikson had implicated him in, despite Erikson not remembering any details of the night in question. The only evidence that linked Ferguson to the murder of a sports editor, found strangled in his office car park in Columbia, Missouri, was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath. But despite the appeals and extensive campaigns spearheaded by Ferguson's father, Bill, and documentary on CBS's 48 Hours, the young man remains in prison for a crime he vehemently denies being involved in. Appeal: Ryan Ferguson has always denied that he was involved in the murder of Kent Heitholt . Two years after Columbia Daily Tribune sports editor Kent Heitholt was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of November 1, 2001, Erikson told police he believed he was involved. He told police the pair, who had been 17 at the time, had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question. After reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved, saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him. In his police interviews Erikson, who was a drug user, was unable to give details of the crime, wrongly stating that Heitholt had been strangled by a shirt, or a bungee cord, before the detective questioning him tells Erikson it was a belt. He claimed however, that he struck the editor once, before Ferguson strangled him. 'The police threatened me to implicate Ferguson or else I would be solely responsible for Heitholt’s death and be charged with first-degree murder and possibly sentenced to death,' Erickson said in an affidavit. Confess: A mug shot of Chuck Erikson, right, who said he was involved after seeing a photofit, right, in a paper . Memory loss: Chuck Erikson, who says he cannot remember the night of the murder, recently retracted his statement that Ryan Ferguson was involved . Despite fingerprints, a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching Erikson or Ferguson, police arrested the young men. 'Everything is wrong about this case, . everything's wrong about it. It makes absolutely no sense,' Kathleen . Zellner, who is working of Ferguson's appeal, told the court. Ferguson has denied being involved in the case, throughout his arrest, trial and seven appeals. He stated to police that on the night Heitholt was killed, he and Erikson had gone to a bar and then he drove them home. When his latest appeal was denied, Ferguson told CBS: 'I just sat in this room by myself. And . just stared at the floor ... and it's frustrating because you don't know, . even with all the facts, if you'll ever get your life back.' The appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated Ferguson both admitting they lied. Tribute: Victim Kent Heitholt was the sports editor at the Columbia Daily Tribune and a father of two . Crime scene: The sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park . Erikson, who is serving a . 25-year-sentence, is now saying that although he still has no memory of . the night in question, he believes he acted alone. Tribune janitor Jerry Trump, who said . he saw the young men at the scene, also later admitted under oath that . he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown. In his police interview, Erikson said: 'I could just be fabricating it all and not know. This is after reading the newspaper article in October and this is kinda what I put together with what could've happened.' He went on to say: 'From there on I'm just presuming what happened. I'm making presumptions based on what I read in the newspaper.' According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive, was never thoroughly investigated. Fellow sportswriter Michael Boyd had left the office the same time as Heitholt, who was married with two children. He says that he drove off before Heitholt. The 1991 blue Oldsmobile he was driving that night was never searched, and he traded it shortly afterwards. Police have never been able to trace it. A forensic pathologist, Dr Larry Blum, has examined evidence from the trial for Ms Zellner, CBS said. He claims that the tire tool Erikson said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries. He added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes, meaning Mr Boyd put himself at the scene very close to the time . the crime was reported. According to CBS Mr Boyd said he left the car park at about 2.20am, . only six minutes before 911 was called. Campaign: Ryan Ferguson, left, with his father Bill and sister, Kelly, who are trying to have him released . Mr Boyd, who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime, told 48 Hours that he returned to . the car park later that night after hearing about the murder. Ferguson's family and lawyer continue to fight for the young man's conviction to be overturned. 'I've always felt that the system works,' Ms Zellner said, as she explained her determination to have him freed. 'He is absolutely innocent. ...I don't want to be part of a system that cannot recognize and correct an error.'","Ryan Ferguson has always maintained his innocence .

Kent Holcomb didn't leave his big rig, but his footage clearly shows the extreme weather conditions including waves crashing against the sides of the bridge-tunnel . The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel is a 37-km fixed link crossing the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, Virginia . ‘I’ve never been so scared in my life. They closed the bridge, and I’m stuck in the middle of it,’ Holcomb said on the video. ‘You can see by my cord, just how bad this truck is rocking… I’m going to need a drink after this.’ The bridge tunnel is a fixed link crossing the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and connects the Delmarva Peninsula's Eastern Shore of Virginia with Virginia Beach and the metropolitan area of Hampton Roads, Virginia. Holcomb was heading home to Hampton Roads from Rhode Island when he ran into the bad weather. Holcomb's cell phone footage shows his big rig rocking in the storm . The bridge¿tunnel combines 19 km of trestle, two 1.6 km long tunnels, four artificial islands, two high-level bridges, approximately 3.2 km of causeway, and 8.9 km of approach roads . Holcomb told WTKR that he thought he was going to be able to get over the bridge before the storm hit . High winds forced crews to close the 23-mile-long bridge tunnel. ‘I thought I was going to be able to beat it - and I guess the bridge people thought that too - but that wasn’t the case,’ Holcomb told WTKR.

For the second  day in a row, there has been a blast at an industrial plant in Louisiana's Ascension Parish. The incident today occurred at CF Industries in Donaldsville, Louisiana which manufactures nitrogen products. One man was killed, and seven injured, when an 18-wheeler carrying nitrogen was pressuring another vessel and caused an explosion around 6:15 P.m. on Friday. Ronald 'Rocky' Morris, 55, was killed in the blast. Morris, who had been working at the plant for 30 years, died instantly. Seven others were injured and taken to a local hospital where they are all in fair or stable condition. Nitrogen blast: The blast happened shortly after 6 p.m. on Friday at the CF Industries plant in Donaldsville, Louisiana . Second blast: This was the second deadly blast in two days in the same parish in Louisiana. On Thursday a larger explosion happened in Geismar, killing one and injuring 70 . Ascension Parish Sheriff Jeff Wiley likened the blast to a 'balloon popping.' Plant manager Lou Frey said that reports that there was an explosion were wrong since 'there was no fire or chemical release nor is there any threat or hazard posed to the community,' Frey said in a press conference. So far though, they don't know what exactly went wrong. 'We do not know exactly what happened, but we don want to find out what happened,' Frey said. ' It's very important to us, but we don't have the details.' The fertilizer plant, run by CF Industries based in Deerfield, Illinois, had some violations in the past with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. They ere fined $150,000 for safety adn health violations after a fire and explosion at the plant killed three people in 2000. The violation cited 12 violations which posed 'substantial probability' of serious injury or death. Geismar explosion: The blast Thursday was much larger, and actually caused a fire at the plant. The blast at CF Industries was described as being like a 'balloon popping' Back to back blasts: With two deadly blasts in two days, many are concerned about oversight at the Louisiana plants . Yesterday a much larger explosion happened at nearby Williams Olefins chemical plant in Geismar, which is just 30 miles away from Donaldsville in the same parish. That explosion killed two people and injured more than 70 others. In a press conference after the CF Industries blast, Wiley commented on the tragic two day events. 'The irony of back-to-back incidents has not escaped us.

Former Guantanamo Bay inmate Ahmed Zuhair stopped eating in June 2005 and kept up his protest until he was sent home to Saudi Arabia in 2009 . Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Ahmed Zuhair, who refused to eat for four years, has condemned the prison's 'excruciating' force-feeding methods. The 47-year-old revealed he was tied down for hours at a time while a feeding tube was inserted into his nose so the liquid nutrient drink Ensure could be digested, causing his nose to bleed. But the father of ten was adamant that nothing would deter him from his four-year hunger strike. 'During each force-feeding, my nose bleeds,' Zuhair said in a sworn statement submitted to the court by his lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, a law professor . at City University of New York. 'The pain from each force-feeding is so excruciating that I am unable to . sleep at night because of the pain in my throat.' The former sheep merchant who was . never charged with any crime during seven years at 'Gitmo', stopped . eating in June 2005, and kept up his protest until he was sent home to . Saudi Arabia in 2009. Zuhair alleges he was roughly forced into the restraint chair - what he called 'the torture chair' - and left there much longer than the two-hour maximum, even though he wasn't always confrontational. The . military acknowledges a 'forced cell extraction team' was repeatedly . used to move Zuhair when he refused to walk on his own to where striking . detainees were fed. Zuhair says his nasal passages and back are permanently . damaged from the way he was strapped down and fed through a nasogastric . tube. Court papers show . that Zuhair once racked up 80 disciplinary infractions in four months, . refusing to be force-fed among them, and that he and fellow prisoners . smeared themselves with their own feces for five days to keep guards at . bay and protest rough treatment. The one-time merchant said he has no work now, with his stomach and back in constant pain from the effects of his strike. 'My family did . not know what I was going through at Guantanamo - the humiliation, the . torture, the solitary confinement,' he told AP. 'Not once did the thought occur to me to stop my hunger strike. 'I . think about the men who are at Guantanamo and I wonder about America's . humanity. 'I ask myself how much longer this will go on.' Former Guantanamo Bay inmate Ahmed Zuhair, pictured in Saudi Arabia, was never charged with any crime during seven year detention . This is the restraint chair used to force-feed Guantanamo Bay inmates . The news comes amid a raft of protests against the U.S. military facility in Cuba and its controversial force-feeding processes, with about 44 detainees being fed through their nose every day to prevent them . from starving to death. AP reports 104 of the 166 . prisoners are hunger striking, and it's U.S. police to keep strikers alive. Navy Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesman for the detention center, said the feeding . procedure is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts. He said the feeding tubes are lubricated and prisoners are offered anesthetics to . prevent long-lasting damage. 'We . think there are adequate safeguards in place to make it as pain-free . and comfortable as possible,' he said. 'It's not done to inflict pain . and it's not done as punishment. It's done to preserve life.' Officials . refer to the process by the medical term 'enteral feeding' rather than 'force feeding'. It involves restraining men with straps that resemble . airplane seatbelts to a specially designed chair that looks like a piece . of exercise equipment. More than 40 Guantanamo Bay detainees are force-fed each day . Human rights groups, seen here protesting outside the White House on Friday, have criticized President Barack Obama for failing to close Guantanamo Bay . But Dr. David L. Katz, an internist on the faculty of the Yale University School of Medicine, said force-feeding hunger strikers is unethical. He said there are risks to prolonged enteral feeding, including the possibility of getting liquid in the lungs and or damaging the nasal passages, particularly when the person is uncooperative. 'You do a procedure when it's the best choice under the circumstances,' Katz said. 'In this ethical context, these are people you are forcing to receive sustenance they don't want. 'I don't know how you begin to measure risk-benefit trade-offs, but there are some medical risks, certainly.' The military began using the restraint chair at Guantanamo to feed prisoners in January 2006 after hunger strikers grew dangerously thin and officials feared some might die.","Ex-Guantanamo Bay inmate Ahmed Zuhair, 47, has revealed four years of being forcibly fed through the nose while strapped to a 'torture chair' has permanently damaged his back and nasal passages.

Australia has announced new guidelines to recognise the gender category 'intersex' on official documents. Under the new system, which will come into effect from July 1, individuals will not be required to have undergone sex reassignment surgery or hormone therapy to select the new category. Since 2011 Australian nationals who were biologically not entirely male or female, have been able to select 'X' as a gender category on their passports. Third sex: The Australian government is to recognise 'Intersex' as a gender category on official documents . Transgender people have been able to pick whether they are male or female providing their choice is supported by a doctor. The changes mean people will now have the option to select M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified). It follows a recommendation by the . Australian Human Rights Commission in 2009 for the government to . consider setting out guidelines for the collection of sex and gender . information. Since 2011 Australian nationals have been able to select 'X' as a gender category on their passports . According to Australia's Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus the new guidelines will make it easier for people to establish or change their sex or gender in personal records held by federal government departments and agencies. He said: 'We recognise individuals may identify, and be recognised within the community, as a gender other than the gender they were assigned at birth or during infancy, or as an indeterminate gender. 'This should be recognised and reflected in their personal records held by departments and agencies.' If an Australian wants to change the gender entry on their personal record, the government will now accept a statement from their doctor or psychologist, a valid Australian passport or a state or territory birth certificate or other document which shows their preferred status. Mr Dreyfus said:'Transgender and intersex people in Australia face many issues trying to ensure the gender status on their personal records matches the gender they live and how they are recognised by the community.

A juror in the trial of the disgraced son of socialite Brooke Astor has recanted her guilty vote and pleaded for him to be spared jail at the last minute. Judi DeMarco, who was Juror No.8 in the high profile trial of Anthony Marshall, 89, says she went along with a guilty vote that she did not believe in because of 'fear and exhaustion'. She has now signed an affidavit saying she believes Marshall, who is due to begin a jail term of up to three years on Monday, is innocent of plundering his mother's millions, . Juror Judi DeMarco, pictured in long grey scarf, has recanted her guilty vote in the Anthony Marshall trial . A New York state appeals court has upheld the conviction of Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty in 2009 of siphoning off millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, philanthropist and socialite Brooke Astor . Conviction upheld: Anthony Marshall, son of late philanthropist Brooke Astor, sits in Manhattan Supreme Court where opening arguments were delivered in his trial . Anthony Marshall (left), arrives at Manhattan State Supreme Court for his 2009 sentencing with his wife Charlene, and his attorney Ken Warner while (right) the late New York socialite Brooke Astor is pictured at the Andrew Carnegie Medals for Philanthropy lunch in New York in 2001. Astor died in August 2007 aged 105 . Marshall had petitioned the Court of Appeals to overturn his 2009 conviction for attempting to con his late philanthropist mother's estate out of $60million, but lost his case last week. The parties were notified by mail last week and Marshall was told to surrender for execution of sentencing on June 17. Today juror Ms DeMarco called for Marshall to be spared jail as she said she only voted guilty because she was bullied into it. In a 10-page affidavit seen by the New York Post, she wrote: 'I changed my vote out of fear and exhaustion, not because I had been persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt. 'I wished I had stood my ground and not changed my vote to guilty.' Lawyers are now expected to file a motion today to delay Marshall's surrender to jail, and a further hearing is likely to take place to look into the juror's allegations over the conviction. Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City . Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman . Ms DeMarco also cast doubt on the reasoning behing the conviction of Marshall's fellow defendant, lawyer Francis X Morrissey, who was found guilty of helping Marshall con his mother by forging Astor's signature on her 2004 will. She said that her fellow jurors, whom she accused of using emotion rather than reason in their deliberations, decided the pair were guilty and came up with a theory around the signing of the will to suit that. Ms DeMarco also claims she was verbally . attacked by other jurors, whom she accuses of swearing at her and . threatening her during deliberations. She says she has come forward on the eve of the defendants' imprisonment because she did not vote according to her conscience. 'My only purpose in submitting this affidavit is to let the court know the truth' - juror Judi DeMarco . She said: 'My only purpose in submitting this affidavit is to let the court know the truth — that defendants did not receive what the judge told us they were entitled to: the fair and honest verdict of 12 jurors regarding the charges against them.' Marshall has been outcast by New . York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother, who died in 2007 aged 105, out of millions. He and wife Charlene have kept . to a frugal life of solitude in their Upper East Side apartment  during the appeals process and they have rarely seen in public . as he awaits his one to three year sentence. A lower court judge wrote in March that he took advantage of Astor 'when they knew her physical and mental condition' were deteriorated. Marshall also gave himself a $2million pay raise and bought a 55ft long yacht with his mother's money. The wheelchair-bound son had begged judges to spare him the jail time given his age, health, military service and lack of prior criminal history. Marshall,who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons. Setting sail: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 . John Jacob Astor IV was a millionaire . and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the . Titanic in 1912 . John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived. Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch. Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony. JJ Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father. They testified that their father and . stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving . her to lie drenched in her own urine. Marshall was found guilty of . defrauding his mother out of money she had inherited from her . third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor. Vincent Astor's father John Jacob Astor IV famously died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912, and he was the one to go claim . his father's body in Nova Scotia after the wreck.

Miss Hurley, 48, who starred in Austin Powers and Bedazzled, previously lived across the border in Gloucestershire when she was dating actor Hugh Grant. But after meeting Australian spin bowler and reformed playboy Warne, 43, she sold up and they bought the house together. The pair became engaged in 2011 and try to spend as much time as possible together in their country retreat.

Lorraine King has been told to sign on the sex offenders' register after admitting sexual offences against a 12-year-old boy . A mother-of-two who worked in a primary school will be on the sex offenders’ register for five years after admitting sexual offences against a 12-year-old boy. Former lunchtime supervisor Lorraine King was also given a nine-month community order when she faced Winchester Crown Court for sentencing last Friday, but she escaped a jail sentence. Adam Hiddleston, prosecuting, said King had previously admitted a charge of inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and sexual assault on a child under 13. On July 30 last year a neighbour of King’s called the police after she had seen behaviour that caused her concern. Mr Hiddleston said the neighbour had seen 41-year-old King in her garden on all fours with a young boy stood behind her simulating sexual intercourse with her. He said both were fully clothed and King was laughing and saying ‘ride me baby, ride me’. Police spoke to the boy, who also confessed that King had on previous occasions touched him around the leg and knees while he had been at her home in Fleet. He told police she had put her hand on his right leg and moved it up towards his thigh. Mr Hiddleston also said the boy told police King randomly spoke to him about sex until he was able to change the subject. He added police interviewed King, who denied the touching allegations. When police told her they had interviewed the boy about the simulated sexual intercourse, she accepted it but said it only happened on one occasion. Mr Hiddleston said King denied telling the boy to ride her and said the claim probably came from a dispute with the neighbour. King lost her job as a lunchtime supervisor at Elvetham Heath Primary School as a result of the charges . Andrew Turton, defending, said the probation officer who had interviewed his client was concerned about King’s low intelligence. He added King did now realise her behaviour was inappropriate and wrong. Mr Turton said King was a single mother with two daughters, one who has Asperger syndrome. He added she has had no contact with the boy since the events last summer. The court was told that King had suffered as a result of the charges as she has lost her job at Elvetham Heath Primary School and is now on benefits. Judge Andrew Barnett told King: 'People who commit these sort of offences very often go straight to jail. 'Your behaviour was totally inappropriate and wrong towards that boy, pretending to engage in sexual activity. The former lunchtime supervisor received a nine-month community order at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) 'You’re the adult and he was the child and you should not have behaved in that way.' The judge said he had taken into account King’s early guilty plea, lack of previous convictions and the fact that she will suffer from having a criminal record and being on the sex offenders’ register.Ordering King not to have contact the boy for nine months, the judge added: . 'I hope by dealing with you in what might seem to some in this very light way that you will learn your lesson that this is not the way to behave towards children.' Stuart Adlam, headteacher at Elvetham Heath, confirmed that King was previously employed at the school and that she has not worked there since the early part of the autumn term last year. 'I would like to stress that the offences committed do not relate in any way to her role as a lunchtime supervisor at the school nor do they relate to any pupils at the school,' he added.","Lorraine King was given a nine-month community order but spared jail .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:24 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:55 EST, 1 May 2013 . Half a mile long and a foot thick, this concrete wall was built to separate black and white families living in the same Detroit neighbourhood in the 1940s. More than 70 years on, the six-foot high wall still stands in Birwood - a chilling reminder of segregated America, and a physical embodiment of racial attitudes the country has long since tried to forget. But despite its dark history, the community has managed to turn the concrete barrier into a symbol of inspiration and hope. Scroll down for video . Division line: The six foot high concrete wall, photographed in 1941, was built to separate homes built for middle-class white people from black people living in the area . Fallen barriers: A section of the half-mile long wall is seen today, covered with colourful murals depicting community life in the area . When Eva Nelson-McClendon first moved . to Detroit's Birwood Street in 1959, she didn't know much about the . wall across the street. Neighbours told her the wall was . built two decades earlier with a simple aim: to separate homes planned . for middle-class whites from blacks who had already built small houses . or owned land with plans to build. 'That . was the division line,' Ms Nelson-McClendon, now 79, says from the . kitchen of her tidy, one-storey home on the city's northwest side. 'Blacks lived on this side, whites was living on the other side. ... That was the way it was.' That's not the way it is anymore, but the . wall remains. Yet slowly, in subtle ways, it is evolving into something else in its community, something unexpected: an inspiration. 'The Wall': While the separation between the black and white communities no longer exists, the wall still stands in Detroit . Progress: Race remains a flashpoint in Detroit, a city beset by an inter-related stew of crime, corruption and high unemployment . It's still a half-mile long, interrupted only by two streets, much as a developer envisioned it in the early 1940s. It couldn't separate people on its . own - people and policies would see to that - but it was enough to . satisfy the Federal Housing Administration to approve and back loans. Aside from the mural that appears at . the wall's midpoint, much of it is easy to miss. In fact, it's . impossible to follow it completely as the wall disappears behind homes . and in spots is overgrown by vegetation. Where it's exposed, it's . whitewashed or a drab earth tone - and sometimes marred by gang . graffiti. On one corner it says, 'Only 8 Mile', referring to the divisive road just yards to the north. The wall never fell, but it didn't . really have to. The area became primarily African-American in the . decades to come, as most whites and even many blacks left. The pattern . was replicated across much of the 139-square-mile city that was built . for two million people but fell to about 700,000 in the 2010 Census. Moving on: People living in Birwood say the wall, which was built to divide, has become something unexpected; an inspiration . Murals: Today sections of the half-mile long wall are covered in colourful murals and slogans . The story of the wall has been . largely lost in larger narratives, such as the 1943 and 1967 race riots . and Eight Mile Road. The wall ends, almost invisible, just shy of the . thoroughfare that serves as the boundary between Detroit and its suburbs . and symbolically represents the divide between black and white. Race remains a flashpoint in a city . beset by an interrelated stew of crime, corruption and high . unemployment. And some accuse the state of further disenfranchising . Detroit's majority black population as Michigan's governor recently . declared a financial emergency in the city and the state took financial . control. Still, the wall is not forgotten. An . artist descended on it several years ago with an army of about 100 . fellow artists and community volunteers to create a vast, eye-popping . mural with images and messages of equality and justice on a section . overlooking a playground. And now, a faith-based nonprofit is giving . work to men who have struggled to keep a job or a home, having them make . sets of coasters that incorporate images from the wall and use . materials from abandoned homes that were razed in the city. Every sale of a $20 set of coasters helps to make something good out of something bad. 'It's recycling, giving jobs to . people who are having a tough time with unemployment and, at the same . time, creating a very nice piece of art that could and should lead to . some great discussions about race in the city of Detroit and in our . country,' says Faith Fowler, director of Cass Community Social Services . and its Green Industries program. Tightly clustered one-story homes . dominate the neighborhood around the wall, which still has well-kept . houses like Nelson-McClendon's but also suffers from a rising number of . vacant, gutted structures. More tear-downs in the making. And, perhaps, . more wood for the coasters. The homes on Birwood end at Alfonso Wells Memorial Playground, where the eye is immediately drawn to the massive mural. It's impossible to take it all in at . once, but certain images pop out in a slow pan: Rosa Parks boarding the . bus that would make her a household name in the civil rights struggle, . followed by a man carrying a sign that says, 'Fair Housing'. 'Only 8 mile': Graffiti references the Detroit road that was a physical and cultural dividing line between the wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs and the poorer, predominantly black city . Landmark: Some call the structure 'Detroit's Wailing Wall', others 'Birwood Wall', while to many it is simply 'The Wall' Positive outcomes: A non-profit organisation in the city is putting people to work making coasters that incorporate images from the wall . Green Industries: Jason Garland cleans glass that will be used for one of the coasters at the faith-based organisation in Detroit . Industry: Montaze Frye stains boxes made out of wood reclaimed from razed houses to hold the coaster sets . Houses and more houses of all colours. A group of men singing a capella under a streetlight. Children blowing bubbles that pop up throughout the wall and contain various things, including an auto plant and words like 'peace' and 'flowers'. 'Bubbles are a form of creation. Children's imaginations create the future,' says Chazz Miller, the artist who designed the mural and teamed up with the Motor City Blight Busters in 2006 on the community project. 'Also, bubbles capture images and distort them and give you a new perspective.' Competition for housing and jobs between white and blacks was widespread in the city's boom years. Many blacks had moved into the area in the 1920s and 1930s because there was so much vacant land - a far cry from the overcrowded, unpleasant conditions in the two black enclaves near the city center. But a lot of white housing developments started spreading north as well and 'pushing up against this black enclave on the far edge of the city,' says Jeff Horner, a lecturer in Wayne State University's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. By 1940, the gap had closed. A developer of a proposed all-white subdivision managed to hammer out a compromise with federal housing officials: The loans and mortgage guarantees would come in exchange for constructing a wall. 'This is the closest thing Detroit has to the segregated fountains or to the white-only swimming pools of the Deep South,' Horner says. Nobody had to tell Nelson-McClendon, who moved to Michigan from Alabama in 1951. 'It was the same thing,' she says. 'Separation.' In an old warehouse a few miles to the southeast, several men are busy working at Green Industries. Among them is Jason Garland, who says he does 'mostly everything' related to making the coaster sets. Garland, 26, had been out of work for a year before coming to work for Green Industries in January. He says he had 'gotten lazy at one point,' but in his new job he often comes in early and on days off. The former automotive worker says he and his co-workers look out for each other, and he never wants to leave. Cass launched Green Industries in 2007, after some clients couldn't get jobs anymore because of the worsening economy and lack of reliable mass transportation. The nonprofit started with welcome mats made from illegally dumped tires, then added a paper-shredding operation employing people with developmental disabilities. When it comes to the wall, Eva Nelson-McClendon knows about perseverance. For her, it was and remains the only option. 'Did it make me angry to see that wall up there? It was something you grow accustomed to seeing, you know, although you don't like it. Getting angry over it is not going to solve anything,' McClendon says. 'What was important to me was bringing up my kids and getting them to get an education so they wouldn't have to be bothered with things like that in the future.' She thinks about progress, and acknowledges some. But she knows there are still neighborhoods, mostly in the suburbs now, where African-Americans can move but they aren't welcomed with open arms. But on this day, she takes solace that people didn't stay in place. Even if the wall did. 'It all depends on the people, the individual, the heart,' she says. 'You're not going to stop progress, don't care how hard you try.'","The 6ft high wall was erected in 1940 in Birwood, Detroit, U.S.

Grieving families who scatter the remains of their loved ones on Lake District fells are being urged to be more considerate following complaints about littering and ashes not being spread properly. Piles of ashes has been found by ramblers as well cardboard boxes, according to park officials. The environmental issue of spreading human and animal ashes has also been raised as it may have an effect on the biodiversity of the area. Sign of respect: Mourners who scatter ashes in the Lake District are being urged to ensure that they clean up after themselves . Steve Curl, 60, and his wife Beth, of . Underbarrow, stumbled upon a set of five discarded cardboard boxes at a . popular beauty spot near a waymark cairn on the Langdale Pikes. They were walking from Harrison Stickle to Pavey Ark when they discovered the boxes 'lying around'. ‘The . fact that friends and relatives of the deceased or pet owners should . carry ashes to such high places, scatter them and simply leave the boxes . to litter the fells is completely incomprehensible,’ said Mr Curl. ‘I find the idea of scattering ashes a bit disconcerting but it was the rubbish that made us really angry.’ Most organisations allow ashes to be scattered across the Lake District but have encouraged mourners to act responsibly. ‘It can be upsetting to see large . piles of ashes dotted around, so we would ask people to spread them . around. It's about being sensitive but also responsible,’ said Steve . Tatlock, ranger at the Lake District National Park Authority. ‘We . understand that families want to scatter ashes of relatives and pets in . places they enjoyed.

Call for consideration: Park officials released their plea for proper conduct when scattering remains on the Lake District fells after ramblers discovered ashes and cardboard boxes left behind . Dr Malcolm Petyt, of the Ramblers Association, is concerned about the effect ashes could have on the environment. ‘The naturalists among us may say a concentrated amount in one place could have an effect on biodiversity in the area,’ he said. Mike Innerdale, of the National Trust, added that mourners should be careful of contamination. ‘Avoid sensitive wildlife habitats like ponds and wet flushes and keep away from water courses.’ Alfred Wainwright, whose guide to the 214 Lake District peaks has gone down in history, had his ashes scattered on Haystacks after his death in 1991. Derek Cockell, of the Wainwright Society, said he was 'dismayed' that containers had been discarded. ‘It is a landscape that many people have a close affinity with during their lifetime and they wish their ashes to be scattered on a favourite fell or viewpoint after their death,’ he said. ‘However, the Lake District landscape is a fragile environment and, as Wainwright stated, 'like a rare jewel it should be treasured and guarded'.’ Two of the containers were labelled Rossendale Pet Crematorium but manager Russell Grey said: ‘It would be inappropriate to comment until all the facts are known.’","Piles of ashes and cardboard boxes left behind by mourners .

He made headlines across the world as the 'Forest Boy' who duped authorities into believing he had been brought up in the woods of central Europe. But now Robin van Helsum has finally revealed that debts to his landlord and a pregnant ex-girlfriend drove him into weaving his elaborate story. Van Helsum wandered into a town hall in Berlin in 2011, speaking broken English and claiming he was called Ray. He said he had been living in a forest with his father called Ryan for five years but had buried him after his sudden death two weeks previously. Berlin social services paid for accommodation for him, his clothing and German lessons for the English-speaking Dutchman. But he then disappeared without a trace as his lies unravelled and authorities in Berlin tried to charge him £25,000 for the cost of keeping him in a children's home. The 21-year-old's lies were uncovered when he was identified by friends and family as German police released his photograph. Van Helsum told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad that he owed more than 8,000 euros in rent and he had been forced to move into a homeless hostel in Hengelo, according to The Independent. After discovering an ex-girlfriend was pregnant, he travelled to Berlin with friends but within days his money ran out and his friends returned to Holland. He slept on the streets before walking into the town hall with his story. He said: 'I knew that if I didn't they would send me back to Hengelo,' The Independent reported. Van Helsum told police his father became ill and told him to walk north to fetch for help before he died. Police even tried to find the body of van Helsum's fictional father after he said he was buried under a pile of stones. Van Helsum, who worked in a fast food restaurant, left, has not returned to Holland after his hoax was discovered. The truth was uncovered after photographs, right,  were distributed across Europe . After disappearing for about three months after being exposed, van Helsum was tracked down to a fast food chain in Germany last year, where he was working. He still lives in the country and is facing charges. He told the Dutch newspaper: I thought about running away, but in the end I decided to stay and solve my problems with the authorities'. Last year, his stepmother Ellen said she heard from van Helsum after he was publically unmasked. She said: 'I was assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside, but nothing.' She added that her stepson is 'smart enough' to return to his home town as 'he would have problems'.","Robin van Helsum said he became homeless in Germany after running away from his native Holland when he discovered the pregnancy .

Working families would have to earn more than £41,000 a year to get the same as many living on state benefits if the Labour Party was in charge of the welfare  system, the Tories claimed last night. The Government’s benefit cap – introduced yesterday – limits the amount of money a household can claim in  welfare payments to £26,000 a year, the before-tax income of the average  working family. Ed Miliband’s party opposes the cap and voted against it in the Commons, even though opinion polls show that it is hugely popular with the public. Official figures, contained in an impact assessment of the policy, show that on  average those who will see their benefits capped will lose £4,836 a year: about £93 a week. A working family would need a pre-tax salary of £32,000 to match the £26,000 a year in state handouts allowed under the cap. But if nothing had changed and Labour got its way, the benefits claimants hit by the cap would have been given nearly £31,000 and a working family would need £41,000 before tax to match them. Tory MPs seized on the figures as evidence that Labour’s opposition to welfare reform discriminates against those who work. The cap was introduced yesterday in four London boroughs – Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley – and will be rolled out nationwide from September. It does not affect those on disability benefits or anyone working more than 16 hours a week and claiming working tax credits. The cap limits will be set at £500 a week for couples, with or without children, and lone parent households and at £350 a week for households of a single adult with no children. Clear message: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said days of 'outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We have a very clear message: we will provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of hard-working families are over.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Conservatives are firmly on the side of people who want to work hard and get on in life. ‘Unbelievably, Labour oppose capping benefits. They’ve got no idea – they want some out-of-work households to be able to claim an average £4,800 a year more in benefits than the average working family takes home in wages.’ Ministers also repeated their claim that the introduction of the benefit was already persuading people to return to work. The Department of Work and Pensions published figures last week showing that the number of families affected by the cap has been cut from 56,000 to 40,000. Menace: Peter Owens was caught driving five different high-powered cars without insurance . Of these, 8,000 have got a job and another 8,000 have disappeared from welfare rolls. Critics have claimed the figures are not proof of behavioural change in those affected. But DWP minister Mark Hoban said: ‘I don’t know how much time [they’ve] spent in JobCentres in recent months, I suspect not very much. I’ve been talking to people who have been implementing these changes, and the very clear message is that this has provided a spur to people, to get them thinking about getting into work, whereas perhaps in the past they haven’t.’ Mr Miliband responded to the criticism by saying: ‘We’re in favour of a benefit cap but it’s got to be adjusted regionally.’ Labour work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne said: ‘Ministers have got this so badly wrong that even members of the Cabinet think it will cost more than it saves. ‘The truth is the benefits bill is soaring £21billion higher than expected because this government is failing to create jobs and the  welfare revolution we were promised is descending into chaos.’ But business leaders backed the Government. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The benefits cap establishes a sensible principle, that welfare should not pay more than working. ‘It is morally wrong as well as economically damaging to have a benefits system that prices employers out of the market. This is a welcome move.’","Ed Miliband and Labour voted against limiting benefits to £26,000 a year .

Since 1784, the bells of St Mary’s in the sleepy village of Bramshott, Hampshire, have pealed out their mellifluous call to worship every Sunday. But this morning the bells will be silent after bellringers decided to go on strike – because the vicar asked them to begin pealing too early in the morning. Despite their enthusiasm for their art, they believe villagers do not want their Sunday morning lie-ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am. Silent protest: Bellringers, lead by captain Toby Arkless, have gone on strike because they believe villagers do not want their Sunday morning lie-ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am . Bramshott vicar Valentine Inglis-Jones caused the stand-off when he decided to move his Sunday morning service from 11.15am to 9.15am in an attempt to tempt more people to attend church. But the captain of the campanologists, Toby Arkless, said: ‘We don’t believe it is right to peal the bells before 9am as people have been working all week and like to enjoy a lie-in. ‘What is particularly galling is that the vicar made the decision without consulting the bellringers. Clanger? Vicar Valentine Inglis-Jones caused the stand-off when he moved his Sunday morning service from 11.15am to 9.15am to tempt more people to church . ‘We have asked the vicar to move the service just 15 minutes later so we can do our ringing without waking everyone up at the crack of dawn, but he refuses to do so.’ A leaflet has been posted through villagers’ doors, telling them of the Sunday stand-off. It says: ‘The bells of St Mary’s have been calling Christians to worship on Sundays since the 1700s. ‘Following decision by the vicar to change the times of the Sunday services, it now seems unlikely that the bells will be rung again on a Sunday morning. The responsibility for this action lies directly with the vicar. The question to be asked is .  .  . What would Jesus have done?’ Mr Inglis-Jones made the decision to . move the times of the Sunday service with permission from the Parochial . Church Council. They believe moving worship to an earlier time slot will . attract more parents with younger children to church as an earlier . service interferes less with the day. It also allows the vicar to . perform a second service in nearby Liphook. The village’s online message board includes comments from residents unhappy at the decision. Some . have complained that since Mr Inglis-Jones took up the post 18 months . ago, he has isolated more traditional members of the congregation. One wrote: ‘Is this how it should be for devoted Christians who have remained loyal to St Mary’s for 30 to 40 years .  .  . and indeed heavily contributed their time, efforts and finances? ‘Is this vicar being led by the voice of God or by the voice of his ego?’ Another wrote: ‘It seems to me the whole village is going to suffer the loss of the bells, and it is a shame that one man’s arrogance and stubbornness can bring this about.’ A third comments: ‘Very, very sad and . quite shocked to learn the church bells of Bramshott will not ring on a . Sunday morning. I hear it’s all to do with a more “convenient” time for . the Sunday service. Seems to have been perfectly satisfactory until . now.’ Complaints: Some parishioners of St Mary's have complained that since Mr Inglis-Jones took up the post, he has isolated more traditional members of the congregation . The bells have rung almost every Sunday since 1784 and were restored in 1989 with money from the late Frankenstein actor Boris Karloff, who used to enjoy listening to them from his nearby garden. Mr Inglis-Jones said: ‘We didn’t quite know how a pre-9.15am ring would work but assumed it was manageable as long as the residents of Bramshott didn’t mind. ‘Apparently ringing after church just isn’t done – although we would love it – and unfortunately our bellringers don’t want to consider a pre-9am ring. ‘The bellringers have asked us to move our 9.15am service to 9.30. The problem is we can’t move it without seriously inconveniencing many of our families.’","Bells at St Mary's church in Bramshott, Hampshire, silenced .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 04:39 EST, 14 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:40 EST, 14 June 2013 . Barred: Manik Sharma has been suspended from working as a medical professional in the UK for one year by the Health and Care Professionals Council . An NHS 'cancer specialist' hired from India following a Skype interview has been barred from practising in the UK after it emerged he has the same level of skill as a first year medical student. Manik Sharma, a radiographer responsible for treating cancer patients, was given a contract with Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust following a successful interview over the internet video phone service Skype. But when Sharma started work at the hospital his obvious lack of competence and understanding stunned his senior colleagues who compared his skill level to that of a first-year university student. NHS bosses terminated his contract after just two months amid fears Sharma's lack of expertise could potentially put patients . at risk. Sharma, who is in his 30s, was also reported . to the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) which has now suspended him from practicing for one year for failing to meet the required level of competence of a newly . qualified radiographer. During an HCPC hearing, one of Sharma’s senior . colleagues said she had not seen such a 'lack of fundamental . understanding' in her 29 years working for the NHS. The radiographer’s work standard was felt to be so poor he had to be supervised at all times. Sharma - who would have received a salary of up to £34,000 annually - also frequently walked out on patients in the middle of consultations and treatments to make personal phone calls. Unqualified: Mr Sharma was employed as a radiographer by Colchester General Hospital after a successful Skype interview but fellow staff members were stunned at his lack of knowledge . Stephen Fash, chairman of the . disciplinary panel, said: 'It was clear that Mr Sharma never reached a . level of competence where he could practice autonomously. 'He never reached a stage when he could work without constant supervision. The panel has identified a number of serious deficiencies in Mr Sharma’s practice.' Sharma - thought to be working back in India - was suspended for one year by the council. He was not present and was not represented at the hearing. All health care professionals are regulated by an independent body. While doctors are regulated by the General Medical Council and nurses by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, radiographers and other healthcare professionals are regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council. All foreign healthcare professionals under the remit of the HCPC have to register with the organisation and have their qualifications assessed before they are able to practise in the UK. This process required foreign nationals to fill out a lengthy online international application for registration with the HCPC in their chosen profession. The applicant must submit details of all their qualifications and experience to demonstrate they meet the Standards of proficiency to practise their profession in the UK. Each profession at the HCPC has its own specific criteria for assessment, which are set out in the profession specific elements of the standards of proficiency. Education, training and experience history are then checked by the HCPC - a process which takes around 12 weeks - before successful applicants are added to the HCPC registry which grants them permission to work in the UK. All medical employers must check staff are HCPC approved before they can employ them. Mr Fash added: 'It will be open to him to undertake additional education and training in order to demonstrate to the panel which conducts the review hearing that he has addressed those deficiencies.' Sharma was employed in May last year 2012 following the Skype quizzing but his contract was terminated in July. A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust dismissed Mr Sharma during his probationary period on the grounds of capability. 'Our lead for radiotherapy took the decision to report him to the Health and Care Professions Council in order to protect the public and in the best interests of patient safety.' While regulated by a different body from the HCPC, new measures are being brought in to ensure the calibre of foreign doctors. Doctors coming to Britain from outside Europe already face strict language tests. But GPs and hospital doctors from countries in the European Union can work in the UK without any national checks on their competence or language skills. Under the new laws, bodies of GPs called clinical commissioning groups have a legal duty to ensure that a doctor’s English is up to scratch before they are employed. The General Medical Council has been pushing for tougher testing in the wake of the death of David Gray in Cambridgeshire in 2008. The 70-year-old was killed when Dr Daniel Ubani gave him 20 times the legal dose of morphine. The German doctor – on his first out-of-hours shift – had not had to prove his competence or ability with English before being employed by the Cambridgeshire NHS trust. Dr Ubani said he was confused by differences between drugs used here and in Germany. He had previously been denied NHS work in Leeds because of his poor English.","Manik Sharma was hired as a radiographer to treat cancer patients .

A driver who has competed 12 times in the Indy 500 finally won on Sunday - and with a bit of luck at that. The popular Brazilian Tony Kanaan dipped inside defending IndyCar champion Ryan Hunter-Reay on a restart with three laps to go and cruised from there under the yellow caution flag. He flipped up his visor to wipe tears from his eyes as the crowd roared and then poured the celebratory winner's milk over his head in Victory Lane. Among the thousands gathered for the historic race was former VP candidate Sarah Palin who had come to Indianapolis with her husband Todd. She described watching the race as 'bucket list stuff'. Milking it! Tony Kanaan, of Brazil, celebrates with the traditional pouring of the winner's milk after winning the Indy 500 in Indianapolis on Sunday . 'I have to say, the last lap was the longest lap of my life,' Kanaan said. 'I got a little bit of luck today. I was looking at the stands, and it was unbelievable. I'm speechless. This is it, man. I made it. 'It means a lot to because so many people, I could feel that they wanted me to win, and it's such a selfish thing to do because what are they getting from it? I'm the one who gets the trophy. 'And if you can bring some joy to them and I think the best thing was trying to put an exciting race for them. And I said it before the race, I believed that this win was more for people out there than for me.' Kanaan had his fair share of chances to win at Indianapolis Motor Speedway but came up short time and time again. He was leading when the rain came in 2007, only to lose to Dario Franchitti when the race resumed. Champion: Kanaan, driver of the Hydroxycut KV Racing Technology-SH Racing Chevrolet, celebrates as he races towards the start/finish line to take the checkered flag and win ahead of Carlos Munoz of Colombia . Fan: Former VP candidate Sarah Palin walks through the pit area before the start of the race . In all, Kanaan went into Sunday's race with 221 laps led at Indy - more than any non-winner except Michael Andretti and Rex Mays - but his second-place finish to Buddy Rice in 2004 was the closest he had come to victory. He had a pair of third-place finishes, including last year, again to Franchitti. The Indy 500 tradition of pouring a jug of milk over the champion's head started in 1936 when winning driver Louis Meyer asked for a glass of buttermilk after the race. From the 1950s, milk companies put up the winner's purse - and handed milk to the champion driver as part of the deal. Today, the American Dairy Association pays $10,000 if the winner drinks dairy in Victory Lane. 'I wanted it all my life, but over the years I was kind of OK with the fact that I may never have the chance to win,' Kanaan said. 'We can disprove the theory that nice guys don't win. We proved that wrong.' This time, it was Franchitti whose crash brought out the final caution to seal Kanaan's victory. 'It's wonderful for him,' said Mario Andretti, himself a victim of bad luck at Indy. 'He's raced here long enough that he deserves it, no question.' The win for Kanaan and car owner Jimmy Vasser was celebrated throughout the paddock. Alex Zanardi, who came from Italy to watch the race and gave Kanaan one of his 2012 London Paralympics medals as good luck, wept behind the pit wall as Kanaan took the checkered flag. Good luck charm: Kanaan kisses his wife Lauren Bohlander Kanaan after winning the race . Celebration: The Brazilian driver celebrates by kissing the bricks after winning the Indianpolis 500 mile race . 'I tell you I'm starting to think (the medal) really works,' said Zanardi, who lost his legs in a 2001 crash in Germany. 'It's a dream come true to see Tony win, to see Jimmy Vasser win, my dear friend. I'm so happy, I'm so happy.' It was Vasser who brought Zanardi's medal to Kanaan before the race, telling his driver that Zanardi wanted him to rub it for good luck. 'I cuddled with it,' Kanaan later admitted. Fellow Brazilian Helio Castroneves, shooting for a record-tying fourth Indy win, was happy for his long-time friend. 'Finally he's able to win this race. He's so close so many times, but the good news is the good old boys are still able to run fast,' Castroneves said. Carlos Munoz, a 21-year-old rookie making his first IndyCar start, finished second and Hunter-Reay was third. 'T.K. is such a fan favorite, absolutely, it's great to see him win it. If anybody is going to win it in the field, he's one of the few I'd like to see other than myself,' Hunter-Reay said. 'We were leading on that last restart, I knew I was a sitting duck, and I wasn't too bummed about it because I knew we had enough laps to get it going again and have a pass back. Maybe I would be third on the last lap, which is where I wanted to be.' Got milk? Kanaan toasts his victory on Sunday by pouring the winner's milk over his head, an old Indy 500 tradition . They're off! Drivers start their engines in the 97th running of the historic race . Only there wasn't a last lap as Franchitti brought out the caution seconds after the race went green. 'I went into the first corner on the last restart and it just didn't turn and then hit. The big, old hit,' said Franchitti. 'When I saw who was leading, it cheered me up a little bit. He's a very, very deserving winner.' The leaders came to the finish line all bunched up around Kanaan, saluting the longtime IndyCar stalwart who had longed to add the final missing piece to his resume. That was about as slow as anyone had driven all day. The average speed was 187.433 mph, another Indy record. Marco Andretti finished fourth, failing to win for the eighth time, and Justin Wilson was fifth in the highest-finishing Honda on a day that was dominated by Chevrolet. Castroneves was sixth. Pole-sitter Ed Carpenter led a race-high 37 laps and finished 10th. For a time, it appeared the win would go to AJ Allmendinger, who led 23 laps in his Indy 500 debut for Roger Penske. Fired by Penske from his NASCAR ride last year after failing a NASCAR drug test, Penske gave him a second chance with this IndyCar opportunity. Seven years after leaving open-wheel racing, Allmendinger finally ran ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing'' and was leading when his seat belt came undone, forcing him to pit. It put Allmendinger off the pit cycle, and he was forced to stop for gas twice far in advance of the rest of the field. It meant Allmendinger had to drive his way back to the front each time, and he finally sputtered out at seventh. 'Once I figured it out, it was phenomenal. I could drive by guys at will when I wanted to,' Allmendinger said. 'I felt like we were up front running our own race, and, I don't know, belts come undone. It just popped. 'I'll be honest, pretty special moment to be leading at Indy,'' he said. ""My body kind of went numb, my mind was racing and I could feel my heart beating really fast, and that's a special moment I'll never forget.' A year after 34 lead changes and a frantic finish created what many considered the best Indy ever, IndyCar had its hands full trying to top itself. This one might have done it, with the slicing and dicing at the front, over and over and over again. There were a record 68 lead changes by 14 drivers, and 28 of the 33 cars were running at the end. With 100 miles to go, 25 drivers were on the lead lap. 'It was a hell of a race. That's all I can say,' said Mario Andretti. 'This is riveting competition, that's all I can tell you. It's just amazing. The reliability of the cars is there. The product is there. It's unbelievable racing, the best I've seen in years.'",Brazilian racer Tony Kanaan kissed the tarmac (and then his wife) after winning the race in Indianapolis .
"By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 07:22 EST, 14 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:04 EST, 15 June 2013 . Iran's top leader furiously told Washington 'the hell with you' following U.S. criticism over the openness of the Islamic Republic's presidential contest. Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, issued the stinging rebuke after casting his ballot in a race widely criticised in the West as being rigged in favour of Tehran's ruling system. The vote will bring an end to the eight-year era of the combative President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose 2009 . re-election was steeped in controversy. Many critics said it was the result of systematic fraud in vote counting after the reformist Green Movement was . brutally crushed . Angry: Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted the U.S. for its criticism of today's presidential election as he cast his ballot today . The election race has taken unexpected turns in the past days as reform-minded Iranians surge behind the only moderate of the six candidates. A victory by former nuclear negotiator Hasan Rowhani would be seen as a small setback for Iran's Islamic establishment. Candidates seen as hard-line loyalists include current nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and Khamenei adviser Ali Akbar . Velayati. Recent comments by Khamenei were . interpreted as support for Jalili, whose reputation is further enhanced . by a battlefield injury during the 1980-88 war with then U.S.-backed . Iraq that cost him the lower part of his right leg. Khamenei, however, has not publicly endorsed a successor for . Ahmadinejad, who had a spectacular falling out with the theocracy over . his attempts to challenge Khamenei's near-absolute powers. The Ayatollah did not reveal who he was voting for when he cast his ballot today. Voting: Presidential candidate Saeed Jalili, centre, casts his ballot during the Iranian presidential election today . But he used the occasion to issue his stinging criticism to the U.S. for its repeated criticism of Iran's . clampdowns on the opposition and the rejection of Rafsanjani and other . moderate voices from the ballot. 'Recently . I have heard that a U.S. security official has said they do not accept . this election,' Khamenei was quoted by state TV after casting his vote. 'OK, the hell with you.' In . Washington on yesterday, State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said . that while the U.S. does not think the Iranian election process is . transparent, it is not discouraging the Iranian people from voting. 'We . certainly encourage them to,' Psaki said. 'But certainly the history . here and what happened just four years ago gives all of us pause.' Moderate: Presidential candidate Hassan Rowhani shows his identification before casting his vote . After . voting, Rafsanjani said he hoped the election would lead to 'national . unity, a requirement for success against any domestic and foreign . risks.' If no candidate wins an outright majority, a runoff pitting the two top finishers would take place June 21, so even a strong showing by Rowhani in today's voting could be overturned. Rowhani's backers, such as former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - who was blocked from running by Iran's ruling system - have urged reformists and others to cast ballots and abandon plans to boycott the election in protest over years of arrests and pressure. Iran's security networks now appear to have blanket control, ranging from swift crackdowns on any public dissent to cybercops blocking opposition Internet websites and social media. Yet other cracks are evident. Combative: Today's vote brings an end to the eight-year era of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear program have pummeled the economy by shrinking vital oil sales and leaving the country isolated from international banking systems. New U.S. measures taking effect July 1 further target the country's currency, the rial, which has lost half its foreign exchange value in the past year, driving prices of food and consumer goods sharply higher. Such concerns could have a direct effect on the outcome of the election. Tehran's mayor, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, is widely viewed as a capable fiscal manager and could draw in votes, since economic affairs are among the direct responsibilities of Iran's president. Other key issues, such as the nuclear program, defense and foreign relations, are all fully controlled by the Khamenei, his inner circle and its protectors, led by the powerful Revolutionary Guard. The other candidates permitted on the ballot by election overseers are seen as hard-line loyalists, including current nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili and Khamenei adviser Ali Akbar Velayati. Such insiders in the presidency would give Iran's leadership a seamless front with significant challenges ahead, such as the possible resumption of nuclear talks with the U.S. and other world powers and the increasing showdown in Syria between rebels and the Iranian-backed regime of Bashar Assad. Yesterday, the White House said it would begin sending arms to Syrian rebel fighters after intelligence officials concluded Assad's forces used chemical weapons. But there also are clear chances that the election could leave Iran further divided. Rowhani's rapid rise from longshot to reformist hopeful - aided by endorsements from artists and activists - has shown the resilience of Iran's opposition despite relentless crackdowns. A defeat could leave them even more embittered and alienated. At final rallies, Rowhani's supporters . waved his campaign's signature purple - a clear nod to the single-color . identity of the now-crushed Green Movement and its leader, Mir Hossein . Mousavi, who has been under house arrest for more than two years. Important: An Iranian woman casts her vote in the first round of the presidential election at a polling station in Tehran today . On Wednesday, the last day of campaigning, thousands of supporters welcomed Rowhani in the northeastern city of Mashhad yelling: 'Long live reforms.' Some Rowhani backers also have used the campaign events to chant for the release of Mousavi and other political prisoners, including former parliament speaker Mahdi Karroubi, leading to some arrests and scuffles with police. Rowhani is far from a radical outsider, though. He led the influential Supreme National Security Council and was given the highly sensitive nuclear envoy role in 2003, a year after Iran's 20-year-old atomic program was revealed. But he is believed to favor a less confrontational approach with the West and would give a forum for now-sidelined officials such as Rafsanjani and former President Mohammad Khatami, whose reformist terms from 1997-2005 opened unprecedented social and political freedoms that have since been largely rolled back. Helping out: An Iranian boy places his mother's voting slip in a ballot box at a polling station . It was unclear how much the boycott calls by reformists could cut into the turnout among Iran's estimated 50 million voters, which was reported at 85 percent four years ago. In Tehran, lines were seen at various polling stations. State TV also showed video of voting queues in various cities. Journalists were under wide-ranging restrictions limiting movement around the country. Iran does not permit outside election observers. Ali Akbar Nategh Nouri, a close adviser to Khamenei, predicted there would be no need for a runoff round next Friday. But Iran's interior minister, Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, dismissed 'any speculation before ending the vote counting' by his office. Outside Iran, votes were casts by the country's huge diaspora including Dubai, London and points across the United States.","Ali Khamenei issued the rebuke after casting his ballot in presidential contest .

And his expletive-filled 911 call is garnering just as much attention.

Barclays was fined £290million after its traders rigged the key Libor interest rate in London, while RBS coughed up £390million. HSBC was fined £1.2billion in the US for failing to prevent its branches being used by drug barons and terrorist groups to launder money.

Furious: Andrew Priest, pictured at an earlier hearing in September, was fined £1,000 after he did a wheelspin into the school car park and began a four-letter rant in front of the distressed pupils . A businessman was fined £1,000 today for unleashing a foul-mouthed tirade in front of a class of children after he was stopped for speeding. Andrew Priest, 39, ranted at community police officers and staff after pupils noticed his luxury sports car breaking the 30mph speed limit outside their school gates in Cheshire. Mr Priest said he was late for a meeting - angrily did a wheelspin into the school car park in his Audi A3. He told a Police Community Support Officer: 'You're PCSOs and not even proper pigs. Go and stop some more innocent people.' As 10 and 11-year-olds looked on in distress from just three feet away, Priest argued about the accuracy of the speed gun and gesticulated at a classroom assistant yelling: 'Is this what you f***ing teach kids? What sort of school is this?' Later, when told by a regular constable he would have to pay a £60 fixed penalty notice for doing 37mph in a 30mph zone, Priest boasted: 'I earn £80,000 a year so I can afford the ticket. My f***ing solicitor will get me off. I'm going to f***ing have you. You're f***ed, I'm going to make a complaint against you.' The children were so upset by his aggressive outburst they had to be ushered back into the classroom at Gorsey Bank primary school in Wilmslow. A letter was later sent out to all parents detailing what happened. Details of the Priest's rant emerged as the businessman, who lives in a flat in Mobberley, Cheshire, was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £1,000 costs after he was convicted of speeding and using threatening behaviour. The incident occurred in July last year, when nine Year 6 pupils were taking part in a 'school speed watch' project with the police officers as part of Road Safety Week. Any motorists stopped for speeding were given the option of taking a fine or explaining to children in a 'kids' court' at the school why they broke the speed limit. The trouble began when Priest was pulled over in his silver Audi A3 magistrates in Macclesfield heard. Teaching assistant Debra Barker told the hearing: 'He was very, very angry from the minute he was pulled over. He was aggressive and was using lots of ""f-words"". 'I told the children the man had obviously had a bad day but they were worried and I kept trying to to reassure them. He said, ""is this what you f***ing teach kids? What sort of school is this?""... I felt very vulnerable and I felt awkward. 'He screeched into the car park. He drove his car forward, his wheels were spinning and he drove aggressively into the car park. 'Threatening': He shouted and swore at PCSOs in front of children from Gorsey Bank Primary School in Cheshire . 'He got out and walked up to the PCSO and squared up to him. I thought it was going to come to fisticuffs and he was going to punch him.' PCSO Gareth Harding said: 'He was instantly argumentative and wouldn't let me show him the speed - instead saying the machine wasn't calibrated. 'He started gesturing towards the pupils. I warned him about his language and behaviour but he jumped out of the car came straight towards me and started swearing and shouting. 'The teacher clearly looked very concerned for the children, a lot of them were starting to get quite agitated, looking like they didn't want to be there at all. A few of them were quite distressed.' PCSO Rebecca Wooley said: 'I explained that a speed gun had detected the speed he was going but he said he was not speeding and his speedometer had not shown him as speeding. - TEACHING ASSISTANT DEBRA BARKER . 'He was angry and very irritated - his voice was raised and his demeanour came across as agitated. 'He made reference to the teacher and pointed and said, ""you want to teach your kids properly"". The children were becoming more distressed, they weren't used to that sort of behaviour, so I advised the teaching assistant to take them back into the school. 'Mr Priest stopped his car, got out then came quite close to my personal space. He became irritated and said something of the effect of: 'This is b*****ks, I wasn't speeding.' 'I asked Mr Priest to not swear, there were still children and staff members who could potentially hear what he was saying. But he said: ""You're police community officers, you're not even proper pigs. Go and stop some more innocent people."" 'He made reference about being late for an appointment. He returned with a mobile phone from his car and said he was going to record the conversation. He wanted to take the issue to court and I said that was his entitlement. 'I saw Mr Priest in the constable's personal space and he appeared to be waving his arms, very close to his face. He wouldn't let him speak and was shouting over him. 'He told him he earned £80,000 a year so he can afford the ticket and he was moving to Qatar for two or three months, so it didn't matter if he got any points.' Priest who was cleared of stamping on a policeman's hat during the incident denied wrongdoing and said: 'I've never heard of a kids' court - it sounds ridiculous. I'm not being ostracised by children.' But district judge Pam Baldwin told him: 'Your shouting and aggressive behaviour caused the children distress. I've no doubt these incidents are frustrating but you went beyond a legitimate expression of frustration.'","Andrew Priest, 39, did a wheelspin into the primary school car park .

We wish to make clear that a previous version of this article contained inaccuracies. We incorrectly reported that the incident took place in November 2012 rather than July 2012 and it did not take place during “Road Safety week”.  Mr Priest disputes the claim he lives in a luxury £300k flat and. Mr Priest has asked us to clarify that he is not a telecoms boss.  He has asked us to clarify that he didn’t say to the Police Community Support Officer that “It was a f***ing joke…” but does accept that he said “you’re PCSOs and not even proper pigs”.  Mr Priest has also pointed out that the children had gone inside by the time the regular constable had arrived and therefore the children were not upset by his aggressive outburst.
Mr Priest was convicted of a Section 5 Public Order offence section 5 (1) and (6) or the 1986 public order act fine £800, and £200 for a SP30 speeding offence, and cleared of two counts of criminal damage."

Her role at the club has been expanding in recent years and she has been attending board meetings in an unofficial capacity since 2010, as well as acting as a transfer broker. She has also been spotted at the training ground and speaks to senior players to canvass their opinion on key issues. Her appointment to the Chelsea board will not change the way things operate at Stamford Bridge, merely formalise the structure.

Iran unveiled its newest combat jet, a domestically manufactured fighter-bomber, that military officials claim can evade radar. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a ceremony today broadcast on state TV that building the Qaher-313, or Dominant-313, shows Iran's will to 'conquer scientific peaks'. The Qaher is one of several aircraft designs rolled out by the Iranian military since 2007. Scroll down for video . Unveiling the newest: Iran revealed today its latest combat jet, a domestically manufactured fighter-bomber that military officials claim can evade radar . Tehran has repeatedly claimed to have developed advanced military technologies in recent years but its claims cannot be independently verified because the country does not release technical details of its arsenals. The Islamic republic launched a self-sufficiency military program in the 1980s to compensate for a Western weapons embargo that banned export of military technology and equipment to Iran. Since 1992, Iran has produced its own tanks, armoured personnel carriers, missiles, torpedoes, drones and fighter planes. Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi said: ‘Qaher-313 is a fully indigenous aircraft designed and built by our aerospace experts. ‘This is a radar-evading plane that can fly at low altitude, carry weapons, engage enemy aircrafts and land at short airstrips.’ 'Conquer scientific peaks': President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled Iran's newest combat jet, a domestically manufactured fighter-bomber, officials claim can evade radar . Some reports however suggest Iran's program relies on equipment supplied by major international defence contractors incorporating parts made abroad or reverse-engineered technologies into its domestic designs. Still photos of the Qaher released by the official IRNA news agency and pictures on state TV show a single-seat jet. They described it as a fighter-bomber that can combat both other aircraft and ground targets. Iran's English-language state Press TV said Qaher was similar to the American-made F/A-18, an advanced fighter capable of dogfighting as well as penetrating enemy air defences to strike ground targets. Physically the aircraft resembles the F-5E/F Tiger II, a much older American design that Iran has had in its arsenal since it was supplied to the U.S.-allied regime of the Shah before Iran's 1979 revolution, Press TV reported. Advanced American fighter: State Press TV said the aircraft was similar to the American-made F/A-18 (pictured), which is capable of dogfighting as well as penetrating enemy air defences to strike ground targets . President Ahmadinejad told the inauguration ceremony in Tehran: ‘Development depends on our will. If we don't have a will, no one can take us there. ‘Once we imported cars and assembled them here. Now, we are at a point where we can design, build and get planes in the air.’ Iran unveiled what it said was its first domestically manufactured fighter jet, called Azarakhsh or Lightning, in 2007. In the same year, it claimed that Azarakhsh had reached industrial production stage. Saeqeh, or Thunder, was a follow-up aircraft derived from Azarakhsh. Iran unveiled its first squadron of Saeqeh fighter bombers in an air show in September 2010.

The tribal man, named as Ayyappan, decided he had to seek urgent medical help for his six-months pregnant wife Sudha after she developed a fever, her body swelled up and she began convulsing. When tribal medicine failed to work, and with the nearest doctor 25 miles away, the devoted husband decided that rather than leave his sick wife at home by herself while he sought help, he would carry her there on his back. The man carried his sick wife to the hospital where a scan showed their baby had died (file image) Ayyappan, who lives deep in the hilly Konni forests in Pathanamthitta district in Kerala, said: 'I had no other way but to carry her to Kokkathode, a town nearby. 'We started early in the morning when it was raining heavily, but I was more concerned about wild elephants.' They reached Kokkathode in the evening, and were then taken by jeep to Pathanamthitta District Hospital, and then Kottayam Medical College Hospital, where his wife saw a doctor and was scanned. Kunjamma Roy, head of gynaecology at the Kottayam Government Medical College Hospital, told The Hindu: 'The patient was six months pregnant and had high blood pressure.

The couple trekked through Indian hills for a day, avoiding dangerous wild elephants on their way to seek help . The husband said he feared coming across an elephant, such as this one pictured in his local town Konni, as he walked down through the hills . The devastated young woman, who had suffered complications as a result of severe malnutrition that had also affected her kidneys, had a normal delivery and is now recovering in hospital, Dr Roy said. He said that while the couple' unborn child had died, the husband's actions had saved his wife's life.

Sonny Carver, 11, has been removed from school by his mother, Sarah (both pictured) after she claims he was bullied for two years . A mother has removed her 11-year-old son from school after she claims he was subjected to a two-year campaign of bullying because he has ginger hair. Sarah Carver has called in police over the treatment she claims Year Six pupil Sonny has suffered because of his hair colour. She said her son had regularly returned home from Cobholm Primary in Great Yarmouth, with scratches and bruises and cruel classmates called him ‘ginger nut’ and ‘a skank’. One day she said he returned with a black eye and on another occasion had to wear his PE shorts after being dragged through a puddle, soaking his school uniform. The final straw came last month when she said Sonny was attacked on his way home from school and a member of the public had to step in to save him. He was pinned against a wall and punched and a bicycle was ridden over his feet. Worried Ms Carver, who had first alerted police last November, called them again after the incident. She had already taken Sonny to a GP who told her he was ‘depressed’ because of what he had been suffering. She has now moved him out the school and accused staff of failing to tackle the bullying. Ms Carver, 38, a medical lab technician, said: 'As a parent you put your trust in the teachers when you send your children to school. You expect them to be looked after. 'It’s outrageous that Sonny had to leave his friends behind and move to a different school and the boys that attacked him were not expelled or suspended even for just one day. 'The school have handled this so badly. I don’t want it to happen to another child.' Cobholm Primary School in Great Yarmouth where it is claimed Sonny Carver was bullied. The school said it does not tolerate bullying and has a very strong anti-bullying policy . Ms Carver, a mother-of-three, added: 'I don’t know why the bullies chose to target Sonny. 'They would call him a skank and ginger nut because of his hair colour - it was outrageous. 'His hair’s not bright orange, it is more of a strawberry blonde. 'I wonder whether it was because we didn’t live close to the school so maybe they saw Sonny as an outsider. 'But whatever their twisted reasons were there’s no excuse. 'I was so worried about him I took him to the GP and the doctor said he was depressed because of bullying. An 11-year-old boy should not be made to feel depressed. At first the worried parent urged her boy not to take any notice and ignore the playground yobs. But when Sonny was pinned up against the wall and punched on his way home Ms Carver called in the police . 'No child should have to go through what he’s been through, especially when it’s affecting his mental state. 'I cannot bear to imagine what Sonny was going through being pinned up against a wall. He was helpless. 'I’m so grateful to the member of public who got out and helped him and called the school.' Sonny has now moved to Glebeland Community Primary School in Toft Monks near Beccles, Suffolk, where he started after half term. His mother said: 'Sonny is really enjoying his new school. It is so lovely to see him with a smile on his face. 'We’re lucky that his new school has worked out and I am thankful as it could have been worse.' Norfolk police said they were investigating the reported attack on Sonny on May 23 and a spokesman confirmed he was left with reddening to his face and arm. Julie Risby, head at Cobholm Primary School, said: 'We do not tolerate bullying in our school and have a very strong anti-bullying policy. 'Staff are committed to the principle that bullying, in any form, is unacceptable and we investigate fully every reported incidence or allegation of bullying, as has happened in this case. 'We understand a complaint has been made to police following an alleged incident outside of school, and we are co-operating fully with their investigation.' Director of bullying charity Kidscape Claude Knight said: 'Schools are often in denial that they have a bullying problem. '""Your child is over-sensitive"", ""You are an over-protective parent"", ""It’s just children being children"", ""‘We can’t do anything unless we actually see it happening"" are a few of the excuses used to avoid addressing the problem. 'The school has a duty of care to keep children safe ‘in loco parentis’, they should have an anti-bullying policy by law and parents have a right to ask for a copy, to find out how the bullying will be resolved.'","Sarah Carver has even called in police over alleged attacks on son Sonny .

British-Australian artist Peter Andre has been appointed cultural ambassador to the capital of Malta, leaving its population in uproar. Residents of the Mediterranean island nation are furious with Valletta city councillors who voted unanimously to appoint the Mysterious Girl singer, despite the fact that he has no links to Malta. More than 1,000 Maltese have signed a petition to oust the 39-year-old artist from his role, which includes the responsibility to promote the rich history and art of the 16th century city. The pop singer has Mediterranean family ties through his Greek-Cypriot background, but Mr Andre was born in London, grew up in Australia and has never lived in Malta. The . appointment was branded ‘100 times worse’ than the honorary citizenship . given to Spanish singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias, in 2008. The . petition reads: ‘Peter Andre should be the last person to carry such a . prestigious and important title. 'Valletta shall only be handled with . honour.’ Peter Andre won ‘Best International Male’ at the Malta Music Awards last week where he also performed as headline act. Despite having been appointed Valletta's cultural ambassador the very same day, Mr Andre made no mention of this on stage . 'We wanted a celebrity fond of Valletta,' Mayor Alexei Dingli told The Sun, defending the city council's vote. Mr . Dingli also claim the city will feature in Peter Andre’s ITV show and . said that Mr Andre had ‘promised to come again this summer where we will . be discussing potential future collaborations.'

A Scottish island, thought to have inspired the cult horror film The Wicker Man, is on the market for £2.5million. Described as a ‘flourishing tourist enterprise and superb family residence’, Tanera Mor is the only inhabited island in the Summer Isles off Scotland’s west coast. Lizzie and Richard Williams took over its 800 unspoilt acres from Mrs Williams' family in 2010 and are allowed to issue stamps from their own post office. With six apartments to let it is also ideal for the holidaymaker who really wants to get away from it all. Just don’t bring your car – there are no roads. Tanera Mor is an 800-acre Scottish island that has been put on the market for £2.5million . Mrs Williams said: ‘After many years of calling Tanera home it is time for someone else to have the privilege of looking after this amazing place. 'We greatly appreciate the effort made by . the local community to consider the opportunity of taking on . Tanera and we fully understand their reasons for deciding not to. 'We . hope that whoever owns the island in the future will enjoy the same warm . and co-operative relationship with the community that we have for the . past 17 years.' Film critics say the pagan cult isle of Summerisle, featured in the 1973 movie starring Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee, is set in the archipelago. Residents on the nearby mainland at Achiltibuie in Wester Ross had been in talks with the island’s owners about a community buyout that could have seen a number of people move on to the isle. But a public meeting in February decided that the buyout was just too much for them to take on. In 1881 there were nearly 200 people living on the island but now there are just two, Lizzie and Richard Williams . The island is thought to be the inspiration for the setting of the cult 70s horror film The Wicker Man . There are no roads on the island but it has a Post Office and issues its own postage stamps . Local interest group Coigach Community Development Company had been given the first opportunity to buy the island on behalf of residents. In 1881, there were no fewer than 118 people living on Tanera Mor, all of whom had left by 1931. Mrs Williams' family the Wilders bought the island in 1996 after selling their dairy farm in Wiltshire. Bill and Jean Wilder passed the title of Tanera Mor on to their three offspring - Jack, Harry and Lizzie - in 2010. Now that all three siblings have their own young families they took the decision to put it on the open market. The 1973 film The Wicker Man starred Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland . The principal house - The Old School House - boasts breathtaking views over the magnificent mountains of the mainland. Over the past 15 years the Wilder family have undertaken a woodland regeneration project, planting over 164,000 native trees. This combined with the use of selective livestock grazing has encouraged wildlife to thrive. The established holiday letting business, comprising six properties - with the potential to add a further two properties - has been expanded in recent years to include residential courses and a Royal Yachting Association-recognised sailing school in the summer. The cafe and Post Office operate from a former boathouse and are open for seasonal daily visits by boat. John Bound, of selling agents CKD Galbraith, said: 'The chance to own your own Scottish island is extremely rare and with Tanera Mor’s thriving tourist enterprise coupled with being a truly spectacular place to live, we expect to receive a lot of interest as it goes on the open market. 'With on-going support and commitment from the local Coigach community, Tanera Mrr offers a truly fantastic prospect for interested parties who will very much have the island’s heritage and sustainability at heart as well as a fantastic life style.'","Unspoilt 800-acre isle has no roads but includes six popular holiday lets .

Isabella Blow and Alexander McQueen were two of the most influential fashion figures of the 20th century. Stylist and magazine editor Blow was the embodiment of the English eccentric who discovered the breathtakingly talented Alexander McQueen at his Central Saint Martins graduate fashion show. He was the enfant terrible of the fashion world whose talent for design has been lauded across the globe. However, both of their lives were marred by tragedy, depression and unhappiness, leading to their untimely suicides. Great loss: The fashion world mourned the loss . of Blow after she took her own life in 2007 and then in February 2010 we . lost a true icon in the form of avant-garde and quintessentially quirky . British designer Alexander McQueen . Iconic piece: One of the most historically important dresses that Alexander McQueen made for his close friend and collaborator, the late Isabella Blow in 2000 is set to go up for auction . The fashion world mourned the loss of Blow after she took her own life in 2007. Then in February 2010 we lost a true icon in the form of avant-garde and quintessentially quirky British designer Alexander McQueen. Years before, in 1992, Blow famously bought McQueen's entire graduate collection for £5,000, and went on to become a close friend and ardent supporter of his work and career. And now, one of the most historically important dresses that Alexander McQueen made for his close friend and collaborator in 2000 is set to go up for auction. The design is a variation taken from his Eshu collection of Autumn/Winter 2000-2001, which was inspired by the ancient Yoruba people of Benin and Nigeria; Eshu being both a goddess and messenger of death. Intricate: The design is a variation taken from his Eshu collection of Autumn/Winter 2000-2001, which was inspired by the ancient Yoruba people of Benin and Nigeria . The gown combines tribal elements of beadwork and animal hair with a high fashion twist. The gown, which is expected to fetch between £25,000-35,000, features acid green beads and a broad dark brown horse hair fringe at the hem. Blow insisted that the dress be made strapless for her, which albeit flattering, made it rather impractical to wear as the weight of the beads produces a strong gravitational pull and she later gave the dress to her assistant. Firm fan: Blow famously bought McQueen's entire graduate collection for £5,000, and went on to become a close friend and ardent supporter of his work and career . This exquisite and important McQueen gown is a rarity (the bulk of her wardrobe having been acquired after her death by her close friend Daphne Guinness). Estimates in the auction start at a few hundred pounds up to tens of thousands and also includes a plethora of Hermès Birkin and Kelly bags in different colours and skins. Blow started her 30 year career . auspiciously as an assistant to Anna Wintour at US Vogue. Even then, she . steered clear of the conventional. At . Blow's memorial service, Wintour said that when Blow worked for Vogue . she did everything fabulously, even cleaning Wintour's desk with Perrier . water and Chanel perfume. In the Nineties, Blow was Fashion Director of The Sunday Times, after which she moved to Tatler, again as Fashion Director. She discovered models Sophie Dahl and Stella Tenant, and worked with major photographers like Steven Meisel and David LaChapelle. She revelled in shocking people with daring outfits: she once wore a fish-smelling, crystal-encrusted lobster on her head to a fashion show, and Lady Gaga has been cited as a modern-day Blow. But she began to suffer from depression, and in 2007, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ovarian cancer, Blow committed suicide aged 48. McQueen received press attention after her suicide with rumours . circulating that there was a rift between the pair at the . time of her death, focusing on McQueen's under-appreciation of Blow. In response to these rumours, McQueen told W magazine: 'It's so much b******. These people just don't know what they're . talking about. 'They don't know me. They don't know my relationship with . Isabella. It's complete b*******. People can talk; you can ask her . sisters ... That part of the industry, they should stay away from my . life, or mine and Isabella's life. 'What I had with Isabella was . completely dissociated from fashion, beyond fashion.' From humble East-end beginnings, McQueen catapulted through life from the 21st floor of a council flat as an obstinate 16-year old embroider (one who stitched the phrase ‘I am a c***’ on a jacket designed for Prince Charles) to an inexorable household name. Describing his childhood as ‘troubled’, McQueen came out as gay at the age of 18 armed with a reputable foul mouth and offensive humor, often incorporating themes such as death, masochism and violence into his fantastically original collections. He is also known for having worked as chief designer at Givenchy from 1996 to 2001 and for founding his own Alexander McQueen label. He hanged himself in February 2010.","Blow is credited with discovering McQueen when he was a fashion student .

Offering tests to men in their late forties could reduce prostate cancer deaths by half, say experts. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening is used to detect prostate cancer, but remains controversial, because it became widespread long before there was substantial evidence to prove its value. It can also be unreliable, giving false positive results which can cause anxiety and result in unnecessary treatment. Prostate cancer can be a source of anxiety for middle aged and older men . Until now, the most recent study found that prostate cancer screening  reduced deaths by 20 per cent. But, with this came a high rates of unnecessary treatment. Statistics showed that to save one life, nearly 50 cases needed to be treated. In 2010, when the UK National Screening Committee in England last . reviewed medical data, it decided that a national screening programme should not be introduced. But now Swedish research, published in the BMJ, has found that if screening was offered to men aged between 45 and 49, it would predict nearly half of all cases. Researchers reviewed a study carried out between 1974 and 1984 involving 21,277 Swedish men aged between 27 and 52. All the men had donated blood samples at the start of the study. The researchers used these stored samples to run PSA tests. Research has shown that screening men aged between 45 and 49 for prostate cancer (pictured) could save many lives . They then checked to see if the PSA reading predicted whether or not they developed prostate cancer. The researchers then used these results to work out the best age at which men should be screened. They found that screening under the age of 45 detected too few deadly cancers. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK . More than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Symptoms include a difficulty passing urine, a desire to frequently pass urine or needing to rush to the toilet. PSA is a protein produced by both normal and cancerous prostate cells . But a high level of PSA can be a sign of cancer . A PSA reading higher than four, but less than 10 is usually due to a benign enlarged prostate . A reading higher than 10 may also just be a a symptoms of benign prostate disease . The higher the level of PSA, the more likely it is to be cancer . And delaying screening until after age 50 missed too many. Screening between the ages of 45 and 49 spotted 44 per cent of the cancers that became deadly. In the study, 1,369 of the men had prostate cancer, 241 had advanced disease and 162 died from it. The study stated that all men should be offered a PSA test in their mid-to-late 40s. They advised that those with a high PSA reading should return for surveillance, checks and treatment if necessary. Those with normal results could wait another five to ten years for their next PSA test. The study said: ‘At least half of all men can be identified as being at low risk and probably need no more than three PSA tests in a lifetime.' 'This is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis,' they say. Public Health England review evidence for screening every three years to ensure that the programmes offered by the NHS are based on the most up-to-date information available. Prostate Cancer UK said more research efforts should be channelled into finding a better screening test for the disease.","Almost 50% of deaths can be predicted before age 50 .

Rupert Murdoch is considering plans to launch a summer football 'super league' featuring Europe’s top clubs to be played in cities from Shanghai to Los Angeles. Leading Premier League clubs, likely to include Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal, would be invited to take part in the tournament, competing with sides including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The plan would see 16 teams take part in the competition, which would run for 10 years and start as early as 2015, during the close season period when teams usually go on tour and play exhibition matches. According to the Guardian newspaper, matches would be aired on Sky and Mr Murdoch's other broadcaster's around the world.

Over half . of the clubs in the English Premiership are in foreign hands and five . are owned by Americans including Manchester United, Liverpool and . Arsenal.

Hallyday, 69, was terrified and 'ran away' from the legendary singer, he said in a book of interviews published yesterday. 'I was sitting beside her and, in the . middle of the meal, I felt her hand climbing up my thigh,' recalled Hallyday, who was just 16 or 17 to her 44 years.

'I was almost a virgin at the time. I couldn’t see myself in bed with her. As far as I was concerned, she was an old woman.' Dans Mes Yeux (In My Eyes) - a book of interviews with novelist Amanda Sthers - does not say when the encounter happened. However, it appears to have been 1960, the year Hallyday released his debut record after bursting on to the scene as the first successful French rock ’n’ roll performer. His 17th birthday was in June, while Piaf would have been 44. 'Piaf used to come and see me singing every night,' he added, according to The Independent. 'I was flattered but never at ease with her.' Toyboys: Piaf, left with her husband Theo Sarapo, was known for liking younger men, but her encounter with Hallyday, right aged 66, has never before been revealed . Hallyday is now a French icon, but at the time, he was being attacked in the national media as a corrupter of youth. At the start of 1960, Piaf was the undisputed queen of 'la chanson française' but down on her luck after car crashes, drug abuse and failed love affairs. She made an impressive comeback that year with Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien, but died just two years later. Piaf is known for preferring younger men but this is the first time that her attempt to seduce teenage Hallyday has been revealed. In an interview with Le Parisien newspaper, Hallyday described the moment differently, calling it 'tender' and putting his reticence down to shyness. 'I was a minor at the time,' he said. 'I have never spoken about it before but it was rather a tender moment. I was sick with shyness and she overawed me.

Thomson became the first UK airline to take delivery of the new ultra-green Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane today. After years of production delays and a grounding earlier this year on safety concerns, the plane touched down at Manchester Airport this morning. Thomson had hoped to start flying the fuel-efficient, 290-passenger Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the beginning of this month. Touchdown: The Thomson-liveried 787 Dreamliner arrives at Manchester Airport today as the airline take delivery of their new plane . Arrival: Another aeroplane takes off in the background at the 787 Dreamliner, the first to be delivered to a UK airline, taxis on arrival at Manchester Airport . Arrival: The UK's first registered and operated Boeing 787 Dreamliner sits on the tarmac at Manchester Airport . Disembarking: The Thomson plane will fly with commercial passengers for the first time on July 8 . Arrival: Thomson Managing Director Chris Browne waves from the steps of the aeroplane after the 787 arrived in Manchester today . But earlier this year battery smoke emanating from two Dreamliner planes operated by Japanese carriers led to a grounding of the world's 787 fleet and a halt to all deliveries. It was the first time since 1979 that every plane of a particular type was ordered to stay out of the air for safety reasons. This meant Thomson had to scrap its Dreamliner flights planned for May and June. With the plane given the go-ahead to take to the air again, Thomson will begin Dreamliner flights on July 8. Initially, Thomson is operating the state-of-the-art aircraft from Gatwick, Manchester, East Midlands and Glasgow airports to Orlando in Florida and to Cancun in Mexico. Crowd: People watch from the viewing area as the new plane arrives in the UK for the first time.

Length: 186 feet. Height: 56 feet. Cruise speed: Mach 0.85, about 650 mph. Cargo volume: 4,400 cubic feet. Maximum takeoff weight: 502,500 pounds. List price: $193.5 million (£120million), although airlines often negotiate discounts. Components: 50 per cent carbon fiber, 20 per cent aluminum, 15 per cent titanium, 10 per cent steel, 5 per cent other. Engines: Rolls Royce or General Electric. Next winter, Thomson will fly the Dreamliner direct to Phuket in Thailand and from next summer it will use the plane for flights to Mauritius and to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Boeing had hoped that the plane would go into commercial service around 2008 but this date continually slipped as production difficulties dogged the plane. It was not until October 2011 that Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways operated the first Boeing 787 commercial flight. Features include a state-of-the-art . flight deck, with larger screens and electronic checks lists and . ‘smooth-wing technology' to aid aerodynamics and wing efficiency. The cabin has dimmable windows, which are 30 per cent larger than similar-sized planes and operated using touch-button controls. A filtration process removes odours, . bacteria and viruses from the air inside, helping to reduce dizziness, . headaches, eye irritation and dryness. The 787's cabin is pressurized to a . maximum level of 6,000 feet - 2,000 feet lower than most other aircraft - . and because passengers absorb 8 per cent more oxygen into the blood at . this altitude this also reduce headaches, dizziness and fatigue. Thomson Airways managing director . Chris Browne said today: 'After much anticipation, we are very excited . to welcome the 787 Dreamliner to our fleet and as the first airline in . the UK to take delivery we hope our customers will enjoy the unique . experience of this revolutionary aircraft.' High interest: The 290-seat plane is more fuel efficient than its predecessors, and more comfortable for passengers . Up close: The plane was originally due to be delivered to Thomson around a month ago, but it was delayed as the 787 fleet was grounded . Ready for first proper take off: With the plane given the go-ahead to take to the air again, Thomson will begin Dreamliner flights on July 8 . Thomson is taking delivery of eight Boeing 787 Dreamliners in total, up to May 2015. British Airways is due to receive the first four of 24 Dreamliners this year, while Virgin Atlantic will get the first of its 16 in September next year. Meanwhile, Thomson's parent company, Tui Travel, announced a commitment today to purchase 60 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with the ability to purchase up to a further 90. The multibillion-pound deal is subject to shareholder approval, with the delivery of the aircraft scheduled to start in January 2018 and run for five years. The Dreamliner has been plagued by problems since its launch in 2008, even before two aircraft developed battery problems. Fanatics: A whole line of people take pictures of the aeroplane landing at Manchester Airport . Interest: The plane arrived at Manchester Airport at around 11am this morning . In January, All Nippon Airlines was forced to cancel a domestic flight to Tokyo after a computer wrongly indicated a problem with the 787's brakes. The day before, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport. And a day before that, another Dreamliner caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston when a battery in the jet's auxiliary power system overheated. Nobody was hurt as passengers and crew had already disembarked. But those were not the only issues that have blemished the much-vaunted launch of air travel's latest addition. Last December United Airlines' brand-new Dreamliner, carrying 174 passengers and 10 crew, was forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans due to a mechanical issue. In the same month, Qatar Airways grounded one of its Dreamliners after several similar faults caused electrical problems. In July last year, debris from a brand-new Dreamliner's engine sparked a fire at a South Carolina airport forcing emergency crews to close the Charleston International Airport for more than an hour. And an incident in February 2012 saw Boeing report signs of 'delamination' occurring on a support structure in the Dreamliner's rear fuselage, launching an inspection.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:35 EST, 24 October 2011 . One of the world's most influential bankers said today that the Euro currency has proved 'a great success' despite the debt problems gripping some members of the eurozone. The comments were made by the head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet who was speaking with Poland's central bank head Marek Belka at a conference organized by the National Bank of Poland. Mr Trichet said: 'The euro as a currency is a great success indeed.' Together: The President of Poland Bronislaw Komorowski, right, hands over a decoration to head of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet, left, during today's conference . He said it remains a credible currency because 'it is backed by remarkable fundamentals.' Despite Mr Trichet's claims, European leaders were today battling to save the single currency from meltdown as the debt crisis threatened to engulf major economies such as France. The Continent’s top brass kicked off a weekend of talks in Brussels – but admitted that a comprehensive deal to shore up the euro will not be reached. It came as an international ratings agency warned that a double-dip recession in the region would see France stripped of its coveted AAA credit score. Positive: The head of the National Bank of Poland Marek Belka. He said the country is 'strongly committed' to joining the euro . Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal would also be rocked by further downgrades, according to Standard & Poor’s. Europe would have to raise hundreds of billions of euros to protect the region’s banks and prop up debt-ridden countries, the S&P report said. It underlined the scale of the task facing European leaders this weekend. But the summit in Brussels has been thrown into disarray by a row between France and Germany – Europe’s two biggest economic powers – over how to fight the debt crisis. Leaders will now hold a second meeting on Wednesday to thrash out the toughest issues after conceding that no deal will be reached this weekend. But the problems currently engulfing the euro are not putting Poland off joining the currency. Mr Belka - Poland's Central Bank head - echoed Mr Trichet's optimism and said his country remains 'strongly committed' to adopting the euro currency - though he said it wouldn't be wise to set a specific target date yet. Unhappy: Thousand of protesters against spending cuts and tax hikes gather outside the Greek Parliament in Athens yesterday. It was the second day of a general strike that's seen the country paralysed . He added that it was impossible to ignore the debt crisis gripping the eurozone. Despite his positive attitude to the euro, Mr Belka said 'it wouldn't be wise . to determine a specific date' but stressed Poland must still prepare . itself for the eventual change. Mr Trichet is retiring, with Bank of Italy chief Mario Draghi becoming the new head of the European Central Bank on November 1.","Polish bank chief says his country remains 'strongly committed' to joining the euro .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:04 EST, 13 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:18 EST, 14 June 2013 . ‘Happy Birthday to You’ has been performed around the world in tribute to everyone from toddlers to centenarians for nearly 120 years, but few people know that the ubiquitous song is owned by a private company. Now, the most famous ditty in the English language has found itself in the middle of a legal battle after a film production company filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the copyright protecting the song. The proposed class action asks a federal court to declare the song to be in the public domain and that Warner/Chappel Music Inc, the music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, return ‘millions of dollars of unlawful licensing fees’ it has collected for reproductions and public performances of the song. Songwriters: The simple four-line ditty was written in 1893 by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teachers . ‘More than 120 years after the melody . to which the simple lyrics of “Happy Birthday to You” is set was first . published, defendant Warner/Chappell boldly, but wrongfully and . unlawfully, insists that it owns the copyright to “Happy Birthday to . You,”’ the lawsuit said. A representative of Warner/Chappell was not immediately available to comment on the lawsuit. The . plaintiff is Good Morning To You Productions Corp, a New York company . that says it is making a documentary about the song. Facing a penalty of . $150,000 if it used ‘Happy Birthday’ without permission, the company . said it paid a $1,500 licensing fee in March. Warner/Chappell . claims exclusive copyright to what Guinness World Records has called . the most famous song in the English language. According to the lawsuit, . the company has collected at least $2million annually in licensing fees. Whenever . 'Happy Birthday to You' is being sung for profit, as in movies, . television shows and concerts, the performers or producers are required . to pay licensing fees, or face a copyright infringement lawsuit. Mystery: The Hill sisters called their tune 'Good Morning to All,' but sometime after its publication, someone had changed it to 'Happy Birthday to You' But few people know that under . copyright law, singing the song in any public venue constitutes a . performance, which is why most restaurants have their waiting staff sing . alternative songs when celebrating patrons' birthday to avoid paying . royalties. ‘If you want to . sing it at your home at a birthday party you don't have to pay anything, . because that is a private performance,’ said George Washington . University School of Law professor Robert Brauneis. ’But if you want to . use it in a television show, a movie, or a television commercial, you'll . pay anywhere from $5,000 to $30,000 for those rights.’ Brauneis, who wrote a 68-page article about the song, told ABC in . 2008 that one of the weaknesses of the copyright case is the murky . authorship of the 'Happy Birthday' song. The other is the fact that the . song's owner failed to properly renew the copyright on the standard . version of the ditty in the 1960s, thus opening the door on a legal . challenge. Free 'Happy Birthday!': A lawsuit filed by a production company seeks to prove that the 1893 song 'Happy Birthday to You' should be in the public domain . The song was first published in 1893 as ‘Good Morning to All.’ The simple four-line ditty was written by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teachers. Patty was the one who wrote the . lyrics, and her older sister, Mildred, came up with the tune. Both women . worked as teachers at the time. The Hills' simple tune with a range . of six notes and an average running time of 12 seconds was first . published in 1893 as part of the songbook Song Stories for the . Kindergarten. Over the next 30 years, the song had . evolved, first turning into a greeting from students to their teachers. Later it changed from 'Good Morning to All' to 'Good Morning to You,' with the name of the person the song was being performed for inserted in . the third line. Long history: The song was first published in 1893 as 'Good Morning to All,' and was written by sisters Patty and Mildred Hill. The copyright to the ditty eventually came to be owned by Warner/Chappel Music Inc . It remains a mystery when exactly the . classroom tune transformed into a birthday song, and who was . responsible for changing the Hills' lyrics. It is generally believed . that the sisters were not the ones who altered the song. 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President:' Hollywood sex symbol Marilyn Monroe famously performed a sultry rendition of the 'Happy Birthday' song to President John F. Kennedy in 1962 . A third Hill sister, Jessica, took . 'Happy Birthday' to Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy Co., which . officially released and copyrighted the work in 1935. Some years later, . the publishing house was bought out by New York accountant John . Sengstack, who renamed it Birch Tree Ltd. Birch Tree retained the copyright on . the song until 1988, when Warner/Chappell, the world's largest music . publisher, purchased the company for $25million. According to Billboard.com, the song has been considered as protected by copyright because the lyrics appeared in a songbook in 1924 and a piano arrangement for it was released in 1935. A year after the publication of the songbook titled Song Stories for the Kindergarten containing the ditty, a copyright application was filed. Under a revised copyright law, works created after 1923 are guarantee 95 years of protection. Brauneis, the George Washington University Law School, professor, said he searched nationwide for evidence of a copyright for a combination of the melody for ‘Good Morning to All’ with the lyrics for ‘Happy Birthday to You’ for an article published in 2009 but did not find any. ‘I believe this song is in the public domain and therefore it is not owned by anyone,’ he told the New York Times Thursday. Investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. bought Warner Music Group from Time Warner Inc in 2004 and sold it to its current owner, privately held Access Industries Inc, in 2011. If the film production company's lawsuit fails, 'Happy Birthday to You' will remain under copyright protection until 2030. 'Happy Birthday to You' began its life in 1893 under a different title, 'Good Morning to All.' The simple four-line ditty was written by Mildred and Patty Hill, two sisters from Louisville, Kentucky, and it was intended as a musical greeting performed in school by teacher. Patty Hill, the younger of two siblings, was a nursery school and kindergarten teacher who wrote the lyrics. She would later go on to create the popular toy Patty Hill blocks. Mildred Hill, who came up with the tune, also started her career in the classroom, but she later became a composer, organist and music scholar specializing in Negro spirituals. The Hills' simple tune with a range of six notes and an average running time of 12 seconds was first published in 1893 as part of the songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten. Over the next 30 years, the song had evolved, first turning into a greeting from students to their teachers. Later it changed from 'Good Morning to All' to 'Good Morning to You,' with the name of the person the song was being performed for inserted in the third line. It remains a mystery when exactly the classroom tune transformed into a birthday song, and who was responsible for changing the Hills' lyrics. It is generally believed that the sisters were not the ones who altered the song. In 1924, 'Happy Birthday to You' appeared in a songbook edited by Robert H. Coleman. By mid-1930s, the ditty had become enormously popular, appearing in several films and a Broadway show. The celebratory song was even used for Western Union's first ever singling telegram. When the ubiquitous melody, which most people assumed was in the public domain, appeared uncredited in Irving Berlin's musical As Thousands Cheer, Patty and Mildred's sister, Jessica Hill, filed a lawsuit against the producers and managed to obtain a copyright for her sisters by demonstrating the link between their classroom tune and the popular birthday song. Jessica Hill took 'Happy Birthday' to Chicago publisher Clayton F. Summy Co., which officially released and copyrighted the work in 1935. Some years later, the publishing house was bought out by New York accountant John Sengstack, who renamed it Birch Tree Ltd. Birch Tree retained the copyright on the song until 1988, when Warner/Chappell, the world's largest music publisher, purchased the company for $25million. Warner/Chappell has been earning about $2million annually in royalties from the song, with the proceeds divided between the music publisher and the Hill Foundation, which has been established after the passing of the sisters. Both Mildred and Patty died unmarried and childless, and their stake in the song had passed to their nephew, Andrew Hill, who has since died as well.

On the run: Sergei Polonsky has been posting pictures of himself on Twitter since he skipped bail . A missing businessman who should be the star witness in a trial featuring media tycoon Alexander Lebedev has been put on Russia’s ‘wanted’ list after being charged in connection with a £121 million fraud and theft case. Sergei Polonsky is accused of embezzling millions in downpayments from potential residents of a luxury residential development in Moscow. Polonsky, who is believed to be hiding in Israel, failed to appear before police investigators last week in Moscow. His absence is now set to trigger a hunt by Interpol and demands for his extradition to Russia. The property mogul has apparently . been on the run after skipping bail following his arrest in Cambodia . over an allegation of assault. He . has since taunted investigators by tweeting a series of pictures of . himself in exotic places. One of the latest, posted on June 8, shows him . in a boat in what looks like a location in the Far East. The . fraud charges ‘have been brought in absentia through his lawyer’, . according to a spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry, who added . that Polonsky could be imprisoned for ten years if found guilty. Polonsky’s . arraignment in a major fraud case highlights the increasing sense of . fiasco over the trial of Lebedev, 53, whose family owns the Independent . newspapers and London Evening Standard. Lebedev, who also owns Russia’s only major independent investigative newspaper, is accused of hooliganism motivated by political hatred in hitting out at Polonsky during a confrontation on a TV talk show. Lebedev’s legal team has branded the Moscow trial a ‘farce’, yet it is due to continue on Friday. Many believe that the hooliganism charge, which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail, is part of a crackdown ordered by President Vladimir Putin on his enemies and critics. On trial: Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev, pictured at a court in Moscow, is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei Polonsky because of political hatred . Mr Putin is scheduled to arrive in Downing Street today for talks with David Cameron ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland. The . fraud and theft charges against Polonsky in Russia follow complaints . from people who bought apartments at his exclusive Kutuzovskaya Milya . development in Moscow. Detectives . from a special unit tasked with fighting organised crime and corruption . searched the homes of  the current and former top managers at . developers Potok 8, formerly called Mirax Group, a business linked to . Polonsky. An Interior Ministry spokesman said: . ‘Items and documents have been seized that provide evidence that the . claimants’ money was transferred to the accounts of organisations that . were not involved in the project.’ Attack: Mr Lebedev (left) lashed out at Sergei Polonsky (right) during a Russian TV debate in 2011. Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral . Mikhail Aleksandrov, head of the investigating unit, said: ‘Investigators are accusing Polonsky of fraud and theft both from legal entities and individuals. ‘Given the fact that he refused to show up at the investigation department, he will be put on the international wanted list in accordance with Russian laws. ‘He will be put on the Interpol wanted list if police fail to locate his whereabouts in Russia.’ Kong Radi, a lawyer acting for the fugitive tycoon in Cambodia, said recently that he had ‘no idea’ of Polonsky’s whereabouts and had not seen him since early April. Lebedev yesterday claimed the money Polonsky is accused of embezzling was diverted to projects in London, Switzerland and Turkey.","Sergei Polonsky accused of embezelling millions from residents buying into a luxury property development .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:31 EST, 8 May 2013 . Steve Ballmer is said to have risked it all on a new operating system for Microsoft, a gamble that may have cost the company's CEO dearly. In the face Apple and Samsung's success in the mobile and tablet computer market, Microsoft bet the farm when it introduced Windows 8, the operating system that Ballmer had heralded as the future. Debuting last year, Windows 8 was the nervous system of its new line of Surface tablet and smartphones. Betting it all: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer made a big gamble when he introduced Windows 8 in October . It was no secret that Ballmer was making a huge bet. When he introduced the operating system in October, a screen behind him read: 'Windows: All in.' But the gamble does not appear to have . paid off, as Microsoft 8 received less-than-stellar reviews and failed . to measure up to the hype and sales of Apple and Google devices. Critics, as well as some consumers, lambasted the technology giant over Windows 8, mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of Microsoft's trademark 'Start' button. Some have now called for Ballmer to quit or be fired. Joachim Kempin, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw the building of the Windows brand, told the BBC last month that he believes Ballmer 'doesn't have the vision' to be CEO. Any decision to oust Ballmer would have to come from his predecessor Bill Gates, who holds the largest stake in the company and personally selected Ballmer - his friend - to take over. On the chopping block? Ballmer's overhaul of the Windows operating system has led to some calls for him to be ousted . Decision: Any move to fire Ballmer would have to come from his predecessor Bill Gates, who holds the majority stock in the company and personally selected Ballmer to take over . While Microsoft has experienced growth in recent years, any success is eclipsed by Apple, which unveiled the iPad Mini at about the same time as Windows 8. Some reviewers liked the way Windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of . relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years. But others say it's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed . to the older versions, particularly when they switch to desktop mode . and don't see the familiar 'start' button and menu. Struck by the flurry of complaints, Microsoft is giving Windows 8 a makeover, known as Windows Blue. Overshadowed: Microsoft's success has been eclipsed by Apple's tablets and smart phones, as well as other devices powered by Google . Tami Reller, who serves as the marketing and financial chief for Microsoft's Windows business, announced a retreat, admitting that the software had defeated many users. She said; 'The learning curve is definitely real and we need to address it.' The company, which is based in . Redmond, Washington, says more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses have . been sold so far, up from about 60 million licenses in January. The licensing volume 'is in the same . general ballpark,' as Microsoft's previous operating system - Windows 7 - . at a similar juncture of its sales cycle, according to Ms Reller. In an interview, Ms Reller said . Microsoft still realized changes need to be made to make Windows 8 . easier to navigate and capable of taking full advantage of technology . improvements that have come out since October. Ms Reller said: 'Are there things . that we can do to improve the experience? Absolutely. There is a . learning curve [to Windows 8] and we can work to address that.' Blue also might make it easier to find . a set of controls - known as 'charms' in Windows 8's parlance - that . currently must be pulled out from the right side of a display screen. Besides responding to customer . feedback, Blue also will make Windows 8 better suited for smaller, less . expensive tablets with 7- and 8-inch display screens, Ms Reller said. The tune-up announced on Tuesday won't be released to consumers and businesses until later this year. One leading research firm, International Data Corp., says Windows 8 contributed to a 14 per cent decline in worldwide PC sales during the first three months of the year - the biggest year-over-year drop ever. Meanwhile, sales of smartphones and tablet computers are booming. The biggest beneficiaries have been Apple Inc., the maker of the iPhone and iPad, and Samsung Electronics Co., which sells the most devices running on Google Inc.'s Android software. Changes: Microsoft has now announced an overhaul to Windows 8, which has been dubbed 'Blue' Google is also benefiting from Android's popularity through increased traffic to its services, creating more opportunities for the company to display ads. By contrast, leading PC makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., which primarily sell Windows-powered machines, have been mired in a financial funk that has battered their stocks and raised questions about their futures. For now, Microsoft isn't saying what kind of changes will be introduced with the release of Blue, which the company plans to anoint with a different name when the update is available. Microsoft also isn't saying whether it will charge existing owners of Windows 8 devices to get the fixes in Blue. The company plans to release Blue in time for the holiday season. Ms Reller said more details about Blue will be released before Microsoft holds a developers conference in San Francisco in late June. Success: The biggest beneficiaries in the tablet and smartphone boom have been Apple, the maker of the iPhone and iPad, and Samsung, which sells the most devices running on Google's Android software . Some of Blue's features are expected to be previewed at that conference. 'I view this as a relaunch of Windows 8, finally giving everyone a fully baked version,' said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead. 'It has been a very rough road for Microsoft so far.' If Blue is meant to make people more comfortable, the changes may incorporate more of the elements from earlier versions of Windows. But one thing that Blue won't fix: the relatively small selection of mobile applications tailored for Windows 8. Ms Reller said the Windows 8 store now has more than 60,000 apps. By contrast, there are more than 800,000 apps available for Apple's mobile's devices and nearly that many for Android devices, too. In one of the most glaring omissions on Windows 8, Facebook Inc. still hasn't designed an app to make its online social network more accessible on that system. Facebook has about 750 million mobile users. Microsoft's decision to tweak Windows 8 so soon after its much-ballyhooed release may reinforce perceptions that the product is the company's biggest flop since the Zune - the company's answer to the iPod. Investors still believe Windows 8 will . pay off for Microsoft, which gets more than half of its revenue from the . sale of Windows operating systems and various software programs and . services. The company's stock slipped 40 cents to $33.35 in Tuesday's afternoon trading, leaving the shares with a 20 per cent gain since Windows 8 went on sale. That outstrips the 15 per cent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the same stretch.","Microsoft CEO said to have bet it all on Windows 8, which has received poor reviews and is bested by Apple and Google products .

Ed Miliband brushed off Labour's shock defeat in the Bradford West by-election by claiming the party is set for a return to power at the next general election. His party suffered a humiliating blow when Respect's George Galloway overturned a 5,000 Labour majority to storm home with a lead of more than 10,000 votes on Thursday. But in an interview with The Observer, Mr Miliband said that it was David Cameron and the Tories who were on the back foot after a week in which they were pilloried for the Budget and for sparking panic buying of petrol. Rivals: Ed Miliband, left, has brushed off his party's shock by-election defeat by claiming Labour can oust David Cameron, right, from power in 2015 . His comments were reinforced by a new opinion poll today which revealed that voters believe the Government has lost . touch with ordinary people and overwhelmingly blame ministers for . triggering panic-buying of petrol. Mr Miliband said: 'I think it is going to be remembered for the end of the Cameron project. 'Thursday night was a very bad result . but there is a big picture about where politics is and I think people . will look back on the last few weeks and say that was when the Cameron . project hit the buffers and this was when Labour had their chance.' He added: 'Opposition is a long and difficult haul. It is going to be a one-term haul, I am confident about that.' The ComRes poll for The Independent . on Sunday and Sunday Mirror found almost three-quarters - 72 per cent - . said the coalition was 'out of touch with ordinary people'. Four out of five of those questioned . said that ministers had caused an unnecessary panic over the threat of a . strike by tanker drivers. Shock: George Galloway, the Respect candidate and his supporters wildly celebrate victory in the Bradford West by election on Thursday night - a huge blow to Ed Miliband's Labour Party . The findings will make grim reading . for David Cameron after a week in which ministers have come under . sustained attack. The poll found 71 per cent believed Chancellor . George Osborne had been wrong to extend VAT to hot pies and pasties . while 64 per cent disagreed with the so-called 'granny tax' - scrapping . age-related allowances for the over-65s. Following reports that the Tories . tried to provoke a confrontation with the tanker drivers to create a . 'Thatcher moment' - echoing Margaret Thatcher's clash with the miners - . Mr Miliband said the Government needed to come clean about its handling . of the dispute. 'Over the last few days its every move has been designed to whip up unnecessary tension at the expense of the public,' he said. War of words: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused ministers of deliberately provoking a confrontation with the unions because they wanted to recreate Margaret Thatcher's clash with the miners in the 1980s . 'Ministers knew all along that a . strike could not possibly be less than seven days away even were it to . be called - that is the law. 'Yet they panicked the nation all the way to the petrol pumps because they imagined it would boost them in the polls.' But . despite the problems which have beset Cameron and the Conservative . Party this week, Mr Miliband is still a leader under pressure. He describes the Labour defeat to Mr Galloway as 'deeply disappointing' and admits that lessons need to be learned. The opposition leader says he will soon be visiting Bradford to discuss how his party came to lose a formerly safe Labour seat. Piling on the pressure: Ed Miliband, with Ed Balls and Rachel Reeves, pictured mid-week trying to heat up the debate about Tory pasty tax by publicly backing Greggs .

A 7-ft tall Dutchman charged with the murder of 24-year-old Sarah Groves appeared in court today but did not enter a plea. Richard De Wit, 43 is accused of stabbing Miss Groves 45 times with a 12 inch knife on a houseboat in Kashmir. Despite having confessed to police, De Wit was silent during the hearing in Srinagar, Kashmir. His defence lawyer appealed for an adjournment so a document could be translated into English. De Wit, from Ridderkerk, Netherlands, was charged with the murder when he was found 45 miles from the scene. He is believed to have fled in a . small boat which capsized, forcing him to swim to shore. The accused was . wearing wet clothes, without shoes and carrying a passport on the night . of the murder. Miss . Groves, from Guernsey was found by the houseboat owner's son in the . early hours of the morning on April 6 after he heard screams coming from . her cabin. She had suffered 45 knife wounds, most on her fingers, hands and arms, indicating she had fought ferociously for her life. De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three . days before the killing, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves. They were . the only two tourists staying on the boat. Miss Groves had been there . with her 25-year-old boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda since February. A Kashmir police source claimed that De Wit had smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned . to his cabin on the night. He reportedly became paranoid that . Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and . allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife. The Dutchman appeared in court with his lawyer, Indian Supreme Court Advocate, Shilpi Jain. The request to have De Wit's 100-page charge sheet translated from to Urdu to English means the hearing is adjourned until June 24. The Deputy Inspector General of . Kashmir Police, Ahfadul Mujtaba, said in April: ‘We put him in front of the . magistrates today and we now have him in our custody for a further ten . days. Adjourned: The case will take a nine-day break as De Wit's 100 page charge sheet is translated into English . Confession: Indian police say De Wit confessed to murdering Miss Groves and told them he was under the influence of drugs at the time . Fought for her life: Doctors revealed Sarah Groves fought valiantly for her life. She received 45 stab wounds . ‘He has confessed to killing the girl but at this time he is not giving any further detail.’ Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered. He is said to have confessed to killing her after smoking cannabis, triggering delusions that she was a Dutch spy. Detectives are also probing claims that Miss Groves, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was conned out of money before her death. De Wit is being held in the region's central jail having received treatment in a government-run psychiatric hospital. Police said the 24-year-old (pictured left) was found inside the boat and had defensive wounds to her wrists and arms. Richard De Wit was seen running from the scene and was captured by police 45 miles away . Tragic loss: 24-year-old Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools. She went travelling last August after moving back home to Guernsey . Life cut short: Miss Groves worked as a fitness instructor after she studied at the prestigious Chelsea College for Art and Design . Miss Groves was born in Manchester in 1988, moving to Guernsey when she was four with her parents. She and her older half-brothers, Ben, 26, and Tom, 31, grew up in a large manor house on the island. Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools, first at Blanchelande College in Guernsey, then as a boarder at the £30,000-a-year St Mary’s College in Ascot, Berkshire. She studied at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London before returning to Guernsey, having decided to become a fitness instructor. After qualifying, she worked for two years at the five-star Old Government House Hotel, leaving last August after deciding to go travelling. The hearing will continue on June 24.

He's most famous for bending spoons and mixing with the rich and famous, but a new documentary claims Uri Geller has also been leading a secret life as a CIA spy. And the controversial paranormalist has even admitted he was once asked to use telepathy to stop a pig's heart, but he refused as he suspected he would next be asked to perform the act on a human. Geller's life as a covert spy has been revealed in a new documentary by Vikram Jayanti, The Secret Life of Uri Geller - Psychic Spy? Uri Geller's secret life as a CIA spy has been revealed in a new documentary . The film explores work Geller is said to have carried out for military and intelligence agencies across three continents. The film, which was premiered at the Sheffield Doc Fest and will be broadcast by the BBC later this year, includes interviews with those who had first-hand knowledge of Geller's work, including former CIA officer Kit Green and retired army colonel John Alexander, who featured in journalist Jon Ronson's book The Men Who Stare At Goats. Geller, who attended the premiere, has said he is concerned at the way he is revealed as a spy in the film. Speaking to The Independent, Geller said: 'I didn’t realise that Vikram was going to do such a thorough job of tying all the loose ends... making that the little hints I dropped throughout my career were real.' Geller has admitted he was asked to stop a pig's heart but he refused as he feared he would next be asked to perform the act on a human . He also said he refused to carry out 'dark things' and only executed 'positive' missions. The film suggests Geller attempted to erase the contents of floppy disks being carried by Soviet diplomats in Mexico back to Russia and even disable radar when Israeli commandos stormed a hijacked plane during the 'raid on Entebbe'. Film-maker Jayanti suggests the US recruited Geller during a 'psychic arms race' with the Soviet Union, although it is believed he came to the attention of the CIA while he was already working for the Israeli military. While Geller remains coy about his involvement in covert operations during the film, he is happy to reveal how he obtained his surprise Mexican citizenship - by pinpointing where to drill for oil. The spoon-bender is believed to have first come to the attention of the CIA while working for the Israeli military . Geller has said he first became aware of his abilities at the age of five when a spoon curled up in his hand and broke during a meal. He says he went on to develop the powers by demonstrating them to pupils at his school . His mother meanwhile believed he inherited them from distant relative Sigmund Freud.","New documentary reveals Uri Geller's secret life as a CIA spy .

On the face of it, Chairman Mao, Napoleon and the Green Cross Code might seem like they have nothing in common. But despite that they have all used propaganda to bury themselves in people's minds. Whether used as a force for good or bad, propaganda is everywhere and a striking exhibition seeks to highlight just how prevalent it can be. The cult of personality: Chairman Mao and Napoleon used striking portraits of themselves to impress the idea upon a nation that they were the undisputed leaders . Icons: This painting on the left presented Stalin, who was himself from Georgia, exactly as he wanted to be seen: as a cultured, learned scholar. The fictional character Uncle Sam (right) who was used to encourage enlistment in World War I and II, is now a cultural icon, instantaneously recognisable . This collection of posters, scarfs, playing cards and even fans curated by the British Library highlight just how insidious, creative and humorous campaigns can be when trying to impress an idea on to its audience. The library's exhibition Propaganda: Power and Persuasion, in London, explores how cultures across the world slipped their message into people's minds - whether it be sneakily subtle or unapologetically obvious. It is the first exhibit to bring Chinese . dictator Mao's little red book and the terrifying drink-driving adverts . together in one exhibition, which will prompt the audience to question . just how much they are influenced by propaganda. Curators have explored the myriad ways . different states have used propaganda to influence the thoughts and . feelings of a nation, whether the message it carries creates an enemy, . generates feelings of national pride or promotes a healthy lifestyle. This slogan on the left has been used in Britain since World War II. The NHS had a mission to improve health through the prevention of disease and campaigns focused on personal responsibility. Those who failed to heed good advice were characterised as a public menace. The Medical Officer journal used striking images (right) to promote better public health. Flies were held responsible for contaminating food and spreading diseases and anti-fly campaigns were held across Britain and the United States . How to win the war: War bond stamps could be mass produced and circulated widely. Liberty provided a symbol that would be understood anywhere in the United States (left). The theme of 'freedom imperilled' deflected from discussion of the rationale for joining the war. In World War I, the Parliamentary War Savings Committee set about using raising funds from the British public. This poster encourages donations by using a simple design to show a direct link between savings and military success (right) One of the exhibits shows a scarf . handed out by the British government during World War II to boost weary . citizens' morale after the country was heavily bombarded by aerial . attacks. The scarf, made in 1942, showed a map demonstrating London’s endurance in the face of German bombing. Winston Churchill's rousing 'We Shall Fight Them on the Beaches' quote and American broadcaster, Ed Murrow’s, famous exultation 'London can take it!', run alongside a map of bomb sites. Messages that stressed the resilience of Britain and of British character were used to rally and sustain support for the devastating war. An unusual method of propaganda was used by King George III in the 18th century. After another bout of sickness, King George III sought to re-establish his authority with a commemorative fan in 1789. Changing people's minds: The 'violated' Belgians often featured in British wartime propaganda with great emphasis placed on the plight of women, children and the elderly.  This helped sustain British moral condemnation of Germany throughout the War, and was used to imply that a similar threat could face British families. In the Soviet poster (right), New York's Statue of Liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for U.S police to observe its people, mocking the idea that it is a symbol of freedom . One way of getting your message across: This unusual commemorative fan (left) links the well-being of the nation with the health of the King using the phrase 'Health is restored to ONE and happiness to millions'. The cards handed out to U.S troops in the Iraqi war (right) served a practical purpose - soldiers could identify Iraqi leaders - but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the Coalition’s intelligence, and its willingness to seek out the enemy . The Green Cross Code Man featured in comics, television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign . It linked the well-being of the . nation with the health of the King by declaring the phrase 'Health is . restored to ONE and happiness to millions.' While . the power of persuasion can generate the idea of a common enemy for a . nation, it can also be used to impress upon citizens the idea of an . all-powerful leader. Propaganda . has been used by leaders across the nations to stamp their authority - . convincing even the most cynical of their power and plans. Chairman . Mao's image was used in a variety of ways - from badges, to books, to . posters - so that every citizen in the huge sub-continent country would . be in no doubt that he was their unchallenged leader. It can be argued that without this wealth of ways that was used to spread the message of his personality, it would have been very difficult to bring the population under his control. More than two billion Mao badges, were produced during the Cultural Revolution, ensuring that Mao was seen as the undisputed ruler across China. The badges became essential for demonstrating revolutionary zeal, allowing wearers to both avoid denunciation and elevate themselves above their peers. The badges even became an alternative currency used to barter for goods and services. Napoleon also used propaganda to announce his rule - portraits were painted to inspire loyalty and intimidate critics at a time when the Emperor's power was declining and France was besieged on all sides. While many would argue propaganda plays an important part in winning wars - from boosting morale to encouraging soldiers to enlist - it was used in a completely different way int the 2003 Iraq war. Coalition commanders circulated packs of playing cards to the US-led forces invading Iraq in 2003 to enable troops to identify and capture prominent members of Saddam Hussein's regime. The cards served a practical purpose but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the Coalition’s intelligence, and its willingness to seek out Iraqi leaders. The tactic was first used during the American Civil War (1861–65). Propaganda could also be used to dismiss ideals embedded in other cultures - imperative if a nation wanted to indoctrinate its citizens into conforming to the government's plans. In a Soviet poster, New York’s famous . Statue of Liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for the American . police to observe its people, mocking the idea that it is a symbol of . freedom. The Tufty Club was set up in 1961 by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to encourage better road safety amongst children. Cards and other material helped spread the message as Tufty and his friends learned from Mrs Owl how to cross the road safely . The 'Careless Talk' campaign aimed to discourage people from idly discussing war work and accidentally passing on secrets to enemy agents. More personal and mobile than a poster, the handkerchief and the humorous cartoons on it would have been a talking point in homes and workplaces. The government feared that continued aerial bombardment could lead to a collapse in the morale of British citizens. Messages that stressed the resilience of Britain were used to sustain support for the war . Chairman Mao badges became a symbol used to support the cult of Mao's personality . The poster attacks and subverts American propaganda that promoted the idea of the democratic freedom of the West. But the art of persuasion isn't just used to convince people of government ideals, or the importance of war - it has been used for far less dramatic purposes. The Green Cross Code updated previous crossing drills as traffic became heavier and road layouts more complex - but it was with the help of a hero clad in green that the importance of road safety was impressed on people's minds. The Green Cross Code Man featured in comics, television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign. The 1976 media plan shows how various audiences were targeted by different media in order to maximise impact. Following the 1967 Welsh Language Act, national campaigns increasingly appeared in Welsh as well as English. Curated by Jude England and Ian Cooke, curators of Social Science at the British Library, the exhibition explores the different ways in which the state has used propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation. Jude England, Head of Social Sciences at the British Library, says: 'We want visitors to consider the role of propaganda in their own lives today, as well as look at the state’s use of propaganda throughout history. 'That’s why, as well as displaying iconic pieces of propaganda from the Library’s collections, such as posters from both World Wars, the Cold War and Vietnam, we’ll also be focusing on more surprising examples, such as the 2012 Olympics and even Twitter – things you wouldn’t necessarily associate with a word like ""propaganda""'. The exhibition runs until September 17 at the British Library, London.","Exhibition explores the ways in which states use propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation .

Nelson Mandela began responding better to treatment this morning for a recurring lung infection following 'a difficult last few days', South Africa's president said. Jacob Zuma told parliament that he is happy with the progress that the 94-year-old is making following his hospitalisation on Saturday. Mr Mandela spent a fifth straight day in a Pretoria hospital, where he was visited by one of his daughters and two granddaughters. Scroll down for video . Nelson Mandela began responding better to treatment this morning for a recurring lung infection following 'a difficult last few days', South Africa's president said. He is pictured here on April 29 recuperating at home after being hospitalised with pneumonia . A boy holds a poster wishing Mr Mandela well as children gather to sing songs for him and place get well cards at his house in Johannesburg today . Mr Zuma noted that today marked the 49th anniversary of the sentencing of the former president to life in prison in 1964. He said 'our thoughts' are with Mandela and his family 'on this crucial historical anniversary'. 'We are very happy with the progress that he is now making following a difficult last few days,' Mr Zuma said. 'We appreciate the messages of support from all over the world.' Mr Zuma also applauded the legacy of Mr Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists today. South Africa's government disbanded its official policy of apartheid - racial segregation and discrimination - in 1994. 'Our country is a much better place to live in now than it was before 1994, even though we still have so much work to do,' Mr Zuma said. He added the former president is 'a good fighter' and was confident doctors were doing a 'very good job' looking after him. Referring to Mr Mandela as 'the father of democracy in South Africa', he said: 'We need him to be with us and I'm sure all the messages that have been pouring in to wish him a speedy recovery are highly welcome.' Concern: Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindzi Mandela arrives at the hospital yesterday . He said he had been given a 'thorough briefing' by Mr Mandela's doctors, according to the BBC. Speaking . during a TV interview last night, the ANC leader added: 'Whilst he is . very serious, he is stabilised and we are all praying for him, really, . to recuperate quickly. We need him to go with us.' President Zuma also plans to visit the anti-apartheid hero 'as soon as his diary allows', a government spokesman told local radio this morning, adding that Mr Mandela remained in a 'serious but stable' condition. Mandela, who turn 95 next month, is being treated at a Pretoria hospital for a recurring lung infection. The . hospital stay is his fourth since December and there is a growing . realisation among South Africa's 53million people that they will one day . have to say goodbye to the father of the 'Rainbow Nation' that Mandela . tried to forge from the ashes of apartheid. Yesterday, his family including ex-wife Winnie gathered at his bedside. Winnie . Mandela, 76, who was married to Mr Mandela for almost 40 years between . 1957 and 1996, spent around an hour with her ex-husband. One of their daughters Zindziwa, 52, . has also visited him in intensive care. She told the South African . Guardian: 'I’ve seen my father and he’s well. He’s a fighter.' Their other daughter Zenani, 53, has . flown home from Argentina, where she is South Africa’s ambassador, to be . at his bedside along with his third wife Graca Machel and other family . members. President Jacob Zuma was seen placing a hand on Mr Mandela's following his release from hospital in April . Graca, who accompanied him to hospital on . Saturday, cancelled a scheduled appearance in London so she could stay . with her husband. The family of the iconic . former leader denied barring government officials and high-ranking . members of the ANC from his bedside, a government spokesman said. 'We have spoken to the family about . this report and they deny that they issued such an instruction or spoke . to the media on barring the ANC and government from visiting Madiba,' said spokesperson Jackson Mthembu in a statement. 'What we know is that given the . pressure associated with the admission of president Mandela, there are . general restrictions that permit only relevant people to have access.' A foundation led by retired . archbishop Desmond Tutu has described Mr Mandela as an 'extraordinary gift' to South Africa. Mandela, seen at his 94th birthday celebrations last year, has his wife Graça Machel at his bedside . Hospitalised: Nelson Mandela, 94, was re-admitted to hospital in the early hours of this morning due to a recurring lung infection . Mr Mandela 'once again endures the . ravages of time in hospital,' said the Cape Town-based foundation, which . was founded by Mr Tutu and his wife Leah to promote peace. 'We offer our thanks to God for the extraordinary gift of Mr Mandela, and wish his family strength.' Mr Tutu, 81, was also a vigorous . campaigner against apartheid, which ended when all-race elections were . held in 1994. Like Mr Mandela, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for . his efforts on behalf of his compatriots. Mr Mandela shared his prize . with FW de Klerk, the last president of the apartheid era.

A woman who failed to reveal she was  a convicted thief when she applied to become a police constable is suing Scotland Yard for discrimination. Rachida Sobhi’s bid to become a WPC was turned down when background checks revealed she had a criminal record for stealing from a previous employer. But she has launched legal action against the force, claiming that she has amnesia that caused her to forget her crime – but no other aspect of her life. It is believed that Ms Sobhi is the first person with amnesia to have been declared disabled for the purposes of an employment tribunal. Rachida Sobhi (left) in her PCSO uniform at a community event in Notting Hill. She is suing the Met for disability discrimination . Astonishingly, her claim has been backed by a renowned psychiatrist – but the MetropolitanPolice is ‘vigorously’ contesting  her case, arguing that her condition is irrelevant as she would not be allowed to become a constable with her criminal record in any case. The case, which has been described as ‘bizarre’, has raised fresh concerns about the compensation culture in the police. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday revealed that PC Kelly Jones was suing a petrol station owner because she tripped over his kerb while investigating a possible break-in. Ms Sobhi, who is already employed by the Met as a  Police Community Support Officer, has had her case dismissed by an employment tribunal. But she won the right to a fresh hearing after a senior judge ruled she was indeed disabled when she filled in the application form. As a PCSO – nicknamed ‘plastic police’ because of their lack of arrest powers – she can earn up to £28,539 a year. She previously worked in Notting Hill in West London and continues to be employed by the Met as part of a ‘safer neighbourhoods team’ in Bromley, South East London, patrolling local streets with regular police officers and attending community events. Mr Justice Keith allowed a new hearing. He said that she forgot about her conviction due to traumatic events in her life . In August 2008 she applied to become a . constable but when her fingerprints were taken as part of the process . it emerged that she had a criminal record. ‘She . had been convicted in 1991 of an offence of theft from a previous . employer for which she had been conditionally discharged,’ according to . the judgment of the appeal tribunal published this week. It . is understood she had been a cashier in a department store in Brixton, . South London, and was arrested with other staff for stealing make-up. Friends say she protested her . innocence at the time but she was convicted and received a conditional . discharge, which means the offence went on her criminal record but she . received no further punishment. Ms . Sobhi received a disciplinary reprimand for not mentioning the . conviction in her initial application to become a PCSO or during her . attempt to become a PC. Undeterred, in November 2009 she applied again to become a constable and was knocked back because of her reprimand – but bosses made clear her conviction would have ruled her out anyway. Although around 1,000 police officers and PCSOs in England and Wales are thought to have criminal records, those found guilty of serious offences such as dishonesty are not allowed to serve in the force. A year later Ms Sobhi, who is of Moroccan background and thought to be in her early 40s, filed a claim  in the London Central employment tribunal ‘complaining of discrimination on the ground of her sex, her sexual orientation, her religion or beliefs, her age and her disability’  against the Met and several individuals. It was claimed that the Met treated her ‘less favourably’ because of her condition and failed to take ‘reasonable steps’ to accommodate her. ‘Her case is that when she had originally applied to become a police constable, she had forgotten about her conviction and the facts to which it related as a result of traumatic events in her life,’ said tribunal judge Mr Justice Keith. The Met apparently accepts she was suffering from ‘dissociative amnesia’ – a form of mental illness that involves gaps in memory – when she filled in the questionnaire. But its lawyers say she should have admitted ‘she did not know whether or not she had any convictions’. At a pre-hearing review in May 2011, neuropsychiatrist Michael Kopelman said Ms Sobhi had been suffering from depression. The case has raised new concerns about the compensation culture in the police. PC Kelly Jones sued the force for a prang in her car . The expert said her memory loss was likely to be a genuine effect of ‘traumatic circumstances’ and that it only affected ‘her ability to recall events around the time of her arrest and conviction in 1991’. The Mail on Sunday has attempted to establish what these circumstances were. Although Ms Sobhi, her lawyers and the police declined to explain, sources have suggested she had a baby when young and had a difficult family life. She got married in 1991 but later separated from her husband. Yet the ‘relatively small gap’ in her memory did not affect her current job, Prof Kopelman said. Her discrimination claim was initially dismissed by a judge, who ruled she had not been disabled at the time of the job application. But last month Mr Justice Keith said: ‘Ms Sobhi’s appeal must be allowed, the employment judge’s finding that she was not a disabled person must be set aside, as must his order that her claim of discrimination on the ground of her disability be dismissed. The case must be remitted to the employment tribunal.’ The fresh hearing will consider if Ms . Sobhi actually knew she had amnesia when she filled in the form, and if . it had a substantial effect on her day-to-day activities. A . Met spokesman said: ‘We believe the first hearing outcome was the . correct one and will vigorously defend our position at all future . hearings. We would not wish to  discuss our position further prior  to . proceedings.’ The average . compensation awarded in employment tribunals in cases of disability . discrimination last year was £22,183. The maximum awarded was £390,871, . although there is no upper limit. Dissociative amnesia is a real  condition triggered by traumatic events rather than physical injury, say experts. But they stress it is almost always caused by extreme incidents such as repeated childhood sexual abuse. Sufferers’ brains forget the events to escape the emotional pain of the memory. Dr Christopher Findlay explained the condition was considered ‘dissociative’ because sufferers ‘separated off an emotional part of themselves’  by forgetting a trauma.The condition is included in  the psychiatrists’ ‘bible’, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). But Dr Findlay said the condition was ‘very rare’ and was not usually confined to forgetting a single event. He said he would want to have an extensive psychiatric report to prove a single episode of amnesia was ‘part of a wider disorder’. And clinical psychologist Dr Roderick Orner said: ‘Memory loss of such a one-off event does not really fit the typical profile for dissociative amnesia.’ Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said: ‘It’s a complete and utter farce. I think it’s extraordinary. ‘People with convictions for dishonesty should not be police officers, full stop. We’ve got enough problems with people not trusting the police as it is.’ But he denied the Met had a wider problem with Employment Tribunal claims, saying: ‘The fact that they didn’t give way and are defending it shows that they are trying to stand up for themselves.’ Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is a bizarre case and appears to extend the law beyond what Parliament has intended. The Met is absolutely right to resist this claim. It is essential that there is full disclosure at the time of applications to join the police.’ Dissociative amnesia is a type of memory loss not linked to a physical cause, such as a head injury, but traumatic events, such as being in a car crash or childhood abuse, and some doctors doubt it can be triggered by relatively trivial events.","Background checks revealed that Rachida Sobhi had a criminal record .

An 'update' of the scrabble app on social networking site Facebook has left players lost for words. After Electronic Arts EA took over the running of the online game from Scrabble brand owner Mattel, it decided to revamp its game structure. Sadly, these changes have not gone down with with seasoned players, with the key bone of contention being that player history has been deleted. Outrage: The 'updated' version of Facebook app Scrabble has been met with derision by loyal players . This means that the aggregate win percentage of a player who has been gaming for years has been lost to the abyss. This has led players, not surprisingly, bombarding the Facebook page for the popular game showing their disgust with the new format. Other changes include the dictionary being changed from Chambers to Collins, and the refresh stalling after a player's turn. One post put by the page admin, totally unrelated to the 'update' was met with a raft of negative comments. Andrea Appleyard wrote: 'The scrabble moment when u realise how only pure arrogance can fly in the face of such overwhelming opposition to the new format.. and STILL you just give the lot of us The Finger! Aw well! Barbara Bishop added: 'I miss playing Scrabble - please admit that you made a serious mistake and bring back the original game.' Popular opinion: Andrea Appleyard's comment was 'liked' 315 times . Negative: There isn't a positive comment in sight here . And this was echoed by fellow fan Jacqueline Smith who wrote: 'That Scrabble moment when you discover that the game you loved to play had gone only to be replaced by a crap version!!!' Disgruntled users also have a Facebook group to air their discontent after 'please bring back the scrabble we love' was set up. This has attracted more than 2,000 members. Game users have also complained that the new version of the game does not allow them to pick who they play against and have also dismissed the new design as ‘brash’. Bad move: Unfortunately there isn't many 'likeable' comments on this post . Helen Jones, 54, a support worker from Southport said: ‘I’ve been playing for the past five years. I’d play for around an hour of an evening when I come home from work. ‘I’ve met some really interesting people. Of course they do not substitute friends, but we had a community. I’ve just had a grandchild and a lot of the people I played with knew that and would ask how it was going. Such is the strong feeling on this, a petition has been set-up called: 'Scrabble - If it ain't broke don't fix it' by John Lewis from Sheffield. On this petition, he writes: 'In the weeks running up Sunday, 27th May 2013, Mattel promised a new “improved” version of Scrabble. 'In our opinion what was delivered is a great disappointment. Judging . by the comments left on Scrabble playing message boards, dissatisfaction . is almost universal. There are very few if any of the community of . players who have messaged anything positive about the changes . 'We are now presented with a random playing partner and therefore . cannot choose against someone who regards themselves as a novice or . against someone who considers themselves to be a serious player. This is . frustrating. 'We enjoyed having the choice of whether or not play a 2 minute game or a week game. That choice has now been removed.' Over 5,000 people have signed the petition so far. A spokesman for Mattel said: ‘The Scrabble Facebook game is now managed by a new partner EA Mobile. 'The benefits of the new game include gameplay across devices, the addition of the Collins Official Scrabble Wordlist, the ability to play in six languages, the option to customise boards and tiles and the option to play ad-free. ‘As part of the transition, we were unable to carry over ongoing games and statistics, the timer mode and the manual match-making function.

With sunlight streaming through the windows, this immaculate bedroom with polished floorboards should be welcoming to flat seekers in Oslo. But it comes with a dark past. It was in that very room that Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik plotted the country's worst peacetime massacre after he moved in with his mother, Wenche, in 2006. It was in this bedroom that Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik plotted the country's worst peacetime massacre after he moved in with his mother, Wenche, in 2006 . Anders Behring Breivik, seen here making a salute at his trial in Oslo, pleaded to be let out of jail to attend his mother's funeral. The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011 . Now, following the death of 66-year-old Wenche in March, the four-bedroom apartment in the child-friendly district of Skoyen, has gone on sale, according to newspaper Dagbladet. It is on the market for 3.7million krone (£408,000). The sale comes as Breivik yesterday renounced an inheritance from Wenche to avoid it going to the state which wants to compensate the families of his victims, according to his lawyer Tod Jordet. During his trial, it was revealed that Breivik had cheated to avoid paying income tax to a state that he strongly opposed. The 34-year-old right-wing fanatic killed 77 people in twin attacks on July 22, 2011, in Norway's worst peacetime massacre. Breivik detonated a car bomb outside government offices in Oslo killing eight people and then drove to the island of Utoya where he massacred 69 in a shooting spree at the summer camp of the governing Labour Party's youth wing . He detonated a car bomb outside . government offices in Oslo killing eight people and then drove to the . island of Utoya where he massacred 69 in a shooting spree at the summer . camp of the governing Labour Party's youth wing. Breivik, who stayed at the flat for five years, would spend a lot of time holed up in his bedroom playing video games, and drawing up his deadly plan, according to prosecutors during his trial. Last August, a court declared him sane and sentenced him to 21 years in jail, the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law. After the death of his mother in March, the four-bedroom apartment where Breivik lived in the district of Skoyen has gone on sale . The sale of the flat, where Breivik lived for five years, came as he renounced an inheritance from his mother to avoid it going to the state which wants to compensate the families of his victims . Marie Mindresunde Moen, estate agent at Eie which is marketing the property, said in an email to Dagbladet, that she was hopeful of securing the sale. And marketing and communications manager Maren Synnevag added that she too saw the apartment as an 'ordinary sale'. 'We will conduct this sale in the same way as for other accommodation we provide but we want only serious interested parties,' Ms Synnevag said. Terror: Teenagers on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya had to 'swim for their lives' and hide in trees when Breivik fired indiscriminately at them . These are the details of the flat, according to Eie. During the trial, it emerged that Wenche Breivik was already terrified of her son when he was just four years old. The court heard how the 'hyperactive and aggressive' boy was incapable of feeling joy or pleasure. It was also revealed that he would laugh in his mother's face when she tried to impose limits. Wenche called in social workers who wanted to remove the disturbed boy and put him in a foster home to prevent any further psychological disintegration. She was still terrified 23 years later when, on moving back into her home in 2006, he would 'sit on top of her on the sofa' and attempt to kiss her face. In a statement to police read out to the court, she said: 'I felt like I was in prison with him. He was uncomfortably intense. 'He started saying I was a Marxist and a feminist. From 2010, he became really strange.' The killer smirked throughout as the . Oslo court heard how he began wearing a mask around the house and . passing plates to his mother from behind doors to avoid being infected . with germs. A week before his twin attacks on Oslo and Utoya Island, Breivik told his mother he felt ugly and wanted to have a facelift. Breivik . and his mother met in early March at Ila . Prison where Breivik is being held, his lawyer Mr Jordet said at the time. Anders Behring Breivik walks with a gun in hand among bodies on Utoya . 'He was allowed to say goodbye.

In the last years of the 19th Century, the hamlet of Hille in Cornwall was a thriving farming community. A new chapel and schoolroom were built, along with a pretty cottage for the schoolmistress. But within 20 years, Hille and all its homes had been abandoned. The First World War sounded the death knell for Hille – not one of its men returned after the Armistice. For almost 50 years it lay abandoned and decaying, until one summer Sunday in 1962 it was rediscovered by Don Slaughter, an Essex businessman, and his wife Eileen. Village for sale: Hamlet Hille in Cornwall, which was saved by the Slaughters in the 1960s and turned into a holiday village, is now for sale . ‘We used to drive down from Chelmsford every weekend looking for something to buy but couldn’t find anything,’ says Don’s widow Eileen today. ‘We’d stopped at a petrol station and the man told us Hille was for sale but he said, “It’s not the sort of place for nice people like you.” ’ Their interest piqued, the couple drove down the twisting roads, took one look and agreed to pay £2,000 for the main house, schoolhouse, 15 dilapidated cottages and a range of barns and other buildings in ten acres – then set about restoring the hamlet, which they renamed Trefanny Hill. For the past 50 years, the restored hamlet – three miles from the village of Duloe, between Looe and Liskeard in East Cornwall – has been operating as a busy tourist business, with hundreds of holidaymakers renting its cottages, swimming in its outdoor pool, playing tennis or relaxing in its very own pub, the Trefanny Inn. New life: Horses riders passing the house that Jon is building for himself, nicknamed 'The Castle' But after half a century, the family is selling up. ‘My dad died five years ago and Mum’s now 86, and there are other things I want to do,’ says son Jon Slaughter, who is building his own house in the village. Jon has already sold two two-bedroom cottages for £145,000 each, as well as St Mary Manor House, in which he was brought up, for £490,000. And now the remaining 15 cottages and a barn with planning permission for conversion into a four-bedroom house are on the market with a price tag of £2 million. Of the cottages, seven have one bedroom, five have two, and three have three bedrooms. All have their own gardens, and the . price also includes the village’s tennis court, badminton court, play . area, pool and ten acres of land, as well as three barns, which . currently comprise the pub, laundry and games room. ‘When . Mum and Dad came here, all but two of the cottages had been condemned . and the only house that was habitable had an outside loo, so they lived . in a caravan while they did it up,’ says Jon. Family project: Don Slaughter and his son Jon, aged five, working at Trefanny Hill in the 70s . ‘Locals used to drive up here on a Sunday to see what these weird people were doing.’ Within months, the first house was ready for guests and the couple started work on the rest of the village, and along the way they discovered ancient treasures, including an 11th Century aspersorium – a vessel for holding holy water. ‘This part of Cornwall was popular . with pirates and smugglers and they would have come through here because . the Penzance to London stagecoach used to go straight through Hille,’ says Jon. The couple then . converted a former cider barn into Trefanny Hall, which became the . family home until they found another hidden property. ‘Mum . was out walking one day and in the undergrowth she came across a . chapel, which they didn’t even know existed. It was owned by the Church . of England and they bought it and converted it into their own house,’ explains Jon. Today, all the houses have open fires . or log-burning stoves, washing machines, dishwashers and microwave . ovens, and many families return year after year, not just in summer but . all year round. ‘We get a . lot of people at Christmas and, in our best year, had a turnover of . £345,000,’ says Jon, who was born three years after his parents moved to . Cornwall and has no plans to leave Trefanny. For . the past 20 years, he has been building The Castle, a vast granite . structure which, when finished, will have a medieval living room, . banqueting hall, kitchen, winter parlour, one bedroom and a bathroom. ‘I’ve got planning permission for a second wing with another 20ft by 40ft bedroom and en suite and rooms below that. I’ll build it in modules and add things as I go,’ says Jon. Estate agent Maitlands, which is handling the sale, has had a lot of interest from buyers who want to carry on running Trefanny Hill as a holiday village, but the prospective purchasers have struggled to find a bank willing to lend to them. ‘We had two families who wanted to buy it and run the business together, but getting a mortgage has been a problem,’ says Claire Biddlecombe, of Maitlands. ‘We are currently negotiating with a group of local investors who are looking to split the village and sell off the houses individually.’ While tourists, many of whom have returned to Trefanny Hill year after year, will lose out, the holiday village may be worth less than the sum of its parts, so breaking it up could make sense – and a quick profit.

Following weeks of rain, the ground at many sites has been left wet, leading to concerns that a heavy shower could turn festival sites into a muddy mess. As reported by The Observer, It has resulted in many organisers stockpiling emergency supplies in the hope that poor conditions do not ruin events. Today, festival goers at the Isle of Wight Festival were again forced to bring out the wellies as parts of the site were transformed into fields of mud. In Birmingham, heavy rain fell during India's ICC Champions Trophy cricket match against Pakistan, forcing play to be called off.

Protection: Music fans at the Isle of Wight Festival were forced to wear wellies with heavy mud spread around the site . Tennis fans at the AEGON Classic also faced a delay in play following heavy showers. Met Office forecaster Michael Lawrence said: 'Generally speaking it has been very unsettled today, very mixed conditions across the UK. 'There have been blustery winds, particularly in the north and on exposed coastlines as well as some thundery showers. 'For the most part this should die away into this evening. Tomorrow should be largely dry with the odd shower. However, rain will be coming down into the far south west in the morning.'

Trial: School teacher Jeremy Forrest is led from a prison van into Lewes Crown Crown, which heard that police halted their probe before he fled to France with a pupil . The teacher accused of abducting a 15-year-old pupil he was having sex with was warned seven times by colleagues that their relationship was inappropriate, a court heard yesterday. However, none of them reported their concerns about Jeremy Forrest to police. Staff were even tipped off by concerned pupils about Forrest and the ‘infatuated’ schoolgirl. The police were eventually alerted when someone outside the school raised concerns. Police seized the 15-year-old’s mobile phone after being told Forrest, 30, had sent her intimate photographs of himself. But detectives told senior staff at Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, they had not found any evidence on the girl’s phone, and had decided not to examine Forrest’s mobile, Lewes Crown Court heard. Hours later, they absconded to Bordeaux. Forrest was arrested after eight days on the run. Police searches then revealed the couple had in fact exchanged topless pictures of each other. Teachers yesterday told the court how Forrest had repeatedly lied when confronted about his relationship with the girl. He tearfully accused her of lying as he denied the claims to colleagues, it was alleged. Staff were even worried about the stress the rumours were causing him, the court heard. Police began investigating on September 14 last year after the tip-off and took the girl’s phone for analysis five days later. But Alicja Bobela, the school’s assistant head in charge of child protection, said police called her on September 20, adding: ‘They said there was no evidence on the girl’s phone so they were not going to seize Jeremy’s. We were left with the idea we had to follow up the investigation.’ Evidence: Bishop Bell CofE teachers Alicja Bobela (left), Neil Pittman and Emma Tremaman (right) all told the court how they had spoken to Forrest about his relationship with the student . That evening, fearing their . relationship was about to be exposed, Forrest drove the girl to Dover . where they took a ferry to Calais. Forrest was first warned by . colleagues to keep his distance from the girl after a school trip to Los . Angeles in February 2012. Emma Tremaman, who taught ICT and . business, said she spoke to Forrest about rumours that the girl had a . crush on him and that he showed her favouritism. She told the court: ‘He . just said thank you.’ Neil Pittman, head of the upper school, also spoke to Forrest after two pupils said stories were going around the school. Teacher in the dock: Jeremy Forrest's 15-year-old pupil, giving evidence by videolink yesterday, has described how their relationship had developed from a kiss in the classroom to sex at the cottage he shared with his wife . The science teacher said: ‘It’s not . unusual for teenage girls to have a crush on a male teacher, but it is . unusual for it to be  discussed openly.’ Mr Pittman said Forrest agreed to . keep his distance from the girl. But Mr Pittman later saw him ‘laughing . and joking’ with her. Forrest also arranged for her to be taken out of . exclusion, where she was sent for misbehaviour, so she could attend his . maths revision lesson, he said. Mr Pittman said: ‘Potentially, it wasn’t a wise thing to do.’ Miss Bobela said pupils had told her . in May that Forrest had been sending the girl private Twitter messages . describing his marriage problems. She called the local authority and . Forrest, who denied the claims. After more rumours, the teenager was removed from Forrest’s maths class in mid June. Educational establishment:Staff at Bishop Bell Church of England School (pictured) in Eastbourne warned Forrest off seven months before he went on the run . When another teacher confronted . Forrest last July about stories that he was picking the girl up in his . car, he came to speak to Miss Bobela. She told the court: ‘He said, “Why . is she doing this to me?” He seemed tearful.’ Mark Talbot, the school’s deputy . head, also spoke to Forrest ‘to make sure he was clear about . professional boundaries’, adding: ‘It was apparent to us that he was not . heeding the advice of Miss Bobela.’ Forrest seemed ‘irritated’ about being questioned, he said. Mr Talbot said he spoke to Forrest again in May. Forrest denies one count of child abduction. The case continues.

Rude, unapologetic and very funny, Mark Wright's female co-host of Take Me Out: The Gossip steps in to help Emily Hartridge present this week's 10 Reasons Why video. Viewers might also recognise presenter Zoe Hardman, 30, from shows like Nuts TV and This Morning's Hub. But this week she takes a break to present a light-hearted take on why women are weird along with YouTube blogger Emily Hartridge, 29. Why Women Are Weird: 'Two kisses yesterday, one kiss today - he is definitely seeing someone else!' Zoe requested the opportunity to work with Emily after seeing her fellow Hub presenter Matt Johnson on last week's episode, all about the perks of the spring season. The double act used to present together and now execute a hilarious rendition of 10 Reasons Why ... Women Are Weird. Emily and Zoe act out what women say to their boyfriends and how that differs from what they are really thinking. For instance, if she says she 'doesn't mind . at all' if you go out somewhere she disapproves of, she's probably . thinking: 'If you go I'll break your legs.' If you go out somewhere she disapproves of, she's probably thinking: 'If you go I'll break your legs' Zoe acts out a comic scene where she says: 'I love being tied up! It was totally fine.' when she's really thinking: 'Oh my god I thought I was going to die.' Here, Emily goes mad at Zoe for wearing the same shirt as her - something, they say, that wouldn't happen if two male friends were wearing the same top. Emily goes mad at Zoe for wearing the same shirt - something, that wouldn't happen between men . If men go out with their male friends, Emily says, and don't text their girlfriend every five minutes, they're obviously having a lap dance. Zoe Hardman then paces up and down the living room as Emily reads a magazine, frantically cursing that her man must be interfering with a stripper if he hasn't texted her in four minutes. Mark Wright and Lydia Bright tweeted to their followers about the hilarious video starring Zoe and Emily . Emily observes her almost wrinkle-free face in a compact declaring her interest in using hemorrhoid cream to get rid of her eye bags. Zoe looks disgusted at the prospect. Women, Emily says, will do anything to make themselves look younger. Which is 'pretty weird' While Emily says she doesn't find going to the toilet a particularly scary thing, for some reason she likes to go with a friend. Zoe asks Emily to come to the bathroom. 'I'm so glad you're here' she says. 'Stroke my hair some more' Zoe asks Emily to come to the bathroom. 'I'm so glad you're here' she says. 'Stroke my hair some more' Assuming this is in order not to eat the stuff, Emily confesses she is a fan of sniffing chocolate. With this she suggests all women are fans of the practice. 'I've already sniffed chocolate this morning,' she says. Zoe doesn't find it so normal that Emily is a fan of sniffing chocolate. Another weird habit . 'Honey I've got a really bad headache,' says Emily, head perched on a pillow in bed. Her excuse for avoiding sex, when flipped on its head, is greeted with a hostile response. 'Why don't you just tell me you're cheating on me,' she shouts. 'Why don't you just tell me you're cheating on me,' she shouts, when her boyfriend excuses himself from sex . Before laying into Reason Eight, Emily stresses that she holds no responsibility for the sexist undertone, a male friend had shared with her his squabbles with the female sex: 'Why can't women learn to use their new iPhone, TV or laptop rather than trying for one minute and passing it over for me to fix.' Zoe presents this one with conviction. 'I don't know what you're talking about. I have never farted in my life, that's disgusting,' she confesses to the camera.

A small passenger jet barreled into a hangar at a California airport Thursday night just ten yards from the terrified workers inside the building. Just after 6 p.m., the small Bombardier Challenger jet crashed into a hangar with at least four inside at Chino Airport in southern California, KTLA reported. Before the 60-foot long plane ended up in the hangar, its engines were running at full speed as it underwent an engine test. The jet somehow lurched over the rubber chalks used to hold planes in place on the tarmac. Scroll down for video . Accident: A small passenger jet crashed into a Chino Airport hanger that had at least four workers inside . On Alert: After the crash, firefighters shut off electricity because they were afraid of leaking fuel . Emergency: Fire crews were on scene to hose down the wreckage . Danger: Three mechanics were on board the small jet when it crashed . 'The plane was chalked on the ramp area while undergoing an engine run-up test,' FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said in a statement. 'At some point, the plane jumped the chalks and ran into the hangar,' he added. After the crash, fire crews hosed down the wreckage, KSTP-TV reported. Three mechanics were on the plane when it crashed and one injured his knee, but all refused medical attention. The hangar is partially used as an office space and at least four people were inside at the time of the crash. No one was injured. Stephen Rand was sitting at a desk in the hangar when the crash happened. 'I heard a loud bang and the whole building shook,' Rand told KTLA. 'It sounded like an earthquake, bomb going off.' 'I walked out and looked down the hallway . and just saw a huge fuselage sticking through the middle of the hallway . and knew immediately what happened,' he said. 'There was three others . and we all just started running out of the building.' 'Like a bomb going off': Witnesses said the crash sounded like an earthquake or bombs . Crash: National Transportation Safety Board investigators will arrive at the site of the crash Friday . Overhead: The small jet crashed while it was undergoing an engine test . Rand was conflicted when the crash occurred. 'I was thinking, you know ""Is the plane going to blow up...Is there anything that's going to cause it to blow? Should I get far away from it?""' he said. 'But I also knew that there were other people in the plane, so I was conflicted you know whether or not to try to get them out or get far away or what to do...it was kind of hectic.' Another witness, Robin Dill also said the crash sounded 'like a bomb going off'. Dill, a retired commercial airlines captain with 32 years experience, told KTLA he thought the mechanics should have immediately put the plane in idle. 'I can say--and I think most pilots would agree--that if the airplane was operating at idle engine speed, the aircraft would have stopped and wouldn't have continued like it did,' Dill said. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board will arrive at the airport Friday morning to try to figure out what happened.","The 600-foot long jet crashed into a Chino Airport hangar with at least four people inside during an engine test Thursday night .

Charla Nash, the Connecticut woman who lost her eyesight, lips, . nose, and hands when she was mauled by a chimpanzee in 2009, has been denied permission to sue the state. Her family sought permission to sue for $150 million but was denied on Friday by state Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. Connecticut has 'sovereign immunity' from lawsuits unless they're allowed by the commissioner. Nash's lawyer had said the state should be . held responsible for failing to seize the animal before the attack, because . it was warned the animal was dangerous. Denied: Charla Nash, who was horrifically disfigured after she was attacked by a chimpanzee in 2009, has been denied permission to sue the state of Connecticut. She is pictured last year . Vance said in his decision that at . the time of the attack, state law did not prohibit the private ownership . of chimpanzees and did not require the state to seize an animal that . was privately owned and not banned by the state. Vance noted that the state banned the ownership of chimpanzees after the attack. 'The State of Connecticut, were it a . private person, would generally not have any duty to control the conduct . of (a) third party absent some special relationship,' Vance wrote. Nash has a chance to appeal to the state General Assembly to reverse Vance's decision. 'I hope and pray that the . commissioner will give me my day in court,' Charla Nash previously told reporters . following a hearing in August before Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance . Jr. Attack: On Feb. 16, 2009, the 200-pound chimpanzee named Travis, left, mauled Charla Nash, right, causing her to lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands in the attack . Happy: Nash, pictured with Travis, worked for the chimp's owner performing odd jobs and caring for the animal . 'And I also pray that I hope this never happens to anyone else . again. It is not nice.' State Attorney General George . Jepsen said the state shouldn't be held liable for the mauling. He argued the judge should deny permission due to a law called the 'public duty doctrine'. It says the state has a duty to protect . the general public in regulatory matters, but not any individual who is . injured by another person not complying with regulations, the Hartford Courant reported. Nash, who received a successful face transplant in 2011, reached a $4 million settlement . last year with the estate of chimp owner Sandra Herold, who died in . 2010. She had sought $50 million. The . settlement agreement filed in Stamford Probate Court calls for Herold's . estate to provide Nash with $3.4million in real estate, $331,000 in . cash, $140,000 in machinery and equipment and $44,000 in vehicles. Reconstruction: In the attack, her eyes, nose, and lips were mauled off . Courageous: The survivor first revealed her mauled face on the Oprah Winfrey show; before the surgery, she kept a veil over her face . Brenden . Leydon, a Stamford lawyer representing Herold's estate, had argued that . it couldn't be sued because Nash was an employee of Herold . and any claims were a worker's compensation matter. Charla Nash now lives in a . nursing home outside of Boston. She had gone to Herold's home on the day . of the attack to help lure Herold's 200-pound chimpanzee, Travis, back . into her home. But the animal went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Travis had starred in TV commercials . for Old Navy and Coca-Cola when he was younger and made an appearance on . the The Maury Povich Show. The chimpanzee was the constant . companion of the widowed Herold and was fed steak, lobster and ice . cream. The chimp could eat at the table, drink wine from a stemmed . glass, use the toilet and dress and bathe himself. Court: Nash talks with attorney . Bill Monaco before a hearing at the Legislative Office Building in . Hartford, Connecticut last August. She was awarded $4 million in damages from the chimp's owner's estate . Injury: Charla Nash arrives for a hearing at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Connecticut . A month after the mauling, Nash's family sued Herold for alleged negligence and recklessness. The lawsuit alleged Herold knew . Travis was dangerous but failed to confine him to a secure area and . allowed him to roam her property. It also claimed Herold gave the chimp medication that exacerbated his 'violent propensities'. Travis had previously bitten another . woman's hand and tried to drag her into a car in 1996, bit a man's thumb . two years later and escaped from her home and roamed downtown Stamford . for hours before being captured in 2003, according to the lawsuit. Nash wants to sue the state . Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, which she holds . responsible for not seizing the animal before the attack despite a state . biologist's warning it was dangerous.","Nash's lawyer said the state was responsible for failing to seize animal before 2009 attack that left her without eyes, lips, nose and hands .

The Liberal Democrats have been accused of covering up complaints of sexual harassment involving one of the party’s most powerful former officials. Women activists claimed that Lord Rennard, the party’s ex-chief executive and election mastermind, propositioned them and touched them inappropriately. Senior figures in the party had been warned about the complaints but the women involved said they did not act. Lord Rennard has denied he behaved inappropriately towards the women.

But he continued to have access to the party’s female candidates through its gender balance programmes, and last month attended a training weekend in Bedfordshire for prospective candidates. One woman, a party candidate who did not want to be identified, said Lord Rennard ‘shoved his hand down the back of my dress’ during a photoshoot. She said that at the time he was ‘more powerful than the leader’. The allegations were revealed by Channel 4 News last night.

In the case of another woman, the lawyers said that he ‘is unaware of her having grounds for complaint’. ‘In addition, Lord Rennard describes as completely untrue any suggestion that he resigned as chief executive as a result of allegations about inappropriate behaviour.’ Denial: Lord Rennard (right), pictured taking part in the Rehab Pancake Race outside the Houses of Parliament earlier this month, has denied the allegations .

More than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of Labour’s decision to increase spending on benefits, a report reveals today. In a 53.4 per cent of homes, state handouts and services now outweigh their tax payments. In 2001 - prior to Labour’s debt binge - the figure was less than 44 per cent. Burden: More than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of Labour's decision to increase spending on benefits, a report reveals today . It had increased by only 0.7 per cent since 1979. It then exploded after Labour used tax credits and other handouts to drag a huge number of new households into the pay of the State. The Centre for Policy Studies, which compiled the report, said the situation was ‘unsustainable’. The think-tank says benefits will have to be slashed, and the pension age increased, to balance the books. Ryan Bourne, head of economics at the CPS, said: ‘These data show that even before the financial crisis, the Labour government was ramping up spending on cash benefits and benefits in kind without corresponding increases in taxation. Increase: The proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 ¿ an increase of over a million households . ‘This was not redistribution from rich to poor, but redistribution from the future to the present. It felt good at the time, but given the government doesn’t have its own money, was unsustainable.’ The study, based on figures from the Office for National Statistics, shows the government is becoming ever more reliant on the taxes paid by higher earners. Only the wealthiest 20 per cent of society are paying significantly more to the state - £20,125-a-year - than they receive in benefits and public services. State services and benefits include unemployment and child benefits and health and education. Taxes include VAT, Council Tax and alcohol duty, as well as payments to HMRC. Criticism: Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised the Tories for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners . Between 2001 and last year, around three million more households became net recipients of the state. Over this period, middle-income households have moved from being significant net contributors to the state to significant net recipients - taking out £4,589 more than they put in. In 1990, middle income households faced an effective tax rate of 8.2 per cent. But by 2010/11 this had reversed, the study says. The effective tax rate was minus 20 per cent. The households with the lowest incomes received £10,153 more in benefits than paid in taxes. The report acknowledges that at least part of the change in effective tax rates is down to changing demographics, with an increasing proportion of retired households. But even in non-retired households 39.6 per cent received more in benefits than they paid in taxes - up from 31.7 per cent in 1979 and 29.0 per cent in 2001. The proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 – an increase of over a million households. Tim Knox, director of the CPS, said: ‘These trends are unsustainable – particularly given the ageing profile of the UK population. ‘Reversing the trend will require implementation of tough policies to get more people into work, to continue the reform of public services, to restrain increases in the cost of benefits payment, and to ensure that enterprise has the freedom to flourish - leading to more growth, more employment and higher wages and salaries.’ It comes at a time when the Liberal Democrats and Labour are insisting the wealthy must do more to help the nation’s finances recover.

A lawyer for the Leveson Inquiry who had an affair with Hugh Grant’s barrister played a significant role in the inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson admitted last night. The judge had initially suggested that Carine Patry Hoskins played only a minor role in his inquiry, carrying out work that was ‘largely mechanical’. But, following revelations that she was paid £218,000 for her work between July 2011 and November 2012, he came under pressure to reveal more about her role. Affair: Celebrities' barrister Mr Sherborne and  Mrs Patry Hoskins, a . member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team,  claim their relationship . did not start until after the inquiry . In a letter to the Tory MP Rob Wilson, . the judge said she had also played a key role in drawing up lines of . questioning used by the inquiry’s lead counsel Robert Jay, as well as . questioning witnesses herself, reviewing witness statements and . researching areas of the law. However the letter said nothing about her role in drawing up the so-called Rule 13 letters outlining the inquiry’s criticisms of the Press before the report was published. Lord Justice Leveson insists the conclusions of his report were his alone. But Mr Wilson said the revelations would underline public concern about whether the Leveson Inquiry’s findings could have been compromised by an affair between Miss Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, and David Sherbourne, a barrister representing Mr Grant and other celebrities campaigning for regulation of the Press. Miss Patry Hoskins, who became known as the ‘woman on the left’ during the televised hearings, was junior counsel in the team led by  Mr Jay. She went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Mr Sherbourne in August last year – while the inquiry was being conducted. Lord Justice Leveson admitted that the barrister had in fact had a significant role in the inquiry . The pair claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in December. Mr Wilson said: ‘We now learn that Carine Patry Hoskins did indeed  provide important legal advice to the Leveson Inquiry, and dealt with  witnesses and made assessments of the evidence on behalf of the inquiry. This must have had some bearing on the inquiry’s work, whether she had a formal input into the drafting of the report or not. ‘It would be completely inappropriate for someone to carry out these important tasks for an impartial public inquiry while developing such close personal relations with one of the parties’ barristers to the point that they went on holiday together to contemplate an affair. Holiday together: The pair went on a break to the island of Santorini (pictured) in Greece . ‘I am very surprised that Lord Justice Leveson has not already taken the many opportunities available to him to make this clear.’ In his latest letter, Lord Leveson again denied that Miss Patry Hoskins influenced his final report. He said she had ‘no input into the conclusions or recommendations in the report itself’. In April last year Miss Patry Hoskins told people at the inquiry she was helping to draft the Rule 13 letters, which set out criticisms of the Press across 120 pages that appeared largely unchanged in the final report later in the year. The letters were sent to newspaper editors in mid-August, when Miss Patry Hoskins claims she was contemplating an affair with Mr Sherbourne. Lord Justice Leveson’s latest letter makes no reference to her work in this area, focusing on her work in the early stages of the inquiry. He has previously said she merely ‘assisted in the largely mechanical exercise of collecting and organising the evidence to support the generic criticisms’ set out in the letters.","Judge initially suggested that Carine Patry Hoskins played only a minor role .

Looking glamorous and in good spirits, Sophie Wessex waved to assembled photographers as she entered the building where Philip has been staying since late last week. She carried what appeared to be a small cool bag - giving rise to suggestions that she was bearing some sort of edible gift for the Duke. Sophie's visit came after visits a day earlier from the Queen and Prince Edward, who arrived at the hospital on Philip's 92nd birthday yesterday bearing greetings cards. Bearing gifts: Sophie carried what appeared to be a cool bag as she arrived at the London Clinic earlier today . Chic: Sophie looked glamorous in a pale yellow print silk dress and navy blazer . The Queen left at about 7.30pm after a half an hour visit. Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke and said he was doing 'well' after his visit. His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'. The family had good reason for their seemingly elevated mood. Yesterday Buckingham Palace described the Duke of Edinburgh as 'comfortable and in good spirits' following an exploratory operation.

The Queen smiled as she was greeted by staff during the visit to the London Clinic on the Duke's 92nd birthday . Prince Philip, pictured last week before his operation, spent his 92nd birthday in hospital . The Duke is progressing well following his operation on Friday. Once out of hospital he will . spend two months convalescing, said the Palace. The Queen arrived shortly before 7pm at the London Clinic where her husband is being treated. In a short statement the Palace said: . 'His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is progressing according to . plans at this early stage. He is comfortable and in good spirits. 'He will remain in hospital for up to . two weeks, and it is expected he will then be taking a period of . convalescence of approximately two months.' The Palace confirmed the Prince is due to resume public engagements in the autumn. The Duke has already received the . good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes have . been fired across the UK to mark the milestone.

Friday, Buckingham Palace said he was 'progressing satisfactorily' and . was 'comfortable', but has not released any further updates. Edward's visit indicates the Duke is well enough to see callers but he did not stay long, leaving after 20 minutes. Prince Philip had been too tired to accept visits but the Queen's arrival is a good sign of his recovery. Prince Charles and . Camilla were at Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral. Bringing cheer: A man delivers flowers and birthday balloons to the London Clinic, where the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating following an operation on his abdomen . 'Doing well': The Duke was admitted to the London Clinic for the pre-arranged operation on Thursday evening, following a garden party at the Palace that day .

The Duke is likely to remain in hospital for up to two weeks in total . while he recovers. Royal-watchers said it was not unusual . for members of the Royal Family not to visit the duke in hospital, . because he disliked ‘fuss’. The duke’s latest admission is the fourth time in 18 months that he has needed hospital treatment. In . 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused . to receive any well-wishers, instead catching up on his paperwork.

Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral. He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest. Two months earlier he spent five days convalescing at London’s Edward VII hospital after being taken ill following the Diamond Jubilee pageant along the River Thames. And in 2011 he spent Christmas in hospital after he was rushed to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge with chest pains on December 23.

A diplomatic protection officer and a middle-aged woman were arrested yesterday over the alleged ‘Plebgate’ plot to discredit former Tory Minister Andrew Mitchell. In all, six people – four police and two others – have been detained by Operation Alice detectives investigating claims that a conspiracy cost the former Chief Whip his job. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after allegations he was aggressive towards officers and called them ‘plebs’ when they would not let him take his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate in September. But a Channel 4 investigation cast . doubt on the police account. Among other things it revealed that CCTV . footage disproved the claim that a large group of tourists were outside . the gate during the row. Scotland . Yard said the 48-year-old policeman arrested yesterday is being . questioned on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The woman, aged . 49, is suspected of assisting an offender. Both were held following . ‘fresh information’ given to Operation Alice officers on June 4. David . Davis MP, a friend of Mr Mitchell, wrote to the Independent Police . Complaints Commission on that day highlighting evidence which ‘strongly . reinforces the case that a conspiracy took place’. In his letter to the IPCC, Mr Davis . referred to documents lodged by The Sun newspaper in defence of a libel . action taken against them by Mr Mitchell. In . them, the paper refers to a call it received the morning after the . incident from an anonymous woman who described herself as a tourist. She . was said to have overheard Mitchell saying to police officers: ‘You’re . f****** morons – you think you run the country, well you don’t.’ But Mr Davis pointed out to the IPCC that video evidence showed ‘there were no civilian witnesses in earshot of any exchange’. He added: ‘The only possible explanation therefore is that this bogus witness was yet another police officer masquerading as a civilian, or a civilian put up to it by one of the police officers who was aware of the original incident.’ Last night Mr Davis said: ‘All I was doing was what you would expect any decent policeman to do. Looking at the facts with a cool forensic eye.’ The arrested policeman had previously been issued with a Regulation 15 notice, served following an alleged breach of professional standards. He has been on restricted duties but will now be suspended. Mischief: Crispin Blunt MP suggested mischievously that broadcaster Channel 4 should be put in charge of the investigation . In a further development, The Mail on Sunday has learned that detectives have followed the advice of another Tory minister and turned to Channel 4 for help. Last week Crispin Blunt MP stood up in the Commons and suggested mischievously that the broadcaster should be put in charge of the investigation. He said: ‘The Channel 4 Dispatches programme took 10 days to establish that the video record was completely at odds with the police account of events. ‘Since the police have interviewed 800 officers, spent £144,000 and taken eight months apparently to go nowhere, might it be an idea to invite Channel 4’s Dispatches to be put in charge of the investigation, as it appears more effective and would certainly be more independent?’ Two days after Mr Blunt’s comments Detective Superintendent Steve Williams wrote to Channel 4’s political editor Michael Crick requesting emails and communications with Keith Wallis, 52, the officer Channel 4 first contacted six months ago. Mr Wallis, from Ruislip, Middlesex, was arrested in January on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Revealed: Dispatches and Channel 4 News revealed CCTV footage contradicted claims that onlookers had been shocked by the incident as it showed just one, uninterested, man walking past . Under investigation: The CCTV footage showed an exchange that raised questions about the description in police logs leaked to the media . The letter said the Met had sent a report to the Crown Prosecution Service but wished to identify all lines of enquiry. It also asked for communications with any of Wallis’s associates. Channel 4 is understood to be considering how to respond. The events date from September 19, 2012, when police on duty in Downing Street refused to open the gate for Andrew Mitchell to leave by bike. According to a police log leaked to the media later, Mr Mitchell is said to have told the police to ‘learn your f****** place’; that they didn’t ‘run this f****** government’, and that they were ‘f****** plebs’. But in December Dispatches and Channel 4 News revealed CCTV footage that contradicted the account in the leaked logs. Reports said the log mentioned eyewitnesses who were ‘visibly shocked’. But the footage shows just one man wandering past, who didn’t appear to show particular interest in the incident. The Dispatches programme also revealed an email was sent from a man in Ruislip to his MP John Randall – who coincidentally was and still is deputy chief whip – with an account very similar to the police log published in the media. Denial: While Mr Mitchell apologised for using profanity, he has always denied calling the officers 'plebs' and 'morons', or telling them to 'know their place' Friends of Mr Mitchell said last night that Scotland Yard had many questions to answer about the case. ‘If it has taken eight months to turn to such an obvious line of inquiry it must be clear to everyone that the Met is dragging its heels,’ said one. While Mr Mitchell apologised for using profanity, he has always denied calling the officers ‘plebs’ and ‘morons’, or telling them to ‘know their place’. Operation Alice was launched in December to investigate whether there was a conspiracy to frame Mr Mitchell. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, originally stood by his officers, saying they had ‘accurately reported what happened’. But he was later forced to promise that he would preside over a ‘ruthless search for the truth’ about the ‘Plebgate’ confrontation that led to Mr Mitchell’s resignation.","Diplomatic protection officer, 48, and woman, 49, questioned over plot .

David Cameron last night sought to shrug off speculation about his leadership of the Tories – by hinting that any one of Boris Johnson, Theresa May, Michael Gove and George Osborne could succeed him. The Prime Minister said he was surrounded by ‘talented people’ and did not want them to be ‘shrinking violets’. Mr Cameron made his point after business and energy minister Michael Fallon, who is close to Downing Street, dropped a hint that Mrs May wants to lead the party. And the Home Secretary herself added fuel to the fire with a speech casting herself as the party’s new Iron Lady. Nonplussed: The Prime Minister deflected speculation about potential rivals to his leadership saying he was surrounded by 'talented people' Mrs May told colleagues pushing through unpopular cuts and reforms: ‘Whatever you do, don’t buckle.’ The Tories needed to do more to reassure voters about their motives, she said. In an interview with Bloomberg last night, Mr Cameron was asked if he was worried he was presiding over a ‘beauty contest’ in which there was speculation about the ambitions of senior colleagues. He responded by praising Mrs May – along with the Chancellor, Education Secretary Mr Gove and London Mayor Mr Johnson. He said: ‘I’ve given people their jobs, I’ve given people the tasks I want them to carry out and then I let them get on with the job. I look around the table and think, isn’t it great we’ve got this talent. I don’t want shrinking violets.’ On Mr Johnson, who has repeatedly refused to rule himself out as a future Tory leader, Mr Cameron said: ‘Boris is doing a great job, he has a lot more to give.’ Potential successors: Home secretary Theresa May, left, and London mayor Boris Johnson, right, have been strongly tipped to replace David Cameron as leader of the Conservative party . There was fresh speculation in the Commons yesterday over Mrs May’s ambitions as Labour MP John Spellar called on the Government do to more for the UK car industry. He asked Mr Fallon: ‘Will he talk to the Home Secretary and get her to back British industry? It might even help her leadership ambitions.’ ‘They may not need that much help,’ Mr Fallon replied, prompting gasps from MPs. Mrs May has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions earlier this year, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to Mr Cameron. However, she is understood to regard Mr Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader if the Tories lose the next election. In a speech to the centre-Right think . tank Reform, Mrs May – hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies . – said the Conservatives’ mission had to extend further the elimination . of the vast budget deficit left behind by Labour. She suggested the . party leadership needed to do more to ‘reassure people about our motives . and our values’ and to ‘go further opening up public services’. Contenders: Education secretary Michael Gove, left, and the Chancellor George Osborne, right, were singled out as part of the 'talented' cabinet praised by David Cameron . She insisted it was possible to do ‘more for less’ across the public sector – highlighting welfare, defence and local government. Mrs May also suggested the Government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector – particularly banks and big utilities. She pointed out that her party had questioned the level of Labour’s public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ‘sadly our argument fell on deaf ears, and we all know what came next’. The Home Secretary  said there was ‘no other way’ than fundamental reform of the public sector. ‘The task facing the Government in the next Parliament will be to maintain fiscal discipline and drive on with reform so that the debt and debt interest payments return to manageable levels,’ she said. ‘That will be a tough challenge, but we’re proving to the public that we can deal with the deficit, we can reduce spending, and we can do those things while not just protecting public services but even improving them.’","David Cameron says he is surrounded by 'talented people'

Reputation: Gangster Dale Cregan, who had a £50,000 reward on his head, claimed that he lost his eye in a fight, but police believe it was cut out . Dale Cregan’s false black onyx eye became a badge of pride and a mark of his hardman image on the streets of East Manchester. He knew the false eye and the empty socket behind it – which had to be searched every time he came into court – looked menacing. Criminal associates say he would use it to intimidate other drug dealers. But mystery surrounds how he lost his left eye. Some say it was badly damaged by a knuckleduster in a drunken bar-room brawl while others say it was knocked out in a fight with gangsters in Bangkok. But a police source said officers were suspicious of the stories because there is no marking or scar tissue around his eye socket. They suspect his eye may have been ‘plucked out’ by a knife-wielding crime rival. The source added: ‘He thought it made him look like a baddie out of a James Bond film. He was definitely looking for a dramatic image and this fulfilled it.’ Cregan was subjected to twice-daily checks behind his false eye as part of the security operation surrounding his trial. During the trial, a source at HMP Manchester, better known as Strangeways, said: ‘Every time he comes in and every time he goes out of the building he must be searched and checked – including behind his eye. ‘Because he is a category A prisoner, each time he leaves these walls he is strip-searched and he must take his eye out so we can look behind it for drugs or some sort of weapon or anything he shouldn’t have. ‘And every time he comes back from court he gets strip-searched again and he has to take his eye out again – and it p****s him off.’ Scroll down for video . Cold-blooded: Cregan decided in advance he would kill the police, and eventually took lives of PC Fiona Bone (left) and PC Nicola Hughes (right) after calling 999 claiming there was a burglary where he was hiding . * Cregan's use of grenades  during . his killing spree was ‘incredibly worrying’, said Sir Peter Fahy, Chief . Constable of Greater Manchester Police. He said: ‘It was military-style . weaponry – grenades from a former war zone. The worry is that there are . huge numbers of these weapons out there from other parts of the world . and it is relatively easy for certain individuals to import them into . this country.’ Sources revealed that hand grenades, . machine guns, bullets and even rockets were among a shocking array of . firepower available on the black market.

Extraordinary: Greater Manchester Police discovered this stash of grenades inside a storm drain during Dale Cregan's 17-week trial . The ‘shopping list’ available to . criminals means they can buy grenades for as little as £150 each, while . semi-automatic handguns with bullets cost £250. Military-issue assault . rifles cost £500 to £1,000 while a magazine of bullets for the weapons . costs anything from £5 to £50. Grenades are the latest addition to the arsenal of criminals as they ramp up the ‘terror quotient’. Cregan had an arsenal of M75 hand . grenades and used four during his murderous spree which claimed the . lives of four people last year. Only last week police found a cache of ten grenades believed to be linked to Cregan at an address in Greater Manchester. Police say the grenades used by . Cregan came from the former Yugoslavia. The M75 is a fragmentation . grenade which has 3,000 tiny steel balls packed into its shell which . explode over a 50m radius.

On one occasion he forced a girl to cut herself as he watched . A predatory paedophile who terrorised teenage girls over the internet has been jailed for eight years. Lee Christie, 43, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, pretended to be a teenage boy to persuade young girls to strip and carry out indecent acts online. He manipulated and threatened his ten victims, who were aged between 13 and 16, and accumulated thousands of indecent images of children. On one occasion, Christie pressured a 14-year-old girl to harm herself as he watched on webcam after threatening to send indecent images of her to her parents and post them online. He told one of his youngest victims, aged just 13, that he would kill her family if she didn’t do what he asked. Christie admitted 23 charges and was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court today. Nearly 70,000 indecent images and videos of children were found on two of his computers, as well as a further 3,000 images of extreme pornography. Nottinghamshire Police was contacted by the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP) after Christie was intercepted on a U.S. social networking site claiming to be a teenage boy. Users claimed he had been persuading young girls to expose themselves online and had boasted that he owned a large collection of indecent images of young girls. In January 2012, Christie was arrested by officers from the Force’s Sexual Exploitation Investigation Unit raided his Newark home. It was when officers began to examine Christie’s computers that the full extent of his devious offending became clear. Detective Constable Andy Taylor, from Notts police’s Sexual Exploitation Investigation Unit, said: 'Christie used MSN and social networking sites to get close to girls all over the country.' Police also found nearly 70,000 indecent images and videos of children on his computers . He added: 'In reality, he was a man in his forties locked away at home obsessed with young girls. 'He would first get them to trust him before persuading them to take their clothes off online. Once he had images of them, he would blackmail them to do what he asked. 'The girls he targeted were very young and vulnerable and they became terrified of him. He would threaten to turn up at their doors and hurt them and their family if they did not carry out his orders. 'He even made one girl cut herself as he watched - he was spiralling out of control and caused untold damage to his victims. 'It’s fortunate that his devious behaviour was noticed by other people online and the authorities were notified.' Christie admitted that he possessed a huge catalogue of indecent images of children and confessed to using a number of fake profiles on social networking sites, posing as a teenage boy to get close to young girls. Lure: The paedophile pretended to be a teenage boy using this image and persuaded young girls to strip and carry out indecent acts online . He admitted to spending up to 20 hours a day on the internet trying to entice young girls to strip and engage in sexual activity online. Chat logs found on his computers showed Christie had been discussing the sexual abuse of young girls with other paedophiles. It was also discovered that Christie had taken indecent images of two girls, then aged 13 and 14, at an address in Nottinghamshire in 2004. Christie pleaded guilty to 15 counts of making indecent images of children, possession of 69, 542 indecent images of children and six counts of causing a female aged 13 or over to engage in sexualactivity. He also admitted possession of extreme pornography and a prohibited image of a child. He will sign the sex offenders register for life and was given a sexual offences prevention order for life.","Predator Lee Christie, 43, posed as a teenage boy online to trick his victims .

The BBC appears to spend taxpayers' money as if it comes from a cash machine, Lord Patten said today. The Chairman of the Corporation's Trust admitted the public’s trust in the BBC had been rocked by revelations about financial largesse and was braced for more damaging headlines over vast severance pay deals to departing executives. But he defended the cost of moving staff to the a new £1billion headquarters in Salford, insisting the only mistake was not keeping checks on how money was spent furnishing the new homes of employees who made the move north. Lord Patten said the public's trust in the BBC had been rocked by revelations about financial largesse and was braced for more damaging headlines over vast severance pay deals to departing executives . The licence fee has been frozen at £145.50 until 2015, and Lord Patten warned that if it did not rise in future there would be a ‘storm’ of protest as services are switched off. But he lifted the lid on the attitude of staff towards spending the public’s money. Speaking at a lunch in Parliament, he said: ‘I think there are particular challenges for us in the BBC because we depend above all else on trust and the trust people have in us.’ He said there were several things about which he is still ‘particularly concerned’. ‘The first is we should be seen to be spending licence fee payers money as though it was not just cash out of an ATM which we could do with as we wanted. ‘We have to demonstrate that we are using licence fee payers money reasonably.’ North: Lord Patten defended the BBC's decision to pay generous allowances to persuade staff to move to the Media City in Salford . Former director general George Entwistle, who quit over his handling of the Jimmy Savile sex scandal, received a £450,000 pay-off last year, double the amount he was entitled to, while Caroline Thompson, the former chief operating officer, was given a £670,000 pay-off. Lord Patten also revealed that in the coming months, there will be more ‘difficult stories’ about the BBC’s use of money. It includes the controversial decision last month to cancel a bungled £100million IT project. ‘We have quite a difficult story this summer to deal with on severance pay which the National Audit Office are dealing with,’ he added. Conservative eurosceptics could be sending the party down the path to 'political suicide', Lord Patten warned. The BBC chairman said it was 'perfectly possible' that David Cameron will be able to achieve in the renegotiation of the UK's membership with Brussels which he has promised. But he warned that the electorate will punish the Conservatives at the ballot box if they appear disunited over the issue.The former European Commissioner said:'If your response to that is that nothing would be acceptable, then I think that would be bad news for the Conservative Party.'If nothing is acceptable, I recall Winston Churchill's very wise observation that the problem with political suicide is that you live to regret it.' BBC Director General Lord Hall has agreed to cap payouts to senior managers at £150,000, a limit Lord Patten said was ‘reasonable’. But he warned against future cuts to the licence fee, even if the country is still in the grip of austerity when negotiations begin. ‘It surprises me that support for the licence fee is substantially higher than it was two, three or four years ago,’ he told journalists. ‘I have no doubt at all that a smaller licence fee would result in cuts in services and every time we have tried to reduce services there has been a storm, either local radio or Radio 6 or other things. ‘We have to produce good programmes. We above all will be judged and our figures for trust and the regard in which the BBC is held will be judged by the quality of the programmes we make at a reasonable cost.’ The decision to move BBC Sport, BBC Breakfast and children's programmes to Salford has been widely criticised for its cost. Last month the National Audit Office found 894 staff were handed an average of £23,000 each to persuade them to move, including 11 who received more than £100,000 for homes worth between £500,000 and £1million. However, they did not have to provide basic evidence of train fares or utility bills to back up their expense claims. Hundreds claimed up to £1,900 a month to cover all rent, bills and council tax in Salford, while others received £3,000 to buy new curtains and carpets. But Lord Patten said he was ‘quite surprised at the hostility in some quarters to Salford’. ‘I think there is slight tendency to think that they haven’t heard of paninis north of Watford. ‘Salford has been a fantastic success and whatever the problems about exactly how much people have been paid for their curtains on the whole it has been a success.’","BBC Trust chairman warns trust in the Corporation depends on not wasting cash .

The Chancellor of Oxford University has rejected calls to endow a college in honour of Margaret Thatcher - suggesting she cannot compete with Jesus . The Chancellor of Oxford University has rejected calls to endow a college in honour of Margaret Thatcher – suggesting she cannot compete with Jesus. Lord Patten dismissed demands for the university to make good its snub to Lady Thatcher three decades after it refused her an honorary degree. He backed plans to set up a Thatcher scholarship at Somerville College, where Lady Thatcher earned her degree. But in a speech to journalists in Westminster, Lord Patten – a Cabinet minister under Mrs Thatcher – rejected calls by London Mayor Boris Johnson to name a college at Oxford University after her. He said: ‘You would either have to start a new college, which would be more expensive, or you would have to persuade Jesus [College] or Corpus Christi or Christ Church to change their name.’ Lord Patten then issued a barbed comment, saying: ‘It may be thought – however admirable she was – slightly pushing it to persuade Jesus to change its name.’ Campaigners have been demanding recognition for Lady Thatcher since her death in April. They also want her bestowed with a posthumous honorary degree after she was snubbed in 1985 by embittered academics protesting against cuts in university funding. It means Lady Thatcher is the only Oxford-educated prime minister not to have been given an honorary degree, a move that entrenched divisions between the Thatcher government and the Left-wing educational establishment. When she retired, Lady Thatcher handed her official papers to the archives centre at Churchill College, Cambridge, where Sir Winston Churchill’s papers are also kept. In another snide boast, Lord Patten said Oxford’s Bodleian Library had secured the official papers of Lord Howe, the former deputy prime minister whose resignation from the Thatcher Cabinet in 1990 precipitated her downfall. Lord Patten dismissed demands for the university to make good its snub to Lady Thatcher three decades after it refused her an honorary degree. They are pictured in 1997 when he was governor of Hong Kong . Boris Johnson suggested the idea of a Thatcher College to make amends for Oxford not awarding her an honorary doctorate . ‘It’s absolutely true that Margaret Thatcher has left her papers to Churchill College. 'It’s also true that Geoffrey Howe has left his papers to the Bodleian. 'The Conservative Party archive is also held in Oxford. 'At present the most important issue in Oxford about Margaret Thatcher’s legacy is a campaign starting at her old college Somerville to start Thatcher scholarships. ‘I hope that will be a lasting memorial to an extraordinary woman who changed the way this country is governed.’ Asked if Lady Margaret Hall – an Oxford college set up in honour of Lady Margaret Beaufort, founder of the Tudor dynasty – might also honour Lady Thatcher, he said: ‘That Lady Margaret was the mother of kings and I’m not sure that’s yet on the [cards].’ Lord Patten seemed unaware that Christ Church has already changed its name once. Originally called Cardinal College after Henry VIII’s chief minister Cardinal Wolsey, it was renamed when he fell from grace. Mr Johnson said last month: ‘I’m still waiting for the Oxford dons to accept the gravity of their error, and in the spirit of magnanimity to award Baroness Thatcher not only a posthumous doctorate, but why not endow a college?’","Boris Johnson said a Thatcher college would make amends for not giving ex-PM an honorary doctorate .

A six-year-old girl was badly burned after she ran in bare feet over extremely hot sand where beach-goers had previously set up a barbecue. Olivia Wilson screamed in pain after the horrific incident on Exmouth beach in Devon, which left skin hanging off her foot in strips. Now her family is lobbing to have disposable barbecues banned from beaches, as they leave red-hot patches of sand which are invisible to the eye. Olivia is believed to be the fifth victim to have suffered serious burns on the same stretch of beach in the past two months. Hurt: Six-year-old Olivia Wilson injured herself by running through red-hot sand on Exmouth beach . Her mother Charlie, 27, said: 'I have never heard a child scream like that - nobody should see their little baby go through this. 'I don't want this to happen to anyone else. People have got to get the message before a baby goes face first into the hot sand in the same situation.' The six-year-old was injured on Sunday when she was building sandcastles on the beach with her mother. She accidentally ran through a patch of sand where a group of youths had been using a disposable barbecue around half and hour earlier. Olivia was taken to Exmouth Hospital, where she was treated for burns and blistering caused by contact with the sand. Injury: Olivia suffered bad burns and blistering and will require several weeks of specialist therapy . She now faces weeks of specialist burns treatment before her foot is completely healed, and has been too scared to play on the beach since. Doctors at the hospital said that the schoolgirl was the fifth person they had treated for sand-related burns over the past two months. Olivia's grandmother Pauline Gilmour said: 'I would like to see these barbecues banned from the beach altogether. 'Once that barbecue's been taken away there's nothing to see on the sand - and that's clearly dangerous.' Danger: Exmouth beach, pictured, has seen five people injured from sand burns in the past three months . Mother-of-two Mrs Wilson said that following the accident, she took Olivia into the sea to cool off, but 'the skin just washed off her foot'. She added that a group of around 20 yoths had been barbecuing near to where her daughter was hurt. 'They didn't do anything wrong, they just didn't realise,' Mrs Wilson said. 'It was about 25 minutes after they had packed away the barbecue. 'It just goes to show it can burn for a long time. People need to know what can happen or it won't stop. 'There was no mark on the sand. What people don't realise is that the sand underneath is still burning like coal long after the barbecue's been removed.'","Olivia Wilson was playing on Exmouth beach when she ran over hot sand .

A teenager hanged himself at the same place that his father – who had shot his wife over an alleged affair – committed suicide a few weeks beforehand, a highly charged inquest heard yesterday. Before he died, Jack Williams, 16, sent a text message to his dead father which read: 'I love you so much, Da.' Jack had been struggling to deal with the acrimonious break-up of his parents' marriage, which culminated in 46-year-old Darren Williams bursting into his estranged wife's hairdressing salon and shooting her at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun. Tragic: Jack Williams sent a text to his dead father simply saying: 'I love you Da', before he hanged himself. Darren Williams, 46, was discovered dead after shooting his wife after discovering she was cheating . He attacked Rachel Williams, 41, after . hearing she was having an affair with a solicitor, the inquest into the . older man's death was told earlier this week. Despite being badly injured in the . leg, she wrestled the gun from Mr Williams, a 6ft 7in, 20st former . bouncer, who fled the scene. Devastated: Jack is said to have attempted to stay neutral when his parents split, but was shocked when his father shot his mother then killed himself . His body was found in woodland shortly afterwards. Yesterday a separate inquest, which . was marred by angry scenes, heard that Jack hanged himself at the same . place five weeks later. His final text message was read to the hearing . in Newport, South Wales. It read: 'I hope where you are you can see this . message and know that I love you more than anything in this world. 'I really do hope you are at peace and . I will definitely see you one day. 'I really hope it comes soon because I . don't know how long I can live without you.' Jack was found dead after going to . visit the woods where his father's ashes had been scattered. The inquest . heard the teenager had tried to 'remain neutral' when his parents broke . up. But the hearing was told that relations between the mother's and father's sides of the family broke down after the shooting. Police had to be called to the inquest . yesterday when insults were hurled across the courtroom by different . sides of the family. Officials had to restrain relatives and two men . were escorted out of the hearing after threats of violence. Coroner David Bowen told the court: 'I . appreciate this is a traumatic time but let us respect the boy's . memory.' Mrs Williams did not attend the hearing. In a statement, she . said: 'Jack was trying to make an equal relationship with me and his . father. Jealous husband: Darren Williams, 45, blasted his wife Rachel, 38, with a double-barrelled shotgun in Newport. The couple are pictured (left) on their wedding day in 2005 and Mrs Williams is seen (right) in hospital . Injured: Mrs Williams wrestled the gun from her husband before he ran from the salon, the inquest heard . Investigation: Mrs Williams (pictured left in hospital) was shot at Carol Ann’s Hair Stylist (right) in South Wales . Shooting: The inquest heard that if he had not killed himself, Mr Williams would have been charged with attempting to murder his wife . 'When Jack saw me in hospital after . the shooting, he said, “I don't know why he'd do it” and we kept in . contact by text and telephone calls.' But the inquest heard Mrs Williams . had sent a text message to Jack, saying: 'Pack your bags and go and . live with the hypocrites', referring to her husband's family. The inquest heard Jack went to live . with his father's sister, Rachael. Her partner Wayne Davies said: 'Jack . was a remarkable young boy who showed so much courage, dignity and . respect and was wise beyond his years. 'He was a credit to his mother and . his father.

Led into battle by the Duke of Wellington, UK troops routed Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, a triumph ushering in almost a century of peace and stability in Europe. But the Government is refusing to mark the battle’s 200th anniversary in 2015 amid suspicions it does not want to offend France. That decision is in stark contrast to Belgium - where the clash took place. The government in Brussels is spending at least £20million on commemorative events, including restoring the battlefield. A painting of the Battle of Waterloo, which will celebrate its bicentennial in 2015. The government has pledged little support to the occasion . Instead, there will only be ‘initiatives’ at military museums and ‘some commemorative activity’ at the Duke’s former homes. The decision also contrasts with the major events organised to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007 which involved an apology on behalf of the nation by then prime minister Tony Blair. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has told the bicentenary campaign group Waterloo 200 that he will not help. The Government has also declined to hand over a single penny for any events. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has told the bicentenary campaign group Waterloo 200 that he will not help. James Morrow, secretary of Waterloo 200, which is organising commemorations including a service at St Paul’s and a re-enactment of the Waterloo Despatch, where British troops travelled with three captured French troops to London to tell the King of victory, said he was ‘disappointed’. He said: ‘The Government has given us its blessing but it is difficult to know why they are not being overly supportive. ‘They have encouraged us but they have not got behind us. ‘The Belgian government has spent millions on events to commemorate the battle but we have been given zilch, zippo, nothing. I think it’s very disappointing. ‘The Battle of Waterloo was a milestone in European history which ended over 20 years of conflict in Europe. ‘We can’t let the 200th anniversary pass without marking it and learning lessons about why it was so important.’ Ian Fletcher, editor of the Waterloo Association’s journal, said: ‘When you look at some of the crazy ideas that the Government wastes money on, you would have thought they might have found some for the Waterloo commemorations. 'It’s an appalling indictment of where their priorities lie.’ David Green, director of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘This is very unsatisfactory, especially if the reason is not to insult the French or because celebrating the victory would be seen as bad or triumphalist. ‘It appears to be ludicrous hyper-sensitivity. ‘Waterloo was a battle of the most immense importance. Britain was fighting a tyrant who had conquered Europe. It was a momentous moment that should be commemorated. We should be shouting it from the rooftops.’ In a message to Waterloo 200, the 8th Duke of Wellington said: ‘I am often asked whether we should not now, in these days of European unity, forget Waterloo and the battles of the past. Napoleon Bonaparte, French Emperor, whose power was broken at Waterloo thanks to the British forces, led by the Duke of Wellington, and a Prussian force . ‘My reply is, history cannot be forgotten and we need to be reminded of the bravery of the thousands of men from many nations who fought and died in a few hours and why their gallantry and sacrifice ensured peace in Europe for 50 years.’ Waterloo was fought a few miles south of Brussels on June 18, 2015. Wellington described his own troops as ‘very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced staff’. Britain and its allies had 68,000 men, and were joined by about 45,000 Prussians on the evening of the battle. The French had 72,000 troops. Heavy rain had turned the battlefield into a swamp. The scale of casualties was staggering - around one in four men were killed. But the victory brought about the final destruction of Napoleon’s army and the end of his bloody reign as dictator.","The battle ended tyranny of Napoleon and ushered in peace across Europe .

Evelyn Agbeko said: 'We didn¿t have the staff - maybe me, an agency nurse and two carers and that was it.¿ . A nurse at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital said she mistakenly claimed a patient was sleeping when she was dead because she hadn't had a break on a 15-hour night shift. Evelyn Agbeko told the Nursery and Midwifery Council that she made notes saying the elderly patient was asleep at 4am and 6am when she had died at 3am. Ms Agbeko, the nurse in charge of the ward, said she was overworked because of staffing cutbacks and the night that she made the medical note was, 'the busiest night of all.' The experienced nurse told the hearing that she was overworked and her ward was understaffed. ‘I couldn’t have a break because I’d have to leave a patient on their own in filth or leave them without having their treatment. ‘That night was the busiest night of all, we couldn’t cope,’ she explained. ‘The . hospital didn’t give us the level of care we needed - there would be . the same number of staff on a ward where there were just elderly people . as there were on our ward which was a gastroenterology ward. ‘I . sometimes wouldn’t have a break in a 15-hour shift because we didn’t . have the staff - maybe me, an agency nurse and two carers and that was . it.’ Along with colleague Theresia Van Der Knaap, Ms Agbeko allegedly failed to provide 'basic life support' when the nurses discovered the 81-year-old was unresponsive. The Nursing and Midwifery Council heard that there was confusion over whether there was a 'do not resuscitate' order in place for the patient. As the pensioner's life drained away the nurses did not start chest compressions or summon the hospital's resuscitation team. On the afternoon of April 16, 2010, registrar Dr . Helen Steed began considering whether or not to impose a 'Do Not Attempt . Resuscitation' order, in light of the patient's chances of survival if . she arrested. The woman, referred to as Patient A, was on dialysis and had been admitted to A&E at the hospital at the day before suffering from shortness of breath. Dr Steed . decided she wanted to see the woman first, but before she could review . Patient A, Susan Voss, acting hospital site manager, received a call . stating she had died. At the time we just had to cut corners to give patients the right care - my priority is providing patient care.’ Ms Agbeko said she ignored hospital policy on note-taking, choosing to fill out patients’ notes at her station rather than at their bedside because she ‘wanted to . make them comfortable’ and not ‘disturb’ them. The elderly patient was also not given a diuretic . to aid her kidney problems and when her oxygen saturation levels dropped . no further checks were made. Registrar Dr Helen Steed told the hearing Agbeko and Van Der Knaap acted in the patient’s best interests. The nurses allegedly failed to provide 'basic life support' when the nurses discovered the 81-year-old was unresponsive . ‘It really did seem that this lady was dying and that there was nothing that could be done to prevent that,’ she said. ‘I think the nurses acted in the patient’s best interests. ‘Hospital policy should always be in the patient’s best interests but it can sometimes be frustrating.’ Dr Steed added that Patient A was too weak and frail to be resuscitated . and that Agbeko and Van Der Knaap had allowed her a ‘quiet death with . dignity’. ‘If Patient A arrested she was very unlikely to survive and she wouldn’t have been on ventilation. ‘Her chances of survival were low. ‘I think it was a common sense decision not to resuscitate her because she was elderly and frail. ‘Technically it was not the right call but it allowed a quiet death with dignity. ‘I felt the nurses were experienced and realised the lady was dying so . they didn’t put out the call to the resuscitation team but instead . contacted the site manager.' Ms Stephenson told the panel that the expected procedure would have been for Agbeko to press the emergency alarm and commence chest compressions until the resuscitation team arrived. Samantha Adams, a nurse who was working that night, allegedly went for a break at 3am and around 15 minutes later Van Der Knaap went to her and told her that Patient A had died, the hearing was told. 'She commented to Ms Van Der Knaap that the patient was for twos, which meant that the patient was for resuscitation,' said Ms Stephenson. She added that this was a reference to extension '222', which was the number for the resuscitation team. Ms Stephenson said: 'Ms Van Der Knaap repeated that the patient had already died. 'Ms Adams will state that she was shocked by this and informed the nurses that the call should have been put out if there was no Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order in place.' Agbeko, who knew Patient A had already died, subsequently made two entries in woman's medical notes stating she was asleep at 4am and 6am. The nurse admits this, claiming that she was simply confused at the time of making the entries. She and Van Der Knaap deny all other allegations against them including making inadequate medical notes and failing to provide basic life support when they found the pensioner unresponsive. Stafford Hospital was the subject of a two-year public inquiry, which concluded last month, into its appalling standards of care. Official documents suggest up to 1,200 more patients than expected died at the Weston Road site between 2005 and 2008. Sir Robert Francis QC, who chaired the inquiry, has said the true figure may never be known. The central London hearing, which Agbeko is attending, but Van Der Knaap is not, continues.

Kevin Boyle's mother Patti, pictured today at court, has called for the Prime Minister to ban websites which sell 'suicide kits' A mother has called on the Prime Minister to ban websites which promote ways of committing suicide which she blames for her son's death. Kevin Boyle, 26, beat more than 1,500 competitors to become one of the original apprentices at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant where he cooked for Prince Charles and Oprah Winfrey. But the talented cook had a history of mental illness and was found dead about two miles from his home in Coulsdon, south London, in January last year, three months after going missing. His badly decomposed body was found with two notes and what is believed to be a suicide kit that had been bought for £44 from a foreign company on the internet. At his inquest at Croydon Coroner's Court yesterday, Kevin's mother Patti, 55, described the paraphernalia bought from the website as 'death in a bag'. The website has since been closed but she asked the coroner to write to David Cameron urging him to ban similar websites still selling 'encyclopaedias to end life'. She told the inquest of her heartache when she realised that a brown paper jiffy bag that she took delivery of for her son contained the tools for his death. At the time she thought it had contained cooking equipment. Sitting next to her husband Tom, 65, . she said: 'I believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that on the . balance of probabilities Kevin committed suicide. 'We have the email exchanges ordering the kit and arranging payment. Budding chef: Jamie Oliver with Kevin Boyle at the restaurant in Hoxton .

'Paraphernalia consistent with these items was retrieved by officers inspecting the site where Kevin was discovered.' The site Kevin bought the kit from . promised painless 'deliverance' and required no proof of terminal . illness or psychiatric assessment, just a photocopy of Kevin's passport. Mrs . Boyle asked the coroner to take the unusual step of writing to the . government to take action in what is known as a Rule 43 letter because . she wanted to lower the number of suicides in the UK. She . said: 'Currently assisted suicide websites have thousands of pages that . offer advice, instruction and the whole wherewithal, almost like an . encyclopaedia of methodologies to end life. 'A young person who is overwhelmed by . life and in a state of mental distress does not have the ability to be . able to look back and say ""I've come that far and I'm stronger for it.

'What . we want and seek the coroner's assistance with is to bring the problems . of these websites back to government because we believe that the . internet service providers should be held responsible for the material they have . displayed and they are penalised for it. 'We also want legislation that bans the UK-based sites.' So-called suicide websites have been linked to dozens of deaths in Britain over the last ten years. Promoting suicide is already outlawed under the 1961 Suicide Act, but this has never been used to prosecute a website operator. Happy memories: Kevin (centre) with brother Joseph and father Tom . Mrs . Boyle told the inquest it was Kevin's 'dream come true' to work for . Jamie Oliver and that the Channel 4 chef had been a constant support for . the family. And she described how the Fifteen restaurant had helped keep her troubled son alive. She . said: 'He wanted to be a chef from the age of four years old. When he . was selected for Jamie Oliver's it was all his dreams come true. Full of promise: Kevin as a toddler . 'Jamie Oliver and his team and everybody at Fifteen have been constant in their support for us as a family. 'Fifteen is like a lighthouse in a place of darkness, it offers people hope. When you are part of the Fifteen family they never let you go. 'Because of Fifteen I can happily say that as a family we had our son for ten years longer than we otherwise would have done.' No cause of death could be given because Kevin's body was in such a badly decomposed state when it was found, and the coroner returned an open verdict. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer warned of the difficulties in taming the internet but said he would write to the Prime Minister to ask him to look at the issue. He said: 'At the moment the government has not yet found a way of controlling the internet but I can understand your concerns and I'm proposing that I should write. 'I hope some good will come of it but the internet is a creature that has grown and grown out of control. I don't l know what is to be done but one should keep trying I'm sure. 'I'm very, very sorry you lost Kevin in such circumstances. We can't give you complete answers because of the time delay and state of the body. 'The likelihood is that he probably did take his own life but I have to be sure beyond reasonable doubt and I can't be.'","Kevin Boyle was found dead about two miles from his home in 2012 .

Jaymin Abdulrahman is alleged to have tried to kill her six-day-old baby by throwing it down a bin chute . A mother has told a court she 'lost control' of her thoughts before throwing her six-day-old baby down a tower-block rubbish chute. Jaymin Abdulrahman, said to have been suffering from a post-natal psychosis, told jurors she did not plan to cause any harm to the baby before the incident last September. The Crown alleges the 25-year-old Iraqi national deliberately placed her baby daughter into the chute with the intention of killing her. Abdulrahman, who denies attempted murder and inflicting grievous bodily harm, wept several times while giving evidence on the third day of her trial. Speaking through a Kurdish interpreter, she told the court she was in tears while cleaning her bathroom shortly before placing the baby in the chute. 'I was extremely sad,' she told jurors. 'I went to the living room, I put the baby in a rubbish bag and I threw her away. 'After I had done so, I just couldn’t believe what I had just done, and I couldn’t understand why I did it. 'I was in shock.' Answering questions from defence barrister Rachel Brand QC, Abdulrahman added that she had not 'planned' to do what she did and had not thought about what she was going to do. 'Even now as I am speaking to you, I am still in a state of disbelief of what I have done. Birmingham Crown Court heard that when the baby hit a metal plate at the . bottom of the chute it was travelling at around 32mph. Miraculously it . survived but suffered severe brain injuries including several skull . fractures . 'I have lost control of my thoughts when I did so. 'I can’t tell whether I was crying at the time or not, but I have done this. 'I wasn’t aware of what I was doing. 'If I thought that by doing so I would do some harm to the baby, I wouldn’t have done it.' Asking Abdulrahman about her time in hospital after giving birth, Miss Brand asked her client: 'Did you have any thoughts at all of causing harm to her?' The defendant replied: 'No. That kind of thought never came to me. This is something I could never imagine. 'I even despised people who were abusive to children.' Prosecutors said they believe Abdulrahman knew what she was doing and intended to kill the baby . Abdulrahman was 'tired, sad and exhausted' in the week after her daughter’s birth and unaware of why she was crying. At the start of the defence case, Miss Brand claimed Abdulrahman’s mental condition was so severe it prevented her from forming an intent to kill or cause serious injury to her daughter who fell more than 40ft into a bin store. The 25-year-old denies attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. Her daughter, whose name cannot be . published for legal reasons, suffered skull fractures and brain injuries . in the fall at a block of flats in Wolverhampton. Opening her client’s case to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court, Miss Brand urged the panel not to view her as a 'monster'. The lawyer conceded that the jury members’ hearts must have sank when they heard details of how the infant had been injured. Ms Brand told the panel of seven men . and five women: 'All I am asking you to do is to keep an open mind about . the evidence you are going to hear in the next stage of this case. 'You are going to hear evidence in the next few days that shows this defendant was suffering from post-natal depression.'

Describing Abdulrahman, who came to . the UK from Iraq in 2011, as a competent and loving mother, Miss Brand . also argued that her illness meant she was not capable of 'forming an . intent to either kill or cause really serious injury to her baby'.

The RSPCA is appealing for help after Bambi, a chestnut mare, was shot in the nose with a 20 inch bolt arrow, believed to be fired from a crossbow, in Barnsley, south Yorkshire. The injured pony was spotted by a horrified member of the public on Monday night at around 7pm in a field in Barnsley. Bambi was shot in the nose with a bolt arrow believed to have come from a crossbow . The member of the public contacted the RSPCA, however inspectors were not able to get near Bambi without causing further distress to the animal. Inspector Joanne Taylor called out a vet who assessed the horse from a distance and concluded it was safe to leave her until the owners arrived, as to catch her would have caused her more anxiety. Bambi was taken was to the equine unit of a local vet on Tuesday, where X-rays revealed the arrow had gone into the sinus four inches deep. Experts say that the chestnut mare was lucky the arrow hadn't gone through her face as she would have died . The arrow was removed and her puncture wound stitched up. Her owners, who do not wish to be named, said: 'We were horrified by what had happened, and so upset to think that someone was wandering around the area brandishing a dangerous weapon.' Vet Bill Black said: 'Bambi was extremely lucky that the arrow had not struck her in the forehead as she would have been dead.' The arrow was 20 inches long and was embedded four inches into the horse's sinus . Inspector Taylor said: 'This was a horrific and deliberate act of animal cruelty on a defenceless animal. 'The arrow had caused Bambi so much distress, every time she moved she banged it causing her more pain and it really unnerved her, you could tell she was terrified by what had happened. 'We believe this arrow bolt is likely to have been fired from a cross bow, the bolt had one red and two yellow quills on it.'","The 10-year-old horse has been shot in the face with a crossbow .

Hundreds of birds take a break during a 1000-mile flight by perching on telephone wires and enjoying the morning sunshine, in photos just released by a French nature photographer. The photos, taken last October, show barn swallows flying over a cemetery in France before settling and taking in the view high above a French cemetery. These agile birds perched on the wires and stayed there for 30 minutes before heading off as a flock towards Nigeria in Africa. Barn swallows are shown taking a rest from their migration to Africa last October by relaxing on telephone wires in Poitou in western France. The photos have just been released by French nature photographer Cyril Ruoso from Burgundy . Photographer Ruoso travelled to Poitou last October specifically to capture the barn swallows in flight. He set up his camera on top of a seven-metre high tripod to capture the images . The swallows were taking a rest from their migration to in Africa last October by relaxing in Poitou in West France. Nature photographer Cyril Ruoso, from Lailly in Burgundy, France, travelled to Poitou to capture this moment and had to be careful not to touch the wire. The 42-year-old said: 'Swallows are gregarious birds, they like to be in pack, especially before they leave for migration. Four out of the six breeds of barn swallows are classed as 'strongly migratory'. They can travel from all over Europe and migrate to Africa, Argentina and northern Australia. Some breeds have been recorded covering up to 11,660 kilometres on their annual migration. Barn . swallows have been known to travel in flock numbers of a hundred up to a . thousand as they migrate to Africa, Argentina, Australia and other . countries in the Southern Hemisphere. There are believed to be around 190 billion barn swallows worldwide . 'The young birds are the first to gather. 'Wires are a good option as they are safe against terrestrial predators and they can still communicate between themselves. 'They fly around and are looking for a good location to relax and catch the sun in the morning. 'There are several hundreds of birds on the wire, but when they reach the roosting place in Africa, there could well be several million.' Barn swallows can live in Europe, Asia, Africa and America and the moment reminded Mr Ruoso of his childhood. He said: 'It reminds me when I was kid in the French countryside, and I used to watch these birds on my way to school. 'They stayed on their wires for half an hour, enough time for them to enjoy the sunshine. 'But it's sad that every year before they migrate there are less and less swallows on the wires. Ruoso said this particular breed of barn swallow were heading to Nigeria as part of their annual migration. These birds would have undertaken a journey of around 1,000 miles but other barn swallows have been known to fly over 11,000 miles during migration season . 'And in order to capture this moment I have to plan it - you can't do it with regular equipment.

Lorna Vickerage ran away with ‘family friend’ John Bush three days after being taken from home and placed in foster care by social services. Detectives urgently want to trace the ‘vulnerable’ teenager and are concerned about Bush because he is known to be a ‘liar, fraud and cheat’. Scroll down for video . Missing: Schoolgirl Lorna Vickerage (left), 14, and former car dealer John Bush (right), 35, both of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, are thought to have been in the Highfields area of the town over the past two days . South Yorkshire Police say they do . not know what his motives are for going off with the girl, but he is . wanted for abduction of a child. Lorna’s mother and father have appealed for her to hand herself in and stressed she is not in trouble. Her father, Darren Griffiths, urged . her to come home. ‘She’s quite independent,’ he said. ‘She’s usually . quite sensible. But, obviously, I don’t know exactly what’s going off in . her head at the minute. ‘She’s quite mixed up. There’s been a lot going off lately.

Police believe that they may be . travelling in a silver Ford Mondeo, registration number Y753 CSH, which . Bush had borrowed and not returned. School: The teenager was last seen on Monday at 2.30pm at Outwood Academy (pictured today) in Adwick in her school uniform, although South Yorkshire Police said it was unlikely that she will still be wearing this . Bush, who is single, is a family . friend. He has convictions for dishonesty and was given a suspended . prison sentence earlier this year for frauds, including failing to . return courtesy cars to garages and failing to pay for a holiday . cottage. ‘What does concern me is he’s a liar, he’s a fraud, he’s a cheat and it’s what he’s telling Lorna,’ said Mr Robinson. ‘She is with a man three times her . age who has no parental responsibility for her. He should not be with . her. Where has he taken her, what’s he doing with her?’ In a message to the teenager, Mr . Robinson said: ‘Lorna, you’re not in trouble. Your mum’s petrified, . we’re concerned for your safety. Let us know you’re safe and well.’ Questions: South Yorkshire Police Detective Chief Inspector Craig Robinson (centre) spoke to reporters at a press conference this morning outside Doncaster Police Station over the disappearance of Lorna . Lorna Vickerage is on the run with a man who sparked a nationwide manhunt two years ago. After he was found, John Bush was said in court to have spun a web of lies from Hertfordshire to Yorkshire, as he conned his way to thousands of pounds worth of goods and services. He managed to get a  courtesy car from a Watford garage while his non-existent Porsche 4x4 was being ‘repaired’, before driving the £13,000 borrowed car north then abandoning it near York. The ‘professional fraudster’ also asked a Thirsk garage to carry out £1,800 of repairs to another car he did not own, drove off in a second courtesy car and never went back to pay, the court heard. Bush was given a 14-month suspended jail sentence in February this year for fraud, as well as 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £3,400 in compensation to some of his victims. At the time of the frauds, he was said to have been homeless and in financial trouble. He had been in a relationship with a drug addict, but this had then ended and he was caring for an elderly man.","Lorna Vickerage and John Bush both from Doncaster, South Yorkshire .

Two officers confronted murderer David O’Sullivan, 28, on his doorstep after neighbours reported hearing a commotion on Christmas Eve. O’Sullivan, who had scratches on his arm and other signs of a struggle, told officers: 'Everything is OK.'

Two police officers confronted killer David O'Sullivan (left) on his doorstep but left the house without realising mum-of-three Charmaine Macmuiris (right) was lying fatally wounded just feet away . She was found dead at O’Sullivan’s home on Christmas Day and he was jailed for life earlier this week. Dyfed-Powys Police referred their investigation to the Independent Police Complaints Commission after O’Sullivan was charged with murder. The watchdog then referred the case back to the force to investigate itself. An internal review found no wrong doing by the officers who left the scene without checking for Ms Macmuiris inside. A Dyfed Powys Police spokesmn said: 'The extent of police attendance and engagement at the address in Carmarthen on the 24 December 2012 was disclosed in full in court.

Prosecutor Patrick Harrington QC told the court: 'When police officers asked him about cuts to his arm he said he had punched a hole in the wall. 'But it is clear serious violence began inside the house with strong indications there was more than one assault. 'The second and fatal attack saw him use a knife to stab her to death.' Ms Macmuiris was discovered at O'Sullivan's home in Maes yr Ysgol, Carmarthen, on Christmas Day . The court heard how O’Sullivan, who was well known to police, was a jealous and controlling boyfriend. He stabbed Ms Macmuiris to death at his home in Carmarthen, west Wales, after becoming convinced she was seeing other men behind his back. The court heard how close police officers came to finding her before she died from her wounds. But her bloodied body was only found the next day when O’Sullivan’s parents came to celebrate Christmas with him.","Two officers confronted murderer at his home on the night he killed girlfriend .

But energetic night owls have found the solution by working out at 24 hour gyms. While gyms opening their doors to members overnight isn't a new concept, it is increasingly becoming more popular. Those taking advantage of the extended opening times include night shift workers using their 'lunch' hour as an . opportunity to exercise, those who are self-conscious and don't want to . be seen by a lot of people when they're working out, or those who simply . want to avoid the gym at peak times when it's busy. Flexible fitness: More people are joining gyms with 24 hour access . Virtual instructor: Pure Gym offer a late night spinning class where members are led via a video broadcast at the front of the class . Fitness fan John Napier, 29, from Wood Green, London, said the latter is one of the main reasons why he hits the gym while others may be hitting the sack. He told the MailOnline: 'My job is demanding and I work long hours but I don't want . that to be an excuse not to workout. 'I usually get to the gym between . 10pm and 11pm four times a week, which means it's quieter and I can . use the machines without queuing. It suits my lifestyle perfectly.' Pure Gym - who aim to offer affordable fitness with membership from £10.99 a month - have 49 gyms across the UK . that are operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As well as being able to use the . equipment, members can take part in a virtual spin class. The class is . led by an instructor via a pre-recorded video played on a large TV in front of the bikes. A . spokesman for the company said the classes - and their 24 hour access - is becoming increasingly popular. Working out after dark: The 24 hour access is popular with those with busy lives or who want to avoid the gym at peak times . Place to yourself: Pure Gym say it's perfectly safe to work out over night as they use CCTV and links to the emergency services . They said: 'The majority of our nocturnal customers are shift workers including NHS, . police and fire service employees. We also see a lot of lorry drivers, . people who work in the hospitality industry and students. 'I usually get to the gym between . 10pm and 11pm which means it's quieter and I can . use the machines without queuing' 'Although the . majority of those people exercising outside of 'normal' operating hours . are there because they are fitting exercise in around their working . patterns, there are others who simply prefer to work out late at night, . or perhaps have children to look after during the day.' Pure Gym estimate that 24 per cent of their of members train between 10pm - 6am. Meanwhile, The Gym, another company with branches across the UK, are also open 24 hours a day to members. Research they carried out last year found that one in ten members use the gym between 10pm and 6am, . with 52 per cent of these visits taking place around midnight. The research also revealed that 83 . per cent of gym goers are now more likely to join one with 24-hour . access so they can fit it into their busy schedule. At Mark Anthony's Notting Hill gym, members gain 24 hour access via fingerprint technology . Both Pure Gym and The Gym give . members the ability to access their equipment by giving them a unique . pin number so they can enter the locked building when it's not fully . manned by staff. At the swanky Mark Anthony gym in London's Notting Hill, they have a more high tech solution to allow their members - including celebrities such as Lucy Mecklenburgh and Caroline Flack - access to the gym when it suits them. Fingerprint recognition is used so members can enter the gym 24 hours a day. Some . people may have safety concerns about working out when a gym is not fully staffed and personal trainers are not on hand to advise if they are exercising properly. The spokesman for Pure Gym said: '""Is it safe?"" is a question that comes up regularly when people are considering joining a 24 hour gym, and our answer is always: yes! It is perfectly safe. 'Reports from customers are that they always feel very safe. They know there is extensive CCTV throughout the gym, there is always someone working in the club no matter what time of day or night they visit, and they know that additional assistance is only seconds away, with a call button within easy reach no matter where they are within one of our gyms.' Pure Gym and The Gym have panic buttons linked to the emergency services that members can press if needed when using the gym over night and members will also have had an induction upon joining on how to use the equipment. The Gym state on their website: 'There are several help buttons in The Gym should you need emergency assistance during unmanned hours. The entire Gym is monitored closely by CCTV during these hours.' But what of the effects on health of exercising at night? People are commonly advised not to workout close to going to bed because of a belief it can cause a bad night's sleep and hinder the ability to drop off. 'For most people exercise at any time seems to be better for sleep than no exercise at all' But a recent study by the National Sleep Foundation debunked this theory. They found that: 'Those who report exercising close to bedtime... do not demonstrate a difference in self-reported sleep quality. In fact, for most people exercise at any time seems to be better for sleep than no exercise at all.' They added that: 'The National Sleep Foundation has amended its sleep recommendations for 'normal' sleepers to encourage exercise without any caveat to time of day as long as it's not at the expense of sleep.' Dr Barbara Phillips who was involved in the study added: 'Exercise is beneficial to sleep. It's time to revise global recommendations for improving sleep and put exercise - any time - at the top of our list for healthy sleep habits.'","Fitness fans are increasingly signing up for 24 hour access to the gym .

The female wild asparagus was discovered in Portland, Dorset, in 1997. But it was the only survivor of the species in the area and, with no male nearby, it could not propagate – unlike most plants, asparagus has separate sexes, so to reproduce a male must pollinate a female. Experts hunted for a mate, but the endangered wild asparagus is found at only 28 locations across the country. The loneliest plant in Britain: The rare female wild asparagus has been saved after a specimen in the wilds of Dorset was mated with a male partner from 175 miles away in Cornwall . Success: Experts from five different agencies worked together to search for the plants, which are now thriving . It wasn’t until 2006 that experts found a male variety in Cornwall which they carefully moved to Dorset and then rubbed its pollen on the female’s stigmas. Her fertilised flowers then grew, producing bright red berries which each containedsix seeds. These were recovered, sowed in pots and grown in greenhouses. After two years, 60 plants were deemed to be strong enough to plant out in the wild where they have spent the last five years. Botanists from five different agencies - the National Trust, Natural England, the . National Museum of Wales, the Dorset Wildlife Trust and the Dorset Environmental Records Centre - have made fruitless return trips to the site to see if the young plants had flowered. But it wasn’t until their most recent visit yesterday that they could finally declare the project a success. Out of the original 60 plants, 51 are thriving and 11 of them - seven males and four females - have now flowered for the first time, meaning they can reproduce. Wild asparagus is found in only 28 sites in the UK, mainly in coastal areas in Cornwall and south Wales, and its habitat is being steadily reduced. It was thought they were extinct in Dorset until the female was found but experts said it was only a matter of time before she died out. The plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste . The plant is different from the garden asparagus that is popular to eat because it grows flat along the ground and has smaller spears that have a bitter taste. The 60 plants were planted in two groups of 30; one on the causeway linking Weymouth and Portland alongside the lone female and the other near to Portland Bill lighthouse. Janet Lister, a conservation advisor for the National Trust, said: 'It has taken them quite a while to mature but at long-last they are starting to flower which means they can sustain themselves. 'Although there are only 11 of them flowering at the moment, the key thing is that both male and females are flowering on both sites. 'We are confident it will only be a matter of time before the other young plants come into flower. 'The aim is to secure the population of wild asparagus in Dorset and we are very hopeful that that is going to happen.' Bryan Edwards, an ecological surveyor at the Dorset Environmental Records Centre, said: 'We brought up a Cornish boy to have a bit of fun with our Dorset girl in 2006 and since then it has been a waiting game. 'Because their natural habitat is in an exposed, hostile environment like sea cliffs it has taken the seedlings a bit longer to grow and start to flower. 'To stand any chance of long term survival, a wild asparagus colony needs to contain plants of both sexes. 'Any colony reduced to a single plant is ultimately doomed to extinction. 'The males have a different size and shape of flower.' As well as conserving a rare and endangered plant, it is hoped the genes from the wild asparagus could be introduced to the garden variety to make them more drought tolerant. Wild asparagus appear to benefit from the North Atlantic Drift, the sea current that keeps the south west relatively warm, which is why they are found in coastal areas. Painstaking: The female plant produced 60 seeds which were carefully propagated in a greenhouse and then planted in the wild .","The rare female wild asparagus specimen has successfully mated .

If you're sick of walking around with an embarrassing gape in the front of your blouse, then Marks & Spencer could have the answer. The high street favourite has developed a 'No Peep' shirt, which uses a hidden placket - a finished opening that allows for movement - and concealed extra buttons to banish gaping for good. Although the innovation is currently limited to a couple of shirts in the Autograph range, from August, all shirts sold by the brand will include the 'No Peep' placket. No more embarrassment: Marks & Spencer's new 'no peep' shirts have hidden buttons and an extra placket . 'In the past, feedback sessions have found that many of our customers have had issues with their shirt buttons gaping open to reveal their undergarments,' said M&S Collection's Head of Design, Neil Hendy. 'In response to this we have developed the No Peep shirt. It’s ideal for women with a bigger bust but also helps provide a cleaner line for all shapes. 'They have been so popular since the launch in March that we will be incorporating this technology into all M&S Collection shirts with a placket by the end of July.' No Peep technology isn't the only design innovation made by the high street retailer in recent months. Last week, the retailer announced the launch of the 'Drop A Dress Size' dress, which uses a supportive lining to create the illusion of a slimmer physique. New talent: Former Jaeger CEO Belinda Earl has been hired to reinvigorate M&S womenswear . According to M&S, the slimming dresses give a more defined waist and a smoother silhouette thanks to the lining, which is made from fabric used in the retailer's shapewear line. Marks & Spencer has had a rough ride in recent years with commentators and customers deriding collections as dowdy and unflattering. That however could all be about to change thanks to the introduction of useful innovations such as the no peep shirt and the appointment of Jaeger's former CEO Belinda Earl as the retailer's new style director. 'I want women to be proud of a garment when they take it off and hang it on the back of a chair,’ Earl, who is also behind the no peep innovation told MailOnline columnist, Liz Jones. Earl, who says she is most proud of the brand's £25 no peep white shirts, added: 'Buttons are concealed so it stops you gaping, which is great if you have a big bust.’","Shirt has extra placket (opening allowing movement) and concealed buttons .

Not only have style icons such as Alexa Chung and Heidi Klum been spotted out and about in them, but they’ve also been all over the catwalks. And while it might not be a surprise to see them championed by designers who target the youth market, such as House of Holland and Moschino Cheap & Chic, grown-up labels, including Stella McCartney and Margaret Howell, have come up with their versions, too. Their chic designs prompted me to wonder if I, a grandmother in her early 70s, could carry off such a look. The last time I stepped out in dungarees was in the late Eighties. Made from thick, brushed cotton with a fake fur trim, they were bottle green and even had a matching jacket. Back in fashion: Trendsetters Alexa Chung, left and Keira Knightley have been pictured in dungarees recently but could grandmother Sandra Howard pull them off? Scroll down to find out...

And there’s no doubt that they would look incredibly cute on someone younger - and not just my toddling grandchildren. But sadly, I felt like an old sheep in them. Dungarees have always had slightly child-like connotations - maybe it’s because we dress babies in them or that they used to be almost uniform for children’s TV presenters - either way, these felt as if they lived down to that stereotype. I’ve usually got no problem wearing clothes designed for any age. In the past, I’ve swapped clothes with my daughter, Larissa, who’s in her 30s, so that’s not a problem for me. I don’t think any of my children would be shocked to see me in what might be considered a young trend. But these just looked a little bit off.

I did once own a pair like these, but they were strictly for gardening. I felt self-conscious in these as the cut requires rather more up top than I possess. Women with big busts might shy away from dungarees, but they’d be wrong. For me, the heavier fabric made them less forgiving, they didn’t drape nicely and they added inches to my hips. They made me feel like a farmhand and got me to wondering if the name dungarees had come about because this was the sort of thing you’d wear to shift dung.

Maybe with some brighter accessories they might have made more of an impact, but these seemed to struggle to find their identity. Though they wouldn’t be my first choice for gallivanting around town, this experiment has inspired me to give dungarees another go. I think many women my age would shy away from them, perhaps thinking they wouldn’t be flattering or that they could look foolish. But if you like trouser suits, you can wear dungarees. Just pick the right pair, team them with a nice pair of heels and they won’t look remotely as if you’re a child or a decorator. Honestly! Chic: Pewter sequin top, £85, DKNY at Fenwick, 020 7629 916.

The silk fabric seemed to hang in a flattering way, and though I worried they might bulge in all the wrong places, in fact they’re kind to a pear shape. Short sleeves made my arms feel exposed, so I’d probably wear a longer sleeved top, maybe in white for contrast. These dungarees could take the place of a trouser suit.

I didn't buy into onesies - they were reminiscent of those awful bodies we wore in the Nineties that you had to do up under your crotch. Dungarees are more wear-able, but you have to pay a bit of attention when you go to the loo that the straps don’t disappear into the pan. These spotty ones were easy to slip on and off, as you have to undo only one strap. I can see these working as a lunch outfit or even as office wear. Dungarees are far more forgiving than trousers. My best feature is my waist and they defined that without hugging my bottom. You don’t quite know what’s going on inside, so they do a good job of hiding things. I don’t think that my husband Michael would object to them, though he might just think I was wearing trousers and a top.

"By . Barbara Metcalfe . PUBLISHED: . 16:48 EST, 12 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:04 EST, 13 June 2013 . Two o'clock in the morning and I'm sitting on the side of the bed, drenched in sweat. It's minus five outside, yet the skylight window is wide open and a fan is whirring by my side. The damp bed is so uncomfortable that I have to change the sheets and pillowcases before I can go back to sleep - even though I need to be up in four hours' time. When it's at its worst - at least once a month - I sleep in the spare bedroom. Peter, my other half, has been incredibly supportive, even though he's been as sleep-deprived as me over the years. I'd love to pause the 'change' - my menopause is a 'waking nightmare', says Barbara Metcalfe . This waking nightmare is my menopause - my so-called 'change'. It's four years since it started, I have no idea when it will end and it's causing my life to disintegrate around me. I hate and resent it, and cannot understand why any woman would relish it. But apparently some do. Indeed, in last week's Femail, Jenni Murray, the esteemed broadcaster and journalist, offered the somewhat controversial view that the menopause 'ushers in the best years of a woman's life'. She was writing in response to research which claims women will eventually evolve out of the menopause, as we continue to have children later and later. I'm afraid I cannot meet it with 'courage and adventure' as Jenni suggests. Any sense of adventure I might have had has been long lost in the myriad of ailments and conditions I am grappling with. Since the onset of  menopause I have not been able to wear shoes indoors, as my feet are so hot. Even on the coldest day I sit in meetings, colleagues in fur-lined boots staring bemused at my bare toes. I wear thin linen clothing throughout the year and even then I find being in most buildings impossible. A trip to the local supermarket is like an invitation to a sauna. You'll always find me in chilled foods. There really is nothing like a hot flush. If you've never had one, you may think it's just like going red with embarrassment. But it's so much worse. It starts from within - like molten lava - and slowly takes you over. Controversial: Jenni Murray believes that menopause 'ushers in the best years of a woman's life' It stops me mid-task and I am overwhelmed by the heat. It makes my ears ring and I feel sick and forget what I am doing or what I am saying. Sometimes the side-effects are so debilitating and distressing that it's tempting not to leave home.When I did make it to work - until last year I was a producer at the BBC - I would find myself erupting into huge rages over the office heating. 'If it's 25 degrees you should be on a beach in a bikini,' I would shout, and ram the thermostat down to 16c. I once actually snarled: 'I am the producer, I will decide what temperature to have.' To get out of bed in the morning is a relief from the night sweats, but then begins a day marred by terrible tiredness, hot flushes and confusion. I constantly write lists so I don't forget things. On bad days I feel as if I'm losing my mind, just clinging on to reality. So much for a sense of adventure! My menopause started when I was 50 and had a total hysterectomy. Abnormal cells were found in my womb, which if left could have led to cancer, so I had  my womb and ovaries removed. With my ovaries went my supply of the female hormone oestrogen. Instead of having the slow dwindle of fertility that nature intends, I had what's called a surgical menopause, when everything happens at once. I was still hooked up to a drip the day after surgery when the first sweats arrived. There was very little discussion in hospital about what I was to expect, as if the surgery and the after-effects were completely unrelated. I left hospital with nothing more than the internet to guide me. I found myself reading about all kinds of cures, from the conventional (hormone replacement therapy) to herbal remedies (black cohosh and red clover) and the utterly bizarre medication which is oestrogen extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. I went down the conventional route, and, full of hope, began a course of HRT. Within days, my breasts felt painful and engorged. I became depressed and confused and -worse - the sweats and flushes didn't even abate. 'Oh, did I mention the mood swings? I . didn't just snarl about the air conditioning, one minute I was ranting . at the poor dog for getting under my feet, the next I was in floods of . tears when I'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen.' I gave it some time for the tablets to kick in - during which my already huge bosom went up a full cupsize - but I only became more bloated, itchy and frankly miserable. So, about six months later I came off it. I tried red clover and other natural remedies but quickly realised nothing was going to work. So I took nothing. I sometimes think I genuinely do have dementia, such is my lack of recall at times. My children laugh at me kindly, because I use the wrong words and forget key names and dates. I once told them an elderly neighbour had to be taken to prison, which had them flabbergasted. Eventually they discovered I meant hospital. After my operation, my once impressive memory was shot to pieces. Suddenly I couldn't remember the names of colleagues I'd worked with for years. One reporter was called Hilary so often she started answering to it – even though she's really called Naomi. I finally left my job at the BBC, which was in part down to the menopause. The building was incredibly hot and I found I was so exhausted when I got home. Oh, did I mention the mood swings? I didn't just snarl about the air conditioning, one minute I was ranting at the poor dog for getting under my feet, the next I was in floods of tears when I'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen. And if my mind was breaking down, my body felt like an alien being, too. The lack of oestrogen has left the skin on my arms and legs dehydrated and itchy, which drives me to despair. Sometimes I scratch until I bleed, even though there is no rash to be seen. My hair is turning into a Brillo pad - I resemble Hagrid, the Robbie Coltrane character in Harry Potter.I feel as if I have taken the express route to old age. The menopause is still thought of as something women just have to get on with, and this means, on top of all my symptoms, I feel like a failure because I struggle to cope. When my grandmother was going through The Change, there was no discussion about it at all. Likewise my mum, a district nurse, had to get on her bike and visit her patients as if she hadn't a care in the world. It's getting hot in here: For those with the menopause, hot flushes can be deeply debilitating . It was a personal battle women kept to themselves. My friend's mum would vacuum in her bra and skirt because of her hot flushes. Yet nothing was ever said, and no one ever questioned her. That was 30 years ago and it appears nothing much has changed. Like generations of women before me, I have to get on with it. I have two young daughters, a partner and a dog, and an exciting job as a freelance TV producer, writer and lecturer. The alarm goes off daily at 6am and there is no going back to bed. Yet some of the effects of the menopause are illnesses in themselves. Just imagine a man or young woman waking repeatedly in the night, clothes soaked through and having to change the bed. Would they just get up in the morning and go to work? More than likely they would ring in sick and get a sympathetic hearing. But I wonder how many older women would do that. Ring in and talk menopause with their bosses? No thanks. Recently, a friend had to take some time off work to recover from the fallout of her menopause. On her return, she was interviewed by two young male managers about her leave. She tried to explain her  problems, but they stopped her mid-flow. Either they couldn't cope with 'women's problems' or they just didn't want to know. Luckily for me, my doctor told me about clinical trials of specific anti-depressants, which had shown promising results controlling night sweats and flushes in menopausal women. So far they are helping me, but they're all I have. Because there is just no cure for this force of nature. If there was, I am sure I would be first in a very long line of women wanting it.","Barbara's menopause started when she had a total hysterectomy .

"By . Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 07:54 EST, 14 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:55 EST, 14 June 2013 . A Brooklyn high school teacher escaped jail yesterday after she pleaded guilty to having sex with a 16-year-old student. Erin Sayar, 37, lost her teaching license over the scandal as well as her marriage after her husband filed divorce papers in January and moved out of their Park Slope apartment. Heavily-tattooed Sayar was an English teacher at James Madison High School. When the judge asked her yesterday if she had sex with teenager Kevin Eng she said yes. Married mother: Erin Sayar, 37, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse . Marriage over:  Erin Sayar, left, is being divorced by husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, in the aftermath of last year's scandal that she repeatedly slept with a student . 'They stated to me that they don’t want to see the defendant spend time . in jail,' Assistant District Attorney Serena Horowitz said, implying . that Eng no longer has hard feelings toward Sayar. 'The complainant and his family are amenable to the offer,' the New York Post reports. Sayar was arrested last May and charged with 50 counts of statutory rape and sexual abuse. Authorities said that the 37-year-old . had both oral sex and intercourse with the teen at least eight times in . her SUV and in her office at the school. She is also said to have plied the teen with marijuana which she keeps hidden in her filing cabinet. The mother-of-one was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office . while his teammates were using the weight room next door. The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November. Allegations: She pleaded guilty to having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School . Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (center) as she left court last June with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her . Consequences: Sayer has been placed on 10-years probation and may have to sign as a sex offender for the rest of her life . After hacking Eng's Facebook account, . the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so . much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'. Sayar replied: 'Oh no - I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.","Alleged affair was uncovered last year when the 16-year-old's girlfriend hacked his Facebook account .

A photo of Iranian President Ahmadinejad hugging Hugo Chavez's mother at the late Venezuelan leader's funeral has sparked controversy among conservative Muslim clerics. The image shows Ahmadinejad and Elena Frias de Chavez touching cheeks during a moment of shared grief. But religious conservatives say his actions are 'sinful' under Islamic doctrine which forbids Muslim men from touching women outside their immediate family. Controversy: This photo of President Ahmadinejad closely embracing Elena Frias de Chavez was slammed by religious conservatives in Iran . They claim the act . insulted Iran's religious dignity and amounted to 'haram' – a term used . to describe a religiously forbidden act under Islamic rules. Mohammad Taghi Rahbar, the Friday prayer . leader of Iran's second city, Isfahan, told Mehr news agency that Mr . Ahmadinejad had 'lost control'. He added: 'Shaking hands with a non-mahram (unrelated by family) woman, under any circumstances, whether young or old, is not allowed. Hugging or expressing emotions is improper for the dignity of the president of a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran.' President Ahmadinejad has already come under fire from conservatives loyal to Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, for posting a blog last week in tribute to Hugo Chavez which predicted he would return with Jesus Christ 'on resurrection day'. Friends: Ahmadinejad has already been criticised for a blog which he posted in tribute to Hugo Chavez claiming he would one day be resurrected alongside Jesus Christ . Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a senior Iranian cleric, said: 'I say directly that he went too far with what he mentioned in his tribute.' 'The president is well aware that such a tribute will provoke reactions in our religious institutes. He could have sent a diplomatic message with no religious connotations.' The controversy surrounding the photograph became even more confused when one of Iran's newspapers accused the Daily Telegraph newspaper of having photoshopped the image 'amateurishly'. Another photo claiming to be the original was circulated which showed Ahmadinejad embracing one of Chavez's uncles. But it was soon established that in fact this was a fake and the Entekhab news website apologised, blaming a rogue reporter for the error.

"The calendar says May 1 but it might as well be winter . 5 inches or more of snow will be the norm from Cheyenne south to Denver . Snow will quickly turn into a slushy mess . Shorts and T-shirt weather on Monday, winter jackets Wednesday . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 08:23 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:27 EST, 1 May 2013 . It may be May, but a blast of cold air that's being brought southwards by the jet stream means parts of the Rockies, Plains and Midwest are to have record spring snowfalls today. Nearly two feet of snow is forecast for the mountains of Colorado and Wyoming, where heavy snow has already begun falling. The National Weather Service says several inches could also fall by the end of the week in a band of wintry weather stretching from Texas to Wisconsin. Scroll down for video... Snow joke: Snow clings to flowers in Denver on Wednesday morning. As much as a foot of snow is forecast for some areas of Colorado . Whiteout: A May snowstorm is expected to dump an unprecedented six to nine inches of snow from Denver to as far west as Minneapolis . Winter blast: The storm is expected to dump between 5 and 8 inches of snow on the city of Devner . Meteorologists said the amount of snowfall could be 'historic.' Some portions of the Plains and upper Midwest regions, including Wisconsin and sections of Minnesota, could see a flurry of wet snow on Wednesday night into Thursday. Cheyenne, Wyoming received more than 8 inches of snow earlier today according to weather.com and was on the verge of breaking its May snowfall record of 14 inches. The sudden drop in temperatures mean there are some astounding differences in temperatures over just a couple of days. Today Amarillo, Texas forecast is snowing and 30 degrees. Yesterday it hit a high of 97. Minneapolis, Kansas City and Des Moines, Iowa, have been basking in the 70s and 80s but will be lucky to hit 40 by the end of the week. Slushy: Jennifer Duensing, takes careful steps on a slippery sidewalk during the Wednesday morning snow in Boulder, Colorado . Cause: A southerly dip in the jet stream means colder weather that usually stays further north is brought down to the Rockies, Plains and Midwest . Delays: Only around 16 flights have been cancelled this morning but the number is expected to increase as the storm gets worse . Weather Channel meteorologist Kevin Roth said 'In Amarillo we’re projecting a 67-degree drop from Tuesday afternoon to Thursday morning – so summer to winter.' 'Cheyenne had eight inches as of midnight their time, and it’s been snowing steadily since then,' he said. 'We think they’re going to end up with a good 12 to 18. … Welcome to May, right?' The heaviest snowfall will be along the Front Range of the Rockies, with an area from central Colorado to southeastern Wyoming under winter storm warnings that call for up to 20 inches of fresh snow through Wednesday night. Denver, could see five to eight inches of accumulation during the period, and roads could become icy and packed with snow. It's likely there will be disruptions to travel as a result of the storm. The late winter blast has forced the Colorado Department of Transportation to dip into its contingency fund to keep the plows on the road. Icey: Dan Hopkins, rides his way to work during the Wednesday morning snow in Boulder, Colorado . Cleanup: Cities like Denver are having to dig into their contingency funds in order to clear the snow. Most places had parked up their snow plows until next winter . CDOT was allocated of $60.9 million for snow removal for the season. The late season snow storms has put the department over its budget. Wednesday's snowstorm is expected to cost CDOT at least $2 million. Temperatures since last weekend have all been in the 70's and 80's and even near 90 in some spots. The warm is ground is warm which means more snow will fall than will actually pile up. There will be more than 60 plows working the Denver metro area Wednesday. Interstates 25 and 80 between Wyoming and Colorado are likely to suffer difficult driving conditions in line for possible snow and ice. This morning, FlightAware.com listed only 16 canceled flights in the region, all at Denver International Airport. Although this storm is likely to set records and heavy snow is rare, temperatures across the North American continent can range dramatically. The Canadian cities of Montreal, Quebec, and Ottawa, Ontario will be up to 40 degrees warmer than the usually warm Oklahoma City.","The calendar says May 1 but it might as well be winter .

Farcically, after devouring such huge sums of money, Qatada has dropped his appeal against being sent back to Jordan on terror charges. He intends to leave the country voluntarily – providing a new treaty protecting his human rights is ratified. The revelations will fuel the debate over the huge sums being spent on legal aid. Over the past eight years, Qatada’s lawyers have been paid £864,944, according to figures released by the Home Office yesterday. Of this, the authorities have managed to claw back only £217,286 by selling assets belonging to the preacher, who was once dubbed ‘Osama bin Laden’s spiritual ambassador in Europe’. The cost to the Government of trying to boot him out has been a further £938,630 in the domestic courts, and £130,018 at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It gives a net total of £1,716,306, the Home Office said in a letter to the Commons home affairs select committee. Chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘I am shocked that Abu Qatada’s legal costs alone could have employed 90 new constables for  a year.’ Qatada has repeatedly used human rights laws to thwart his removal to Jordan. Battle: Home Secretary Theresa May has negotiated a new treaty on human rights with Jordan in a bid to deport Qatada . He claimed his trial for plotting a terror attack would be unfair because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. This argument, originally rejected by the British courts, was upheld by judges in Strasbourg. It forced Home Secretary Theresa May to seek new legal guarantees from Jordan that Qatada’s rights would not be breached. The case then began again in the British courts and was expected to take years. But in a shock move earlier this year,  Qatada said he would return home voluntarily when the treaty Mrs May agreed with  Jordan was signed – probably by the end of this month. Qatada is behind bars in London’s Belmarsh prison after breaching a bail condition that restricts use of mobile phones and other communication devices. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be disgusted at the amount of their cash this vile hate preacher has cost us. ‘On top of these legal costs for the Government, there is the legal aid and benefits he has enjoyed, not to mention security costs. ‘The European Court of Human Rights has effectively landed British taxpayers with this eye-watering bill.’","Outraged MPs say the money could have employed 90 PCs a year .

A 15-year-old schoolboy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a young father - in a children’s playground. Danny Parekh, 21, was found bleeding from a single stab wound to the leg shortly after 1am yesterday. He was taken to hospital but later died. The injury was believed to have severed an artery. Victim: Danny Parekh (21) died from a single stab wound to the leg after being attacked in a park in Nottingham in the early hours of Sunday morning . The 15-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the killing, in Nottingham, later in the day. Witnesses heard Danny screaming in agony after he was attacked at the playground in Basford, Nottingham, in the early hours of Sunday morning. He was rushed to the Queen’s Medical Centre in the city but died shortly after arriving. Danny, who had a two-year-old son, was described by friends and family as 'a great, humble lad, who would do anything for anybody'. Friend Tanny Smith, 25, said: 'He was a good guy, always up for a laugh and a joke, he would do anything for anybody. I just went to the pub with him last week. It still hasn’t sunken in. I am in shock.' Park: Friends and family left tributes at the playground in Old Basford, Nottingham where Danny was stabbed . Tributes: Friends left flowers for Danny at the play area in Old Basford, Nottingham, where the father-of-one was fatally stabbed in the early hours of sunday morning . Another friend, Benji Nebs, 26, added: 'He was a good lad, humble, always had a smile on his face, and always had something good to say. He never had any trouble with anyone. He was polite and would always say ""hello"" to everybody and he was very popular.' Dozens of people turned out at the park where he died yesterday to pay their respects and leave flowers. One tribute read: 'Gone but never forgotten. Love, Rhea and Nikita'. Another read: 'Danny, love you so much. All love, love, Kingston and Kingsley.' 'Gone but not forgotten': Danny was taken to hospital but later died from the injury, which was believed to have severed an artery . A 27-year-old woman, who lives next to the park where Danny was found, called the ambulance after she had been woken up by 'a very high-pitched howl'. Crime scene: one neighbour said she was terrified after the incident and wanted to move away . The mum-of-four, who did not want to be named, said the sound of the screams made her physically ill. She said: 'It knocked me sick. When I heard the screams, I looked out of the window and saw a girl screaming hysterically. 'Then I saw she was leaning over Danny, who sat up, but slumped down, which is when I realised he was in trouble. 'I can’t believe this has happened, I will move out tomorrow. I want my children away from here. 'The kids are not stupid, they know what’s going on. My nine-year-old son was on the floor rocking - petrified. 'Danny was a brilliant lad, always showing his pure white teeth.' A postmortem examination was carried out by a Home Office pathologist yesterday evening.

For those of us who would never dream of going to music festivals, the attraction of dodgy sound systems and fields turned into mud baths has always been a bit of a mystery. No more. The secret behind the success of many summer festivals is that they’re not really about music. Fans are now more likely to go to a festival to take drugs, get drunk or sleep with a stranger than actually listen to the music, a study found. A quarter say they have slept with a stranger, 21 per cent taken drugs, and 13 per cent got into a fight. Survey: Only 45% of those who attend festivals such as Glastonbury, pictured, actually go for the music . And the misbehaviour crosses the generations. Among middle-aged (45 to 54) fans, nine per cent admit experimenting with illegal drugs at a festival, a fifth drink to excess, 10 per cent have slept with a stranger, and two per cent got into a fight, according to the study by MSN.co.uk. Others even admit burning tents. Brits will spend an average of £423.01 at UK festivals this year, making them too expensive for 60 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. However, despite The Rolling Stones headlining Glastonbury and The Stone Roses the Isle of Wight Festival, just 45 per cent actually go for the music. The others are lured by the atmosphere, the chance to socialise with friends, and to 'escape from everyday life'. In total, 47 per cent have done things at a festival they would 'never consider doing outside of the music festival environment', the study found. For those aged 35 to 44, the figure is 50 per cent. Festivals expert George McKay, Professor of Cultural Studies at Salford University, said it was 'human nature' to let your inhibitions go at a festival. He said: 'Festivals are deeply rooted in the carnival tradition, which is to invert everyday expectations of normal behaviour. Different reasons: Other festival-goers say they go to events like Glastonbury, pictured from the Stone Circle area of the festival site on Worthy Farm, Pilton, to 'escape from everyday life' 'Historically, carnivals would have a ‘lord of misrule’ who oversaw the revelries and subversion of the ordinary rules of life. 'For example, at the medieval Christian Feast of Fools, a ‘Boy Bishop’ would lead a temporary revolution interlaced with hedonistic partying. 'This carnival attitude can be seen in the earliest popular music festivals in Britain, such as the Beaulieu Jazz Festival in 1960. That ended up in a riot between modern and trad jazz fans. 'The Stonehenge Free Festivals of the 1980s also degenerated into trouble. 'The MSN research shows that misbehaving modern festival goers are simply upholding this ancient tradition.' Professor McKay added: 'The pop festival has been around for more than half a century. That means there are now several generations of keen festival-goers. 'Remember that venerable hippie slogan from the 1970s: ""You’re never too old for a happy childhood""? 'Music festivals continue to be places where we can escape reality and subvert the rules - whatever age we happen to be.' Typical British weather: One in eight festival-goers say they are staying away from events held in fields this year because of fears it will ran the entire time . While escaping reality for a few days can be fun, it can also have its irritations. The biggest gripe is that portaloos are not cleaned often enough, with 43 per cent infuriated by this, the poll of 2,000 festival-goers found. Almost one in five (17 per cent) are irked by the high price of food and drink, and 16 per cent say they have to queue too long to buy it. A similar number (17 per cent) get frustrated at not being able to charge their mobile phone or get a signal. One in eight festival fans say they are staying away from the fields this year because of fears over the weather. And of those that are going, a pair of wellies tops their list of essential items, followed by wet wipes, fancy dress and clean underwear. Office worker Ryan Davies, from Manchester, said the 'free-spirit' nature of festivals make them the perfect place to forget about the stresses of work. The 41-year-old said: 'Festivals are the perfect place to let your hair down without anyone judging you. I have a responsible my day job, so usually moderation and professionalism are key. 'Once I have pitched my tent I can really relax, let off a bit of steam and share the love. The good music is a bonus.'","Only 45% attend festivals such as Glastonbury or Reading for the music .

Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope could be used to find Mars-size alien planets capable of supporting life, it has been claimed. Researchers at MIT say the telescope could look for small, rocky exoplanets orbiting strange 'failed stars' known as brown dwarfs. Researchers believe the hunt could uncover planets capable of supporting life. Scroll down for video . A brown dwarf with a disk of planet-forming material around it. Brown dwarfs are bodies without enough mass to ignite nuclear fusion and become stars - and researchers say they could habour rocky exoplanets capable of supporting life . Most stars in the cosmos are too weak to even ignite thermonuclear fusion in their cores, thus they never visibly light up. Instead they emit primarily infrared light, which the Spitzer can easily detect. Astronomers refer to these 'failed stars' as brown dwarfs. They also believe some dark matter may consist of dark celestial bodies like brown dwarfs, which do not produce optical light and are too faint to visibly detect from Earth. 'Our program represents an essential . step towards the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial planets and . carries the compelling promise of studying the concept of habitability . beyond Earth-like conditions,' the team wrote. The . team is aiming for Mars-size planets because of their importance in . planetary formation models, lead author Armaury Triaud told Space.com. 'Eventually these planet embryos, the . size of Mars, those would collide and form bigger rocky planets, or the . core of (gas giant) planets such as Jupiter,' Triaud said. Brown dwarfs are brighter in the . infrared – the wavelength in which heat radiates – and those we can see . are relatively close to Earth, making it easier to detect the effect of . any planets on their motions. The Spitzer Space Telescope seen against the infrared sky. It could now help look for potentially habitable planets around 'failed' stars . Spitzer is the largest infrared telescope ever launched into space. Its highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes, including dusty stellar nurseries, the centers of galaxies, and newly forming planetary systems. Spitzer's infrared eyes also allows astronomers see cooler objects in space, like failed stars (brown dwarfs), extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds, and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets. Astronomers will seek small planets crossing the face of these brown dwarfs to look for life. The planets sought would orbit more . closely than Mercury does to the sun, but the faint warmth of brown . dwarfs could still make such inner regions habitable, researchers said. In a brown dwarf's 'habitable zone' it's possible that a planet could pass between the brown dwarf . and Earth more than 50 times a year, providing multiple attempts to study them. The scheme could also help find . targets for the forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope, which will be . able to probe planetary atmospheres to look for traces of oxygen. 'Right now, there are no projects . able to find an Earth-sized planet whose atmosphere can be studied with . the James Webb,' he said. The proposal is ne of several being considered to further extend Spitzer's mission. Spitzer launched in August 2003, and ran out of coolant four years ago but is observing new targets (such as near-Earth objects) as part of an extended mission.","Small, rocky exoplants near the failed stars could be habitable .

A California woman has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder after smothering her two-year-old daughter because the toddler would not stop crying. Tiffany Lopez, 21, of Oakland, was facing a murder trial in connection to the 2010 death of her daughter, Kamilah Russell, when she accepted a plea deal with Alameda County prosecutors this week. Lopez is expected to be sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in January, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Guilty: Tiffany Lopez (left) admitted smothering her daughter to death in the apartment she shared with the girl's father Joseph Russell Jr (right) Victim: Kamilah Russell, two, was killed by her mother at home . The tragic incident happened on March . 9, 2010, when Lopez, then 19, called police reporting that she had . accidentally sat on Kamilah as the two were playing hide-and-seek at an . apartment they shared with the girl's father, Joseph Russell Jr. The . young mother, who was at the time three months pregnant with her third . child, claimed that the two-year-old had been hiding between coach . cushions, and she had accidentally sat on her. Kamilah was rushed to Children's Hospital Oakland after Lopez called 911 and reported that her daughter was not breathing. The toddler was pronounced dead an hour later. Detectives . who questioned the young mother said Lopez’s story did not add up . because the woman weighed 250lbs, and if she were to sit on her . daughter, who weighed only 37lbs, the girl would have cried in pain. After . a lengthy interrogation, Lopez eventually admitted to police that she . had become frustrated with the child crying for her father, who was not . home at the time. Home: The apartment building in Oakland, California, in which Lopez killed her daughter . ‘All I wanted to do was to get her to stop. She wasn’t supposed to die.’ Lopez told investigators, according to Bay City News. ‘I didn’t mean to kill her! I love my baby girl!’ The mother put her hand on the girl's nose and mouth for about 17 seconds, causing her to suffocate, prosecutors said. A . pathologist ruled that Kamilah died of asphyxia due to smothering, . finding that there was an inadequate blood flow to her brain. ‘Just to know that her own momma took her life... It ain't killing me. It's making me die deep inside, man,’ Kamilah's father told ABC7 after Lopez’s arrest. The . couple's second child, Tania, who was seven months old at the time, was . briefly placed in state custody but later returned to the custody of . Joseph Russell.

Pope Francis waded into the debate on gay marriage today -  telling the Archbishop of Canterbury he wants to work together to promote family values ‘based on marriage’. Pope Francis - who vehemently opposed gay nuptials in his native Argentina - and Archbishop Justin Welby met for the first time after becoming the new leaders of their respective faiths. Speaking after their encounter in Vatican City, Pope Francis said he hoped the two leaders could collaborate in promoting the sacredness of life ‘and the stability of families founded on marriage.’ Gay marriage debate: Pope Francis told the Archbishop of Canterbury today that he wants . to work together to promote family values ‘based on marriage’ Archbishop Welby has spoken out against the legalisation of gay marriage in Britain, saying it would undermine family life. The legislation would enable gay couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies in England and Wales. The meeting of minds on the controversial issue is a rare moment of agreement between the two churches amid strained relations. The Pope praised the Archbishop for ‘recalling the value of marriage’. He said: ‘ Particularly important is . our witness to the reference to God and the promotion of Christian . values in a world that seems at times to call into question some of the . foundations of society, such as respect for the sacredness of human life . or the importance of the institution of the family built on marriage, a . value that you yourself have had occasion to recall recently.’ Francis has long taken a hard line on the issue. As archbishop of Buenos Aires he . clashed with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner on gay marriage, . calling it an ‘anthropological step backward’. He has also insisted that . adoption by gays and lesbians is a form of discrimination against . children. Today's meeting was billed as a chance to reduce tensions between the Catholic and Anglican churches . Both leaders, inaugurated within days of each other, acknowledged differences between their churches . Archbishop Welby said the two churches were ‘absolutely at one’ on the issue of gay marriage. The major point of difference between . the denominations has been the ordination of women priests in the . Anglican Church, which has since witnessed a  steady stream of . disenchanted Anglicans, who have been welcomed with open arms into the . Catholic Church. His predecessor Pope Benedict caused . uproar in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church when in 2009 he . introduced structures to ease disenchanted Anglicans into Catholicism. The Pope acknowledged the ‘painful . history’ between their churches, admitting that ‘difficulties have . arisen in our theological dialogue that were greater than we could have . foreseen at the start of our journey.’ He added: ‘The history of relations between the Church of England and . the Catholic Church is long and complex, and not without pain.’ Archbishop Welby said the differences between the churches were ‘ testing ‘. ’But a firm foundation of friendship will enable us to be hopeful in speaking to one another about those differences,’ he said. The Vatican's bold step to welcome back Anglicans came nearly 500 years after King Henry VIII broke away . In . 2009, Benedict decreed that Anglicans who feel their Church had become . too liberal could find a home in Catholicism in a parallel hierarchy . that allows them to keep some of their traditions, such as parts of the . Anglican liturgy and the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It was the boldest step by the . Vatican to welcome back Anglicans since King Henry VIII broke with Rome . and set himself up at the head of the new Church of England in 1534. Francis . said he was sure the move would help the Catholic world to better . appreciate and understand the spiritual and pastoral traditions of the . Anglican community. Welby, a . former oil industry executive, has inherited a Church which is itself . divided over issues such as gay rights and women bishops. He is against . gay marriage but favours female ordination, and is stuck in the . crossfire between liberal and conservative clerics. After addressing the pope and Vatican officials, Welby went on to pray at the tomb of Saint Peter under St. Peter's Basilica. The historic meeting comes as it . emerges that Francis’ predecessor, Benedict, will escape prosecution for . ‘crimes against humanity’ for his part in the church’s cover up of . abuse, including sexual violence. The International Criminal Court . (ICC) has rejected an application by The Centre for Constitutional . Rights to investigate Benedict and other Vatican officials, saying it is . outside the jurisdiction of the court. Legal experts had said that Benedict . could face charges after losing his immunity from prosecution as head of . state after stepping down in February. Lawyers for the victims claimed that Benedict had been put in place policies through which abuse could continue.","Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury met at the Vatican today .

She said: 'The position of the jet stream makes the weather largely unsettled but there will be a north-south divide in the amount of rain people will get. 'As it moves north conditions in the south should come closer to the average for this time of year. 'The north will have cloud with no rain, whereas the south will have cloud and showery rain with sunny intervals on Saturday, but as it moves north the band of rain and wind will move with it. 'It will be cloudy and rainy in the south this weekend but that does not necessarily mean it won't be warm, there will be normal temperatures for the south but it will be cooler in the north. 'It will be similar on Sunday until Tuesday, with cloud and sunny intervals across the country until Wednesday morning.'

'I wanted people to know who I was . because I felt as if I was lost in the middle of this storm,' she said. 'I was taken over. I wanted people to know precisely what I was . thinking.' She added that her identity was lost . in the media frenzy after Kercher was found murdered at their apartment . in Perugia, Italy in 2007. Laying low: She keeps her head down as she leaves the studio following her appearance on Wednesday . Heading home: Knox, who appeared emotional in the GMA interview, is pictured leaving the studio on Wednesday . Knox's seemingly bizarre behavior - joking around and kissing her Italian boyfriend Raffaele . Sollecito, who was also convicted of the murder before he was acquitted - made her prime suspect. In the interview on GMA, she attempted to defend her actions. 'It's . the greatest hurdle that I've had to come across in defending myself,' she said. 'Until you're in a situation that is as incredible, surreal . and overwhelming and tragic that I was... 'I . had to learn how to deal with it. I was 20, I was in a foreign country, . I barely spoke the language and my friend was murdered and I'd never in . my life experienced anything like that. 'I was clueless all the way through. I had to learn how to survive.' She also touched upon her odd behavior in an exclusive interview with Diana Sawyer, which aired on ABC News on Tuesday evening. Emotional: Amanda Knox appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday and said she hopes that the family of her murdered roommate, Meredith Kercher, will read her newly-released book . Story: She told Robin Roberts the book gives her a chance to explain her relationship with Meredith . 'I think that everyone’s reaction to something horrible is different,' Knox said. 'I was stunned by her death, completely bowled over because it was unfair. She was my friend, and I lost a friend.' But she admitted: 'I could have been more sensitive.' In . the interview, Knox . said she was now considering returning to Italy for the trial. But she . said the prospect of the case made her feel as if she had 'another field . of barbed wire to crawl through.' And asked of those who have called her a 'she-devil,' a sexual . thrill-seeker and a seductress, she firmly defended herself saying: 'They're wrong.' Knox also opened up about the first time she met Kercher when they moved in together. 'I . was putting away my things in the room when she came to my room and . introduced herself,' Knox said, adding that she thought: 'Wow, this is someone who, who I can get along with.' Account: Knox has written about her experiences in her book, left, which was released on Monday. In it she says she details her friendship with Meredith Kercher, right, who was killed in their apartment in 2007 . Pain: Her family, including her mother Arline and brother Lyle, pictured, said they will not read the book . Others have contrasted that Kercher found Knox's loudness and lack of ambition annoying. 'It bothers me when people suggest that she wasn’t my friend,' Knox said of their relationship. On November 1, 2007, the bloody body of Kercher was found after sustaining 47 wounds including a fatal slash across her . throat. Knox says she was never at home when it happened but was at the apartment of her boyfriend of one week, Sollecito. She says the two of them had sex, watched a movie, stayed up late talking. The next morning she says she left Sollecito's apartment to return to her own for a change of clothes. Once inside she saw blood in the bathroom sink but went ahead and took a shower anyway. 'I . thought it was strange,' she admits but defends that she didn’t know . how to react to it all - . and believed it had to be all innocent. She then went to Sollecito's apartment for breakfast. Defense: In an emotional interview with Diana . Sawyer, which aired on Tuesday night, Knox said she was upset about how . she had been branded in the aftermath of her roommate's murder . Foxy Knoxy: Knox said those who penned her as a 'she-devil' and seductress were wrong and branded her as guilty before a fair trial . At . the crime scene, Knox says she heard something about a ‘foot’ spoken by . investigators in Italian. Her curiosity soon escalated into fear as her . understanding of their conversation advanced. ‘There was blood and there was a blanket,’ she recalled police saying that day. ‘My . friend had been murdered and it could have just as easily been me. Somehow she had died in the house where we were living and it could have . been me,’ Knox said of her initial fears. Knox was taken to jail and accused of Kercher's murder, which she denied. Investigators . suggested that she may have had amnesia from so much trauma she had . experienced. When her local boss and boyfriend opened up to . investigators about what may have happened, suggesting Knox may in fact . have played a role, Knox says it had a dramatic effect on her defense. At the scene: Knox says that on the morning she found Miss Kercher's body she was returning from Sollecito's apartment and entered the crime scene while ignoring the blood found on her bathroom sink as nothing serious . ‘I, . I can only describe it as breaking down. I didn’t know what I . remembered and what I didn’t remember anymore,’ she defends of her then . admission to Kercher’s murder while behind bars. Of the confession she signed, she says: ‘I signed it because I was incredibly vulnerable at the time.’ Despite not one trace of Knox’s DNA found at the crime scene, she was found guilty of murder. Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito received 25 years. Behind bars she says she considered cutting her wrists or swallowing bleach to end her life. She says she would sing the Star Spangled Banner and prayed to stay positive. But in 2011 her murder conviction was overturned. In an earlier interview with USA . Today, Knox issued a plea to be one day 'allowed' to visit the cemetery in Mitcham, . south London that holds Kercher's body. Amanda Knox and then boyfriend Sollecito spent four years in jail until their convictions for Ms Kercher's death were overturned . 'I really want to go see her grave,' said Knox. 'And right now I don’t feel like I have the right to without . her family’s permission. So that’s something that I want to work toward . to get closure.' Kercher's . family has publicly maintained their own personal conviction in Knox's . involvement in the murder and in a statement released early Tuesday . reminded that she could still be found guilty. 'The Italian legal system still has . an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new . court hearing. The sentence can still be overturned,' said Meredith's sister . Stephanie Kercher. Following Knox's and Sollecito's release from prison, . Sollecito moved to Switzerland while she returned to Seattle to finish . her creative writing degree at the University of Washington. A . third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found . all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss . Kercher’s murder.","Amanda .

It must be a cunning plan – for while actor Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick the downtrodden servant in Blackadder, is knighted in today’s Birthday Honours, there is just a CBE for his scheming master Rowan Atkinson. Robinson, . whose character was famed for his shabbiness and lack of hygiene, . admitted he was ‘a little gob-smacked’ at being honoured and joked that . he would now be rescuing damsels in distress and slaughtering dragons if . the need arose. More . seriously, he added: ‘I’ll use my new title to highlight the causes I . believe in, particularly the importance of culture, the arts and . heritage in our society, and the plight of the infirm elderly and their . carers.’ With his catchphrase ‘I have a cunning plan’, Robinson became Britain’s favourite dogsbody as the long-suffering Baldrick. And as a history-mad presenter on Time Team, he has dug up some of the country’s most prestigious archaeological sites. But . his knighthood reflects neither his popularity as a sitcom star nor as a . history buff. Instead, the 66-year-old actor was recommended for his . ‘public and political service’ as a Labour party activist. His . name was put forward by the Parliamentary and Political Services . Committee, set up last year by David Cameron to reward party workers. Robinson was a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee for four . years during the Blair era, and spent four years as vice-president of . the Left-wing actors’ union Equity. His activism has never been low-key – wherever there’s a high-profile Leftie cause, he can often be found waving his red flag. When . Bono and Bob Geldof were handing out Make Poverty History wristbands in . the run-up to the G8 summit in 2005, Robinson was one of the most . vociferous showbusiness supporters. His involvement with Comic Relief . has seen him make several documentaries in Africa. Recognition: The Blackadder star, left, was nominated for his 'public and political services' In Britain, he rarely seems to miss a . demo. At the TUC rally against the Coalition’s spending cuts in March . 2011 he was a keynote speaker, and alongside hard-Left Labour MP Diane . Abbott he campaigns on issues such as housing and welfare benefits in . Hackney, the London borough where he grew up. Success: Robinson was a little-known actor before Blackadder . Robinson . was a little-known actor before Blackadder. But his career had begun . with a West End success – he was spotted in an amateur show and offered a . part as one of Fagin’s boys in the original 1960 production of Lionel . Bart’s musical, Oliver! One night, as understudy, he stood in at short . notice for the Artful Dodger. The experience left him with a love of . comedy acting. He spent years in repertory, then set up a community . theatre group. By the time . he was cast as Baldrick in 1983, he was in his late 30s with two . children. He felt distanced from the rest of the cast: Rowan Atkinson, . Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, . were all young graduates. The . son of a council worker, Robinson had left school after gaining four . O-levels. ‘The impression you got was that they slid off the silver . spoon straight into the rehearsal room at BBC TV Centre,’ he said. Four . series of Blackadder made him a household name, but it was a chance . encounter with archaeology professor Mick Aston during a holiday in the . Greek islands that led to Robinson’s most long-lived TV role – as the . eager amateur on Time Team, leaping into Roman excavations or medieval . ruins to uncover fragments of history. His enthusiasm was contagious, and the country fell in love with archaeology. Even the Royal Family were swept along. When . Robinson was invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace, the Queen, . the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles became engrossed in . conversation about what a Time Team dig could discover at the royal . sites. New career: Mr Robinson forged a second life as the presenter of Time Team on Channel 4 . Robinson’s private . life has been colourful.

However, some eagle-eyed celebrity spotters may find one particular housemate looks rather familiar - alternative model Sallie Axl. The tattooed blonde, 26, was photographed just two months ago in a passionate clinch with The Only Way Is Essex star Tom Pearce in London. Scroll down for video . Familiar face: Tattooed model and DJ Sallie Axl was the second to enter the Big Brother house . Getting lucky: Sallie with The Only Way Is Essex star Tom Pearce in April . The pair had obviously met up at the DSTRKT nightclub and were spotted all over each other as they left the venue in the early hours. Then then hopped into a taxi together, presumably to get to know each other better. Making her debut on the new series of the Channel 5 reality show on Thursday night, the bisexual model showed off plenty of her figure and tattoos in her skimpy outfit as she made her way into the house. In fact, Sallie's outfit choice quickly earned her the nickname 'Sideboob Sallie' among viewers who tweeted their shock at the revealing nature of the ensemble. Not exactly demure: The DJ showed off her tattoo sleeves and a whole lot of side boob in skimpy ensemble . What do you think of this year's Big Brother contestants? Sallie boasted she had slept with over 70 girls, but describes them as 'head f**ks'. She also claims to have slept with various celebrities, including footballers... and presumably Tom. She is currently single, having ended her last relationship after discovering her 'weirdo' boyfriend going through her phone. Sallie has a three-year-old daughter who lives with her for several days every other week, while her father looks after her for the rest of the time. Model Sallie describes her little girl as the most important person in her life, and says every second they have together is precious. Ready to cause trouble: Sallie pulled some interesting poses before going into the house . 'T**s and tatts, that's me!' Sallie summarises herself . While Sallie has made a name for . herself as a model, she was actually only signed up six months ago, and . says she is proud to be one of the first tattooed models to break into . the mainstream industry.

Her new housemates have been warned she could be difficult, as she described herself as a 'b**ch'. Meet and greet: Sallie speaks to the first housemates to enter, twins Jack and Joe Glenny . Get a room: Sallie boasted she has slept with several celebrities, one presumably being Tom . She said: 'I get my boobs out in public, because I love it. T**s and tatts that's me'. Before entering the house she said . she differs from most models because: 'I don't wear heels, I don't wear . push up bras, glamour girls can be tomboys too.' When someone pointed out Sallie's presence on BB to her former kissing partner Tom on Twitter, he replied: 'Ha ha ;-).'

Thursday is the 11th anniversary of the day their 13-year-old daughter, Milly, was abducted and murdered as she returned from school. It would be six months before her body was found in a wood 25 miles away from their home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. A family torn apart: Murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, 13, with her mother Sally. Thursday is the 11th anniversary of the day she was abducted and murdered . Bob and Sally Dowler in the wake of daughter Amanda 'Milly' Dowler's disappearance. It would be six months before her body was found in a wood 25 miles away from their home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey . And it would be longer still, a full nine years, until Levi Bellfield, the former club doorman who killed her, would finally be convicted of her murder. But for the Dowler family even that would bring no closure. In July 2011, less than a fortnight after the trial ended, the Guardian reported that News of the World journalists had intercepted and deleted voicemails on Milly’s mobile phone. The claim was especially toxic because her parents had thought at the time that it might have been her deleting the messages, giving them false hope that she was still alive. For the Guardian this ‘false hope moment’ would prove to be the spark it had been looking for to detonate the phone-hacking scandal. Such was the scale of public outrage that within days Rupert Murdoch had closed down the 168-year-old Sunday tabloid. Soon afterwards Rebekah Brooks, News International’s chief executive and a former editor of the paper, was forced to resign. News International paid the Dowlers £2million compensation with Murdoch personally donating an additional £1million to charities of their choice. But it quickly emerged that the battle centred around Milly’s parents was not just against the newspaper behind the hacking of their daughter’s phone, but an entire industry. Riding on the back of public sympathy for their plight, the Hacked Off campaign was by now in full cry. Launched by self-appointed media watchdog the Media Standards Trust, its aim was to force a full-scale public inquiry into hacking and Press standards generally. To amplify its voice, the celebrity victims of media intrusion were put at the forefront of the campaign – Hugh Grant, J K Rowling and Steve Coogan. But when it came to putting pressure on the politicians, the involvement of the Dowlers would prove critical. David Cameron meets with the family, including Bob, mother Sally and sister Gemma, at his office following claims that Milly's mobile phone was hacked on behalf of the News of the World . A month after the Dowlers had given evidence at Leveson, a senior News International executive accused the Guardian of 'sexing' up its story about News of the World journalists deleting messages from Milly Dowler's phone . Within a week of the Guardian story the couple, accompanied by representatives of Hacked Off, had met all three party leaders. The Prime Minister then announced the Leveson Inquiry. When it convened in November 2011, there again were Hacked Off’s roster of celebrity victims, led by Grant, by now their cheerleader-in-chief. The Dowlers also attended, giving heartbreaking testimony. Mrs Dowler recounted the night of March 24, 2002, when she rang her daughter’s mobile phone and found fresh space was available on its previously full voicemail account. She shouted to her husband: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail, Bob. She’s alive!’ The previously automated response had reverted to Milly’s own greeting. The sound of her daughter’s voice led Mrs Dowler to believe Milly had deleted some messages (something later blamed on the actions of News of the World journalists). A month after the Dowlers had given evidence at Leveson, a senior News International executive accused the Guardian of ‘sexing’ up its story about News of the World journalists deleting messages from Milly Dowler’s phone. Lord Leveson said the messages were probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator . ‘The Metropolitan Police has now confirmed that the News of the World was not to blame for deleting the specific mobile phone messages of Milly Dowler that gave false hope too her parents that she was alive,’ he said. The Guardian was forced to print an apology. The following May, Scotland Yard’s Chief Inspector John MacDonald said in a statement to the Leveson Inquiry: ‘We cannot conclusively say whether any voicemails were manually deleted.’ And in his report, Lord Leveson accepted as much, saying the voicemail messages were in fact probably deleted automatically by the mobile network operator. ‘The inquiry does conclude on the lower standard of proof of the balance of probabilities that tampering with or illegal interception of Milly Dowler’s voicemail was not the cause of the “false hope moment”,’ he wrote. Yet Hacked Off and its supporters dismissed the revelation as a minor detail. After all they had got their inquiry and the report they wanted. All they needed now was to force the political parties to accept the Leveson recommendations in their entirety – and once again the Dowlers’ name was key. Last week it emerged that the campaign group had made extraordinary threats against Labour in an attempt to ‘sabotage’ cross-party agreement on Press reform. The group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking led by the Dowlers would condemn Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‘dirty deal’. Concerns about Hacked Off’s motives were heightened yesterday after a secret dossier drawn up by the group was leaked to the Mail on Sunday. In it there is a discussion of how the Dowlers can be used to pressurise the Prime Minister. It concludes: ‘It is in their name that we act.’ Given the events of the past few days, some might argue that Hacked Off should remind itself of that final phrase.","Thursday is 11th anniversary of day 13-year-old was abducted and murdered .

The body of Louis Roberton, 26 and from Glasgow, was found just before 8am this morning in the Lovatiere area of La Plagne. He had gone missing late on Wednesday night during a 'bar hopping' session with two friends he was on holiday. The British tourist has died after freezing to death during a skiing holiday in the resort of La Plagne in the French Alps (file photo) The party had arrived in the popular resort last Sunday, and were due to spend the week skiing and snowboarding. But witnesses said they had seen Mr . Robertson drinking heavily, and he is believed to have got lost as he . tried to find a short cut home in the dark. 'It appears to have been an . unfortunate accident,' said a local police spokesman. 'He wanted to take . a short cut and, in the cold and dark, met his death.' The officer said that 'cold and too . much alcohol' probably contributed to Mr Robertson getting lost, and . ending up in the stream. A missing persons alert was issued . throughout the resort on Thursday at 4pm, but heavy snow and bad light . meant the search had to be postponed overnight. British skiers and snowboarders have frequently got into serious problems after drinking too much in the Alps. Many have died because they underestimated the risk of drinking at a high altitude. A campaign about the dangers involved . was launched by the then British ambassador to France in 2009, with Sir . Peter Westmacott saying: 'Over the past years, we've noticed a rise in . accidents in resorts linked to alcohol consumption, particularly . accidents on the slopes, mostly among young people. 'We are telling our compatriots to be . careful: when you consume too much alcohol at an altitude and it's cold, . the danger is greater,' he said. In February of this year an inquest . heard how a young British skier died when he smashed into a snow cannon . after drinking four bottles of beer before taking to the slopes in the . nearby resort of Val D'Isere. The holiday rep had also led tourists . on a bar crawl the previous night, shouted 'Watch this!' as he set on a . steep run moments before the tragedy. He lost control while trying to execute a turn and ploughed into the snow-making machine at high speed. And in January a British teenager . drowned in an outdoor swimming pool after a night out with friends in . Alpe d'Huez, another French ski resort. Police said she and a male friend had . been drinking before they climbed over a 6ft fence to get into the . water, where she became trapped under a tarpaulin that was partly . covering the municipal pool. La Plagne, which was created in 1961 in the Alpine Tarentaise valley, is now made up of 11 resorts.

White House assistant chef Sam Kass, who cooks weekly for President Obama, said Tuesday that he is facing a furlough brought about by crippling federal budget cuts. The chef, who is also the president’s senior nutrition policy adviser, is one of nearly 500 White House employees who are expected to receive furlough notices because of the so-called sequester. On the chopping block: Assistant White House Chef Sam Kass, pictured in 2009, is one of 480 White House staffers facing furloughs . Staying active: Mr Kass, right, was named a Senior Policy Advisor for Healthy Food Initiatives in 2010, working with First Lady Michelle Obama on her 'Let's Move!' initiative to reverse childhood obesity . Speaking with food reporters Tuesday, Mr Kass said: ‘We’re being furloughed,’ according to Reuters. A White House spokesman who accompanied Kass to the press briefing declined to comment on the matter. News of the possible White House staff furloughs comes days after several members of the Obama administration announced that they would return a portion of their salaries to the federal government as a sign of solidarity to the austere days ahead in Washington. The chef cooks dinner several times a week for the president and while he likely won’t be preparing all of the president’s meals in the coming weeks, the New York Times’ Caucus blog cheekily notes that it is unlikely the president will miss any meals. Make our garden grow: First lady Michelle Obama waters wheat seedlings during the spring planting of the White House garden last week; Kass helped create the vegetable garden on the South Lawn . It is unclear whether notices have gone out to other Obama aides informing them that they must take days off without pay. Mr Kass, who was trained in Chicago and Vienna, joined the White House Kitchen staff in 2009 and was named a Senior Policy Adviser for Healthy Food Initiatives a year later, working with First Lady Michelle Obama on her ‘Let’s Move!’ initiative to reverse childhood obesity. He also helped create the vegetable garden on the South Lawn that has yielded 3,000 pounds of fresh produce for the first family. Mr Kass told reporters that effort won't be affected, according to the Associated Press.

There are few things more depressing on a car journey than the ‘flud, flud, flud’ sound of a flat tyre. You invariably seem to get a puncture when it’s dark, when it’s raining and when the car is laden with tired kids, luggage and a front seat passenger reluctant to get their hands dirty, but unusually eager to point out what you’re doing wrong. Changing a spare tyre is hassle enough, but in recent years, coping with a flat has become even more stressful. For without fanfare, motor manufacturers have begun to phase them out. There are few things more depressing on a car journey than hearing the 'flud, flud, flud' sound of a flat tyre says, David Derbyshire . Each year, tens of thousands of stranded drivers lift up the boot carpets of new cars looking for a spare and a jack, only to discover a ‘tyre repair kit’ – an electric pump, a bottle of sealant and instructions written by someone with only a passing familiarity with cars and the English language. I have to admit I know almost nothing about car repair. Ask me to change a spark plug and I’m baffled. Tell me my ‘big end’ has gone and I’ll probably call the doctor. But I do know how to change a spare tyre, and that admittedly basic knowledge is a badge of pride. I know about loosening the nuts before jacking up the car. I know where to fit the jack. And I know how to give a withering look when someone offers an opinion. So I resent car manufacturers making my one car-related skill redundant. And they are making it redundant in force. Out of the top ten best-selling cars in Britain, only the Volkswagen Golf now comes with a full spare tyre as standard. Lucky owners of top-of-the-range new cars get skinny space-saving spare . tyres that take up less room in the boot, but which will keep them going . for 50 miles or so until the driver can get home or to a garage. A few . find their cars are delivered kitted with four ‘run-flat tyres’ — tyres . with strengthened walls that stay hard even when the air has escaped. But the unfortunate ones — the owners of the bottom-of-the-range Honda . Jazz, Renault Clio and Vauxhall Astra, for example — have to make do . with a sealant kit. If you’ve ever tried to use an emergency tyre inflation kit, you’ll know how awkward and messy they can be. Drivers have to connect a pipe from a compressor in the repair kit to . the flat tyre’s valve, plug the compressor into the cigarette lighter . and switch on the compressor to fill the tyre with air and sealant. Many car manufacturers are slowly phasing out the spare tyre . Then you have to unplug it all, drive the car for two miles to disperse . the sealant throughout the inside of the tyre to tackle the air leak, . stop and park, plug the compressor back into the tyre and cigarette . lighter, and pump up the tyre fully. Even then there’s no guarantee you can drive the car away. Sealant kits . only work with holes 4mm or smaller. Bigger gashes are impossible to . repair — a fact you will discover after an hour or so fiddling around on . the roadside. And even if you can get puncture kits to work, many garages refuse to . repair tyres if they have been filled with sealant, claiming it is too . time consuming and expensive to clean them out. A £15 puncture repair . can end up costing the £100 price of a replacement tyre. The demise of the spare is already . having an impact on emergency call-outs. Green Flag, the car breakdown . service, said the number of call-outs to drivers stranded by flat tyres . leapt 20 per cent last year. The . RAC had 80,000 calls in 2011 from motorists who found they hadn’t got a . spare in the boot, and who were unable to use the sealant kits. That . works out as around one fifth of all their tyre problem calls. Prakesh Patel, an RAC patrol officer, is not a fan. ‘I’ve . never been very successful with them,’ he says. ‘They are fine if it’s a . small hole caused by a nail. But the problem is that when you use the . sealant it ends up on the road and it’s messy. ‘It costs £20 to £30 to replace the sealant, and when you take the tyre to be repaired they won’t take it because of the glue inside. So you have to pay for a new tyre as well. ‘I had a call out this week from a middle-aged women who couldn’t find the spare but thought there must be one. 'When we opened up the boot the hole that should have been filled by a tyre was instead filled with a piece of polystyrene. She looked at me in disbelief.’ So why are car manufacturers cutting back on spares? One reason is the demand for ever larger boots. Families want people carriers with seven seats, plus room for buggies and luggage. Something has to give, and that something is the spare tyre. Removing the tyre which is usually stored under the boot’s carpet gives more space for boot seats to be folded away when not in use. But above all, getting rid of the spare saves the manufacturers money. It is cheaper to fit a £20 repair kit than an £80 spare tyre. There is also the issue of European and UK legislation designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The motor industry is under intense pressure to shave off excess weight from cars to improve fuel efficiency, and scrapping the spare removes up to 25kg of weight. While drivers fume, the car industry insists it is giving consumers more choice. John Visscher, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: ‘Some people are comfortable with changing a tyre, but there are other motorists who want the ease, speed and the safety of not having to change a tyre on the side of the road. And there are drivers who don’t know how to change a tyre, or who don’t want to.’ The manufacturers argue that if a customer lavishes £15,000 on a new car they would be pretty daft not to double-check what they were getting for their money. The RAC had some 80,000 calls from motorists who discovered that their car didn't have a spare tyre in 2011 (file picture) The trouble is, how many motorists would ever imagine they’d be sold a new car without a spare tyre. Some manufacturers allow you to ‘upgrade’ by paying extra for a spare, but in many models there simply isn’t space. The RAC — which wants spare tyres to be included as standard — says dealerships need to spell out more clearly what customers are getting. RAC technical director David Bizley says: ‘Not including a spare wheel has become a growing trend among car manufacturers over the past five years, to the point where about 50 per cent of punctures registered in 2012 happened to vehicles which did not have a spare wheel.’ There is no sign that spares are about to come back into fashion either. It won’t be many years before they are available only as a pricey optional extra — along with sun roofs and a sat-nav. That means for the foreseeable future, the only spare tyres middle-aged men like me will have in our cars are the ones around our waists.","David Derbyshire says that many car manufacturers have began to phase out the spare tyre .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:48 EST, 7 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:06 EST, 7 April 2013 . Three members of the same Italian family have taken their own lives after state-imposed austerity measures and mounting debts left them believing there was no way out. Anna-Maria and Romeo Dionisi hanged themselves at their home in the seaside town of Civitanova on the Adriatic coast, becoming the latest victims of the economic crisis. Mr Dionisi, 63, a former builder, had lost his job and was unable to draw a pension after the state raised the retirement age by five years, 16 months ago, as part of a series of Europe-imposed cuts. Pensioners in Italy have been particularly badly hit by the austerity measures brought in by Mario Monti's (pictured) government . The couple were not able to get by on Mrs Dionisi’s pension of less than almost £500 a month and had fallen months behind on their rent and bills. On hearing the news, Mrs Dionisi’s elderly brother, Giuseppe Sopranzi, 78, who lived next door to the couple, threw himself into the sea. Although many are struggling in Italy as the economy falters and cuts bite, the family tragedy has struck a nerve - triggering an outpouring of grief around the entire country. At their funeral on Saturday politicians were mobbed by furious friends and family who denouced the deaths as ‘murder by the state’. The mayor of Civitanova Tommaso Corvatta told the newspaper La Stampa: ‘Such was their dignity that this family preferred to end it all in tragedy, rather than ask for help. ‘In another place a similar situation would have driven people to crime. ‘When politicians debate economic policy in the great palaces of state they need to think on the people like this at the other end of the chain, and remember that.’ The shoe company where Mr Dionisi worked as a clerk had shut five years ago and he had struggled lately to find work. Tommaso Corvatta, the mayor of Civitanova (pictured) has said: 'Such was their dignity that this family preferred to end it all in tragedy, rather than ask for help' Hundreds of Cypriot bank workers protest against the possibility of their pensions being affected should the government decide to restructure Cyprus' two largest banks on Thursday as fears economic fears spread across Europe . The couple owed around £15,000 in taxes and feared their car and furniture would be repossessed. They had become ‘desperate’, local residents said. Mrs Dionisi had completely given up hope, and was very depressed. Neighbours who discovered the couple’s bodies also found a note asking for forgiveness. Mr Sopranzi, a former clerk in a shoe factory, returned from a walk on the beach to find police outside the building. When he heard what his beloved sister had done he cast himself into the harbour. Attempts to revive him failed. Suicides have become increasingly common in the recession, Italy’s longest for 20 years. Pensioners have been particularly badly hit by the austerity measures brought in by Mario Monti’s government. Measures to help some 40,000 of those left without pensions have been brought in but the overall number affected is at least 150,000.","Couple hanged themselves at their home in Italian seaside town .

Teenager Emaan Shah has been missing since she disappeared while on a shopping trip with her family on Oxford Street on Monday . A police hunt is underway to trace an Indian teenager who went missing while on a shopping trip with her family on London's Oxford Street. Emaan Shah's parents have been left 'frantic with worry' after the 17-year-old became separated from them while out shopping on Monday, June 10. The teenager had been on holiday in the UK with her family for two weeks and was due to fly home to India that evening. Her father Tanvir Shah has said the family are desperate for information about the teenager and that there was no reason his daughter would go missing. He said: 'My wife and two sons are now frantic with worry. There is no reason for Emaan to go missing. 'We’d been enjoying our last few hours in London before catching our flight home. I was just a few paces ahead of my wife and daughter in Oxford Street and when I turned round she’d gone. 'We are at a point where we cannot eat, we cannot sleep. We are desperate for news about Emaan and just want her back with us.' Officers have said her disappearance is 'completely out of character'. Westminster police have pieced together CCTV which shows Emaan walking along Wimore Street, close to the junction with Duke Street, after appearing to have left Oxford Street. Officers have said the route could have taken her back to the hotel she was staying in. Detective Inspector Annette Clark, who is leading the investigation to trace the teenager, said: 'Emaan may be 17 but she is not street-wise and she’s never travelled alone before. 'She is not familiar with London and, to our knowledge, does not have any friends in the capital. 'It is vital that anyone with information about her whereabouts contact us as soon as possible.' Emaan is 5ft 3ins tall, of slim build with brown wavy hair. When last seen she was wearing a black jacket with a Manchester United logo on the chest, grey trousers and black and white trainers.

A dedicated emergency dispatcher stayed on the line with a stroke victim for nearly 8 hours while emergency personnel desperately searched for the woman who was unable to describe her own location. New York City Fire Department dispatcher Joann Hilman-Payne took a call around 1 p.m. Monday. The call came from a cell phone and the victim had suffered a stroke, causing her speech to become badly slurred. Diligence: FDNY Dispatcher Joann Hilman-Payne stayed on the phone with a stroke victim for 8 hours as emergency workers searched desperately for her . Using information from the cell phone tower that had routed the call from the victim, Mary Thomas, the medics first rushed to an East 71st street Manhattan address according to the New York Post. But Thomas wasn’t there. Still on the phone with Thomas, Hilman-Payne continued speaking to Thomas and trying to get as much information about her location as possible. ‘Throughout the entirety, she worked to keep the patient awake, she never lost her own composure and remained calm while attempting to elicit more information from the patient,’ wrote Emergency Medical Dispatch Capt. Philip . Weiss in a letter recommending to the FDNY that Hilman-Payne be given recognition for her valiant efforts. Desperate: The New York Fire Department, fire marshal, and NYPD all searched for victim Mary Thomas on Monday. Versizon was finall able to pinpoint her location using her cell phone . Before any of that could happen, however, the ailing Thomas needed to be found. Hilman-Payne’s boss, Lt. Arlene Simmons, enlisted the Fire Marshal’s Office for help. Together they searched patient databases and for people who shared Thomas’s name. Though that search would prove futile because, as it turned out, Thomas wasn’t calling from her home. The NYPD threw their hat in the ring as well, as did Verizon Wireless, in an effort to precisely pinpoint the victim’s location. Found: It turned out, Thomas wasn't at home, but at work. She was finally found at an apartment where she is a housekeeper on Manhattan's Upper East side and was taken to Lenox Hill Hospital (pictured) where she remains . For the rest of the day, Hilman-Payne stayed on the phone with Thomas. Finally, Thomas was located with the help of Verizon. As it turned out, she’d suffered the stroke at her workplace—an East 72nd Street apartment where she worked as a housekeeper. Thomas was rushed to Lenox Hill hospital, where she remains in intensive care. And the largely positive outcome can all be traced back to the heroic efforts of Hilman-Payne who remained diligent throughout the day-long search. ‘I have no doubt that without the efforts of all involved,’ wrote Wiess.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 04:57 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:33 EST, 20 March 2013 . investigations: The French Foreign office is investigating reports that geologist Philippe Verdon was beheaded by terror group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on March 10 . Al Qaeda terrorists today claimed to have beheaded a French hostage in retaliation for his country’s war in Mali. Foreign Office officials in Paris said they were trying to verify reports of the horrific death of Philippe Verdon, who has been in captivity for the past 14 months. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is waging a terrorist campaign against the French Army in Mali, claims it cut the geologist’s head off on March 10 ‘in response to France’s intervention in Northern Mali.’ Referring to Francois Hollande, a spokesman for the group calling himself Al-Qairawani added: ‘The French President Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French hostages.’ There are at least 14 French hostages currently held by Al Qaeda in west Africa, including seven by AQIM. It means that France, which has already lost five soldiers fighting in Mali since the war started in January, is slowly being sucked into an increasingly bloody terrorist war. Mr Hollande sent a force into Mali specifically to prevent the north of the country from being used as a launch pad for terror attacks in Africa and in the West. Mr Verdon, who is in his 50s, was captured on November 24 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic, a colleague. The men, who were on a business trip, were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori, in the north of Mali. AQIM claimed that both men were secret agents or mercenaries, and later released a video of Mr Verdon in captivity. The hostages’ families have expressed growing fears about the men’s safety, especially following the invasion of Mali. On Monday, Mr Verdon’s father . Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ‘We are in a total fog and it is impossible to . live this way. We have no information.’ Captured: Mr Verdon has been held captive for 14 months, having been captured on November 24 2011 along with colleague Serge Lazarevic . No information: On Monday, Mr Verdon¿s father Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ¿We are in a total fog and it is impossible to live this way. We have no information¿ . The Verdon family were particularly concerned by Mr Hollande’s firm announcement that France would not pay ransoms. French forces arrived in Mali on January 11 to help the Malian Army against Al-Qaeda fighters who had controlled the north of the country since April 2012. France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground in Mali, most carrying out clean-up operations after driving out most of the Islamist rebels from the area. Senior Al-Qaeda commanders Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abdelhamid Abou Zeid are believed to have been killed in Mali earlier this month. A rescue operation ordered by Mr Hollande to free a French secret agent held hostage in Somalia since mid-2009 ended in failure in January after he was killed along with two French soldiers.","Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claims to have beheaded Philippe Verdon .

The apparent slip of the tongue might surprise Woods, not to mention his recent ex-wife Elin Nordegren, as Vonn and Woods have been dating just three months. The 28-year-old Olympic skier has become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been pictured keeping a close eye on Tiger at various courses. During a quiet moment at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania on Friday, Ms Vonn said that she didn't give the champion golfer advice about his game but that she was a sounding board for him as 'lots of people go home and talk to their wife or . husband about their job'. Scroll down for video . On course: Lindsey Vonn watches boyfriend Tiger Woods from the gallery on the 18th green during the third round of the U.S. Open in Ardmore, Pennsylvania . Watching closely: Vonn has been a staple at major championships since she started dating Woods three months ago . Tiger tamed? Tiger Woods, pictured on Sunday at the U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, might be surprised to hear that girlfriend Lindsay Vonn compared herself to his wife . She told the New York Times: 'We talk golf after his golf rounds, but mostly I listen. We really are . normal in that way. Lots of people go home and talk to their wife or . husband about their job. That’s what we do.' Woods had a lot of ground to make up on Sunday in Ardmore, Pennsylvania after he skidded to seven bogeys and a 6-over-par 76 on Saturday. Woods tumbled down the leader board and matched his worst round as a pro at the U.S. Open. Ms . Vonn was more of a casual presence on the sidelines than at previous . competitions. The . Olympic skier has been dressed casually in a T-shirt, jeans, . sunglasses and baseball cap from her sponsor Red Bull as she closely . tracked Woods around the course. She tweeted on Thursday: 'Day one here we go!' before posting several pictures of golf fans' muddy feet at the rain-sodden course. At the Masters in Augusta last month, Ms Vonn turned heads at the course in a clinging beige floor length dress and coordinated sunhat. However it appears that being relegated to the role of golf WAG is rather irksome to the glamorous Miss Vonn whose last appearance with Woods was at the Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards in Manhattan. Biggest fan: Vonn waits near the clubhouse as she watches Woods during what has been a rocky performance by the golfer . Golf WAG: Vonn, an Olympic skier, made sure she had a Red Bull sponsor's hat firmly on her head during a more casual appearance at a tournament . Exasperated: Woods reacts after missing a putt during the second round of the 2013 U.S. Open . She also told the Times: . 'Some people seem to forget that I’m not just Tiger’s girlfriend. I’m . actually a successful athlete. I’m Lindsey. I have my own career and my . own life.' She added that . she was 'very happy' and that despite the constant attention that has . come with dating the world's most famous golfer, the relationship is . 'worth it'. Woods is currently ten strokes behind . third-round leader Phil Mickelson, the only player under par at the . short but devilishly tough Merion Golf Club. Despite leading the PGA Tour in putting in recent weeks, Woods needed 36 putts on the severely undulating greens. He blamed his inability to gauge the speed of those baffling putting . surfaces for his three days of uneven play - and he was right. Woods . is tied for third in fairways hit and 22nd in reaching the greens in . regulation. But he's averaged 32 putts per round, which left him tied . for 53rd in the field of 73 players. Afterwards, he said: 'It's certainly frustrating because I was feeling like I was playing well this week and I just didn't make the putts I needed to make. 'The first two days, I had, like, three 3-putts and I was four shots off the lead, and I missed a boatload of putts within 10 feet. Off his game: Woods appeared to be disappointed with his performance on the course in Pennsylvania . Good day for golfing: Thousands gather to watch Woods on the ninth green at the tricky Merion course . 'So I really wasn't that far off. If I clean up the round and don't 3-putt, I'm one shot back starting out today. Basically, I just didn't have the speed right this week and it certainly showed.' This U.S. Open marks exactly five years since Woods won his last major, at Torrey Pines, which he captured in a playoff against Rocco Mediate, despite hobbling around with ligament damage. His pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' career record of 18 majors remains stalled at 14. Woods also shot a 76 in the final round at Shinnecock Hills in 2004, as well as two rounds of 76 at Winged Foot in 2006 when he missed the cut. Glamor on the green: Ms Vonn (second left) watches Woods during the Masters in Augusta, Georgia in April . Woods' worst round ever at an Open was a 77 at Oakland Hills in 1996, when he was a 19-year-old amateur. What made his performance here perhaps even more surprising is that Woods has already won four times this season, including The Players Championship - sometimes called golf's fifth major - and three of his last five starts. Most recently, however, Woods stumbled to an 8-over-par finish and a tie for 65th at the Memorial, a tournament he'd won five times. Champion: Vonn was keen to point out at the golf tournament that she was successful in her own right with her career as an Olympic skier . Red carpet glamor: Tiger Woods and girlfriend Lindsay Vonn at the Costume Institute Gala in New York last month . Woods said several tough pin placements chosen by the U.S. Golf Association's course set up compounded his problems trying to figure out the speed of the greens. 'Look at what they did at (Nos.) 7 and 8 today. Couple short holes, but 7 is one step and a half over the top of the ridge. Eight is on the down slope a little bit, and it's a pretty steep slope. So they got some really tough ones out there,' he said. But Woods' also conceded he rarely put his approach shots into those greens where he should have. 'If you put the ball in the right spots you've got uphill putts and you can be really aggressive,' Woods said. Woods now faces the prospect of beginning the final day of yet another major with only the longest of shots to contend. What little consolation he could muster came when someone asked: 'Tough day?' 'Yeah,' Woods replied. 'At least I started well.'","Ms Vonn, 28, was casually dressed in T-shirt, jeans and baseball cap in Ardmore, Pennsylvania .
