"Sydney (CNN) -- Reinstalled Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd recently announced his Papua New Guinea or ""PNG Solution"" in an effort to halt the escalating number of unauthorized boat arrivals of asylum seekers to Australia shores. Under his plan, all asylum seekers arriving by boat would be transferred to PNG for ""processing"" and no asylum seeker coming by boat would ever obtain permanent resettlement in Australia, even if they were subsequently found to be a genuine refugee. With an election due sometime before late November, the perception that Australia has lost control of its borders is the primary issue in a handful of marginal seats that will decide the election. Rudd is attempting to break the people smuggling business model by removing the possibility that one can arrive by boat seeking asylum and eventually win resettlement in Australia. Despite the deliberately harsh rhetoric about the PNG Solution that is designed to deter boat arrivals, Rudd's plan will not be as effective as might first appear. READ MORE: Riots as Australia shuts door on asylum . Conservative leader Tony Abbott has derided the PNG Solution as a flimsy two page-agreement ""held together by sticky tape and Blu-Tack."" Abbott has an obvious interest in doing so. But he is correct. Like all effective policies, the devil is in the detail. In this case, the lack of detail for such an important policy announcement is astounding. Can PNG absorb all Australia's boat arrivals? First, there are serious doubts that PNG has the capacity to absorb the number of asylum seekers that will try to make it to Australia, even if there is an initial deterrent effect following the weekend announcement. Authorities at PNG's Manus Island Detention Centre, the primary location for processing Australia-bound boat people, openly admit that current facilities can only house around 300 people. Given that around 3,500 asylum seekers have been arriving each month since 2013, even a dramatic slowdown would overburden the Manus Island facilities. PNG leader Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has indicated that the country could take in some 3,000 asylum seekers for processing, although no firm ceiling has been put on the ultimate number. O'Neill has only indicated that the numbers of asylum seekers that PNG is prepared to take will depend on the country's capacity to do so. Although temporary tent shelters can be built within weeks to accommodate around 600 people, PNG officials have also indicated that permanent facilities to accommodate the 3,000 people will take two years to construct. Left unanswered is where Australian authorities -- who bear responsibility for the asylum seekers at all stages -- would send surplus asylum seekers for processing if PNG facilities could no longer cope, as is likely to be the case. Due to a 2011 High Court decision which invalidated the ""Malaysia Solution"" proposed by previous Labor leader Julia Gillard, Canberra cannot legally send Australia-bound asylum seekers to countries that are not signatories to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. As PNG and the Philippines are the only signatories among Australia's neighbors, the suspicion is that Australia-bound boat people who cannot be processed by PNG will have to be processed under Australian jurisdiction and resettled in the country if found to be refugees -- which is precisely why growing numbers of boat people are arriving in the first place. If so, Rudd's threat that no asylum seeker arriving by boat will ever gain entry into Australia will be demonstrated to be hollow -- which will likely encourage even more asylum seekers to pay smugglers in an attempt to gain Australian entry. Concerns about ""culture clash"" Second, O'Neill has stated that PNG will only resettle asylum seekers who have been found to be genuine refugees. Several questions arise at this point. Over half of all asylum seekers have been found to be genuine refugees upon arriving in Australia, with the number rising to above 90% after going through the Australian judicial appeals process. There is already strong political and social opposition in PNG to resettling refugees in what is still a vastly undeveloped country. Given PNG's hitherto absent role in accepting refugees, many in the country express concern about an imminent ""culture clash"" in the event of a refugee influx, while many have openly hostile attitudes towards Muslim immigrants who would comprise the majority of Australia-bound asylum seekers. This will only restrict the numbers of refugees that PNG would in reality accept, increasing the chances that they will be resettled in Australia. Moreover, O'Neill has stated categorically that PNG will not allow those asylum seekers who are subsequently found not to be genuine refugees to remain in the country. Given that all Australia-bound asylum seekers remain Australia's responsibility even if they are processed in PNG under Rudd's PNG Solution, those rejected automatically remain ""Australia's problem"" and under Canberra's duty of care. Once again, Canberra would have few options available besides transferring them to Australian facilities. Can policy stand annual test? Third, the PNG Solution is subject to renewal each year, meaning that there will be immense annual pressure on Port Moresby to annul what is an extremely unpopular agreement. Although Australia will bear all of the costs for the PNG Solution, the plan has not been ""costed"" meaning that Australians are likely to recoil when the true ongoing expense of the proposal becomes clear. Despite all this, we need to remember that this policy is forged in the midst of an election campaign. Rudd only needs the PNG Solution to ""stop the boats"" for a few weeks in order to somewhat cynically portray the initiative as an ingenious plan. Short term success in stemming boat arrivals is all Rudd needs, which is just as well -- because this is all the PNG Solution is likely to achieve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Lee.","Australian leader Kevin Rudd plans to send ""boat people"" to PNG .

"(CNN) -- The body found Saturday in a fortified bunker in Washington state is believed to be a murder suspect who had been hiding inside, the King County Sheriff's Office said. A sheriff's SWAT team blew a hole in the roof of the hideout with explosives and saw what they believe to be the body of Peter Keller. It appeared he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff's office said. ""They believe the person has been dead for some time. There's a great deal of blood and a pistol nearby,"" Sheriff Steven D. Strachan said. A bomb disposal unit cleared the bunker to ensure there were no explosives or booby traps, officials said. Deputies earlier said they had Keller, 41, contained inside the bunker. Authorities fired tear gas late Friday into the bunker, set into the Cascade foothills about 25 miles east of Seattle. It was unclear whether the gas went deep enough to have any effect. Keller had not been seen since Sunday following a fire at his home, where the bodies of his wife and teenage daughter were discovered. His standoff with authorities began Friday after investigators found evidence that led them to the bunker near Rattlesnake Ridge Trail, according to the sheriff's office. Authorities didn't immediately send deputies in because of safety concerns. Investigators do not have a clear motive for the slayings, according to Sgt. Cindi West of the King County Sheriff's Office. Keller, who did not have a criminal record, was described as a survivalist by some relatives, West said. ""We gathered he had a doomsday attitude ... family and friends have indicated he thought the world was going to end at some point,"" West said. Keller likely had plenty of arms and supplies in the bunker, officials said. Clues to Keller's whereabouts came while investigators were processing evidence at his house, authorities said. People in the area also reported seeing Keller's pickup truck near the trailhead. ""This isn't a hole in the ground. This is a large built-up structure,"" Strachan said of the bunker. ""But hidden. It took some time to find it. In fact our tactical team smelled the wood smoke coming before they actually saw it."" Strachan said Keller's house nearby was set afire Sunday after the slayings, but it failed to spread beyond the kitchen. Authorities found a hard drive with photos, he told CNN Seattle affiliate KING. One photo was enhanced and it aided in the search for Keller, who authorities said had been building the bunker for at least eight years. The sheriff's office this week obtained an arrest warrant for Keller stipulating two counts of first-degree murder and first-degree arson. CNN's Phil Gast and Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","A body with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound is found .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Election results in four major Indian states Friday marked a momentous comeback for the country's ruling Congress-led coalition, although it was undercut in one state by backlash against a graft-tainted coalition member. Analysts say the good showing for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition is a much-needed boost for the government, battered by a series of corruption scandals, rising inflation, and low investor confidence in Asia's third largest economy. In the eastern state of West Bengal, more than three decades of communist rule came to an end as the Congress alliance led by populist leader Mamata Banerjee won a landslide victory. The Communist Party of India also lost its strong hold in the southern state of Kerala. Analysts say the left's Marxist economic policies seem increasingly outdated in the world's second-fastest growing major economy. The only remaining red state in India is Tripura in the northeast, with a scant population of 3.6 million people. Meanwhile, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the federal coalition was defeated as its key ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, lost its political monopoly. The DMK party has been badly hit by a multibillion-dollar telecoms corruption scandal that has cost the country up to $31 billion, according to a government audit. The man at the center of the scandal, A. Raja, is a DMK member and former telecoms minister. He was arrested last month for his alleged involvement in the selling of telecom licenses at rock-bottom prices. ""The DMK party has institutionalized corruption in Tamil Nadu for years and their defeat clearly shows voters will no longer tolerate corruption,"" said political analyst P. Nilotpal of the Center for Indian Political Research and Analysis. Tamil Nadu's chief minister and the head of the DMK party, M. Karunanidhi, resigned after his party's defeat. Karunanidhi's daughter and DMK lawmaker M.L Kanimozhi also faces charges for her alleged involvement in the telecom scandal. A court will is expected to decide whether Kanimozhi will be sent to jail on Saturday. ""For the longest time, local elections in India were fought along caste or religious issues,"" Nilotpal said. ""But now people are awakened, they are saying no to politicians or political families who have dominated for so many decades."" Analysts say these election results are crucial as the coalition will be in a better position to act on long-awaited reforms such as a new legislation on land acquisition. They say the regional elections could be considered a referendum ahead of the national elections in 2014.","The regional elections give a boost to the prime minister's government .

"(CNN) -- Kaitlyn Hunt's supporters say she is being prosecuted because she was in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex. Authorities say it isn't a gay rights issue at all, but rather a simple case of an adult inappropriately involved with a minor. As public outrage mounts, fueled by Internet activism, 18-year-old Hunt has until Friday to decide whether she'll accept a plea deal or go to trial for her relationship with a 14-year-old schoolmate. Hunt is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery in the relationship that the young woman and her parents say was consensual. The students attended Sebastian River High School in Sebastian, Florida, . While some of the 150,000 people signing an online petition asking prosecutors to drop the case have suggested that it's being handled differently because it involves a same-sex relationship, Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said that has nothing to do with it. ""If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl, it would have been prosecuted the same way,"" he said. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin concurs, saying whether the people involved are same-sex or opposite-sex, the legal issues are the same. ""A kid, a child under the age of 16, cannot consent to having sexual relations with an 18-year-old, an adult under the eyes of the law,"" she said. ""And that really is all this case comes down to when you look at it legally."" The Indian River State Attorney's Office has offered a plea deal that would reduce the charges to third-degree child abuse. As part of the package, she would get a year of probation and two years of monitoring, meaning she would have to wear an ankle bracelet. It would be up to a judge to decide if she would be labeled a felon as she moves forward in life. Her lawyer, Julia Graves, is asking that ""common sense"" prevail and that the charges be reduced to a misdemeanor. ""This is a life sentence for behavior that is all too common, whether male, female, gay, straight,"" Graves said at a Wednesday news conference. ""High school relationships may be fleeting, but felony convictions are forever."" Charles Sullivan, an attorney for the 14-year-old, told CNN affiliate WPTV that the plea deal is fair. ""It takes into account the seriousness of the offense. It takes into account that it's a violation of Florida law,"" he said. ""The plea offer allows her to enter a plea that she will not go to jail and she will not be labeled as a sex offender, so there's no argument that her life is being ruined by this plea offer."" A sometimes tearful Hunt said the whole thing frightens her. ""I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life, and not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family,"" she said, acknowledging the whirlwind that has surrounded her since the family went public with the story. ""Definitely overwhelming to say the least. ... Just kind of hopeful, hopeful for the best."" Prosecutors have said they will not bend on the plea deal.","Supporters of Kaitlyn Hunt, 18, say she's being prosecuted for having a same-sex relationship .

"(CNN) -- The purpose of terror is to terrorize. Though questions remain about those responsible for the attack, the horrendous bombing attack on the Boston Marathon sought to instill paralyzing fear, inflict debilitating trauma and force us to forfeit our freedom. We cannot let terror win. We -- Americans and Israelis -- live in open societies that enable us to celebrate our freedom. Whether in arts festivals, sporting events, craft fairs or merely playing with our kids in the park, we are upholding those liberties in the face of those seeking to deny them. At the same time, we know that our freedoms must be defended, sometimes by men and women in uniform but most poignantly by people refusing to succumb to fear. We beat terror by refusing to submit. The people of Boston, who on the day of the bombing were celebrating liberty's birthday, will not submit. Our experience in Israel has taught us that communities and caregivers, police and security forces, elected leaders and volunteers can unite at such times and block the terrorists from achieving their objectives. While taking all possible measures to prevent further loss of life, we adamantly refuse to forfeit our way of life. Anyone who has suffered the agony of terror knows the pain of the victims and their families as well as the radius of the emotional damage inflicted on countless citizens. We know that at such times, communities can band together and help bind the psychological and physical wounds. When first responders rush through the smoke, risking their own lives to assist the fallen, the healing process begins. And the people of Boston will heal. Still, the democratic liberties that Americans and Israelis enjoy cannot be taken for granted. American security forces and policy-makers face complex challenges. We must appreciate their successes in thwarting many attacks. We will continue to embrace freedom, but we will remain vigilant and resolute. This attack in Boston reminds us of both the worst and best in humanity. In an act of terror, those responsible destroyed and forever altered the lives of hundreds of people. But, stories of the heroic first responders, the athletes who ran to the hospital to donate blood and the countless other acts of selflessness remind us of the American spirit and its capacity to overcome terror and emerge stronger. We comfort the bereaved, tend to the hurt and take all precautions. We remember the victims but, standing together, refuse to be victimized.

"(CNN) -- On the basis of the evidence currently in the public record, one likely outcome of the case against George Zimmerman is a mixed one: There may be sufficient evidence for a reasonable prosecutor to indict him for manslaughter, but there may also be doubt sufficient for a reasonable jury to acquit him. Any such predictions should be accepted with an abundance of caution, however, because the evidence known to the special prosecutor, but not to the public, may paint a different picture. It may be stronger or weaker. Media reports suggest that police found Zimmerman with grass stains on the back of his shirt, bloody bruises on the back of his head and other indicia that may support his contention that Trayvon Martin was banging his head against the ground when Zimmerman shot him. We don't know what Martin's body or clothing show, other than the fatal bullet wound. If there are no comparable bruises or grass stains and if the bullet wound and powder residue establish that the gun was fired at very close range, this too might support a claim of self-defense. Then there is a recorded cry for help, which, if it turns out to be the voice of Martin, would undercut the defense -- if the voice analysis passes scientific muster and is deemed admissible into evidence. There may be additional forensic evidence -- or witnesses -- of which we are now unaware, though it is unlikely there is a ""smoking gun."" Finally, there is the overarching and historically painful reality that an unarmed black teenager lies dead at the hand of an armed Hispanic man who ignored a dispatcher's advice not to follow and engage the ""suspect,"" and who may have -- and this too is forensically unclear -- uttered a racial epithet while chasing him. These ""facts"" give rise to several possible scenarios of what may actually have occurred on that dark rainy night. Under the Florida self-defense statute, it matters greatly what happened, most especially who ""initially provoke[d] the use of force,"" and who started the physical encounter. If Zimmerman initially provoked the deadly encounter, then he cannot invoke any ""stand your ground"" defense. He would then be under a legal obligation to ""exhaust ... every reasonable means to escape."" Though this statute is anything but a model of clarity, it does suggest that whoever ""provokes"" a deadly encounter has a heavy burden of justification in claiming self-defense. But the statute doesn't define ""provokes,"" and that ambiguous word may hold the key to the outcome of this tragic case. If provocation is limited to a physical assault, and if Zimmerman's account that Martin blindsided him with a punch is believed, then Zimmerman did not provoke the encounter. But if provocation includes following the victim and harassing him, then Zimmerman may well qualify as a provocateur. Moreover, a jury may believe that Zimmerman started the physical confrontation by grabbing Martin. This would almost certainly constitute provocation. But to complicate matters further, even a provocateur has the legal right to defend himself under Florida law if he can't escape and if he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, as Zimmerman claims he was. All this goes to show how factually driven this case is under Florida law. And we don't yet know all the facts. The special prosecutor, who has said she will not use a grand jury to decide whether to indict Zimmerman, has an obligation to consider all the evidence and to apply the law to the facts. All she needs in order to indict is probable cause that a crime has been committed. A jury that ultimately decides whether the defendant is guilty needs much more: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But what if a prosecutor concludes that there is both probable cause and a reasonable doubt? That is the nightmare scenario that this prosecutor may well face. In ordinary circumstances, most prosecutors would not bring such a case, because it would be a waste of resources to indict someone who will probably be acquitted. But this is anything but a run-of-the-mill case. Moreover, the Florida statute provides an additional layer of protection to a defendant claiming self-defense: A judge must decide whether the defendant is ""immune from prosecution,"" that is, if the judge believes his actions fall under the law of self-defense. So the following mixed outcome is certainly possible: The special prosecutor indicts; the judge does or doesn't grant immunity; if he doesn't, the jury acquits. Many people would be unhappy with such a mixed outcome, but it is not the job of the law to make people happy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Dershowitz.","Alan Dershowitz: Prosecutor in Trayvon Martin case could face ""nightmare scenario""
He says based on evidence that is public, there could be probable cause to indict .

"Washington (CNN) -- A single leaked document has opened a political Pandora's box over intelligence-gathering in the post 9/11 United States, raising questions about what is being done and how the public perceives it almost 12 years after the terrorist attacks that traumatized the nation. This week's disclosure of classified government programs to collect information on phone calls, e-mails and Internet use for national security reasons quickly dominated headlines, forcing President Barack Obama to reassure Americans on Friday that ""nobody is listening to your telephone calls."" His first public comments on the secret programs revealed by the Guardian and Washington Post touched on a litany of politically volatile issues that have come to shape the Obama presidency early in its second term. In particular, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor's claim of a ""false choice"" between civil liberties and national security following the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks now argues that such a choice was inevitable. ""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to make some choices as a society."" The swing in perspective reflects how the United States has changed since 9/11, when the attacks on New York and Washington that killed almost 3,000 people traumatized a nation where many believed global terror couldn't threaten the homeland. How does it affect me? Ensuing security efforts by President George W. Bush's administration included the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as tougher policies such as torturing suspects. In the anti-terrorism fervor of the nation, Congress easily passed the Patriot Act sought by the Bush administration in 2001 to expand domestic spying despite opposition by civil liberties groups. Some provisions of the Patriot Act were ruled unconstitutional and Congress reauthorized a modified version five years later. Obama, then a first-term senator from Illinois, voted for the revised measure after taking part in mostly unsuccessful efforts to further strengthen civil liberties provisions. As president in 2011, Obama signed another reauthorization of some Patriot Act provisions that allow the clandestine operations made public this week. On Friday, the president argued that while classified, the programs were known to Congress and contained effective oversight from legislators and federal courts. He rejected criticism from both the far left and far right of the political spectrum that the data mining of phone records and monitoring of foreign e-mail and Internet use overstepped constitutional bounds, but welcomed renewed public debate on the shadowy issue. Damage assessment over U.S. intelligence-gathering leaks . ""In the abstract, you can complain about Big Brother or how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance,"" Obama concluded. Leaders of intelligence committees in the House and Senate have publicly backed the secret programs, saying they helped authorities prevent terrorist attacks. Others in Congress argued the secret information-gathering goes too far. ""I think that we've overreached,"" Sen. Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat who has long pushed for greater transparency in the government's counter-terror efforts, told CNN. ""I think that we ought to have this discussion and we can find the right balance. But if the people don't know, how do you have the discussion?"" Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, also said people have to know what liberties are at stake before they can effectively debate whether the government programs are right or wrong. Privacy's already dead . ""At some point we have to ask that question, what are you willing to give up?"" Jaffer told CNN. ""Before you ask it, you have to have some information about what is being given up. Too much of it is secret."" A leaked court order published by the Guardian on Wednesday shed the first light on the extent of the government monitoring of information. Subsequent revelations confirmed by the government disclosed U.S. intelligence agencies are collecting details on telephone calls and monitoring the online activities of at least some overseas customers of Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple and other providers of popular online services. Udall and fellow Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon warned last year that the American public ""would be stunned to learn the details"" of how the government was interpreting the Patriot Act. ""As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows,"" they wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. To Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, the issue touches on shifts in the terrorism threat as well as how to protect against it. A rise in homegrown terrorism and the corresponding need to look internally for possible threats is ""how post 9/11 America has changed,"" West told CNN on Friday. In the aftermath of the 9/11attacks, ""people favored the Patriot Act because it was going to be directed against terrorists,"" he said. ""It used to be us versus them, but those distinctions have broken down. If you want to target terrorists, there are going to be some Americans in that category."" To handle what he called a ""horrible communications challenge"" in response to the firestorm created by this week's revelations, West said the Obama administration needs to explain the difference between outright spying such as listening in on phone calls and the more general data mining of the newly disclosed programs. ""Basically everyone's doing that these days, both in government and business,"" he said of data mining, which essentially is how Facebook tailors advertisements to specific patterns of activity by its members. However, a lack of clarity in rules and regulations under the Patriot Act magnifies the problem, according to West. For example, he noted that that overseas phone calls from the United States can be subject to greater scrutiny than domestic calls. Internet laughs about being spied on . ""It's actually easy for people to be paranoid, because in some cases there are greater protections, but in other areas there are fewer or no protections,"" West said. Another change has been the revolution in social media on the Internet, with people now able to communicate around the world instantly and for free. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said the technology advance means a younger generation that is much more experienced and comfortable with publicly sharing details of their lives and also more aware of the threat of terrorism. ""They've lived their whole lives on the Internet; everything they are is public,"" Schiller told CNN on Friday. At the same time, she said, ""growing up with sort of the threat of random terrorism has created a nation that is more frightened than it used to be and more willing to let the government do what it needs to go to keep them safe."" As a result, Schiller said, the Obama administration has to demonstrate it will follow the law in using information collected in order to generate public support for letting it have that information. ""When it fails, people are less willing to allow you to invade their privacy,"" she said. For that reason, this week's disclosures pose a problem for Obama at a time when the Internal Revenue Service has been cited for targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra scrutiny. Opinion: The great privacy debate . Republican opponents seeking to depict a government gone wild lump together the IRS controversy, the Justice Department's secret subpoenas for journalist phone records and the newly revealed classified programs to attack the president. ""This is an all-out assault on the Constitution,"" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday in a statement that noted Obama formerly fought to protect civil liberties when he was in the Senate. To Schiller, Obama's adoption of much of the Bush-era anti-terrorism apparatus was the natural outcome from assuming presidential responsibility for national security. ""Nobody predicted in 2007 that Barack Obama would preside over such a massive spying operation,"" she said. ""You never know until you get in there how many threats are out there against the United States and what you have to do is thwart them."" It all comes down to being the commander in chief, she said, adding: ""I don't think there's a president who ever served who would not have done the same thing in the name of security.""

"(CNN) -- Scenes from the mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater are horrific, but are all too familiar in the United States. Some have argued that gun control is irrelevant to mass shootings because the perpetrators are typically so determined that they will overcome any legal hurdle to acquiring firearms. However, mass murderers often use assault weapons or guns with large ammunition capacity. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder . One of the guns James Eagan Holmes allegedly used to shoot 70 people within minutes was an assault rifle with a 100-round drum magazine. This extraordinary firepower enables gunmen to kill and wound more victims than they otherwise could if they used weapons that held fewer bullets. There is obviously no need for any civilian to have such powerful weapons. Rational gun policy, one that puts public safety ahead of the interests of the gun industry and gun enthusiasts, would ban firearms and ammunition clips that hold more than 10 rounds. Such a policy might not prevent many of our mass shootings, but it should reduce the number of victims from these incidents. Skeptics might point to the federal assault weapons ban (a section of the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act) that Congress let expire in 2004 as a failure that did not affect overall homicide rates. However, the law's impact was limited by its narrowness that made it easy for gun manufacturers to evade. A broad ban on the sale and possession of high capacity (more than 10 rounds) ammunition magazines with stiff penalties would translate into saved lives. Between 9,000 and 10,000 people are murdered each year with guns in the U.S., most garnering little attention. Local news coverage of such events typically provides scant information or context to enable citizens to understand the role of guns in these incidents. Invariably, the only time that gun violence and gun policy are discussed in the national media is after a horrific shooting rampage. We should not brush aside discussions of gun policy as too politically difficult to expect meaningful change, or ""the price for our freedoms."" Instead, we should reflect on why the U.S. has a murder rate that is nearly seven times higher than the average murder rate in other high-income countries and a nearly 20 times higher murder rate with guns. And we should consider how flaws in current gun policies contribute to this disparity. Standards for legal ownership and permits to carry a concealed gun are relatively lax in the U.S. In most states, a person with a long history of arrests and convictions for misdemeanors (often pleaded down from felony charges), prior restraining orders for domestic violence and history of drug and alcohol abuse can own as many military-style weapons as he can afford to purchase, and can legally carry concealed guns almost anywhere. Opinion: When will America wake up to gun violence? Under federal law, anyone wanting to purchase a firearm from a licensed gun dealer must pass a background check. But in most states, the gun dealer who stands to profit from a gun sale, rather than a law enforcement agency, determines the authenticity of purchasers' identification cards. Gun dealers face little consequence if they fail to account for dozens of guns upon inspection. Data indicating which gun dealers sell the most guns linked to crimes are kept from public view and cannot be used in decisions about the dealer's license. Illogically, federal law and most state gun laws allow firearm purchases from private sellers with no background check or questions asked. As a result of these policies, it is far too easy for dangerous people to own, carry and ultimately use guns. Following mass shootings, gun control opponents have not been bashful about pushing for laws to remove restrictions on carrying guns in schools, bars and churches. Indeed, calls for removing restrictions on carrying concealed firearms will not stop mass shootings. Research indicates that so-called right-to-carry laws don't reduce violence, and may increase aggravated assaults. But studies I have conducted indicate that stricter regulations of gun sales, whether by retail dealers or by private sellers, are associated with fewer guns diverted to criminals. Moreover, national national surveys show that a large majority of citizens favor these reforms to our gun laws, including most gun owners. In addition, there is substantial research showing that law enforcement strategies that focus on deterring illegal gun possession reduce violent crime. Public health initiatives in Chicago and Baltimore, which use reformed ex-gang-members to reach out to youth, mediate disputes and promote alternatives to violence, have also been shown to significantly reduce homicides and shootings. More than 30,000 people die every year from guns in the U.S., and more than 400,000 are victims of nonfatal crime committed with guns. The economic costs are staggering -- an estimated $100 billion annually. Only a small fraction of these deaths are connected to mass shootings. But the mounting deaths and associated trauma from mass shootings should motivate us to take action to make needed reforms to our gun laws, focus law enforcement resources on combating illegal gun possession and invest in prevention initiatives proven to reduce gun violence. America's high rate of gun violence is shameful. When will we change? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel W. Webster.","Some people argue that gun control is irrelevant to mass shootings .
Daniel Webster: But mass murderers often use firearms with large ammunition capacity .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Loud chants rise up from the street below, the noise bouncing off the wall of the building across the way and pouring in to an apartment on the top floor of a block in Vicalvaro, a working class suburb of Madrid. ""The people, united, will never be divided!"" yells the crowd, angrily waving banners and placards. ""To fight is the only way!"" Rocio pokes her head out of the window, watching the commotion below with interest, as dog-walkers, mothers with strollers, and pensioners carrying shopping bags join the throng. The scores of people gathering on the sidewalk are no nosey neighbors -- indeed, many of them are complete strangers to the family living on the fifth floor -- but they are all here to protect Rocio from eviction. The mother-of-one, with brightly-dyed hair, braces on her teeth, and worry etched on her face, hangs her head as she explains how she got here: The move from Ecuador in 2003, when times were good and jobs plentiful in Spain, the decision to invest in a home for Rocio and her son, now 17 and in high school. But then the global financial crisis hit, bringing Spain's economy to its knees; Rocio lost her jobs -- in a shop, and as a cleaner -- and the mortgage payments spiraled out of reach. She is an example of the crisis many Spaniards face as the country deals with the highest unemployment since the Civil War in the 1930s, and a recession entering its second year. For a while, Rocio got by on benefits, but then those stopped too, and now the bailiffs are circling. ""They are about to evict me, and I'm fighting to stay because I don't have anywhere else to go,"" she says. ""I haven't paid my mortgage because I can't -- I don't have any work."" Inside the cosy two-bedroom apartment, there's little sign that the family may be turned out onto the street at any moment: The TV is on in the lounge, shelves and closets are full, and a piece of meat sits on the kitchen counter top, defrosting in time for tonight's dinner. In the main bedroom, there's just one concession to the very real threat that Rocio might be about to lose her home: a large black suitcase sits, empty, atop a bedspread dotted with pink roses. ""I can't stand the thought of living on the streets with my son, but I have no idea where else to go,"" she says. ""Just thinking about it makes me very sad."" Rocio's story is echoed by others all over Spain: the global financial crisis knocked the bottom out of the country's housing market and sparked a major recession that left thousands jobless. The country's unemployment rate stands at 26% -- its highest level ever -- and the situation is even worse for young people, with more than 55% of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work. With no income, many are finding themselves unable to afford the mortgage payments on homes that are no longer worth the prices paid for them. Tomas Rodriguez is one of those who lost his home. The 33-year-old used to work in a grocery store, but was made redundant when the company got into trouble. Now he sleeps in Madrid's Plaza Mayor, a tourist hotspot by day, and cardboard city peopled by the homeless at night. ""I was able to get unemployment benefits, but time has run out,"" he says. ""I can't afford to pay for things, so now I'm living on the street... It's hard, but that's the way it is."" Rodriguez says the financial crisis has left many ordinary Spaniards homeless: ""People are losing their jobs. Now they can't pay their mortgages, they can't provide for their families, they struggle. ""People have an image of the homeless that is not real -- they see somebody with a box of wine and they think we're all like that, [but] that's not the case... Even people with degrees are living on the street. Nobody is safe."" It is this fear that has driven many Spanish people to action -- compelled to act by what they see as the gross unfairness of everyday life in Spain in 2013, where struggling citizens are evicted, even as hundreds of homes lie empty. Dozens of those gathered outside the door of Rocio's apartment block are supporters of ""Stop Desahucios"" (Stop Evictions), part of the Platform of People Affected by Mortgages (PAH) a group which campaigns to prevent banks and authorities turfing those hit by the country's economic woes out of their homes. ""For every eviction, an occupation!"" they shout, accusing the banks and authorities of ""real estate terrorism."" ""The next eviction should be at the Palace of Moncloa! [the Spanish prime minister's official residence]"" runs another chant; a few short years ago, most Spaniards would have shied away from such overtly political protests. Activist Dante Scherma, 24, says Spain's troubled history had left many wary of becoming involved in political issues: ""Forty years of Franco's dictatorship made people disconnect from politics."" But when simmering anger and resentment about the government and the economy gave way to the mass marches of the 15-M movement -- also known as the ""Indignados"" -- the floodgates were opened. In 2011, thousands of Spaniards took to the country's streets, inspiring the global ""Occupy"" movement with their protest camp in Madrid's Puerta del Sol. Sofia de Roa, 28, was one of the first to take part in the demonstrations, which she says were a political awakening for the Spanish people. ""Citizens were not used to speaking out on political issues. My parents never discussed politics with me, but now that is changing. The movement awoke a lot of people who were not interested in politics before."" Scherma agrees: ""The 15-M movement made people talk about social issues, and about politics in normal conversations -- in cafes, restaurants, bars -- where before they only talked about football or fashion."" Nowadays, Madrid is a city of protests -- it is almost impossible to cross the capital without coming across a sit-in or a march, petitions are everywhere, and the activists have returned to the Puerta del Sol. The demonstrations are organized through the internet, particicularly Twitter and Facebook. ""We use the social networks to communicate,"" explains de Roa, brandishing her smartphone. ""This is the tool that has permitted us to fight together, and to feel that we are not alone."" Their subjects are anything and everything -- from education reform to job losses, government cuts to corruption -- but all reflecting a widespread dissatisfaction with politicians and their handling of the country's economic crisis. ""They are destroying our future,"" says college student Alejandra, as she participates in a march in support of public education. ""We know there's a crisis, but it could be less if they managed the money better. ""All the political parties do is accuse each other, the government is destroying the country, and the conditions for workers are getting worse and worse."" Each protest is color-coded: White for healthcare workers, green for the education sector, orange for social services, red for general trade union members, and black for public service workers. On Saturday, February 23, all these individual groups are expected to unite for rainbow-hued mass demonstrations in towns and cities across Spain, known as the ""Marea Cuidadana"" (Tide of Citizens). Back in Vicalvaro, the moment of truth has arrived, but the crowd -- now shouting at the police, insisting they should be ashamed of themselves for helping to evict families -- appears to have had an impact. Rocio is summoned downstairs, as lawyers from the PAH explain that she will be able to stay -- for a while at least. For those working to stop Spain's eviction epidemic, today has seen a small and temporary victory: The bailiffs have been put off for now, but Rocio knows they may yet return. For those demonstrating about cuts, corruption and a lack of cash, the protests will go on. CNN's Joe Duran contributed to this report.","Spain has seen hundreds of protests since the ""Indignados"" movement erupted .

"Ottawa (CNN) -- Montreal's interim mayor, Michael Applebaum, was arrested and charged early Monday with 14 criminal counts including fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy. Quebec police said the charges involve at least two Montreal real estate transactions from 2006 to 2011 and hundreds of thousands of dollars traded hands. ""These allegations rest essentially on obtaining permission and political support on two real estate projects,"" said Capt. Andre Boulanger of the Surete du Quebec, the province's police force. He would not confirm or deny if the charges involve bribes or ties to gangsters and organized crime. Applebaum took over the mayor's job in November after Gerald Tremblay resigned amid corruption allegations. At the time, Applebaum vowed to ""end an era of sleaze"" at Montreal City Hall. From 2006 to 2011, Applebaum served as the borough mayor of a large suburb of Montreal. During this time he also served on the city council. Commenting at a police news conference Monday, the head of Quebec's anti-corruption squad, Cmdr. Robert LaFreniere, said, ""We can no longer tolerate these reprehensible acts committed towards the management of our public institutions. The values of ethics and integrity must remain at the heart of the actions taken by our elected officials."" Officers said the investigation began in March after they received what they described as ""solid"" evidence from members of the public. Quebec police say the investigation continues and they are not ruling out more arrests. This is the most recent explosive allegation to rock the city of Montreal as the details of an insidious corruption scandal have been laid bare at a province-wide inquiry. Testimony at that inquiry has outlined widespread corruption allegations and close relationships between elected officials, city employees, contractors and even organized crime. Applebaum denies all charges.","Michael Applebaum faces 14 counts including fraud, breach of trust and conspiracy .

"(CNN) -- Women's rights took center stage Saturday at the Nobel ceremonies as three women recognized for their struggles against the backdrops of the Arab Spring and democratic progress in Africa accepted this year's peace prize. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Leymah Gbowee, a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country, shared the prize with Tawakkul Karman, an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in Yemen. The three were chosen for their non-violent struggle against injustice, sexual violence and repression. ""Ever since the Norwegian Nobel Committee made this year's decision known, the people of Norway have looked forward to seeing you on this stage,"" said Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. ""You give concrete meaning to the Chinese proverb which says that 'women hold up half the sky,'"" he said. ""We thank you for the hope you awaken in us all."" Jagland said the work of the three laureates should serve as warning to dictators even as more civilians were killed Saturday in Syria. 'Been a long time coming,' say prize winners . ""The leaders in Yemen and Syria who murder their people to retain their own power should take note of the following: mankind's fight for freedom and human rights never stops,"" Jagland said. The three women received the coveted gold Nobel medal and a diploma and will share $1.5 million in cash. They will also be honored with a star-studded concert Sunday that culminates the program of Nobel events. All three women dedicated their remarks to women struggling for equal rights around the world. ""I urge my sisters, and my brothers, not to be afraid,"" Sirleaf said in her Nobel lecture. ""Be not afraid to denounce injustice, though you may be outnumbered. Be not afraid to seek peace, even if your voice may be small. Be not afraid to demand peace."" Johnson Sirleaf, a 73-year-old Harvard graduate whose political resilience earned her the nickname ""Iron Lady,"" became Africa's first democratically-elected female president in 2006, three years after decades of civil war ended. Crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former President Charles Taylor, she declared a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary-age children. She dedicated her remarks to women around the world ""who have seen the devastation that merciless violence can bring."" Gbowee, 39, led a women's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in Liberia's civil war. She mobilized hundreds of women to force delegates at 2003 peace talks to sign a treaty -- at one point calling for a ""sex strike"" until demands were met. She thanked Liberian women for making ""our country proud."" ""Thank you for sitting in the rain and under the sun. This is your prize. This is our prize,"" she said. ""The world used to remember Liberia for child soldiers but they now remember our country for the white t-shirt women,"" she said referring to the women clad in white T-shirts who demanded an end to Liberia's brutal civil war. ""Who would have ever thought that Liberian women would have been among faces of women's global victory, but you did it."" But she also reminded the world that victory was still afar. ""We must continue to unite in sisterhood to turn our tears into triumph, our despair into determination and our fear into fortitude."" she said. ""There is no time to rest until our world achieves wholeness and balance, where all men and women are considered equal and free."" Karman, 32, emerged as an icon of change as Yemen was swept up in the tumult of the Arab Spring, but the mother-of-three has long been active in campaigning for women and human rights. Karman, the first Arab woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize -- and one of its youngest recipients -- founded the rights group Women Journalists without Chains, and emerged as a key figure in protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. ""I have always believed that resistance against repression and violence is possible without relying on similar repression and violence,"" she said. ""I have always believed that human civilization is the fruit of the effort of both women and men. ""So, when women are treated unjustly and are deprived of their natural right in this process, all social deficiencies and cultural illnesses will be unfolded, and in the end the whole community, men and women, will suffer."" While Johnson Sirleaf's Nobel achievement has stirred anger among Liberian political opponents who claim recent elections were rigged in her favor, this year's Nobel Peace Price is unlikely to attract the level of controversy seen in 2010. China and more than a dozen other countries, including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, boycotted the event over the decision to award the prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, a key figure in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Liu, who is serving an 11-year-sentence in a Chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power,"" was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the prize, which China denounced as a ""political farce."" Awarded almost every year since 1901 (it has been halted during times of major international conflict) the Peace Prize has a history of contentious laureates. Previous winners include former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who won alongside Vietnamese revolutionary Le Duc Tho (who declined the award), and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who won jointly with Israeli President Shimon Peres and former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In 2009, the prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama despite the fact he had spent less than one year in office. Two years earlier, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore was a joint recipient in recognition of work highlighting climate change. â€¢ This year's three co-laureates will sit down with CNN's Jonathan Mann for an hour-long special interview. The interview will broadcast live on CNN International and CNN.com on Saturday at 1600 GMT (11 a.m. ET) and repeated on Sunday at 0300 GMT (10 p.m. ET Saturday). â€¢ The concert in honor of the Nobel prize winners will be broadcast on CNN.com on Sunday between 1900-2000 GMT (2 p.m.-3 p.m. ET) and 2030-2130 GMT (3:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m. ET).","NEW: Nobel chairman says the prize should serve as warning to dictators .

"(CNN) -- As a lifelong resident of South Central Los Angeles, I refuse to be part of the social system that breeds problems rather than solutions. South Central is a ""food desert"" where the lack of healthy food alternatives leads to obesity and preventable disease. I have raised my sons in South L.A., and it is heartbreaking to see so many young kids on a trajectory to nowhere, potential high school dropouts prey to gangs, drugs, violence and incarceration. So where do we start to create positive change? I believe that change starts from within, and unless you want to take the first step, change will never happen. We need to take the responsibility to be the creative force in our society. We need to be the gardeners of our society. TED.com: Ron Finley's talk on gardening in South Central . So instead of waiting for others (the city or other units of government), I decided to take my shovel, my weapon of change, and start gardening. Change begins with youth and healthy role models. Gardening takes care of both. It builds community. Children learn what they live. If children live with hostility, they learn to fight. If they live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive. If they live with criticism, they learn to condemn. If they live around alcohol, drugs, unhealthy food and violence, this is what they will reproduce in their lives and in society in general. This is a vicious circle that needs to end. My vision is that gardening can do that -- and my organization has been planting gardens in South Central, including ones on city-owned land. If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever you put in front of them. When kids learn to grow vegetables, they learn not only how to eat in a healthy way but how to be productive and are armed with a value system that will help them to navigate in their lives -- values such as patience, appreciation, sharing, honesty and respect. You will be surprised how kids are affected by this. One day, I was out in my garden attending to my sunflowers when a teenager passed by with his earphones hooked up, listening to his music. When he saw the huge sunflowers in my garden, he was taken aback: ""Yo! Is dat real?"" He was screaming. A few days later, he joined us in the garden. TED Blog: A visit to Ron Finley's garden . But gardening's therapeutic effect is not only for kids. I have been to homeless shelters to install gardens. People will come around and will start telling stories of gardening with their mothers and grandmothers. I see hopeless faces light up; I see the seed of hope where none existed before, and this is for me a great reward. Our society -- not just South Central -- suffers from social corrosion. Due to the economic crisis, parents have to work long hours (if they are lucky enough to have a job), and often, kids are neglected. In many cases, kids grow up with their TV set as parent. Technology offers more ways of nominal communication, but our society tends to promote actual isolation. It is crucially important to cultivate nourishing relationships and human connections, and gardening can definitely do that. So who do you want to be: a bystander or a force of positive change? Pick up your shovel, bring some compost and come meet me in the garden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Finley.","Ron Finley: South Central Los Angeles is a ""food desert"" with few healthy alternatives .

"(CNN) -- Thirty days of signs and signals have revealed to the world in Francis I, a pope who seems eager to earn the title pontiff, or bridge-builder. Beginning with his choice of a name, which evokes the beloved image of St. Francis of Assisi, the former cardinal of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, put the world on notice that change was afoot by forgoing the fancy red slippers and ermine stole favored by other popes. Since then he has shown a remarkable common touch in his encounters with the public and greater sensitivity to others than the man who came before him. Try as he did, Francis' immediate predecessor, Benedict XVI, never looked comfortable in his own skin, let alone in pastoral contact with others. Clad in his ornate robes, he seemed to keep the world at arm's length in a way that betrayed his long service as Rome's ""Rottweiler"" (a nickname he received from the press) in charge of disciplining those who deviated from doctrine. While personally warmer, the pope before Benedict, John Paul II, was stern when it came to religious matters and approached the world with an Us vs. Them mindset. As the church was rocked by a seemingly endless number of sex abuse scandals -- thousands of child victims and systematic cover-ups by the hierarchy -- he blamed secular society, especially the media, and capitalistic materialism. Pope Francis tasks cardinals with studying reform of Catholic Church . In contrast with John Paul and Benedict, Francis doesn't seem capable of greeting anyone without a big, sincere smile and whenever given the choice between clerical privilege and everyday human experience, he opts for the human. This was demonstrated most clearly as he visited a jail during Holy Week to symbolically wash the feet of a dozen people who represented the apostles. Among them were two women and two Muslims. Their presence, and Francis's ease with them, dismayed traditionalists who recoiled at the sight of females and non-Catholics being included in the ritual. It thrilled those who hunger for a more accessible and inclusive church. The survivors of clerical abuse, who I have come to know during three years of writing my book ""Mortal Sins,"" hope that Francis will bring real change. However, they have been discouraged by 30 years of church evasions and counterattacks and are understandably wary. Tough-minded evaluators, they criticize Francis' record on abuse in Argentina. There he was among many of the world's Catholic bishops -- fully 25% -- who failed to meet a deadline for establishing policies to deal with complaints and priests who were accused, according to the Wall Street Journal. Victims also wait for Francis to demonstrate that he will discipline offenders and reveal their records. ""We don't think statements make kids any safer,"" SNAP leader Barbara Blaine told me this week. ""Unless he makes kids safer, he's not doing his job."" Blaine's ""show-me"" attitude is echoed by her SNAP colleague Peter Isely, who was sexually abused when he attended a Catholic boarding school in Wisconsin. Isely said he admires the new man's style and sees, in his personality, reason for hope. Vatican seeks to rebrand its relationship with science . ""St. Francis was the single greatest reformer in the history of the Catholic Church,""' noted Isely. ""My favorite quote by St. Francis is, `Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.' Confronting and reforming the church's global system of child sex abuse and cover-up, that is doing what is necessary. If Pope Francis does that, who knows what's possible? Better yet, what's impossible."" Jeffrey Anderson, the attorney most responsible for the waves of litigation that have revealed the church's secrets on abusive priests, is even more optimistic. Regarded by some as the most dreaded enemy of institutional Catholicism, Anderson told me, ""This pope has already demonstrated in action and words a humility we haven't seen before. I see that as revolutionary and it is in direct contrast with the hubris that was the source of the abuse crisis. It gives me hope that he can, if he chooses to, go against the power structure and fundamentally change things. For today I have hope like I never had."" Although I am also skeptical of church leaders and well aware of the hierarchy's long-standing failure on the abuse issue, Francis' first 30 days have led me to agree with Anderson when it comes to the new pope's personality. This is a shift for me, and I make it tentatively, because like all Catholics and former Catholics, I know we are susceptible to the influence of church stagecraft. We want to believe, and that desire has been exploited too often in the past. If Francis makes the changes that the church must make to end the sex abuse crisis, it will happen because he grasps and wields the power of his office. As a cardinal, he was bound by his oath of obedience to ""go along."" As pope, he is the one who makes the rules and requires others to obey. What if one of those requirements included an open, transparent and serious program to make children safe and heal the trauma of the past 30 years? Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse cases . Many of history's transformational figures have been men who, when they finally achieved power, used it in surprising ways. Theodore Roosevelt, son of wealth and privilege, became the trust-busting enemy of corporate monopolists. Southerner Lyndon Johnson used his considerable skills to champion civil rights. Richard Nixon, Republican friend of industrialists, created the Environmental Protection Agency. Francis has his chance now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael D'Antonio.","Michael D'Antonio: Pope Francis' first month has shown a remarkable common touch .
He says the Pope connects with people on a human level .

"(CNN) -- Norway's alleged mass killer testified on Thursday that he played video games as a way to train for a shooting spree that killed 77 people last summer. In particular, Anders Behring Breivik said at his trial that he played ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"" as a means of shooting practice, according to CNN's report. The confessed shooter also said he once played the online game ""World of Warcraft,"" a role-playing adventure with multiple players from around the world, for as many as 16 hours a day. For people who have long suspected that there is some link between violent video games and real-world violence, the statement offered frightening new evidence for why the video-game industry should be more strictly regulated. Many gamers and columnists, however, rolled their eyes and collectively muttered ""here we go again."" ""How many times are we going to do this?"" Paul Tassi wrote in a Forbes story, ""The idiocy of blaming video games for the Norway massacre."" ""Really now, it's getting absurd."" ""Norway Killer Played World of Warcraft, Which Probably Means Nothing At All,"" declared a headline on Time.com, which shares a parent company with CNN. Whether shoot-'em-up video games can incite violence has been a long-running debate among the public as well as in clinical psychology. This type of discussion tends to come up every time it's revealed that a high-profile killer also played video games. Perhaps the most memorable case study was the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado in 1999, during which experts speculated about the influence of the game ""Doom"" on the teenagers who carried out that crime. And for years, the controversial ""Grand Theft Auto"" series, in which players can kill police officers, was targeted by critics who said it glamorizes criminals and promotes violence. The makers of the game were even sued by the attorney for a convicted cop killer in Alabama, who argued the game inspired his client. Ultimately, it seems like science should judge whether playing violent video games can lead to a propensity for violence in the real world. A number of recent studies have cast doubts about the link between video games and violence, but there's no definitive answer. Confusingly, a 2004 U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education report studied 24 cases of school violence and found: ""Over half of the attackers demonstrated some interest in violence, through movies, video games, books and other media. However, there was no one common type of interest in violence indicated. Instead, the attackers' interest in violent themes took various forms."" The always-vocal jury of the Internet, meanwhile, rushed on Thursday to the defense of the video game industry. Here's a breakdown of the general argument, in case you want to be supercontrarian and appropriate these points for cocktail-party conversation this weekend. Point 1: Lots of people play video games and don't kill people. ""How many subscribers do those two games have? Several million? And yet several million of us managed not to go bonkers with a gun,"" a commenter on my Google+ page. ""Ridiculous argument."" Point 1.5: Lots of people who play ""FarmVille"" don't actually farm. Here's a related point: People who play other kinds of video games don't usually (or ever) act out the things they do in the games. ""Shooters do not create real-life killers. Neither does ""FarmVille"" create real-life farmers,"" another Google+ commenter said. Point 2: The confessed Norway killer had other apparent influences. ""If we're looking for Breivik's influences and motivations, we'd better start with xenophobia, fundamentalist Christianity and right-wing ideology before even mentioning what was in his Xbox,"" a commenter wrote on CNN's story about the trial. And from Lisa Smith on Google+: ""If there were no violent video games or movies, would Breivek have shrugged off writing his manifesto [on] his irrational fear of Islam? No, then perhaps then if he'd been unable to watch the news? Oops, now we have to keep him from using the Internet, was that enough?"" Point 3: There are lots of ways to train for a shooting spree. From a Forbes column: ""Let's say he did use 'Call of Duty' to help him train in some way. So what? That may sound callous, but let's be real here. If he went to a gun range every single day for the past year, a place that actually trains you how to hit person-shaped targets with a real gun firing real bullets in your hands, would we be talking about how shooting ranges are to blame? Would we want them all closed down for fear someone else might learn how to shoot a gun and kill someone? Some might, but they'd be shouted down by gun rights activists, ironically many of whom would like to blame games instead."" Point 3.5: And anyway, these games would be crappy for training. ""How can 'World of Warcraft' be considered 'training'? Unless he planned on looting gold and armor. Also, 'Modern Warfare' is hardly a training tool. Too linear and unrealistic,"" another Google+ commenter wrote. ""Could the 'Armed Assault' series, with its more simulation based approach, have been more useful to create a mass murderer?"" Point 4: There's little scientific evidence to suggest video games actually make people violent. From Time.com: ""The most up-to-date research, according to academic and TIME contributor Christopher Ferguson, 'has not found that children who play VVG [violent video games] are more violent than other kids, nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion.' In Ferguson's own longitudinal studies, recently published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, he found 'no long-term link between VVG and youth aggression or dating violence.' And Ferguson references another recent longitudinal study involving German children, published in Media Psychology, which similarly found no links between increased aggression and violent video games."" Point 5: The Norway killer apparently saw ""WoW"" as a cover-up device. I'll add this little factoid to the pile: If you search the manifesto that's attributed to Breivik, you'll only find a few references to ""World of Warcraft."" When he does mention the game, he appears to be explaining that by saying if you're playing ""WoW"" all the time, you can stop family members and friends from questioning what you're up to. ""Announce to your closest friends, co-workers and family that you are pursuing a 'project' that can at least partly justify your 'new pattern of activities' (isolation/travel) while in the planning phase,"" the manifesto says. ""(For) example, tell them that you have started to play 'World of Warcraft' or any other online MMO game and that you wish to focus on this for the next months/year. This 'new project' can justify isolation and people will understand somewhat why you are not answering your phone over long periods.""

"(CNN) -- It's been a difficult year for the seven time F1 champion, Michael Schumacher. After three years in retirement, Schumacher returned to F1 with the new Mercedes team, but has struggled to make an impact on the race track, finishing this year's season in a disappointing ninth place. It has led many to wonder why the racing legend has returned to sport. But amid the gossip and allegations, the 41-year-old has defended his decision. He told CNN: ""I enjoy it. I feel I have the right to do what I enjoy. Whether I put in dispute my reputation...I just feel good about my decision and I have so much support from people."" ""I certainly want to make it a successful return,"" he continued. ""I'm only happy if I'm back on the winning road with the team. This is what I'm working for, this is the joy of the passion for Formula 1."" His decision has been supported by some of the biggest names in F1. Finnish F1 driver for Team Lotus Heikki Kovalainen told CNN the criticisms towards Schumacher were unfair. ""People had high expectations, people expected him to win. But (Mercedes) didn't have a car to win and second of all, things have changed since he left Formula 1."" Fellow F1 champion Alain Prost said no-one should judge or criticize a driver of his caliber, saying, ""For me, it is difficult, almost impossible to go back to the title after three years...But if there's one driver who'd be able to do it, I think it's Michael."" Team principal and co-owner of Mercedes, Ross Brawn, admits the team has had a disappointing year and credits some of that to Schumacher. ""It's been disappointing, in overall performance, we haven't had the car, Michael's taken a little time to get up to the performance he'll be able to deliver. I've seen patches of that performance...the last few races of the season was the Michael Schumacher I expected to see. But on a more positive note, Brawn added: ""Now it's all coming together and I think next year we're going to have a really exciting time."" Schumacher admits it's been a sluggish return to the track, but remains positive, saying: ""It's certainly not as successful as I thought initially and many other people have thought."" ""But then having such a strong group and team behind, Mercedes pushing it so hard, I have no doubt about success in the future.""","Michael Schumacher return to F1 racing this year after three years in retirement .

"Kingston, Ontario (CNN) -- Three members of an Afghan immigrant family, who were found guilty of murder in what the judge called ""a completely twisted concept of honor,"" intend to appeal their convictions. A Canadian jury on Sunday convicted Mohammed Shafia, 58; his wife, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 42; and their son, Hamed, 21, of first-degree murder in the deaths of Shafia's three teenage daughters and his first wife in his polygamous marriage. Sunday's verdicts followed a three-month trial, in which jurors heard wiretaps of Shafia referring to his daughters as ""whores"" and ranting about their behavior. All three were sentenced to life in prison immediately after their convictions, with no chance of parole for 25 years. A lawyer for the son, Hamed, told the Canadian Press news agency his client and the client's parents will file an appeal, but he did not say when. In announcing the verdict, Judge Robert Maranger told the court it was ""difficult to conceive of a more despicable, more heinous crime."" ""The apparent reason behind these cold-blooded shameful murders was that the four completely innocent victims offended your twisted notion of honor, a notion of honor that is founded upon the domination and control of women, a sick notion of honor that has absolutely no place in any civilized society."" Outside the courtroom, Gerard Laarhuis, the chief prosecutor in the case, called it a ""good day for Canadian justice."" At least one Shafia family supporter interrupted Laarhuis with shouts of ""lies"" and called the verdict a ""miscarriage of justice."" But others cheered the verdict as Laarhuis continued. The three Shafia sisters -- Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13 -- were found dead inside a car that plunged into the Rideau Canal in Kingston on June 30, 2009. Shafia's first wife, 52-year-old Rona Amir Mohammad, also died. The verdicts came on the second day of deliberations for a seven-woman, five-man jury in Kingston, about 280 km (175 miles) west of the family's home in Montreal. Prosecutors said the girls' father, mother and brother all plotted to kill the four women in an ""honor"" murder. Investigators claimed that hours of wiretapped conversations revealed a premeditated plan to punish rebellious, Westernized daughters and their permissive advocate, Rona. Shafia and Yahya admitted on the stand that they were upset with Zainab for running off to marry a Pakistani man they hated, that Sahar wore revealing clothes and had secret boyfriends, and Geeti was failing in school and calling social workers to get her out of a home in turmoil. Prosecutors argued that under instructions from his father, Hamed Shafia used the family Lexus to ram the other family car carrying the women into the canal. The shattered headlight on the Lexus, prosecutors said, matches the damage on the rear bumper of the family Nissan in which the women were found dead. Investigators also believed the victims might have died before they hit the water, because they were unable to escape despite their seat belts being unbuckled and the car being submerged in just 7 feet of water. In the three-month-long trial, Shafia testified, ""My children did a lot of cruelty toward me,"" as he wept openly on the stand. He went on to say he believed his children ""betrayed"" him by dating and he did not hide his anger, saying a father would never expect that kind of behavior from this daughters. In taking the stand, Shafia swore to tell the truth on the Quran, and he again invoked the holy book to say Islam does not condone killing people to preserve a family's honor. In a direct response to a question from prosecutor Laurie Lacelle, Shafia said, ""To kill someone, you can't regain your respect and honor. Respected lady, you should know that. In our religion, a person who kills his wife or daughter, there is nothing more dishonorable. How is it possible that someone would do that to their children, respected lady?"" ""You might do it,"" Lacelle calmly replied, ""if you thought they were whores."" Shafia had used that term in a conversation captured by wiretaps. Investigators played hours of the wiretap recordings in court, alleging many conversations involving the three suspects prove they were plotting murder. In some of the most shocking conversations, Shafia launched into a rant about his daughters' behavior. ""I say to myself, 'You did well. Would they come back to life a hundred times, you should so the same again,'"" he says. And in another tape played in court and translated from the Afghan language Dari, he says, ""May the devil defecate on their graves! This is what a daughter should be? Would a daughter be such a whore?"" Shafia and his lawyers tried to explain that his shocking words are traditional expressions in Dari that should not be translated literally. But the jury also heard from an expert witness on honor murders -- a term CNN is using in the interest of clarity rather than the more common ""honor killings"" because the latter phrase does not properly describe the alleged crime. That witness, University of Toronto professor Shahrzad Mojab, said that in some families, honor is worth more than life. In an interview with CNN, Mojab said that many times, honor crimes are calculated acts that involve more than one family member. ""There is a very important difference between honor killing and violence against women in the form of domestic violence. It is plotted, it is premeditated."" Mojab said. ""What we need to understand is that the male power and the male desire for the control of the woman's body and the woman's sexuality -- the honor resides in that sort of understanding and the ownership of women's body and sexuality,"" she said. ""So when that is being presented in a way that is not acceptable to the social norm, then the only way the honor can be restored is by purifying that. And the purification is through blood."" Sometimes, such murders occur with the ""buy-in"" of women in the family, said Irshad Manji, director of the Moral Courage Project at New York University, who also authored the book ""Allah, Liberty and Love."" ""This is part and parcel of a cultural tradition called honor, which is a tribal tradition that emphasizes the family or the tribe of the community over the individual,"" she said Monday. It is not an Islamic phenomenon, she said, but ""it is, however, a problem within Islam because of how Muslims often confuse culture and religion. You can't blame non-Muslims for scratching their heads and wondering what the hell is going on.""","The defendants are sentenced to life in prison .

"(CNN) -- ""Whale Wars"" TV conservationist Paul Watson quit his conservation society Tuesday because of a recent federal court injunction against him and his group's anti-whaling activities. Last month, the Japanese research foundation Institute of Cetacean Research and the Japanese firm Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd. secured a U.S. District Court injunction against Watson and his Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, according to the institute's website. The injunction prohibits Watson and his group from coming within 500 yards of the plaintiffs on the open sea, according to a copy of the court document on the institute's website. Watson has become renowned for his attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers on the open water through Animal Planet's ""Whale Wars"" TV show. Interpol issues wanted notice for Watson . ""As a United States citizen, I will respect and comply with the ruling of the United States 9th District Court and will not violate the temporary injunction granted to the Institute for Cetacean Research,"" Watson said in a statement Tuesday. ""I will participate as an observer within the boundaries established by the 9th Circuit Court of the United States."" Watson resigned as president and executive director of the conservation society in the United States and as president of the society in Australia. ""For the 35 years since I founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, I have strived to act non-violently and within the boundaries of the law,"" Watson said. ""During Sea Shepherd's long history, we have never caused a single injury to any person,"" he said. ""Although we have broken some bureaucratic regulations like Canada's so-called Seal Protection Act, we did so to challenge the validity of these regulations, which were in contradiction to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

"(CNN) -- For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy. Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let's do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements ... like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose. The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn't care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn't care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there. It wrote, ""Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can't identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?"" Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget. Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan's and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for $1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost $1 trillion of it from new revenues. Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead. Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid. These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched. But, frankly, these aren't even the most critical issues we should be addressing. The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with. The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn't overspend. But if we don't figure out what business we're in -- what new industries will create tomorrow's jobs, what kind of new workers we'll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment -- our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns. Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow ... and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues. The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn't plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn't discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must. Perhaps the Senate budget or the president's will be wiser about investing -- although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times. Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Many are oblivious to D.C.'s budget debate; that's just as well .

"NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- U.S. President Barack Obama set his green plan into action Monday, potentially reversing several Bush-era decisions on global warming and fuel efficiency. U.S. President Barack Obama signs orders Monday on vehicle emissions and fuel efficiency standards. In his first major environmental acts as president, Obama directed his Environmental Protection Agency to review a California application to regulate greenhouse gases and told his Department of Transportation to begin implementing fuel efficiency standards passed last year but not implemented by the Bush administration. He also pushed for passage of the $825 billion economic stimulus package in the House and Senate. Those bills include money for investments in renewable energy, conservation and a better electric grid. ""No single issue is as fundamental to our future as energy,"" Obama said at a White House news conference. ""It is time for this moment of peril to be turned into one of progress."" California emissions: Under the Clean Air act, California has long sought to tighten its air quality standards. To achieve those standards, California would likely require cars to emit fewer greenhouse gases. Currently the federal government does not regulate carbon dioxide emissions - the main culprit in greenhouse gases. The Bush administration recently denied California's request saying that new federal fuel standards made stricter rules there unnecessary. Obama said his administration will review that decision. Any change in policy would likely take months to implement. ""Let me be clear: Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry; it is to help America's automakers prepare for the future,"" said the president. The environmental community applauded the move. New emission standards could result in vehicles that get better gas mileage. ""With these actions our new president is not just stepping up to the threat of climate chaos,"" Dave Hawkins, head of the climate center at the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote on his blog. ""The cleaner cars he will help put on the road will show us the way to reduce our dangerous dependence on oil and will push automakers to make the cars that the world will want and need in the 21st century."" The auto industry, which has opposed California's effort to raise its air quality standards, said in the past it will result in an expensive patchwork of emissions standards and force them to build different cars for different markets. Seventeen other states may adopt California's rules if the Obama administration allows it, representing over half the vehicle market. On Monday General Motors said it is trying to make more efficient vehicles, but said any standard must be ""workable."" ""GM is working aggressively on the products and the advance technologies that match the nation's and consumer's priorities to save energy and reduce emissions,"" the company said in a statement to CNN. ""We're ready to engage the Obama administration and the Congress on policies that support meaningful and workable solutions and targets that benefit consumers from coast to coast."" Chrysler had no comment, and Ford could not be reached. It's possible automakers would simply make their entire fleet conform to the stricter standard - thus upping fuel efficiency standards for the whole nation. It's also possible the auto industry would make different cars for different markets, perhaps not selling certain bigger cars in states that adopted the new standard. Either way, most analysts said it would raise prices for everyone. ""Anytime you have to comply with two different sets of standards, it's more expensive,"" said Eric Fedewa of CSM Worldwide, an automotive research company. Fedewa also said having two different standards could be a challenge for the auto industry at this time - they are currently losing money and have recently received billion in taxpayer support. Federal fuel efficiency rules could be more easily relaxed if the industry had a hard time complying, he said. ""It's in our nation's best interest to be under a common strategy,"" he said. Fuel efficiency standards: Regardless of what California does, Obama also moved to implement higher fuel efficiency standards passed in 2007. Those increases - the first in more than 30 years - called for raising the average fuel economy from 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 22 miles a gallon for trucks to 35 miles a gallon for the whole fleet by 2020. Obama said the increased standards would save 2 million barrels of oil a day. That's about 10% of the country's total oil consumption, and roughly the same amount the country currently imports from the Persian Gulf. ""This rule will be a downpayment on a broader and sustained effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" said the president. The new standards, originally supported by Bush, were put on hold during his last days in office, in response to the woes facing the auto industry. The industry has long opposed raising fuel economy standards. It has argued that the new rules are expensive and unnecessary since it already makes fuel efficient cars. Stimulus: Obama also called on Congress to pass the $825 billion stimulus plan currently under debate in both houses. Tens of billions of dollars are allocated for energy programs under both plans. The House version contains $20 billion in tax incentives for the industry that are intended to get money flowing back into a sector particularly hard hit by the financial crisis and help Obama meet his stated goal of doubling renewable energy production in the United States in three years. It also contains $10 billion to modernize the countries aging electric grid, including money for a so-called smart grid. The smart grid basically involves digitizing and connecting the country's aging utility grid. Experts say it will result in greater efficiency because appliances will be able to turn on and off when electricity is cheapest, consumers will have more information about how much electricity they are using, and when and where they are using it. The smart grid is also essential if various forms of renewable energy like wind and solar are to be used. The House version of stimulus also calls for billion in conservation money for federal buildings, public housing, and homeowner incentives. ""America will not be held hostage to dwindling resources, hostile regimes and a warming planet,"" said Obama. ""This is the boost that our economy needs and the new beginning that our future demands.""","Obama orders review of California request to regulate greenhouse gases .

"(CNN) -- They call it ""The List."" On it: the names, ages and addresses of 21 people accused by police of buying sex from a 29-year-old fitness instructor. And it's the talk of Kennebunk, the historic, picture-perfect Maine town that had been -- until recently, at least -- best known for its bygone shipbuilding industry and a money-making tourist trade. Police say the instructor, Alexis Wright, used her Zumba fitness studio and the office of her business partner, Mark Strong, to run a prostitution ring. They say she videotaped intimate encounters with some of the dozens of customers she allegedly entertained. On Monday, police released a partial list of those accused of hiring Wright after a judge rejected a request to shield their names from public view. The attorney for two men named on the list argued that identifying them would destroy their lives, families and careers. Police are releasing the names and addresses in batches, and more names are expected soon. Strong's lawyer, Dan Lilley, says the list of Wright's alleged johns runs 150 names long. Among them, according to Lilley: lawyers, accountants and a local TV personality. While much of the world is getting its first salacious tastes of the whole affair, Kennebunk residents have been dealing with it since at least July, when police arrested Strong and made the case public for the first time. The tawdry details have riveted residents of the small community of 10,000, a tree-shaded, picket-fenced tourist destination of stately sea captain's homes and 200-year-old inns just a short drive from the Bush family oceanside compound in nearby Kennebunkport. Everyone wants to know who's on that list. ""You can't go anywhere without people bringing it up,"" said Kristen Schulze Muszynski, managing editor of the 6,000-circulation Journal-Tribune. And it's starting to wear on at least some of residents. ""I'm tired of it, honestly,"" resident Tina Palanka told CNN affiliate WGME. ""I'm really tired of it. There's got to be more to Kennebunk than this. This is not a good legacy."" It's certainly not typical for a place where the most recent crime roundup issued by police leads off with charges against a 51-year-old man for letting his dog roam free. ""Boy, it really hit us hard,"" resident Paul Bergeron told WGME. The sex allegedly occurred at a store-front Zumba exercise studio, run by Wright. Zumba is, according to the brand's official website, ""an exhilarating, effective, easy-to-follow, Latin-inspired, calorie-burning dance fitness-party that's moving millions of people toward joy and health."" According to Kennebunk police, someone tipped off authorities more than a year ago that something more than Latin-inspired dance was going on at the studio, located on a leafy stretch of York Street, next door to one pizza parlor and across the street from another. Maine's State Police and the state's Drug Enforcement Administration soon started looking into the case. And in February, five months after the investigation began, police raided Wright's fitness studio and Strong's office. What police found hasn't been officially released -- the search warrant records have been sealed. But the Press Herald newspaper of Portland reported that the findings included videotapes of Wright having sex with numerous men, a ledger containing prices for various sex acts and detailed customer records. A grand jury indicted Wright on 106 counts related to the alleged prostitution business, including invasion of privacy charges for allegedly filming some of her sessions, according to court documents. The grand jury indicted Strong, who is also a private investigator, on 59 counts. Both have pleaded not guilty. Neither Wright -- whose studio is now closed, according to its website -- nor her attorney, Sarah Churchill, returned calls from CNN. The York County district attorney's office declined to comment Tuesday. Police are also issuing summonses for the men on Wright's list, accusing them of engaging in prostitution, a misdemeanor charge. Two men on the list argued the names shouldn't be made public because doing so would cause ""irreparable harm"" to their reputations, their families and their businesses, according to court documents. They deserved to be shielded under state victims' rights laws and the state constitution, their attorney argued. On Monday, Superior Court Justice Thomas D. Warren disagreed, ruling that the names of people accused of crimes have to be available to the public. ""The principle that court proceedings are public is essential to public confidence. If persons charged with crimes could withhold their identities, the public would not be able to monitor proceedings to observe whether justice has been done and to observe whether certain defendants may have received favored treatment,"" Warren wrote in his decision. Warren ruled that some of them men, those who had been filmed during sex acts, could also be victims of a crime -- invasion of privacy -- and deserved to have their addresses shielded from the public, but Tuesday he revised his decision after a ""conference call with counsel for the interested parties in the civil action,"" according to a Kennebunk police news release. One man told CNN affiliate WCSH TV that his name appears on the original list. But he said it's not him. ""When I first saw my name on the computer I laughed,"" said the man, who CNN has chosen not to name. ""And then as I got up I'm thinking, 'All my years in law enforcement, all my years, activities with children, coaching baseball, the young men that I know who are now dads today and responsible citizens, this is very misleading and I don't think it's fair.' And then I became upset, to say the least I was very upset."" The release also has upset some of Muszynski's readers. The Journal-Tribune editor says she's getting letters wondering why the names of the men are coming out before trial. She said she isn't getting any letters from readers upset that Wright's name has been plastered in media accounts of the case, bringing up what some say is a long-held double standard in prostitution cases -- the accused prostitute gets all the attention, while her customers slip away out of public view. As it happens, that tide appears to be turning, said Michael Shively, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, criminal justice researcher with Abt Associates who has been tracking anti-prostitution programs since 2005. Nationwide, Shively said, 525 cities and counties have at least once tried some form of what's known as ""shaming"" -- publicizing the names of men who buy sex or focusing on them instead of the sellers. No one has formally studied the effectiveness of such efforts, he said. ""But evidence that is available points in the direction of it being a pretty effective thing to do,"" he said. ""But it's not definitive."" Read Shively's national prostitution study for the U.S. Justice Department (PDF) And while Kennebunk doesn't appear to be intentionally shaming Wright's alleged customers -- the city releases a weekly list of people accused of crimes -- all the attention is putting a spotlight on the men, nevertheless. ""Had the city hired a public relations firm, they couldn't have written a better script for generating as much attention as possible,"" Shively said, referring to the incremental release of the names of those charged as prostitution customers. CNN's Adam Reiss and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","Police add ages and addresses to list of 21 alleged johns .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- When I think of the story of African women, I immediately think of my mother and I want to use her story as a frame of reference in how African leaders can improve the lives of women. My mother is a huge inspiration to me but sadly, many African women do not have the opportunities that she has. They are the backbone of our nations and their success will lead to the success of Africa. Using this platform afforded to me, I would like to tell our leaders the five things African women need to succeed. I was born to a woman who having completed high school in the early 1970s, got married, had me and went about the business of being a mother and wife. I must have been about seven or eight years old when my mother got her first job as a secretary. Today my mother is Group Human Resources Manager (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania) for Car & General. She's pursuing a degree in clinical psychology. I think I should mention that my mother went back to school at 50. She turned 60 in February 2012. 1. Education . It can never be said enough. Nowhere is it as clear as it is in Africa that educating a woman is educating a nation. My mother is who she is today and my siblings and I have turned out to be who we are because she went out at the age of 50, sat in the same room as people half her age, so she could learn. She already had a job she was great at but she had a thirst for knowledge. And today, my mum is a better mother, grandmother and friend all because of the education she had and the knowledge she pursues to this very day. Caroline Mukoto: Kenya's Queen of radio . 2. Economic empowerment . The African woman needs to be able to fend not just for herself but also for her children. This is something my mother always drummed into me and I am largely my mother's daughter; driven, focused but also determined to be financially independent. In my early 20s, I couldn't figure out why she went on and on about getting a job, being good at it and earning my own money -- but today in my 30s I get it. What drives me crazy about the policy around this is that money is never allocated in a way that benefits women and home first. Instead, it feeds a handout mentality, we never give women a hand up. It's a really horrible cycle. This is why I'm very proud of what my mother did. If you can give a woman a hand up and she can stand, she'll help another woman too. Anytime I go to an area where there's poverty, we never give just money, we give seeds so they can plant or animals they can rear. I'm involved in a greenhouse project for the areas where the land is dry. The people always have to pay us back in produce and even when they are done paying, they are so excited because they have money in their pockets, you would think they were Bill Gates. That is what happens when you empower a woman. See also: Mother's day not so rosy in Africa . 3. Access to health care . My mother had a job that gave her medical cover and hence access to doctors and healthcare facilities for herself and us. For as long as I can remember my mother took charge of our health. My brother [John] was born with a blockage in one of his lungs and had the worst case of asthma I knew of, but mum's health cover took care of that and John's subsequent health needs, as he battled with asthma throughout his teens. She was a better mum not because she understood medicine, but because she had access to health facilities and doctors. Too many women are forced to watch their children die, even from the simplest, most treatable illnesses, simply because of poor access to healthcare. Read also: 'Why women must be free to choose' 4. Exposure . In a world where women have such few role models -- looking at my mum whose mother tilled the land -- she had no way of doing better for herself or charting a bigger and better path for me and my siblings, if it wasn't for the exposure to a wider world that she got through the working. You cannot become what you cannot see. Today, mum pursues her dream in clinical psychology and supports a daughter who chose to adopt because my mum is more exposed to different circumstances than most. Don't just tell women what is possible, show them. 5. Hope . When all else is gone, nothing remains but hope. If my mother had written this piece, she would say pray and work. To an international audience , I call it hope with a purpose. As long as we give the women of Africa hope, so long as we don't tread on their dreams and those they have for their children -- these women will rise and with them their children and right alongside them this continent. Today, the daughter of Rose Mutoko stares at the world through the lenses of CNN. Who would have thunk it?

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've rescued 94 migrants who were crammed into the back of a hauling truck in ""subhuman conditions."" They came from as far away as Nepal and as nearby as Guatemala, paying thousands of dollars to get to the United States, authorities said. Seven of them were minors. They showed symptoms of asphyxiation and serious lesions on their hands and feet when they were rescued, Mexico's National Migration Institute said. X-ray equipment detected the migrants at a checkpoint in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas early Tuesday morning. The driver of the truck has been turned over to prosecutors on suspicion of human trafficking, and the migrants are receiving medical, psychological and legal assistance, Chiapas state prosecutors said in a statement. Photos released by local police show migrants sitting on the ground as an official toting a stethoscope tends to them. It was not immediately clear where the migrants would go. The group included 45 Guatemalans, 23 Salvadorans, 10 Nepalese and 9 Bangladeshis and 7 Hondurans, authorities said. ""The migrants had paid different amounts for the transport, according to their nationality,"" the migration institute said. ""In the case of the Central Americas, the tariff was between $4,000 and $5,000, and the Asians from $6,000 to $8,000."" Last week, Mexican authorities rescued 81 migrants they said were held captive in the border city of Reynosa. And in June, authorities said they rescued 165 migrants who were kidnapped as they tried to cross into the United States. Experts say many migrants passing through Mexico on their way to the United States are victims of violence along the Mexico-U.S. border, but the journey is perilous from the moment it begins. And the danger has grown as Mexico's drug gangs expand their reach. In Mexico, Central American immigrants under fire .

"(CNN) -- Passengers have been rescued from a gondola dangling over a freezing creek after the tower snapped in half Tuesday at a ski resort near Whistler, British Columbia. Rescuers try to reach the passengers trapped inside one of the suspended gondolas Tuesday. Doug Forseth, senior vice president of the resort, said a total of 53 passengers had been rescued. He said no more people are trapped. The section of the lift affected by the accident had 15 cars going up the mountain and 15 coming down at the time, but they were sparsely populated, Forseth said. Three people were freed on the up side, each in a different gondola car, along with 50 people divided among the 15 cars on the down side, he said. The accident occurred at a tower that was constructed in two pieces, and the top part came away from the lower part, Forseth said. He said resort officials did not know what caused the structural failure, but an investigation would be conducted Wednesday. Tyler Noble, a reporter for CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver, was on the scene at the Whistler Blackcomb resort about 110 miles north of Vancouver. He reported that at least two gondola cars hit the ground after the accident, both from relatively low heights near the tower that split and caused the system's heavy cable line to slacken. ""One hit a bus stop and the other hit a house,"" Noble said. ""Another one was suspended over a creek, but everyone is out of that car."" But Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Steve Wright stressed that no gondolas had fallen.  Watch gondola dangle in the air » . ""At no time was anyone in serous risk and at no time were the cars separated from the line,"" Wright said. Canadian Television News footage showed rescuers walking down a fire truck ladder escorting passengers from one gondola over the frozen water. At least six people were trapped inside that cabin, which was the closest to the base of the mountain, CTV News reported. Cynthia Jennings told CTV News she was in a car halfway down the mountain when the tower snapped. ""All we saw were other cars swinging sideways and we thought we were going to crash to the ground,"" she told CTV News by cell phone. ""I thought the whole cable system was going to come down. I couldn't even breathe."" Authorities said they did not know the cause of the accident. ""It just started really suddenly, we saw people running everywhere,"" Jean-Philippe Plante said.

No serious injuries were reported, but a spokeswoman for the Whistler Blackcomb resort said five people required medical attention. Three were taken to a nearby clinic and two were taken to a hospital as a precaution, said spokeswoman Tabetha Boot. Skiers were evacuated from the area and the resort -- site of the alpine skiing venue for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games -- was closed while authorities worked to remove riders from the cars and investigate the accident.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian border officer was shot in her booth Tuesday afternoon by a motorist, who then apparently killed himself, Canadian police said. The shooting occurred at a border crossing across from Blaine, Washington, where the motorist was traveling from, authorities said. The border officer was breathing before being airlifted to a hospital, but further details about her condition were not immediately available, said Surrey Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cpl. Bert Paquet. The man who shot her was pronounced dead at the scene, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Paquet said. He was driving a car with Washington state plates into Canada, he said. Authorities had yet to confirm the man's identity late Tuesday afternoon, Paquet said. Canadian authorities closed the border crossing immediately after the shooting. The closed British Columbia port is known as the Douglas or Peace Arch crossing, and Canadian authorities are asking motorists to use another area crossing, said Faith St. John with the Canada Border Services Agency. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were investigating. Dave Noble told CNN affiliate CTV that he saw a chaotic scene when he arrived at the crossing Tuesday. About a dozen border guards with guns drawn encircled a white van. ""They had it surrounded. ... You knew something had gone down,"" he said. ""It's very shocking. I feel terrible for the border guard. I come here quite a bit, and don't know any of them personally ... but there are some really nice people that work here."" Authorities told Lisa Kennedy that she and her family would be waiting for a while. She saw all the ambulances and police cars pull up to the scene, where the van's doors were opened. ""They said, 'Hold on, you guys are going to be here for a long time. We've had an injury, a fairly serious one,"" Kennedy told CTV. Jagdar Randhawa said he heard the gunfire. ""All of sudden, I hear two shots,"" he said Tuesday afternoon. ""Then we wait for a while. We're still waiting for a long time."" Canadian Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews said he was ""deeply concerned by the news of the shooting today at the Peace Arch border crossing of a CBSA officer."" ""This event is a sobering reminder of the dangerous conditions faced daily by the men and women of our law enforcement agencies as they work to protect the safety and security of Canadians,"" Toews said.

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Warren, the White House consumer-protection adviser now running for a U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts, ripped into the tax plan put out by Mitt Romney, the state's former governor, at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday night. ""He wants to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires,"" said Warren, a former Harvard law professor who served as the Senate watchdog over the 2008 bank bailout. ""But for middle-class families who are hanging on by their fingernails? His plans will hammer them with a new tax hike of up to $2,000."" That's a lot of money to average folks, so let's take a closer look. The facts: . Warren's figure is drawn from the verdict of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute that reviewed the Republican presidential nominee's proposals. An August 1 analysis by the nonpartisan group cautions that it's not a precise scoring, since Romney hasn't provided enough specifics. But it found that under what Romney has said he wants to do ""would provide large tax cuts to high-income households, and increase the tax burdens on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayers."" ""This is true even when we bias our assumptions about which and whose tax expenditures are reduced to make the resulting tax system as progressive as possible,"" the center noted. Romney wants to cut today's income-tax rates, which date back to the Bush administration's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, by 20% and eliminate the alternative minimum tax on high earners. Romney says he will make up the lost revenue in part by limiting deductions, exemptions and credits currently available to top-level income earners, though won't say which tax breaks he plans to eliminate. CNN Fact Check: About those 4.5 million jobs ... If a Romney administration got rid of tax breaks like deductions for mortgage interest, health insurance and charitable contributions for top earners and cut them only by 42% for households that earn less than $200,000, the lower-income families with children ""would pay, on average, $2,000 more in taxes,"" the group concluded. Households without children would see a $75 cut under that scenario, the group stated. The study was written by Samuel Brown, a former Federal Reserve analyst; Adam Looney, who served on the Obama administration's Council of Economic Advisers; and William Gale, who served on the same advisory board during George H.W. Bush's presidency. President Barack Obama's campaign seized on the $2,000 figure, using it in campaign ads targeting voters in swing states like Ohio, Florida and New Hampshire. The Romney campaign disputed the findings of the study when it was released, arguing that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for Romney's promise to keep the share of taxes paid by top earners the same and that a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of Romney's plan -- would lead to more revenue. ""There's an old expression in the computer world: garbage in, garbage out,"" Romney told Fortune magazine in an August 15 interview. ""They made garbage assumptions and they reached a garbage conclusion."" The study's authors said it worked under the assumption that any reductions in revenue due to the corporate rate cut would be made up elsewhere. Conclusion: . The $2000 ""tax hike"" figure that Warren cites is grounded in a third-party analysis that Romney has criticized, but one the authors stand by. The authors also note that their calculations are not precise because they lack some specifics of Romney's plan. CNN's Matt Smith and Lindsey Knight contributed to this report.","Democrats say Romney tax plan will cost middle-class families $2,000 .

"Paris (CNN) -- France's military intervention in Mali has surprised many who believed French foreign policy was committed to disengagement from international conflicts. The country's refusal to commit forces to the war on Iraq in 2003 was interpreted in the United States -- not only in government but in the American media and public opinion -- as the consequence of a pacifist doctrine and even as a scandalous betrayal of its allies. More recently the withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan could have reinforced the impression that France was pulling out of international military commitments. The notion that France is withdrawing from international military engagements fails to grasp the realities of French foreign policy. France remains amongst the Western countries most likely to make a direct military intervention in a foreign country. It is not only consistent with French foreign policy doctrine -- France is also one of the few major global powers with the capacity to do so. It nonetheless legitimates questions about the consistency of French foreign policy. The socialist government just sent troops into Mali to combat Islamic extremists only days after President Francois Hollande refused to intervene in Central Africa after its government was asked for military assistance. President Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy ordered a military intervention in Libya against Colonel Gaddafi after refusing to engage his troops in the Ivory Coast during the initial phase of the crisis in that west African country. Panetta: U.S. could provide logistical, intel support in Mali . So where is the logic in French foreign policy? To answer this question, it is necessary to grasp that French foreign policy attempts to balance two sometimes conflicting goals -- objective and subjective. The first corresponds to French commitment to work with international institutions to maintain a global order that is multi-polar and regulated by law. The second refers to France's goal of protecting and enhancing its own national interests. Let's first take the ""objectivity"" paradigm. France has consistently emphasized the pre-eminent role of the United Nations in conflict resolution. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, French policy is based on the belief that international military interventions must seek the legitimacy of the United Nations. This does not mean smug French pacifism. On the contrary, membership on the security council imposes special obligations. France is willing to back a U.N. commitment to muscular military interventionism. France is actively involved in various U.N.-supervised military missions. France advocates that emerging countries be accepted as members of the U.N. Security Council if those countries show a commitment and capacity to take on the responsibility of U.N.-sanctioned military interventions. To cite one example, France has urged Brazil to take action in the Haitian crisis under the U.N. aegis. France considers itself an ""agent"" of the United Nations where necessary, but often works behind the scenes to influence U.N. decisions. This occurred with Libya, following Moammar Gadhafi's offensive on Benghazi. To do so, France imposed an expansive interpretation of the U.N. Resolution 1973 [that imposed a no-fly zone over Libya]. Its position highlighted a conception of international law and sovereignty opposed to that of China and Russia. The French position was even bolder than that of the United States and Great Britain. Indeed, one could argue that France was more aggressive than its allies about legally sanctioned military intervention in foreign countries. France's status as the philosophical cradle of human rights also impacts its foreign policy. Recent French military interventions have invoked the need to protect civilians against their own government and to prevent crimes against humanity. We witnessed this in the case of Libya, but also in the mid-1990s when France intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo. In both cases, French intellectuals were exercising pressure in favor of intervention on behalf of human rights. These pressures can have a substantial impact in a country like France where intellectual elites work through petitions or direct influence on the government citing the special status of France in the world. They are less effective, of course, when there are obstacles within the U.N. Security Council, as in the case in the Syrian crisis. What's behind instability in Mali? FranÃ§ois Hollande has reaffirmed France's commitment to have a special role in defense of human rights. At the same time, France's ""subjective"" interests cannot be overlooked -- especially when the French ""post-colonial paradox"" comes into play. Like Britain, France has stronger ties, and when necessary a greater military presence, in former colonies from Djibouti to Senegal. French colonial history explains why the government of Mali has called on France for military assistance to combat Islamic terrorism. At the same time, French governments are reluctant to intervene in these countries precisely because France wishes to avoid looking like a colonial master. It was easier for Nicolas Sarkozy to take a quick decision regarding Libya than on the Ivory Coast for this reason. Libya is not a former French colony. In like manner, FranÃ§ois Hollande's refusal to directly involve the French army against the rebels held in Central Africa is partly based on a desire to avoid the accusation of French colonial meddling in the internal affairs of a former colony. Furthermore, France has to take into account the importance of migrants related to its former colonies. The intervention in the former Yugoslavia was also a message for the Muslim community that French interventionism was not inspired by the crusade spirit. And one could say the same for the French positions in Libyan, Ivory Coast or Syrian crisis. This time, in Mali, it must be acknowledged that the French intervention was desired by most of the Malians who live in France. The French counter-offensive has been in the works for many months. France feared, above all, the prospect of direct intervention. That's why France was urging African countries to set up their own forces to support Mali. Direct French military action became urgent however when the Islamic insurgents threatened to invade the country's southern region. Pragmatism suddenly took priority over law. In conclusion, France intervenes in foreign countries according both to doctrine and to the pragmatic parameters of circumstance. French foreign policy is based on balancing these sometimes conflicting goals of objectivity and subjectivity. In international relations, the hard reality is that actions are often commanded by facts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jean-Michel Blanquer .","France's refusal to commit forces to Iraq in 2003 was interpreted as a pacifist doctrine .

"Weybridge, Vermont (CNN) -- Will I get over the end of Saturday deliveries by the U.S. Postal Service? I'm sure I will. But like countless others in this country, I will miss them. Living in rural Vermont, in a fairly isolated farmhouse overlooking the Green Mountains, I look forward to the mail, which brings news from relatives and friends, Christmas cards, bills, and -- most of all -- Saturday visits from Bob, who has been arriving at my house for years now, always with good cheer, local gossip and a sense that God's in his heaven and all's well with the world. I remember as a child looking forward to the arrival of Mr. Mail, as my sister and I called him, on Saturday mornings. He was a dour fellow, but we liked him. We had no school on Saturdays, so all the children got to know him on that day. He was missing a front tooth, so it was probably a good thing that he rarely smiled. When he did, it was an occasion. I loved him, mostly because he brought regular letters from my pen pal in Sweden -- letters with an array of strange, colorful stamps and peculiar tales from abroad. It was an adjustment when, years later, we had to get used to Miss Fe-Mail, a young woman with masses of blond hair and red lipstick. The mail has always kept me in touch with the world. As a young man I lived in Scotland for seven years, and loved getting two postal deliveries a day, bringing letters on blue aerograms from home. I would open those fragile blue letters very carefully, so as not to lose words. They were often scribbled in a tiny hand so the author could get as many words as possible within the aerogram's limited boundaries. Opinion: Goodbye, Postal Service? My Scottish postman's name was Angus, and he told me about his grandfather, who had brought three or four deliveries to every house each day. The mail was like e-mail in those days. If you lived in a city, such as London, you could really send a letter in the morning and expect it to make it across town by the afternoon. Nowadays it can take several days to get a letter from one side of Vermont to another. Sometimes I wonder if we're still using the Pony Express. As a boy, I read a book about the Pony Express, and had fantasies about joining it. The express started up in the mid-19th century, with relays of postal workers on horseback who would carry letters from Missouri over the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountains, to California -- and it only took about 10 days. It was the invention of the telegraph that brought this wondrous service to a halt, not unlike the advent of the Internet, which has made the postal service much less relevant to our lives. E-mails deliver most of our joys and sorrows today, and we conduct routine business in this ephemeral form. Handwritten letters have become precious artifacts. For future biographers, the loss of real letters presents a dilemma. My bookshelf holds volumes of the collected letters of my favorite writers, and I treasure those by John Keats, Lord Byron, Dickens and others. Will anyone ever publish someone's collected e-mails? How Amazon could save the U.S. Postal Service . So much of our thinking is about loss, and this is one of the losses we must bear. I doubt that we'll ever return to obsessive letter-writing, and don't expect to get many letters from abroad, with brilliantly colored stamps bearing the visage of unknown kings, queens and other eminent people I've never heard of. I wonder if I'll even know the person who brings letters to my house in the years to come. At least my part of Vermont has Internet access. In the immediate future, the absence of Saturday postal deliveries for rural areas that lack access might have genuine consequences, hurting business and dampening the spirits for people who already feel a bit out of touch. Everyone would like, I think, to see a robust postal service -- the Post Office represents the nation at home. I still make special trips into town, a drive of several miles, to do ""business"" at the P.O., where I meet friends to exchange gossip, buy special editions of stamps and, for nostalgic reasons, purchase aerograms to send to friends abroad. The bustling atmosphere is cheery, especially at Christmas, when people wait in line to get their odd-shaped boxes weighed and posted. Postal Service finances show smaller loss, but still in trouble . The postal service will always be part of our lives, and long may it live. I'm sorry about the loss of Saturdays, which may make me feel a little more isolated on weekends at my hilltop house. But who ever thought the government existed to make us happy? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini lives in small-town Vermont, and says he will miss Saturday mail deliveries .

"Ku Maloob Zaap, Mexico (CNN) -- Much of Mexico's remaining oil wealth lies thousands of meters below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. The question is: how to get at it. When state monopoly Pemex discovered its 'Supergiant' oil fields in the 1970s, they were found in barely 100 meters of water. At the time, they were the envy of the world and made Pemex one of the biggest oil producers. But since 2004, production has declined by nearly one million barrels a day as reservoirs dwindle. To compensate for the aging Supergiants, Pemex must now exploit resources at depths of up to 3,000 meters -- where they estimate there may be some 29 billion barrels of oil. There's a vast area of the Gulf of Mexico to explore and the size of the task is really brought into focus when you visit an exploration rig. After a 20-minute helicopter flight over an endless expanse of shimmering ocean, a lone platform can just be seen on the horizon. Pemex has only three exploration rigs available to explore hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and to probe the subsoil they must drill wells which take around 100 days to complete. Progress is painfully slow compared to the United States. ""The U.S. has a contract scheme which allows private investment, which allows concessions,"" says Carlos Ramirez of the Eurasia Group, a risk assessment organization. ""So there is a lot of activity coming from the big oil companies. In Mexico, that's not the case so Pemex has to do it by itself, with its own resources. And the resources Pemex has are limited."" This is the root of the Mexico's dilemma. When the government expropriated the country's reserves in 1938, the principle of national ownership of oil was enshrined in the constitution. Pemex is forbidden from entering into production sharing agreements (PSAs) with multinational companies, which would see a BP or ExxonMobil share the exploration risks in exchange for a stake in the oil discovered. Private investment in the company is also prohibited, so a partial IPO -- along the lines of Brazil's Petrobras -- is out of the question. Pemex has so far invested some $3.8 billion in its Deep Water exploration, which many analysts say is not enough. So now there is controversial talk of constitutional amendment which would allow additional capital and expertise to be brought into Mexico's oil industry. ""You have the incentive of the companies can bring all their capacities that an operator - an owner - would have,"" acknowledges Carlos Morales, the head of Production and Exploration at Pemex. ""You can have access to that technical knowhow."" For Mexicans, Pemex is more than just an oil company. It is the only supplier of subsidized gas to motorists around the country. And more importantly, it paid for many of the roads they drive on -- as well as schools, hospitals and much of the nation's infrastructure. Pemex's earnings account for 35% of the Federal budget. Deep water drilling is notoriously difficult. At depths of 3,000 meters, temperatures are so low that oil can freeze as it leaves the subsoil and equipment must be able to withstand strong currents. It raises memories of the Deepwater Horizon disaster along the U.S. Gulf coast, which Morales says has cast a shadow. ""It made us a lot more aware of the issues. We are in tough environments, no doubt. They have to make you think of the risks. You have to evaluate the worst case scenarios before going into the decision of drilling a well. You have to design your well perfectly."" This month's deadly gas explosion at a Pemex processing center underlines the ever-present risk of industrial accidents in the energy industry. So with the obvious need for more expertise and capital, what are the prospects of a landmark constitutional amendment? Mexico's President-Elect Enrique Pena Nieto campaigned on a pledge to reform the energy sector and aides say he will tackle this in early 2013. But he faces an uphill task. He lacks a majority in Congress to drive through his own legislation and the leftist PRD party in Mexico remains strongly opposed to sharing Mexico's oil wealth. There is also the fact that Pemex is no longer in critical condition. ""Things in Pemex don't seem to be as dire as they were 3 or 4 years ago,"" says Ramirez. ""This production stability and reserve replacement and oil prices where they are - there doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency in the political elites of Mexico to tackle such a complex and controversial reform."" For Pemex, the question is almost philosophical. ""In what timeframe do you want to monetize the reserves? Many countries have taken that decision in different fashions,"" Morales says. ""Norway decided to monetize in a short time period the reserves they had. And they did very successfully. They have the petroleum fund and many advantages. So whatever we do in the end should reflect on the standard of living of the Mexicans.""","Mexico is looking at deep water drilling as a way of extracting more of its oil reserves .
Some estimates say there may be up to 29 million barrels available .
Some now want constitutional amendment allowing private investment in oil .
But nationalized Pemex is popular with Mexicans, providing cheap gas and money for infrastructure ."
"(CNN) -- Want to experience nirvana? Just head to Monaco. Those seeking a transcendental state of spiritual well being, however, will be in for a disappointment, as this ""Nirvana"" is in fact a giant superyacht - boasting six decks, a cinema, a seven meter swimming pool and -- as if one wasn't already enough -- two reptile enclosures.

And there can be few places on earth with so much said pride on display as Monaco. Small state, big fish . Nestled between the French Alps and Mediterranean Sea, and covering just under two square kilometers, the miniature principality punches far above its weight when it comes to monetary muscle. According to the Wall Street Journal, the average cost for residential real-estate here is about $57,865 per square meter, out-pricing the likes of London and Saint Tropez, making it the most expensive place in the world to buy a home. It's little surprise then that it has become renowned as the playground of the rich and famous -- with wealthy pleasure-seekers taking advantage of its luxury marinas, stylish casinos, annual Formula 1 Grand Prix and, of course, its highly favorable 0% rate of income tax.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- At first, a Philadelphia landlord said, he thought one of his tenants was attempting to conceal a dog after finding a dog dish in the basement of his apartment building. But on a return trip to the basement Saturday, Turgut Gozleveli found something much more sinister: four mentally disabled people held captive, including one man chained to a radiator. ""It was terrible,"" he said Sunday, adding the people were surrounded by human waste. ""I don't know how long they were there."" Three people have been arrested and accused of holding the people captive and stealing their Social Security checks. Linda Ann Weston, 51; Thomas Gregory, 47; and Eddie Wright, 49, face charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass, unlawful restraint, and false imprisonment, Philadelphia police said in a statement Sunday. The alleged victims include a 29-year-old woman and three men, ages 31, 35 and 41, said Philadelphia police Lt. Ray Evers. All seven -- the three suspects and four alleged victims -- had been traveling together, he said, but did not know for how long. Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged victims. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said. Gozleveli, who also serves as the building's janitor, said he was contacted Thursday by the block captain of a neighborhood group regarding suspicious activity. He checked out the basement that day and found a few things out of place, but no people. On Friday, he found the dog dish. On Saturday, after hearing a dog barking, he went to the building's sub-basement and found a door chained shut. He found the people after removing the chains. ""Other than the barking dog there was no sound,"" he said. ""... I said, 'What the hell are you doing here?' No answer, and I called 911."" ""This was a total surprise,"" Gozleveli said. ""I never expected to find people. I just expected to find a dog."" The people, he said, ""acted like children."" The four were in a room roughly 10 feet by 15 feet, Gozleveli said, and looked malnourished and disheveled. They had a metal bucket and a jug of what appeared to be orange juice, but no food. They also had pillows and blankets, but didn't know where they were or where they had come from, he said. Authorities believe the four were trapped in the tiny room for up to a week. Evers said they suffered from bed sores and ""injuries that are very, very hard to describe."" The alleged victims appeared to be malnourished and were taken to a hospital. They were listed in stable condition Sunday, police said. The FBI is also investigating. The northeast Philadelphia building is a former movie theater converted to a seven-unit apartment building. Police cars were still outside the building Sunday afternoon. The four people found in the basement were brought out on stretchers, said Danyell Tisdale, the block captain who notified Gozleveli. She said she was concerned about some of the things she'd seen recently, including people being brought in from the back of an SUV with out-of-state plates. ""I hope I did enough,"" she said. ""I called."" CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Suspects face charges of aggravated assault and kidnapping, among others .

Anthony Senatore, 33, was charged with six counts of endangering the welfare of children and a disorderly person's offense for enabling access by minors to a loaded firearm, Prosecutor Jim McClain said. Senatore's 4-year-old son was playing in a yard on April 8 when he went inside and retrieved his father's loaded .22-caliber rifle from a bedroom. When he came back out, he fired a single shot that struck 6-year-old Brandon Holt in the head. Brandon was taken to the Jersey Shore University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead the next day. Six-year-old dies a day after being shot . In addition to the loaded rifle, four other firearms were found in Senatore's bedroom, all unsecured, close to ammunition and accessible to his three children, the prosecutor's office said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A misguided photo shoot of Air Force One over New York City in 2009 terrified residents, infuriated the president, and cost the director of the White House Military Office his job. Now, NASA is working to prevent a similar panic in Washington D.C. NASA officials this week announced plans for a new mission to monitor air pollution in the Baltimore-Washington traffic corridor that will include a series of low-altitude flights between the two cities. Trying to prevent a repeat of the chaos raised in New York, they are eager to get the word out to the public. Michael Finneran, spokesman for the DISCOVER-AQ project, says that NASA is publicizing the flights to generate awareness and to make sure people ""won't be surprised."" ""Public safety is paramount,"" he said. NASA plans to use a P-3B, a 117-foot, four-engine turboprop plane, for flights that will be as low as 1,000 feet. The lower of the two aircraft will fly in spirals over several ground measurement stations along the flight path, which includes Interstate 95 and crosses over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The other aircraft will fly at around 26,000 feet. The flights are scheduled to start no earlier than June 27 and go through July. Working with federal and state environmental agencies on this analysis, NASA says the flights are critical. All flights will be posted on the NASA website the night before takeoff. ""For some of these pollutant gases, the satellites are not as effective in detecting the quantities near the ground as they are at higher altitudes,"" Ken Pickering, a project scientist explained. Low-flying aircraft will help answer questions about existing data, and will provide ""a complete picture of air quality over the Baltimore-Washington region,"" Pickering said. Potential benefits from the research are not limited to Washington. Pickering said that these experiments ""will help NASA design a next generation of air-quality satellites"" leading to analyses for cities across the country, so that ""ultimately public health can be better protected."" Flights are scheduled in Houston next, in 2013, and could be followed by flights in Los Angeles, Birmingham, Alabama or Atlanta. So if you're in the Washington D.C. area over the next month, and happen to catch a glimpse of a startlingly low NASA aircraft -- don't hold your breath. In fact, NASA is hoping the new study will help everyone breathe easier.","NASA planes will sample Washington D.C.-Maryland air .

"(CNN) -- Unsolicited text messages from scammers, companies and political campaigns are illegal and annoying. But at least now they're easier to report. Recently all of the major North American wireless carriers have deployed a centralized spam-reporting service backed by GSMA, a global association of wireless carriers. This service collects information about spam complaints from all participating carriers into a common database, which may make it easier for carriers to identify spammers and take action against them. According to GSMA, one feature of the new spam-reporting service is that it generates a data feed of spam reports that carriers can integrate into their network security measures. It may be hard to tell whether this new system does any good. But it probably can't hurt. I just tested it. Here's how it works: . When you receive a spam text message on your phone, forward that text to the shortcode 7726 (which spells ""SPAM""). You'll then receive an automated message from your wireless carrier, asking you then to enter the phone number from which the spam text was sent. I first reported as spam a text message I received from the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. (To be clear, the Romney campaign did not spam me. I voluntarily signed up to receive its text updates. However, I had to test this spam reporting service with somebody's text message, and I doubt that one spam report would do Romney much harm.) The Romney campaign sends texts from a common shortcode (a short telephone number that's leased by the U.S. government for texting programs -- a use that is highly regulated). So when I responded to Verizon with the sender's phone number, I received a response that said: ""It is likely that your message came from a shortcode. Please return to the original message and reply STOP."" OK, this might sound like the new spam reporting service didn't really do anything -- but actually it probably did the right thing. In the United States, any texting campaign that uses a shortcode has to obey strict rules. One of those rules is that if you reply ""stop"" to any message that came from a shortcode, it has to stop sending you messages. Many mobile users don't know this, so this is a good reminder first to try to unsubscribe. And also, it verifies that my test didn't do Romney's campaign any harm. But many text-spam messages are sent from regular phone numbers, not shortcodes, precisely because shortcode use is so tightly monitored and regulated. Organizations that disobey U.S. shortcode rules can find their shortcode lease revoked, or their messages blocked by carriers. Next I tested the spam-reporting service by forwarding to it a spam text I had received from an ordinary phone number. It claimed to be offering a Walmart gift card, but that was most likely a ruse. After I got Verizon's acknowledgment of my spam report and sent it the full 10-digit phone number of the spam sender, the system responded: ""Thank you, we appreciate your assistance."" It also offered Verizon's instructions for blocking text messages from a specific number. This spam reporting service apparently doesn't tell you whether any action was taken against the spammer you reported. So it's a little unsatisfying in that regard. Also, this service is new, so it's unclear so far what kind of difference it might make in the fight against spam texts. However, forwarding spam texts to an easy-to-remember shortcode is a simple thing to do. So it might be a good idea to try using this service to report any spam texts that you receive. Let's hope it helps. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","North American wireless carriers have deployed a new spam-reporting service .

"(CNN) -- The second of two new research probes successfully entered the moon's orbit Sunday afternoon, a day after its companion, NASA announced. The unmanned Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory-B (GRAIL-B) fired its main engines at 5:05 p.m. and slipped into lunar orbit 39 minutes later, controllers at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported. Its companion GRAIL-A probe arrived on Saturday. ""Cheers in JPL mission control as everything is looking good for #GRAIL-B,"" the Pasadena, California, laboratory announced on its Twitter page. ""It's going to be a great 2012!"" NASA says the twin orbiters will study the moon ""in unprecedented detail"" from a near pole-to-pole orbit about 34 miles (55 km) high. For an expected 82 days, their instruments will chart the lunar gravitational field, giving scientists a peek into what goes on beneath the surface -- and possibly an insight into how the Earth and its neighbors formed. Both probes were launched aboard a single rocket from Florida's Cape Canaveral on September 10. The Apollo manned missions of the 1960s and 1970s took only three days to cross the 250,000-mile distance from Earth to the moon. But the GRAIL probes took more than three months and covered more than 2.5 million miles ""reshaping and merging their orbits"" so that they could be better positioned and coordinated to study the moon, NASA said. Maria Zuber, principal investigator for GRAIL, said the moon remains mysterious in many ways. Scientists theorize that the moon formed when a Mars-sized object crashed into Earth, but it remains unknown why the near side of the moon is so different from the far side. The basins are flooded with volcanic material on one side, and the other side has mountainous highlands. ""We think the answer is locked in the interior,"" Zuber said at a NASA news briefing Wednesday.","NASA's GRAIL-B space probe slipped into lunar orbit Sunday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- It was a homecoming rally to cheer on the Waverly Wolverines football team. They were undefeated this year. Everyone was proud. Then, in the midst of the cheers and a sea of red and white pom poms came a 30-second skit that, for some, turned an afternoon of school pride into one of shame. Three white male students involved in the skit made light of domestic violence, and they did it in racist manner, say some. Two were in blackface as they re-enacted a 2009 domestic abuse incident in which singer Chris Brown assaulted then-girlfriend Rihanna. The student who played Brown was vying for the school's ""Mr. Waverly"" title -- a school tradition in which skits are performed and the one that garners the most applause wins the title. On Monday, Waverly alum Matthew Dishler posted a photograph of the skit on CNN's iReport. He says someone shared the image on Facebook. The photo went viral. By Tuesday afternoon, the CNN iReport had more than 46,000 views and showed up on Huffington Post, Buzzfeed and Gawker and in local newspapers. Suddenly, Waverly High School became synonymous with racism and sexism. Twitter lit up with comments about the skit. Many were critical, but some defended the skit. ""I don't think it was offensive at all,"" said Chelsea House, who earned her high school diploma from Waverly last year and moved to Alabama but returned for homecoming last week and saw the skit. ""There's nothing wrong with blackface. There's nothing wrong with dressing up as a black person. Black is but a color,"" House said. Waverly Central School District Superintendent Joseph Yelich said Tuesday that he did not believe the students in the skit intended to offend anyone. Waverly resident Thomas Rumpff, a 2007 graduate of the high school, said he believed most of the kids were unaware of the historical context of blackface, a form of theatrical makeup used by white people in minstrel shows that perpetuated racist stereotypes of African-Americans. Rumpff said the Rihanna incident had also been satirized online and on television before. ""Was this a little bit inappropriate? Yes,"" he said. But said the incident ""has been completely blown out of proportion."" Other incidents of blackface have surfaced this year, including a Colorado Springs second-grader who offended a teacher when he painted his face black to resemble the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The Waverly High skit was approved by school officials before it was performed, Yelich said. He acknowledged the problem and said he was speaking with students, teachers and staff at the school in the coming days. ""My concern is to start making something teachable out of this particular circumstance,"" he said. The desire to win likely fuels outrageous behavior, said Fran Bialy, assistant director of A New Hope Center, an agency that aids victims of rape, domestic violence, assault and hate crimes. Other skits at the pep rally involved Tarzan and a dairy farmer milking his cows. Last year, a student played Tiger Woods, also in blackface.""I have heard about blackface, but ... they're portraying Hollywood events,"" alum Ryan Bronson said. ""It would be the same thing if he bought a mask."" Bottom line, Bronson said: People are being too sensitive. ""They go crazy about every little thing,"" he said. ""The school and everybody are going to basically stop letting kids be kids."" Dishler said he posted the image not to cast a harsh light on anyone but to prod the school to do better with issues of diversity. ""I don't believe the kids really knew what they were doing is as offensive as it is,"" Dishler said. ""The administration was watching this go on, and they let it happen."" Alum Vlad Chituc also blamed school officials. He said Waverly, a small town off Interstate 86 just west of Binghamton, New York, could easily be seen as a place that affirmed stereotypes of all sorts. Of Waverly's 4,444 people, 4,312 were white, according to 2010 census data. Chituc said he was ""extraordinarily offended"" by the skit and ashamed that his school seemed to be OK with it. ""On the one hand, I can't blame the kids for being ignorant,"" Chituc said. ""It's a small town, and the kids don't know any better. It's the responsibility of the administration to let the kids know this is not how you behave in 21st-century America. ... They've been failing at that spectacularly. ""The administration should be creating an environment where minorities are welcome, not the butts of racist jokes that make light of domestic violence."" Chituc contacted Waverly High School Principal Kim Forero by e-mail. He sent CNN Forero's response, which read in part: . ""Thank you for your concerns. We will continue to address issues of diversity and respect for all. The format of pep rally will need to be reconsidered. I appreciate your concern for your alma mater."" Yelich, for his part, said he could see how the skit could have been misconstrued and that he intends to set clearer expectations for behavior. ""I have some opportunities here to make positive change,"" he said. CNN was not able to obtain the names of the students involved in the skit. Whatever their intentions were, one thing was clear: Their portrayals of Chris Brown and Rihanna fell short -- the kid who played the dairy farmer was crowned Mr. Waverly. CNN's Katie Hawkins-Gaar contributed to this report.","Some students at a New York high school don't see anything offensive .

"(CNN) -- July 8 will mark the start of the final space shuttle mission and the end of an era, NASA announced Tuesday. The U.S. space agency announced the date for the final flight of Atlantis following a flight readiness review at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. If nothing delays the countdown, the shuttle would depart at 11:26 a.m. The 12-day mission will be the 135th and final flight of the space shuttle program. Atlantis is scheduled to deliver spare parts and supplies to the International Space Station to help keep the orbital lab going, NASA said. It also will fly an experimental rig to test tools and techniques to robotically refuel satellites in space, according to the agency.

"(CNN) -- In the lush rainforests of Africa's Congo Basin, hundreds of thousands of indigenous people live as hunter gatherers, depending on the forest's natural resources for their survival. Yet most have no legal rights to the land that has been their home for millennia. But GPS technology is helping indigenous people map the land they call home and produce documents that can help preserve their access to the forest that is their lifeblood. Rainforest Foundation UK (RFUK) is one group that organizes ""community mapping"" projects in central Africa's Congo Basin. Spread across six countries, and covering more than 1.3 million square miles -- an area twice the size of Alaska -- the Congo Basin includes an expanse of rainforest second only in size to the Amazon. It is also home to 40 million people, says Georges Thierry Handja, of RFUK. They include up to half a million hunter-gatherer people, often referred to as ""pygmies,"" whose lives are intimately linked to the rainforest. ""In almost all of the Congo Basin official laws say the land belongs to the state,"" says Handja. ""Our challenge is to support those people to be able challenge those laws."" Handja says that because forest people have no legal rights to the land where they live, their governments can simply give the land to logging and mining companies, who often prevent indigenous people from accessing the land. ""Hunter-gatherer communities suffer most from the situation because 80 to 90% of their livelihood comes from forest products to survive,"" says Handja. ""When nothing is done ... you see a situation where communities start dying and the number of people in the communities diminishes throughout the years."" See also: Race to save the leatherback turtle . RFUK's ""Mapping for Rights"" program trains forest people to map their land using GPS devices, marking the areas they use for activities such as hunting and fishing -- as well as their sacred sites -- and the routes they use to access these vital areas. The GPS information is used to create a definitive map of the land used by these semi-nomadic communities, which can be used to challenge decisions that see them excluded from areas of forest. ""The map is not an end, it's the beginning of the process,"" says Handja. ""Once the indigenous people have the map we must support them to have discussions, negotiations with the decision makers."" Handja explains that if, for example, an area of rainforest has been earmarked for a palm oil plantation, the aim is to arrange discussions between the palm oil company, the government and the communities that live there, to ensure the needs of the community are considered. The maps provide objective evidence that people rely on the land, and that continued access to it is essential for them. But is not just logging, mining and palm oil plantations that threaten the forest people; they can also find themselves excluded from land designated as a conservation area. See also: Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests . Handja says that when land in the Congo Basin is designated a national park or conservation area, indigenous people are often banned from hunting in, or even entering, the area. But some indigenous communities have been fighting back. Cameroon's Centre for Environment and Development (CED) has been running community mapping projects for 10 years. Like RFUK, it trains forest communities to map their land using GPS technology. In 2007 and 2008 CED partnered with the Forest Peoples Program to map rainforest used by the Baka hunter-gatherer people near the new Boumba Bek National Park in Cameroon. The maps revealed that the Baka people traditionally collected honey, mangoes and medicinal plants from land that was now designated part of the national park. The maps were presented to the WWF, which manages the park. As a result of the maps, and those produced by the WWF's own community mapping projects, the WWF granted the local Baka people greater access to the national park. Of course, maps themselves are no guarantee that indigenous people will be allowed access to forest, but they are a vital negotiating tool, according to CED's Diderot Nguepjouo. ""When you have a map it's easy to discuss with government -- you can even discuss with other actors, mining, logging companies,"" he says. ""When it's not based on GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data, it's difficult; those people say you can't prove that, it's not real, it's not the situation in the field. ""With GIS technology ... it's easy for other people outside the mapping process to verify if that the information is exactly placed on the map and on the land at the same place."" RFUK and CED claim that not only can community mapping protect forest people's rights, but it can protect the rainforest itself. They say indigenous communities have a vested interest in conserving the rainforest they have lived in for thousands of years. Following the Boumba Bek mapping project, the WWF concluded that, far from threatening the survival of the rainforest, the Baka people were ""excellent nature conservators."" ""When land is removed from communities and given to, say, a mining company, it is very few years before it is completely cut down,"" says Handja. ""The way communities manage the forest really allows it to be sustainable for many years."" He adds: ""Where you find protected areas you always find indigenous peoples -- if their way of living was harmful to the environment it would not be possible to have such biodiversity there and be able to create protected areas there. ""They have to be part of the management of such areas and allow them to keep on living the way they are living now -- when this is not the case it's very harmful to their lives.""","Indigenous communities in Congo Basin often have no legal rights to the land where they live .

"Washington (CNN) -- NASA launched a satellite Friday, starting a three-year mission to help better understand climate change. NASA sent the Aquarius/SAC-D Sea Surface Salinity satellite into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For the next three years, the Aquarius satellite will look back at Earth and generate monthly maps of sea salt movements, data that are crucial to the understanding of global climate change and ocean currents. The project will give scientists the information they need to better predict El Nino and La Nina tropical climate patterns in the Pacific. Until now, such research has been limited to ship and buoy instrumentation. The long-term project, which began in 2001, is the culmination of a joint effort between NASA and Argentina's National Space Activities Commission. Program executive Eric Ianson said the launch ""represents a great leap forward for the two agencies and (their) collaborations."" The Delta II rocket carried an Argentine-built satellite with American data-gathering instruments. The mission will also serve as an environmental data-gathering project for Brazil, France, Italy and Canada. It was delayed once this week because of a guidance computer problem. The $287 million satellite will provide insights into water circulation and changes around the globe by measuring the microwave energy emitted from the ocean during weekly scans. The mission begins to fulfill part of President Barack Obama's 2010 pledge to focus NASA more on ""science that will garner tangible benefits, helping us to protect our environment for future generations.""

"(CNN) -- Does the Web have room for one more social network? Microsoft thinks so. With Facebook hogging the spotlight last week and Google working to stay in the game with Google+, Microsoft has quietly launched So.cl, which it describes as a social-search tool to share information and meet people with common interests. What it's not, Microsoft says, is a rival to Facebook. ""So.cl is an experimental research project focused on the future of social experiences and learning, especially among younger people,"" Microsoft said Monday in an e-mail. The tool was launched late last year for students at a handful of colleges and universities. Last week, the company quietly made it available to anyone for a public beta test period. Among the features of So.cl (pronounced, of course, ""social"") is a ""bookmarklet"" feature similar to Facebook's ""Like"" button. That lets users share sites or pages they find interesting with other users. You can share, comment on or tag other people's posts. So.cl also has a ""video party"" feature that lets users chat with others and incorporate videos into those chats. The tool comes from Microsoft's FUSE Labs, which works with product research and development teams on new Web and social tools. The initial focus on students still shines through. With So.cl, users can build posts with many elements -- such as photos, video and text -- and share them. It also lets them find other users with similar interests and build communities around specific goals, educational or otherwise. The researchers behind So.cl deliberately sought to collaborate with a student audience that is more holistic -- encompassing representation from the sciences as well as the humanities -- rather than simply technical, says Lili Cheng, general manager of FUSE Labs. Just don't call it Microsoft's answer to Facebook. Google and smaller rivals have struggled to gain a foothold in a social-media landscape that Facebook dominates. On So.cl's FAQ page, Microsoft makes it clear that their new tool is designed as a layer on top of existing networks. ""We expect students to continue using products such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other existing social networks, as well as Bing, Google and other search tools,"" it says. ""We hope to encourage students to reimagine how our everyday communication and learning tools can be improved by researching, learning and sharing in their everyday lives.""","Microsoft's social search tool, So.cl, is now available to the public .

"(CNN) -- Tens of millions in the central and eastern United States are bearing the full brunt of summer, in all its sweltering and stormy fury. Temperatures Friday soared past 100 degrees Fahrenheit from Topeka, Kansas, to Washington, and the same scorching conditions are expected to continue through the weekend and beyond. Even as evening set in Friday, the headaches weren't over. A powerful line of severe thunderstorms moved across the Midwest -- ""fueled by record-high temperatures across the region,"" according to the National Weather Service -- bringing with them lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph. As they moved east from Indiana through Ohio and into West Virginia, the storms caused damage that contributed to power outages that affected more than 2 million homes by 11:30 p.m. ET Friday, according to utilities. ""The storms may reach as far as the Atlantic coast by late tonight or early Saturday morning,"" the weather service said. ""People planning outdoor activities this evening in the path of the squall line are urged to pay attention to local weather warnings and take shelter as storms approach."" It's part of a massive system that has left one in three Americans baking in scorching heat and has threatened lives and doled out misery for those not fortunate enough to find a splash of cool water or air conditioning. Heat warnings, watches or advisories Friday spanned 730,000 square miles of the central and eastern United States, an area roughly the size of Mexico, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.

The Jackson County medical examiner, in western Missouri, is investigating three deaths that may be related to the heat, according to information on the Kansas City Health Department's Twitter feed. One case involves a male, born in 1952, and a young boy born last year; the other suspected heat-related death is another man, born in 1943. The medical examiner in Harris County, Texas, is also looking into whether a 62-year-old Houston woman found Thursday died from heat-related causes, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. Some places have been sweltering for days, and there's little relief in sight for many with temperatures expected to remain roasting through next week, if not longer. ""Heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke are a real threat,"" the National Weather Service said in issuing an excessive heat warning through Sunday for eastern Missouri, including St. Louis, where temperatures should soar up to 106 this weekend. ""This is especially true because of the longevity of this heat wave, and the effects of extreme heat are cumulative."" In Springfield, about 215 miles southwest of St. Louis, high temperatures prompted city officials to open eight cooling centers and extend pool hours, steps similar to those taken by many other municipalities, including ones more than 1,000 miles away in the Washington area. 5 tips to survive extreme heat . In Memphis, Tennessee, where highs hit 105 degrees Friday, firefighters went door to door, checking on residents to make sure they're bearing the weather well.

Excessive heat warnings, issued by the National Weather Service when ""a prolonged period of dangerously hot temperatures will occur,"" were posted for 12 states, from Nebraska to New Jersey, with watches and advisories posted for at least six other states. Arizona was also under an excessive heat warning, with a predicted high Friday in the Phoenix area of 112 degrees. In locales not doused by thunderstorms, excessive heat is affecting air quality. Citizens of metro Atlanta experienced their first ""code red smog alert"" since 2010, according to the Clean Air Campaign, a partnership between employers and the state transportation department. Other metro areas on the East Coast were also feeling the heat and its repercussions. That includes New York, where there is an air quality alert and heat advisory out through the weekend because of heat indices that probably will hover just below or surpass 100.

This kind of heat is nowhere near normal for this time of year, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said, pointing to a statement from the National Weather Service that said all but one of the 52 record-high temperatures reached in 2012 have come in the past seven days. This month, 21 high-temperature records have been set, and 30 have been tied, according to Greg Carbin, warning coordination meteorologist for the Storm Prediction Center. That's on top of 45 records set or tied in June 2011, Carbin said. The conditions have people young and old doing whatever they can to beat the heat.

"(CNN) -- Work to cut up the hull of a U.S. Navy warship grounded on a Philippine reef is expected to begin shortly, reports from the Philippines said Monday. Weather will be the determining factor as to when crews will begin cutting up the wood-and-fiberglass hull of the USS Guardian, which has been stranded on Tubbahata Reef in the Sulu Sea since January 17, a Philippine Coast Guard official said. The 224-foot-long hull is expected to be cut into three parts. ""We need six days of very good weather in order to begin cutting and lifting of the hull,"" Coast Guard Palawan District Commodore Enrico Efren Evanglista told the official Philippine News Agency. Salvage crews have identified strong points in the hull of the 1,312-ton minesweeper that can be used to lift chunks of the hull off the reef. ""Most of the work is done below deck. The focus of the salvage team is the preparation of the hull for cutting and lifting,"" the Coast Guard official said. The superstructure of the vessel has been removed and taken away from the grounding site on Tubbahata Reef, an environmentally sensitive UNESCO World Heritage Site. About 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral can be found there, as can whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO. That means crews are taking extra care in removing parts of the ship that could contain residue from oil and fuel, such as pipe fittings, Efren Evanglista said. The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef. The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible. An investigation of the grounding is ongoing. Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles.","Six days of calm weather needed to cut up warship's hull .

"(CNN) -- Police continued their investigation Tuesday into the shooting deaths of an Army recruiter and a 17-year-old girl in Maryland that appear to be ""a murder-suicide,"" Montgomery County police said. Staff Sgt. Adam Anthony Arndt, 31, knew Michelle Lynne Miller because he supervised her recruitment as she planned to enlist in the Army Reserves after graduating high school, police said. Police found both of them dead Monday inside Arndt's apartment in Germantown while looking into a report of a missing juvenile possibly being at that location, police said. Police broke down the door because they were unable to make contact with anyone inside. ""Detectives now believe that Arndt shot Miller and then shot himself,"" police said in a statement. Miller was a senior at Rockville High School, police said. Miller's father, Kevin, told CNN affiliate WJLA that he believes his daughter was lured to Arndt's residence after she received a call Sunday night from Arndt, who was threatening suicide. His daughter raced to his home in her mother's car, her father said. Miller had just been accepted at Arizona State University and enlisted to help pay the tuition, her father said. She wanted to be a psychotherapist, he said. Arndt was apparently in violation of Army recruiting regulations because a recruiter isn't ""allowed to have anyone who would be considered influenced by your position in the Army in your private home, in your dwelling place,"" said Kathleen Welker of the U.S. Army Recruiting Command. When asked if the recruit's presence in Arndt's residence violated regulations, Welker stated: ""I would say it appears that way. But it is being investigated by the police and by our Criminal Investigation Division."" A recruiter is also prohibited from having any sort of relationship with someone applying for military service, Welker said. Arndt worked at the recruitment center in Gaithersburg, Maryland, she said.","An Army recruiter shoots a recruit, 17, and then himself, police say .

"London (CNN) -- Documents chronicling the life of South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela are now freely available to his fans around the world, thanks to a new online digital archive. The Nelson Mandela Digital Archive Project contains nearly 2000 mementos from of the life of the 93-year-old, casting an intimate light on the life of the anti-apartheid leader. Documents include the earliest-known photograph of Mandela, taken in 1938 when he was 19 or 20 years old, hand-written letters and diaries written during his 27 years of imprisonment, and previously unseen drafts of the sequel to his autobiography. The archive extends from the earliest known record of Mandela -- a Methodist church membership card issued in 1929 -- to handwritten notes taken during the talks to end apartheid, and beyond. The project is a collaboration between internet giant Google, and the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory in South Africa, where the originals are held. Google gave a $1.25m grant to help preserve and digitize thousands of archival documents held in the Johannesburg-based center -- including never-before-seen items donated by the former president himself -- so that they could reach a broader audience online. The concept behind the project is that spreading Mandela's life story will help promote a message of social justice through the world. ""It is invigorating to see our combined efforts become a reality,"" said Verne Harris, head of the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory. ""This digital initiative will make it possible for us to reach the full spectrum of our stakeholders, from the global elite to systemically disadvantaged South Africans."" The archive includes handwritten letters from his cell to his children, Zeni and Zindzi, after their mother, Winnie, had been arrested by the apartheid regime's police. ""My Darlings,"" begins the letter, dated June 23, 1969. ""Once again our beloved Mummy has been arrested and now she and Daddy are away in jail. My heart bleeds as I think of her sitting in some police cell far away from home, perhaps alone and without anybody to talk to, and with nothing to read. Twenty four hours of the day longing for her little ones."" The project was the work of the Google Cultural Institute, which seeks to unlock the world's cultural and historical heritage by promoting and preserving culture online. Steve Crossan, the institute's director, said the archive showed ""how the internet can help preserve historical heritage and make it available to the world. We've worked closely with the (center) to create an interactive online experience with powerful search and browsing tools, so that users can explore Mr Mandela's inspiring life story."" A similar grant of the same size has also been made to the Desmond Tutu Peace Center in Cape Town, for the documentation and digitisation of the South African Archbishop and anti-apartheid activist's archive. Other Google Cultural Institute projects have included showcasing the Dead Sea Scrolls, presenting thousands of works of art online through the Art Project, and the digitization of the Yad Vashem Holocaust materials. Speaking at the launch, South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor described Mandela as ""the most famous ex-political prisoner of all time"" and praised him for making ""his own intellectual property available to all."" ""He is an inspiration to us all. His qualities as a person inspire us. And they inspire our children,"" she said. ""It is a pioneering step to digitize Mr Mandela's own records and to post them online.""","A new online archive features nearly 2000 documents from Mandela's life .

"(CNN) -- As video game technology improves, games are getting quicker, deadlier and more reactive. This, in some cases, is requiring gamers to be faster on the draw, more reflexive in their actions and to be able to act with little time for a thought-out strategy. One gaming genre, however, prefers to slow things down while still maintaining a high degree of action and planning. Turn-based strategy games harken back to the days of playing board games with dice and individualized pieces. But, now, they can use the latest tech to help make the games more immersive and interactive. At Firaxis Games near Baltimore, the company continues to create one of the best turn-based strategy franchises with its ""Civilization"" series. Sid Meier, director of creative development, has spearheaded development of the ""Civ"" series since 1991, but he helped found Firaxis with the idea of bringing in others who thrive on the thrill of strategy and creating experiences that test the mind of the gamer. ""I think it is unique to strategy games,"" he said. ""I know people have said, 'I've looked at Civ and it looked complicated so I didn't play it.' Where a strategy gamer will look at it and say, 'Oooh. It looks complicated. I'm going to play that.'"" 10-year-long video game creates 'hellish nightmare' world . Strategy board games back in the 1970s and '80s, like ""Blitzkrieg"" and ""War in Europe,"" were simulation-type games requiring players to spend a lot of time rolling dice to resolve combat or find out different game stats -- weather conditions, civil unrest, troop rally points. Bringing turn-based strategy games to computers allowed all that number crunching to be done quickly and increased the pace of the game. Ed Beach, lead designer for ""Civilization V: Gods & Kings,"" designs historical board games in his spare time, but appreciates how turn-based strategy games now create a better experience for the player. ""If the player is just rolling dice to update status and once every 20 minutes he gets to make a decision, that's horrible,"" Beach said. ""Back then, it was kind of cool to see how the simulation worked, but now they want to feel engaged like they are Napoleon. The bar has raised a lot in what they are expecting."" 5 games to watch from Comic-Con . Technology has elevated the expectations of players for graphics and artificial intelligence, and made some strategy board game mechanics easier to implement. Meier said there are many concepts that work really well in a computer game, like fog of war -- not being able to see all the pieces on the board until your units are within range of enemy units. ""There is just as much temptation to do too much with the computer game ...,"" he said. ""You have to make sure the player feels they're in control and everything is understandable."" Part of the excitement for designers has been figuring out the best way to create the game experience so that it becomes part of the natural flow of the action. It is also a challenge not to get lost in the glow of creating a really cool weather system, for example, that the player isn't even going to notice, much less enjoy. ""Certainly, it is a place where I've gotten stuck a few times, thinking about things in terms of how the systems work together instead of thinking, does this even ... matter to the player?"" Jake Solomon, lead designer for ""XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"" said. ""In a strategy game, you have an idea of a player experience in your mind. Tweaking these systems, it's hard to gauge how that's going to achieve the ideal player experience."" Meier, Solomon and Beach all said they have a passion for the genre and try to create games they would want to play themselves. Despite all the system creations, which they feel are unique to the turn-based genre because of the intricate details demanded by fans, the core goal of any game has to be fun. Meier said there is no checklist they work from to make their games. He said they have also been fortunate to have an involved and vocal fan base for their strategy games, which helps them fine tune their creations to meet the demands of their fans. Beach points out the future of turn-based strategy gaming is already playing out in other casual games like ""Words With Friends,"" where players take turns playing a ""Scrabble""-like game with opponents. While watching his daughter play on her phone with her friends, he realized casual gaming is creating a growing audience for the turn-based strategy genre. Is 'Diablo III' a broken game or just too hard? ""It is amazing just the connectiveness of everything now,"" he said. ""There are absolutely opportunities for strategy games to interact in all new ways and opening up new modes of multiplayer action."" And while the crew at Firaxis is busy working on the next computer strategy game, traditional board strategy games have been making a revival as well. ""The Settlers of Catan,"" a game first published in 1995, has been reappearing on store shelves, and made appearances on the popular CBS sitcom, ""The Big Bang Theory."" Other titles requiring more thought than reflex actions are also drawing interest from gamers, both longtime and casual players. Pong! Atari marks 40 years of gaming . ""There is such a huge audience now for that style of interaction (with turn-based strategy games),"" Beach said. ""It is really an interesting phenomenon."" ""The world is changing, but it's all good for strategy gamers.""","Turn-based strategy games are reminiscent of board games .

"(CNN) -- Who would have thought that getting naked and naughty with a stranger online could have negative consequences? It turns out that in addition to the potential for walk-ins by significant others and soul-crushing lack of self-respect in the morning, would-be Internet Lotharios now have to worry about being blackmailed. Police in Singapore are reporting what appears to be a ring (or rings) of online scam artists who use attractive women to ""friend"" victims on social sites, seduce them into cybersex on webcams and then threaten to post images or videos of them online if they don't pay up. ""They would commence a webcam conversation with the victims and initiate cybersex by undressing themselves first before persuading the male victims to appear nude or perform sexual acts in front of the webcams,"" the Singapore Police Force wrote in a post on its website. ""Unknown to the victims, the suspects had recorded the acts."" According to the police, more than 50 such cases were reported in 2012, up from 11 the previous year. In the wonderfully sensational style of journalism reminiscent of Next Media Animation's ""animated news"" (the Taiwanese folks who showed us Tiger Woods' 2009 traffic mishap and Steve Jobs turning into a ninja) Singapore TV station HD 5 created a 10-minute ""reconstruction"" of the scam. It shows our hero Danny, a dorky student, being ""friended"" on Facebook by the lovely Lilly, who proceeds to talk him out of his pants on camera before abruptly disappearing. The tryst-gone-wrong is then followed by an e-mail and phone call from a shadowy dude demanding $50,000. Poor Danny. Graham Cluley, of Web security firm Sophos, warns that if such a scam spreads, it could encompass more than just blackmail. ""You can imagine how a man, believing he is being seduced online by a sexy woman, might be all too eager to click on a link she suggests or run a malicious program on his computer,"" Cluley wrote on his blog. ""Before he knows it, his computer could be under the control of a hacker."" It was unclear Monday whether Singapore Police have made any arrests related to the scams. A message to the police force was not immediately returned. Singapore Police warn potential targets to be wary of strangers befriending them on social networks and to avoid giving away personal details or ""performing compromising acts"" with people you barely know. The police also urge users to call authorities immediately if someone tries to extort money from you. Cluley adds a simpler word of advice: ""Be careful out there, and keep your trousers on, chaps.""","Naked webcam scam being used to blackmail victims .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 2 feet of snow piled up at the nation's capital as a blizzard pounded mid-Atlantic states Saturday, cutting power to hundreds of thousands in the region in what the president referred to as ""Snowmaggedon."" Snow fell from southern Indiana eastward to New York, Washington, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the New Jersey coast, gripping states and snarling traffic. The snow didn't stop everyone, however. Some made fun with the white stuff, fashioning ""people"" out of snow or having snowball fights. In Washington's Dupont Circle, about 1,000 people packed, rounded and flung snowballs in between outbursts of laughter. President Obama didn't let the snow keep him from his busy Washington schedule. Faced with the swirling flakes, Obama ditched ""the Beast"" -- his souped-up Cadillac limousine -- for an armored, four-wheel drive Chevy Suburban capable of trudging through the several inches of snow. Despite plowing and shoveling, the continuous snow made for a slippery White House driveway. Before the 15-vehicle presidential motorcade pulled out of the driveway headed to the Capital Hilton for Obama's speech to Democrats, one of the emergency vehicles lost traction and slid into an SUV. No one was in the car at the time. Sliding vehicles in Virginia hit six state police troopers; three of the troopers suffered minor injuries, police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said. About 25.5 inches of snow fell at American University in Washington over two days, inching the city toward the snowfall record. The capital received 28 inches of snow in the ""Knickerbocker Storm"" of January 27-28, 1922. The blizzard has left hundreds of thousands of customers from Virginia to Pennsylvania without power, utility companies said. As of 7 p.m., 92,840 customers were without power, Dominion Virginia Power said, down from 207,000 customers Saturday morning. In Maryland and Washington, 104,331 Pepco customers were in the dark, the utility company said. The majority, or 84,829, live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and 7,643 live in Washington, according to Pepco. Another 23,163 Maryland customers were also without power, according to Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. Are you affected by winter weather? Share photos, videos . In Philadelphia, a reported 28.5 inches had fallen at the airport by 4:45 p.m., the National Weather Service said. ""We are getting absolutely clobbered this morning with snow,"" said Steven Steingard, a lawyer who lives in suburban Philadelphia. ""We have about a foot already and they say it will continue for 10 to 12 hours more."" The storm also may produce a record snowfall for Baltimore, which has reported up to 28 inches of snow so far, according to the National Weather Service. Flights canceled, highway crews mobilized . In College Park, Maryland, snow-laden power lines drooped onto branches, causing power failures. One city resident, Ben Hampton, told CNN he could hear electrical transformers popping. Annapolis, Maryland, racked up 21.5 inches of snow by 3 p.m. Saturday. State officials said 2,400 pieces of equipment were trying to clear highways. The state also was relying on 300 National Guard members to help with ongoing weather trouble. Crews have about 12 to 24 more hours of work ahead to clear roads and ready them for the Monday commute, Maryland Emergency Management Agency spokesman Ed McDonough told CNN. ""It was coming down 2 to 3 inches an hour at times and snow plows just can't keep up with that,"" he said. In some areas, snow piled as high as 30 inches tall, McDonough said. More than 750 personnel were clearing roads in Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty said. But the heavy, wet snow has even trapped some plows, Washington Department of Transportation director Gabe Klein said. Flights were canceled at the Washington-Baltimore area's three main airports and at Philadelphia International Airport. Amtrak has canceled many trains in and out of Washington, and Greyhound has halted bus service until 1 p.m. Sunday, Klein said. On Friday, a weather-related accident in Virginia's Wythe County left two dead, state police said. A father and son stopped on a shoulder to help injured occupants of a disabled vehicle. Minutes later, a tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck their van while trying to avoid hitting the disabled car. The father and son died at the scene, state police said. Virginia state police said the accident was one of many crashes and disabled cars reported. Winter storm warnings were in effect from southern Indiana eastward to New York and south to North Carolina, with blizzard warnings for Washington, Delaware and the New Jersey coast. Delaware Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency Friday night and ordered all vehicles off the roads by 10 p.m. Forecasters were predicting that the mountains of West Virginia and Maryland, west of the nation's capital, would receive the most snow -- possibly 3 feet. CNN's Greg Morrison, Suzanne Malveaux and Angela Fritz contributed to this report.","Maryland officials say 2,400 pieces of road-clearing equipment in use .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three Drug Enforcement Administration agents are under investigation for allegedly hiring prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, a congressional source confirms to CNN. According to this source, House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King, R-New York, and committee investigators have been ""aware of this for some time."" News of the investigation comes on the heels of a prostitution scandal involving U.S. military and Secret Service agents who were detailed to Colombia in April in advance of President Barack Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. Several Secret Service members have been dismissed as a result of investigations. Public hearing scheduled on Secret Service prostitution scandal . CNN spoke with three senators -- one of whom asked not to be identified -- who confirmed the investigation concerning the DEA agents. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said senators found out about the matter a week ago but were asked to keep it quiet until the agents were removed from Colombia. ""Not good,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, which on Wednesday will hear the first testimony from Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. Collins released a statement later Monday, saying, ""It's disturbing that we may be uncovering a troubling culture that spans more than one law enforcement agency. ""In addition to the Secret Service scandal, we now learn that at least two DEA agents apparently entertained female foreign national masseuses in the Cartagena apartment of one of the agents. The evidence uncovered thus far indicates that this likely was not just a one-time incident,"" Collins added in her statement. DEA spokesman Rusty Payne said the matter has been turned over to the Justice Department inspector general. ""The Drug Enforcement Administration was provided information from the Secret Service unrelated to the Cartagena hotel Secret Service incident, which DEA immediately followed up on, making DEA employees available to be interviewed by the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General. DEA takes allegations of misconduct very seriously and will take appropriate personnel action, if warranted, upon the conclusion of the OIG investigation,"" Payne said. In addition, Collins and one other senator told CNN that one additional Secret Service agent has come forward in recent days and volunteered to his superiors that he paid a prostitute while in Colombia in advance of President Obama's recent trip there. An aide to Collins said the Secret Service is telling the senator's office that the agent says he thought he was paying for a massage, not for prostitution. Because that agent came forward on his own, he will not lose his job, one of the senators said.","Evidence ""indicates that this likely was not just a one-time incident,"" senator says .

"(CNN) -- The funeral service for ""Sopranos"" actor James Gandolfini will be held Thursday in Manhattan, a family friend told CNN on Sunday. Gandolfini, who was on a working vacation in Rome, died Wednesday. An autopsy determined his death was the result of a heart attack, according to Michael Kobold, the family friend. The actor's remains are scheduled to leave Rome on Monday and arrive in the United States the same evening, Kobold said. The service will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. ""On behalf of the Gandolfini family, I would like to thank the Italian authorities for all of the assistance they have rendered in expediting the formalities necessary to repatriate James Gandolfini's remains to the United States,"" Kobold said. ""We are fully aware that this process usually takes seven days and we are extremely grateful for their efficiency in dealing with this matter. We sincerely thank you."" The 51-year-old actor arrived in Rome with his son, Michael Gandolfini, a day before he died. ""Jim was happy, he was healthy, he was doing really fine,"" Kobold said. ""He was on vacation with his son. He has an 8-month-old daughter. Everything was going great. I just spoke to him on Father's Day."" The same day Gandolfini died, he had visited the Vatican and dined with his son, the family said. After he returned to his room, his son alerted hotel staff that he was not answering knocks on the bathroom door. Hotel staff broke down the door to get to him and called an ambulance, said Tiziana Rocca, head of a film festival the actor was planning to attend. Gandolfini was in Italy to receive an award at the Taormina Film Fest in the Sicilian town of Taormina. Instead of the award ceremony, the festival paid tribute to Gandolfini's lifetime achievements. The actor shot to fame on the HBO drama ""The Sopranos."" In the widely successful series, he played Tony Soprano, a tough New Jersey crime boss.

"(CNN) -- Don't count Carlos Danger out of the New York mayoral race just yet. He's still a contender. That's Anthony Weiner, for anyone who slept through the news that more X-rated photos and text messages apparently sent (under that nom de plume) by Weiner to a then-22-year-old woman have surfaced. The raunchy messages were reportedly sent via the social media website Formspring in August 2012, nearly a year after Weiner resigned from Congress after his first sex scandal. But this time around, Weiner is smarter. Instead of denials, Weiner has admitted communicating with the young woman and asked for forgiveness, again. ""I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,"" Weiner said in his news conference Tuesday with his wife, Huma Abedin, a longtime Hillary Clinton adviser, standing by his side. I say Weiner should stay in the race and let the voters decide his fate. Opinion: The public humiliation of Huma Abedin . And it looks like he's planning to do just that. He's resisting all calls to step down and has promised, once again, to stop sexting. Just 10 days ago, polls showed him narrowly leading the race for the Democratic nomination over City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, according to USA Today. Everyone loves to chime in on a scandal. And while numerous people and publications, including the New York Times editorial board, profess outrage over latest Weiner's moral lapses -- and others are labeling him a sexual predator and demanding that he drop out -- it may be time for Americans to fess up. Anthony Weiner may be in the headlines today, but many American adults are using social networking to spice up their sex lives. Weiner's messages are raunchy. They read more like an erotica novel by the hugely successful author Zane. And one of the reasons voters may just grant Weiner the forgiveness he's asking for is because many of us can relate. Sexting between adults, both married and single, is on the rise. Nearly one in five adults in the U.S. says they use their smartphone for sexting, sharing explicit photos or text messages with others, says Lookout Mobile Security, which sponsored the Harris Interactive poll of 2,097 adults. The biggest age groups for sexting are 18- to 34-year-old men (32%) and 35- to 44-year-old women (25%). Even baby boomers are getting into the action, with one in 10 people age 55 and older sexting. All those parents who are admonishing their children about the dangers of sexting? Well, they speak from experience: The Harris survey found that 30% of parents with children under the age of 18 have also sexted. Like it or not, we have become a sexting nation, which may explain why some voters are willing to forgive politicians caught up in sex scandals and give them a second and even a third chance. If Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as New York governor in 2008 after a scandal involving prostitutes, can rehab his political career enough to compete for New York City comptroller in this election, then it stands to reason that Weiner, with all his faults, still has the right to have voters decide whether he's fit enough to become the city's next mayor. ""New Yorkers have a forgiving attitude. If this was in another state, Weiner might not make it, but here, he has a chance,"" said Vincent Hurst, an educator in New York. For Hurst, who says Weiner won't get his vote, it's all about his politics. ""I probably won't vote for him -- or Eliot Spitzer, either. Weiner wants to cut 1,400 parent coordinator positions from the Department of Education. That's a disgrace,"" Hurst said. Like many voters, Hurst is concerned that the Weiner story will take away from the critical issues facing voters in the coming election. Opinion: Hey Weiner, New York doesn't like to look stupid . ""I'm almost betting that another allegation will come up. This is a very important election. The new mayor will likely reform the Department of Education and other important city agencies. We need to focus on those issues, not his sex life."" Whether it's Weiner, Spitzer or one of the city's favorite sons, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the political sex scandal has become a familiar story at every level of American politics. And after the headlines fade, it almost seems a non-issue at the polls. Voters today are more likely to forgive and even re-elect the candidate unless the scandal involved gross corruption or misuse of public funds, such as when Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was forced to leave office. Maybe the time has come to accept that American politicians are flawed, but that doesn't necessarily exclude them from a productive political career. These stories will not go away, not with the incredible access technology gives us into personal lives of our neighbors around the globe. ""American attitudes are changing about sex because of evolving sexual norms and modernization,"" said Alison Dagnes, associate professor of political science at Shippensburg University. ""We are a forgiving nation and will forgive the sinner if he is truly apologetic. If a politician can make the case that sexual impropriety is a personal matter, the public will likely give him a pass."" ""But the timing is a problem for Weiner,"" said Dagnes, also the editor of ""Sex Scandals in American Politics: A Multidisciplinary Approach."" ""How many times is he going to apologize to the public?"" Opinion: Why Weiner's problem is ours, too . We don't know what type of relationship Weiner has with his wife, but Abedin is standing by her husband for now. That's her choice. New York voters will also have an important choice about Weiner and Spitzer and whether we hold our politicians to a higher moral responsibility than we hold ourselves. The decision is ours. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Don't count out ""Carlos Danger"" yet; Weiner should still run for mayor .
Calls for him to quit may not take into account Americans' growing tendency to ""sext,"" she says .
She says if Spitzer can run with his sex scandal, why not Weiner? Voters should decide .
Jones: Maybe it's time to accept that flawed people can still govern productively ."
"New York (CNN) -- After more than two decades behind bars, David Ranta walked out of a Brooklyn courthouse Thursday afternoon with an apology from a judge and one immediate wish: ""Get the hell out of here."" Ranta had been convicted of second-degree murder in 1991 for killing a rabbi during a botched diamond heist. But two decades later, a onetime witness said he had been coached into identifying Ranta in a police lineup -- and after an investigation, prosecutors recommended that Ranta's conviction be tossed out. ""Mr. Ranta, to say that I'm sorry for what you have endured would be an understatement and grossly inadequate, but I say it to you anyway,"" Judge Miriam Cyrulnik said during an emotional hearing that left even the judge wiping her eyes. Asked what he wanted to do now, Ranta told reporters at the courthouse, ""Get the hell out of here."" And with that, he walked out with his lawyer, carrying a small mesh bag that held his belongings. ""Right now, I feel like I'm under water swimming,"" he said. ""This is overwhelming."" Hours later, his lawyer told CNN that Ranta intends to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of New York and the New York Police Department. ""My client had 23 years taken from him. It is a lifetime, it's a generation,"" attorney Pierre Sussman said. ""And if you look at those before and after pictures, before he went in, and now that he's out, it's a different person."" For now, Ranta plans to relax and reconnect with his family, Sussman said. One of his first requests after leaving the courtroom, Sussman said, was ""a juicy chicken parmesan sandwich with a side of fries."" 'A number of things' wrong with the case . Ranta, now 58, was sentenced to 37 1/2 years to life in prison in the killing of Chaskel Werzberger, a rabbi in Brooklyn's Williamsburg community. Since Ranta's trial, another man's widow has identified her now-dead husband as the killer; a onetime jail inmate has said he made up statements about Ranta to boost his own fortunes; and the man who, as a boy, picked him out of a lineup has come forward to say he was coached by a detective. Prosecutors have determined the evidence underpinning Ranta's conviction ""has been degraded to such an extent"" that it would no longer support the verdict, said John O'Mara, the deputy district attorney in charge of Brooklyn's conviction integrity unit. Louis Scarcella, one of the detectives who investigated the case, told CNN that Ranta admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest. As for claims that police coached a witness, he said, ""No way that happened."" But O'Mara said the investigation found ""a number of things that were wrong with the case."" ""It was cumulative,"" he said. New evidence led prosecutors to believe ""that we could no longer be confident"" that Ranta was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A witness changes his story . A key part of the investigation that led to Thursday's ruling started two years ago, when a witness in the case changed his story. Menachem Lieberman was 13 years old when he identified Ranta in a lineup. In 2011, he told investigators that he identified Ranta after being told by a detective to ""Pick the guy with the big nose."" ""I was too young back then to realize that this was a setup. To me this was just basically, I never saw a lineup before, I was just part of the process,"" Lieberman said in an exclusive interview with CNN's AC360 on Thursday. ""I think as years went by ... as more and more I saw on the news, I saw innocent people get set free in various ways. I started to think back to the trial I was involved in, and remembered where I was told who to pick out of the lineup."" After Lieberman came forward, O'Mara's unit began to dig into Ranta's case. ""As he started to investigate, the whole case fell apart,"" Lieberman said. ""So I guess an innocent man was in jail but is now free. The sad part is that the killer never met justice."" For some, doubts linger . Isaac Abraham, a friend of the victim's, said he had sat through the trial and came away convinced that if Ranta had not been Werzberger's killer, ""he was definitely an accomplice."" ""Now it's David Ranta's day to suck in some fresh air and enjoy his free life out there,"" Abraham said. But he said the decision to release him left him ""confused."" ""Is the shooter still out there? We're pointing to a dead man to close the case? That's asinine,"" he said. Werzberger died four days after being shot, a victim of the attempted holdup of a diamond courier. The courier escaped, but the would-be robber shot Werzberger through the window of his parked car, hauled him out of the vehicle and drove off, according to the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Ranta was arrested six months later, when two men facing trial on their own robbery charges gave his name to police, prosecutors recounted in asking that his conviction be tossed out. In an initial lineup, only one witness recognized Ranta, and that was after a lengthy conversation with a Yiddish interpreter, they noted. In the second lineup, three youths identified him and repeated that identification in court. One witness who didn't identify him was the courier, the intended target of the holdup. Attorney: 'There was no physical evidence' When questioned by detectives, Ranta initially denied any involvement in the killing. Then he acknowledged knowing one of the jail inmates who identified him, according to prosecutors. He admitted he had been near the scene and knowing his friends had planned a holdup. Then he admitted he had been involved in planning the diamond heist, acted as the lookout and had seen the other men with the gun. ""The police had an alleged confession from him, but there was no physical evidence,"" Michael Baum, the lawyer who represented Ranta at his trial, told CNN. ""The jewelry courier, he testified for the defense, saying that Ranta wasn't the guy."" Four years after Ranta's conviction, a woman named Theresa Astin came forward to say her husband had been the killer. Joseph Astin, who had died in a 1990 car accident, had been possible suspect before: Scarcella had brought the courier to the morgue in hopes that he could identify Astin as the gunman, but he couldn't. Baum sought a new trial for his client based on the widow's testimony, without success. Then in 2011, Lieberman came forward. ""It was on his conscience for all these years,"" Baum said. ""He was 13 years old at the time. He was just a kid. He was just doing what they told him to do."" Detective: 'I never framed anyone' As O'Mara began to dig into the case, details unraveled. One of the two jail inmates who put the finger on Ranta had since died; the second told prosecutors he had fabricated earlier statements he made about Ranta, hoping that his cooperation would help his own criminal case. His girlfriend at the time confessed that her account was manufactured as well. And Theresa Astin reiterated her previous testimony. Scarcella said the case against Ranta was ""very simple,"" and he sharply disputes Lieberman's account of being coached. ""They're saying that I framed it,"" Scarcella said. ""I want to go on record saying this: I never framed anyone in my life, and you would have to be a low, low devil to do something like that. I slept very good for the last 22 years."" But Sussman, Ranta's attorney, called the case ""a travesty of justice from the beginning."" ""The detective work that was done on this case was at best shoddy and at worst criminal. And I don't use that word lightly,"" he told CNN. ""But when a closer examination is done of the detective work ... It becomes clear that there were so many leads that weren't followed, there were so many notes that weren't taken and just a general lack of attention to an investigation that required nothing but close scrutiny of the scene, of witnesses and so forth. That didn't happen."" Arizona woman's murder conviction, death sentence overturned . CNN's Mary Snow reported from New York. CNN's Matt Smith and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- From ""The West Wing"" to ""The Help,"" Allison Janney has been part of some of the most acclaimed ensemble casts of the big and small screens. But for her latest role, the award-winning actress finds yet another medium to share her talents and this time with just one other performer, 18-year-old starlet Dakota Fanning. In a production shown exclusively on the YouTube original content channel, ""WIGS,"" Janney has the title role in ""Celia."" As has often been the case for Janney, the role happens to line up with her personal political views. In the eight-minute short, she plays a pro-choice doctor who both counsels women about abortions and performs them. However, her latest patient, ""Hannah"" (Fanning), is a bit different. Hannah is the teenage daughter of Celia's dear friend, and Celia's friend has no idea her daughter is pregnant. Like the political themes of ""West Wing"" or issues of class and racism in ""The Help,"" Janney was immediately drawn to the script and hungry to portray a character that might get people talking. In an interview with CNN, Janney had some choice words for anyone going head-to-head with women's rights, pointed a finger at a certain reality TV show she blames for killing ""The West Wing,"" and offered up a few pearls of wisdom to fellow ""5-foot-12"" beauties like herself. 'West Wing' cast reunites for one last 'walk and talk' CNN: What drew you to ""Celia?"" Allison Janney: It's very thought provoking. I read it and I believed in a woman's right to choose, and this is how I'm political in doing projects like this. I think this opens up a dialogue with people who watch, and even those people who are pro-life can watch it and appreciate it. CNN: You can't help but ask yourself, ""What would I do in this situation?"" Janney: Yeah, I totally did. I have friends with daughters Dakota's age and I think it would be very tricky for me. I thought it was wonderful in that you're not sure what the outcome is. I don't believe in answers. Everyone gets to talk about whether or not they think she did it. Did she go to a new doctor or did she end up having the baby? I definitely feel that it is between a woman and her doctor and her loved ones. That's where those decisions should be made --not legislated by the government. CNN: Does it surprise you, 40 years after Roe vs. Wade, that this is still such a heated and debated topic? Janney: It's extraordinary to me! It makes me so angry in a country where we are all suppose to be, ""Freedom rings...Freedom!...Freedom!"" And then women are the ones constantly being cut down and having information and education kept away from them as if we can't be trusted to make our own choices. It's infuriating. CNN: A lot of attention has been focused on women's issue this election cycle, from abortion and contraception to funding for Planned Parenthood. Janney: The fact that anyone is trying to defund Planned Parenthood...my mother use to work for Planned Parenthood and I was always aware of their existence. (Those against Planned Parenthood) want to keep women in the dark. They want to take away their right to have access to health care and education about how to take care of their own bodies. It's evil. CNN: Your ""Celia"" co-star Dakota Fanning turned 18 this year and will be able to vote for the first time. Janney: What a beautiful young actress. I met her sister Elle the other night at an event where she was being honored. They're both so wonderfully self-possessed, mature and very smart. Dakota was a little intimidating! At her age! I still feel like a teenager and she's so professional and talented and just extraordinary. I would credit that to her parents. I also wanted to do (""Celia"") because I knew I'd be working with her. I love everything she's been in and thought she'd be that caliber of an actress who could take on this issue and do it the right way. CNN: There was a time not too long ago when movie stars wouldn't do TV. Now there's the Internet. What does it take for someone with your resume to go online? Janney: (Laughter) This is two-fold. This is my way of being political. I did ""Prop 8: The Musical"" and recently this PSA (public-service announcement) with the ""West Wing"" group for Bridget Mary McCormack, who is running for (Michigan) state Supreme Court. It brings me so much joy do projects about subject matters that I believe in. I'm not an activist in the sense that I can't go out and speak in front of people. I'm so terrified to speak in public and I can't believe I'm an actress! And it's also economics. People can't afford to be snobs about any medium. CNN: A lot of people blame the Kardashians for sucking up all the TV time. Janney: (laughter) Exactly. ""The West Wing"" was hit hard by reality television. I've always had a chip on my shoulder about it. I can't believe we had the same viewers as ""The Bachelor,"" but when that first hit in 2001 or 2002, slowly our ratings started to go because we were opposite. I was, like, ""what is going on? Why do people that like to watch ""The West Wing"" like to watch ""The Bachelor""?! I've always hated reality television. Networks love to back those shows because it doesn't cost them anything. Scripted television and well-paid actors have taken a hit -- it's it has changed the landscape of television. CNN: The ""West Wing"" PSA you mention was a cruel tease for many to see the whole gang back together. Fans are demanding a reunion. Janney: I wish. I had so much fun. I realized how much I missed all those people when we got to spend the whole Saturday together. I miss being with those people. They're extraordinary, funny, smart actors and they were my family for so long. It was a tease for me, too! CNN: If a full show is too much, what about a movie? Janney: I know. I know. I'm afraid that's all in Aaron's (Sorkin) hands. I have no say in that matter, but I would love it! I love that character, one of my favorites I've ever gotten to play. CNN: You're 6 feet tall, is that right? Janney: I am. I like to say 5-foot-12! CNN: Do you have any advice for kids, especially tall girls who might be facing bullies or are struggling to feel comfortable in their bodies? Janney: I always encourage girls to take ballet or modern dance, and have an appreciation for their beauty and their body and lines. That gave me a lot of confidence. It's not easy being the tallest person in class and feeling so gangly and huge. I think dance is a way to give women, especially tall women, control over their body and an appreciation of it.","Allison Janney is co-staring in a YouTube original production .

"(CNN) -- Facebook, where people love to discuss politics and complain about other people discussing politics, saw a huge surge in Election Day chatter on Tuesday. In a stunning nod to the power of social media in this election, Obama's first public acknowledgment of victory was a post shared on Twitter and Facebook. It read ""Four more years"" and included a photo of Barack and Michelle Obama hugging. That single post was the most retweeted in the history of Twitter (more than 700,000 times), and on Facebook it raked in an astounding 3.5 million likes and almost 500,000 people shared it on their own Timelines. Over the course of the day, there were more than 71.7 million election related posts and comments on Facebook in the United States and 88.7 million around the world. According to Facebook's internal Talk Meter, which measures how much buzz events get on the network, the election was the most talked about event in 2012. It was especially popular among 25- to 34-year-olds and in D.C., Mississippi and Virginia. It was also a huge topic internationally. Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia were the top countries posting about the election. Obama was mentioned 10 million times on Facebook during Election Day. In just one hour, from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m., he was mentioned 4.1 million times on Facebook -- more than Romney's 4 million total for the entire day. Not everyone appreciates having political posts fill their Facebook feed. Heightened emotions have let to angry fights in comment threads, interfamily drama and unfriendings. The negativity has even caused some to declare they are leaving the social network for a while. Quitting Facebook isn't the only way to cut out the politics.

"(CNN) -- James ""Whitey"" Bulger's defense lawyer continued hammering away at one of the government's star witnesses in a Boston courtroom Wednesday, trying to portray the convicted killer as a pathological liar who should have called it quits and gone to the electric chair when he had the chance. ""Why not take the death penalty and get it over with?"" Bulger attorney Hank Brennan asked Steven Flemmi. ""I was dead either way,"" responded the Bulger henchman, who has spent five days on the witness stand. Flemmi said he decided to cooperate with the government to spare his friends and family from having to suffer through endless trials: ""I took the path of least resistance."" Key to any deal, he said, was testifying against his former crime partners. ""I was facing life-in-prison, plus 30-year consecutive sentences, plus the electric chair in two states,"" he said, describing his testimony as non-negotiable and a package deal, ""It was a global situation."" It's 'Whitey' vs. 'The Rifleman' as Bulger defense goes for top witness . Flemmi pleaded guilty in 2003 to 10 murders. Bulger's lawyer challenged Flemmi, saying he caved because he couldn't handle conditions ""in the hole"" in solitary confinement, on a cold floor in a 6-by-6-foot cell, with a Â¼-inch slit to look outside. ""I'm a human being. I'd like to have a chair,"" Flemmi said. When he complained about having no TV, prosecutor Fred Wyshak jumped up: ""I object. It's not the Hilton."" After his deal, Flemmi was moved to a more comfortable, undisclosed facility. Throughout the trial, Bulger's lawyers have tried to show that as FBI informants, Bulger and Flemmi were protected by rogue FBI agents up and down the chain of command. Without that protection, the duo's reign of terror would not have been as successful or lasted as long as it did, from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. Juror weeps as witness details strangling death of woman . After he was arrested in January 1995, Flemmi tried arguing he had been given immunity for his criminal activity by FBI agents who looked the other way. One of them, disgraced agent John Connolly, was convicted of federal and state crimes and is serving 40 years in Florida. Brennan has been relentless in his questioning of Flemmi, referring to him as a rat. ""A rat is someone who scurries around and feeds on other people,"" Brennan pointed out. Flemmi defended his relationship with the FBI, saying both sides benefited: ""It was quid pro quo, survival."" When asked whether the FBI agent Connolly ever suggested someone be killed, Flemmi answered, ""He gave us information and we acted on it."" U.S. District Judge Denise Casper is reviewing the 30-person witness list submitted by Bulger's attorneys. Many can testify about Bulger's role as an informant but not about the federal murder and racketeering charges he faces. She's expected to rule on which witnesses are relevant to Bulger's defense.

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have arrested a former college professor who was on the FBI's 10 most wanted list over allegations of child sex abuse. Walter Lee Williams was detained late Tuesday, Mexican state news agency Notimex reported. The FBI placed the former university professor wanted for alleged sexual exploitation of children on the list Monday, according to Notimex. Williams researched in the field of gender development at a university in California, which gave him easy access to his victims, mainly teenage boys in developing countries, the FBI said. Agents believe he had resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand, but also may have traveled to Mexico and Peru. An FBI agent reported finding child pornography on a computer and in a video camera belonging to Williams. He was the 500th suspect added to the ""FBI 10 most wanted fugitives"" list, and the bureau offered $100,000 for information leading to his arrest. Williams' photo had appeared in Mexican newspapers identifying him as a fugitive. Police arrested him in a cafe in Playa del Carmen after he failed to produce proper identification.","Walter Lee Williams was a professor studying gender development .

"(CNN) -- Close to a dozen countries, including the United States, announced Tuesday they were expelling Syrian diplomats in a coordinated move reflecting the international outrage about a massacre in the town of Houla. A U.N. official said it's ""clear"" that Syrian government forces were involved in the massacre, which left more than 100 people dead, nearly half of them children. A ""fairly small number appear to have been killed by shelling, artillery and tank fire which took place over a period of more than 12 hours,"" said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. human rights office. Should the U.S. 'airdrop' millions of phones into Syria? The majority appear to have died as a result of ""summary executions"" by ""armed men going into houses and killing men, women and children inside,"" he said. ""What is clear is government forces were involved. They were shelling, using tanks and artillery. And it appears to be Shabiha militia (a government militia group), entering houses and slaughtering people in what is really an abominable crime that took place throughout the day on Friday."" Syria has denied being behind the killings, insisting that ""terrorists"" carried them out. Syrian officials said the government would investigate. The bloodshed continued Tuesday, when at least 72 people were killed across the country, including nine children and two women, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syria said 21 ""army and law enforcement martyrs"" were buried. Children shot, knifed, axed to death in Syria's Houla massacre, reports say . The Netherlands, the United States, Australia, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Canada all announced Tuesday that they were expelling some Syrian diplomats. In some cases, it was just the ambassadors; in others, numerous diplomats were expelled. The U.S. State Department decided to expel the Syrian charge d'affaires, two State Department officials told CNN. Zouheir Jabbour was called to the department Tuesday morning and told he and his family had 72 hours to leave. He has been the top Syrian envoy in the United States since the ambassador, Imad Moustapha, was called back to Syria in October in a response move after the United States said it was pulling its ambassador out of Syria. ""We hold the Syrian government responsible for this slaughter of innocent lives,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement Tuesday. ""This massacre is the most unambiguous indictment to date of the Syrian government's flagrant violations of its U.N. Security Council obligations ... along with the regime's ongoing threat to peace and security."" White House spokesman Jay Carney was even more emphatic. ""This weekend's massacre is a horrifying testament to this regime's depravity. The international community is united in its revulsion at the regime's actions through both its military and its thug forces, and we are ratcheting up the pressure on and isolation of this murderous regime,"" he said. Sen. Bob Carr, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement, ""The Syrian government can expect no further official engagement with Australia until it abides by the U.N. cease-fire and takes active steps to implement the peace plan agreed with Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan."" The Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was declaring the ambassador persona non grata and expelling four other diplomats ""for the unacceptable repression carried out by the Syrian regime on its population."" But Annan, envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League, took a markedly different tone after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. While he said he ""conveyed in frank terms the grave concern of the international community about the violence in Syria, including the recent shocking events in Houla,"" he also said that Syria's vow to organize its own investigations ""is very encouraging."" He also said he ""expressed appreciation for the cooperation of the Syrian government, which enabled the U.N. to deploy an observer mission to Syria, quickly."" ""We are at a tipping point. The Syrian people do not want the future to be one of bloodshed and division. Yet the killings continue and the abuses are still with us today,"" Annan said, according to a statement released by his office. He said he appealed to al-Assad ""for bold steps now -- not tomorrow, now -- to create momentum for the implementation of the plan."" ""I also appeal to the armed opposition to cease acts of violence,"" he added. Talking to reporters in Damascus, Annan was asked what he thought would happen in Syria if the peace plan was not implemented. ""If the plan is not implemented, I would worry for the future of Syria. I would worry about stability in the country. ... If we do not (implement the plan), may God help us,"" he said. ""Words are wonderful, but action is better. What is important is demonstrate through action a real commitment to the plan and this is what the international community is asking for now: action, not words,"" he said. Al-Assad told Annan that ""terrorist groups"" have escalated operations, including killings and kidnappings, in recent days, and he stressed the urgency of getting countries that are ""financing and harboring terrorist groups"" to commit to Annan's plan, Syrian state-run TV reported. Residents in Houla say Syrian regime forces terrorized the town, a suburb of the anti-government bastion of Homs. An 11-year-old survivor recalled his experience. ""They were talking to my mom. I'm not sure what happened but they shot her five times. They shot her in the head. Then he turned and shot my sister, Rasha, in the head. Then he shot my brother, Nader, in the neck and back,"" the boy said. 'SNN,' YouTube help amplify voices in Syria . Months of diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions have yet to quash the violence, and anger over perceived inaction by world leaders boiled over after the Houla massacre, which the United Nations said left 108 people dead. Opinion: Only Russia, China can stop carnage in Syria . Horrific images of dozens of mutilated children's corpses in Houla prompted a rare moment of unity Sunday from the U.N. Security Council. Even Russia, the staunchest defender of the Syrian regime on the council, signed on to a statement that condemned the Syrian government for its ""outrageous use of force against (the) civilian population."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a conversation with Annan, ""expressed grave concern about the tragedy in Houla and emphasized that all sides in Syria must give up violence in order to avoid similar incidents in the future,"" according to a statement from the ministry. ""An objective and independent investigation of all circumstances of the tragedy must be done under the U.N. Mission in Syria,"" the statement said. Yet few Middle East watchers predict the Houla massacre will break the diplomatic deadlock that has cemented itself around Syria for a year. Timeline: Syria -- How a year of horror unfolded . Unlike in Libya, where NATO-led airstrikes contributed to deposing longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi, al-Assad has powerful regional allies in his corner: Iran, Russia and, to an extent, China. Syria also has ""five times more sophisticated air defense systems than existed in Libya, covering one-fifth of the terrain,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey testified before Congress in March. But a former Syrian general said the country's capabilities were exaggerated. ""It is good to face civilians or light armed freedom fighters ... but when it faces a superior power it will collapse right away. I'm saying that with all sadness because this is the army I served like for 27 years, but this is not the army of the people anymore ... It's the army of the regime itself,"" Akil Hashem told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed and tens of thousands more have been uprooted since the crisis began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people. CNN cannot confirm death tolls and reports of violence from Syria, as the Syrian government limits access by foreign journalists.

"London (CNN) -- A British man accused of orchestrating his wife's murder by hit men while they were on honeymoon in South Africa should be extradited to face trial, a London court ruled Wednesday. Shrien Dewani's appeal was dismissed by Judge Howard Riddle, paving the way for extradition, said an official at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town in 2010. Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of Anni Dewani's death that he had hired two men to kill her. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing. Speaking outside the court Wednesday, Anni Dewani's sister, who did not give her name, said the family was satisfied by the ruling, but it was just one step in the battle to find answers. ""We don't want to forget Anni in this -- for us it's all about Anni, it's all about finding out what happened to her,"" she said. ""We will fight this battle to the end, and this battle has just begun for us."" The ongoing case has been hard on her family, she said. ""Look at my mum, look at my dad -- they are struggling every day with this. They have lost a daughter."" Ashok Hindocha, the victim's uncle, told CNN the extradition decision is a relief. ""We want to know what happened. Our view on this is quite simple. There were five people in the car, four men, one lady. She was murdered,"" he said. ""Three of the people in the car have confessed that that they were involved and they are also in jail now for their part in this incident. Shrien is the only one who hasn't spoken. We want to know why. Why did a beautiful girl on her honeymoon have to die, to be killed, brutally murdered?"" Dewani's legal team may still seek to appeal Wednesday's ruling. The businessman, from Bristol in southwest England, has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing. His extradition was halted last year on mental health grounds. Psychiatric experts told a UK court last year that Dewani was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he'd tried to take his life. 'Fair trial' South African Justice Minister Jeff Radebe welcomed Wednesday's extradition ruling, saying it reaffirms the view that South Africa's legal system is fair and upholds the rule of law. ""We are also pleased that at last Mr. Dewani will stand trial for the alleged murder that induced a sense of shock and outrage -- national as well as around the world,"" he said in a statement. ""We guarantee him and the entire world that he will indeed receive a fair trial."" Radebe said the ruling is also a vote of confidence in the ability of Valkenberg Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, and the correctional services to ensure Dewani is cared for in South Africa. But he said the ruling would not mean that Dewani would immediately be returned to South Africa, since he has further legal avenues to explore. If successful, they could lead to a further appeal in the UK courts. Dewani's attorneys argued last year at the High Court in London that extradition to South Africa would breach his human rights under European law. Their appeal cited concerns over the effect of extradition on his mental illness, the provision of facilities for its treatment and the risk of attack and sexual violence from other inmates. CNN's Kim Norgaard and Victoria Eastwood contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We want to know what happened,"" says the uncle of murder victim Anni Dewani .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Mali's historic cultural center, Timbuktu, lacks electricity, water and phone service, because ""terrorists"" sabotaged the utilities there, a Paris-based spokesman for the ethnic Toureg separatist party MNLA said Thursday. MNLA spokesman Moussa Ag Assarid said most of the ""terrorists"" fled Timbuktu for the desert after French planes on Tuesday bombed the militants' headquarters, which was built by former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. However, Assarid warned, some militants remain in the fabled city. Assarid's choice of the word ""terrorists"" highlights the ever-shifting alliances as Mali devolves into a wild frontier. MNLA used to be aligned with Ansar Dine, one of the main Islamist groups fighting to take over Mali. But after MNLA ousted the Malian army from Timbuktu last year, Ansar Dine and al Qaeda drove MNLA away. The head of the United States' African Command, Gen. Carter Ham, spoke at Howard University in Washington on Thursday about the situation. He said his ultimate goal is helping a legitimate Malian government based in the capital of Bamako control the whole country. U.S. has flown seven cargo missions to Mali . ""Territorial integrity of Mali is nonnegotiable. No discussion of a separatist state or something like that. But, it also appears that Mali has asked for, and will need, some help to establish government control in the north,"" Ham said. ""Realistically, we would all like to see the elimination of al Qaeda and others from northern Mali. Realistically, probably the best you can get is containment and disruption, so that al Qaeda is no longer able to control territory as they do today."" ""This must be in fact and in perception an African-led endeavor that is done at the request of the Malian government, and I think that is well under way now,"" Ham added. But recent allegations against Malian troops have some human rights observers questioning whether the Malian army has right on its side, or just might. Malian soldiers have carried out a number of summary executions as they seek to drive back Islamist militants who have been advancing from the north, a human rights group claimed Thursday. Mali's military offensive against the militants has gathered pace in the past two weeks, with backing from France and other international allies. Refugees tell harrowing stories of life under the Islamist militants who hold northern Mali in an iron grip. But the French-based International Federation for Human Rights said it was ""very alarmed"" by reports that Malian soldiers are themselves carrying out extrajudicial killings and abuses as they counterstrike. FIDH claims the victims of these abuses have been anyone ""accused of complicity with the jihadists or infiltrated elements, persons in possession of weapons, people who have no proof of their identity during military patrols or simply people targeted because of their belonging to certain ethnic groups."" The group said it had confirmed that Malian forces have carried out numerous executions in the key conflict area between the north and south, particularly in the towns of Sevare, Mopti and Niono. ""In Sevare, at least 11 individuals were executed in the military camp, near the bus station and near the hospital,"" the FIDH said. Reliable information indicates ""close to 20 other executions in the same area where bodies are said to have been buried very hastily, in particular in the wells. In the Niono region, Malian soldiers killed two Malians of Tuareg origin."" The group says it has also been told of other summary executions in central Mali, and documents the pillaging of Tuareg homes by government soldiers. What's behind instability in Mali? A Mali military spokesman declined to comment on the record about the rights group's allegations. The FIDH called for the immediate establishment of an independent investigation commission ""to assess the scope of these abuses and sanction the perpetrators."" Although Malian and French politicians and military officials have repeatedly called for respect of international humanitarian law and human rights, the FIDH says it is concerned by the lack of scrutiny of these alleged violations. ""This series of grave abuses confirms the concerns that we have been expressing for several weeks,"" said the group's president, Souhayr Belhassent. ""These acts of revenge together with the extreme tensions that exists between the communities constitute an explosive cocktail leading us to fear that the worst could happen, especially in the context of the reconquering the North."" MNLA rebels who returned to Mali well-armed from fighting for the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi staged a military coup last year against the Malian government. Islamic extremists capitalized on the chaos, carving out a large haven in Mali's north and imposing a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The Islamists banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. Fellow rights group Amnesty International also has voiced concern over the actions of Mali's army. ""Particularly troubling is that among the Malian forces -- as well as pro-government militia -- are individuals who enjoy impunity for egregious human rights violations,"" wrote Scott Edwards, managing director of Crisis Prevention and Response at Amnesty International USA last week. Among other abuses, an Amnesty report last year accused the Malian army of ""indiscriminately"" bombing the civilian population in response to the rebellion by armed Tuareg groups. More signs al Qaeda in Mali orchestrated Algeria attack . Corinne Dufka, who heads Human Rights Watch in West Africa, told CNN on Thursday that education could help stem the ""worrying number of reprisal killings."" ""[It] should be a wake-up call not only to the Malian army to nip this problem in the bud and investigate and hold those responsible, but also to Mali's international partners -- the French, the European Union, the African forces who are coming in -- to acknowledge the weaknesses and problems within the Malian security forces, and then, to properly accompany them, to urgently train them in international humanitarian law and to mentor them so there are no further abuses in the future,"" Dufka said. A CNN crew in Mali has heard anecdotal reports of abuses. It has encountered widespread hatred of the Tuareg in Mali, with many in the population blaming them for bringing the current conflict into Mali. The CNN crew has heard reports that the houses and possessions of Tuareg families have been destroyed by either citizens or Mali's military. Many Tuareg are in hiding or keeping a low profile for fear of retribution from the public and military. Tuareg in refugee camps have repeatedly said they had to flee Mali because of violence against them. France's involvement in Mali began the day after militants said January 10 that they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako. Those events stoked fear among global security experts that Mali could become a new hub for terrorism. The FIDH is a multinational human rights body made up of 164 groups across the world, with delegations at the United Nations in Geneva, the European Union in Brussels and the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that Penn State's former president and two senior administrators will face trial on obstruction of justice and other charges related to the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. The decision followed a two-day preliminary hearing in Harrisburg that wrapped up on Tuesday. This is ""a tragic day for Penn State University, to say the least,"" Judge William Wenner said. State prosecutors allege that former President Graham Spanier, former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Senior Vice President Gary Schultz all knew about two allegations made against Sandusky in 1998 and in 2001, but lied about their knowledge when a grand jury convened several years later. All three men have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Penn State OKs settlements for Sandusky victims . E-mails that surfaced during Penn State's internal investigation into Sandusky's actions led, in part, to criminal charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and failure to report child abuse against the three school officials. The communications touch on a 2001 incident involving the former assistant football coach's encounter with a boy in a shower on the Penn State campus. Afterward, the e-mails show, the men decided to ask Sandusky to stop bringing children from his charity into the locker rooms at the school. Paterno family and others file lawsuit against NCAA . At least three of Sandusky's known victims were abused after 2001, according to testimony at last year's trial of former Nittany Lions defensive coordinator. Attorneys for the three accused former Penn State administrators claim there is no evidence of a cover-up. Yet prosecutors have characterized their action as a conscious decision not to call police. ""There was a conspiracy of silence,"" prosecutor Bruce Beemer said during this week's hearing. ""They are not relieved of criminal responsibility because their conspiracy worked for 10 years."" Those testifying during the recent hearing included Mike McQueary. He was a Penn State graduate assistant coach in 2001 when he witnessed the allegedly illicit shower encounter between Sandusky and a boy that's central to the prosecution's case. McQueary said, for the first time, that late iconic head football coach Joe Paterno had mentioned Sandusky was a ""sick"" guy in passing several times in the decade between that incident and when Sandusky was charged in 2011. Paterno died the following month. Paterno told him, McQueary testified, that Penn State administrators had ""screwed it up"" when talking about the 2001 investigation. Curley's attorney, Caroline Roberto, said this testimony was inconsistent with all if the other testimony and statements McQueary has given in the past three years. Dan McGinn, a spokesman for the Paterno family, said he doesn't think McQueary's testimony was truthful. ""Someone can tell you there was a private conversation about anything,"" McGinn said. ""We're clear about what we think Joe Paterno did."" A trial date for Spanier, Curley and Schultz has not been set, though Schultz's lawyer Tom Farrell said that he expected it will begin in March. All three men are set to be tried together. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Penn State's ex-president, 2 other former administrators will stand trial .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- One year, 365 days and an endless number of seconds, transformed my life 360 degrees, made it go from color to black-and-white, turned laughter into tears. I now no longer perceive the world as a 14-year-old innocent girl who takes everything for granted, more as a victim of a terrible experience that'll never fade away, always reminding me of what others go through and a memory that will forever stay with me. Before the revolution, I remember how, on cold winter nights we would sit together as a family, around the crackling fire sipping hot chocolate. I remember the smoke from the fireplace, wafting upward, leaving a scent of burning wood in the air. I remember looking into my sister's eyes and that glimmer they always had, the smiles my parents would share. I remember how I used to love breaking the silence of the moment by rushing into my father's lap, tracing the narrow path of velvet veins on his hand, as I enthusiastically told him about my day at school, my second home and my friends, my second family. We don't live those days anymore. Now no one's eyes can lie, and the only sound I can hear is the screaming of sorrow. March 23, 2011 was the first day I saw a demonstration in Syria. I was driving to a friend's birthday party, through streets that were packed with people carrying flags and calling out chants in support of the regime. I was oblivious to my surroundings, I didn't know what was going on. I thought it was just a demonstration that would blow over. ""Barely any one is coming! Their parents are too scared to send them because of what's happening,"" my friend cried when she saw me. I looked into her eyes and saw the tears slowly forming and streaming down her red cheeks, streaking her dark make-up. As weeks passed by it kept getting worse. One day I jumped out of bed to the sound of something loud shattering the windows of my room. Breathless, I got up too quickly, barely noticing the glass sparkling on my dull rug. I ran but came to a sudden halt as I felt my head spinning and my vision darkening. My mom was crying and hugging my sister tightly. ""A bomb hit an area nearby,"" my mother stuttered, switching through the different news channels while trying to block us from seeing it. I managed to get a glimpse of it, on the TV, something I wish I had never seen. I remember my eyes feeling assaulted by the brightness on the screen, a sight that haunts me every night; dead bodies, bits of human flesh, were spread out like dispersed glass. I closed my eyes and opened them again, hoping I would go back to the life I was used to, where unicorns and rainbows existed along with Prince Charmings and forever afters. Unfortunately now, the dark days, and the nightmares take place on a regular basis, devastating my country and reluctant as I am to let it in, taking over my life, and controlling my mind. From then on the world changed for me. Instead of learning it slowly through experience it was taught to me harshly through the sound of gunshots and bombardments. I discovered how cruel life can be, and how in one second a smile can turn into a tear, peace into war, a friend into an enemy and life into death. I lived in a blur, not knowing what had happened or what I was to do. I woke up every morning to the sound of gunshots, bombs or the roaring helicopters accompanied by the sad news of the death or kidnapping of someone we knew. Some evenings, I hid under my blankets, covered my ears, and thought of the past trying to feel safe again. I silently peeked out my window to continuously stare at the moon in its different forms casting a dim light, to stare at the sky and the stars emerge taking their place in the night. The image drawing me further and further from reality, into the life I yearned to go back to. My parents tried to stay strong teaching us to do the same, until one night it all fell apart. I was sitting in my room, the place I hadn't left for a long time, talking to my friend about our memories, and suddenly, I hear a cry, whispers, the sound of my mother's sobs, then her yelling. ""I'm going out to find him!"" My family has its own business and my father was late coming back home, not answering his phone. ""But it's too dangerous!"" my aunt screamed back at my mother. ""I don't care!"" my mother shouted back. I ran down the spiraling staircase terrified, afraid of what was happening. Everything went black, like a starless night. I felt like the walls of the house were closing in, suffocating me. The background noise was blocked out and all I could do was stand and stare in dismay at my mom in this state for the first time. She lay on the stone courtyard just outside our front door, crying, holding her phone with a shivering hand dialing my dad's number like her life depended on it. Everything stopped. It was like someone pressed the pause button in a movie, and now the seconds felt like hours. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart screaming over my mom's voice. I don't know how long we waited, or how fast my heart was beating, but when my dad's car turned the corner, I gave everything I had left to run and hug him tighter than ever. At that moment my senses returned and I realized how cold the ground was under my bare feet. I carried my mom inside, and from that day on I learned that though she may be older, taller and more experienced, deep down she needs me just as much as I need her. Now, the one thing I looked forward to was waking up every morning and creeping into my parents' bedroom to look at my dad's thin and frail face making sure he had made it in safe the night before. In school, only half my class was left. ""At least we have each other,"" said one of my five best friends with a comforting smile. However that didn't last for long. Devastating news kept coming at us, beginning with the death of my friend's uncle. ""In one second I lost my uncle; a part of me,"" she whispered in a heartbreaking tone. I looked at her hopelessly, trying to comfort her, but I knew no words could bring him back. Every morning for one month, no words were spoken by anyone besides the ones of regret. ""If we knew this was coming, we would have done things so differently,"" we would tell each other. We wouldn't have taken so much for granted, we would have appreciated what we had. Instead it was ripped away. Grades dropped, smiles faded, students left, and all that remained were the memories that we would safely lock away. As my dad protectively drove us to and from school, the only places we could go to, I noticed the row of soldiers on the streets. They reminded me of domino pieces. Their presence radiated darkness. Each one had a solemn appearance, frightening eyes that looked right through you below their crunched frown. However, what always caught my eye were their large guns, the color of the dark pine trees they leaned on. I went from looking at colorful flowers and singing birds every morning, to dark killer weapons. April 5, 2012 was my last day of school. My parents decided to move us all to Lebanon. I had known it was coming all along. It wasn't a surprise. Everyone was moving. I sank in my seat that day at school, buried my head into my hands and cried like I did every day. I remembered how when I heard the news about Egypt and the violence in Tahrir Square and thinking to myself that I was far from harm's way. Now I was considering how hard it would be to move away from my home, my dad, my friends and family -- not knowing anyone or anything, possibly never being able to contact them because of the broken phone lines. My mind wandered back to 10 years ago when I first stepped foot into the school, only worrying about things like my friendship bracelets, and now I was expected to leave everything I ever knew behind. The people who knew me inside and out, who had carved a place in my heart. Memories flashed accompanied by more tears as my friends gathered around me and I opened my swollen eyes trying to picture the scene hoping it would last forever. I am angry and I feel hatred to the people that are ruining my country, anyone who is holding a gun and shooting no matter which side they're on. Those who stole my childhood and that of so many others. My dream was to apply to universities with my friends as well as cry tears of joy when we threw our graduation hats in the air. Now that was crushed to pieces. One part of me, knows that this isn't good bye, and that no matter where this crazy world takes us when the time is right we will return. Another part of me is scared that more people will die, even if they are not close to me. Everyone has a family, friends and they suffering. I am scared that I will lose the hope that I now have about being able to return, and being left with nothing but memories.","Cayanne wrote about the war is Aleppo, Syria, that forced her family to flee .

"(CNN) -- Three Marines, including the commanding officer of an infantry battalion, have been relieved of their duties in the wake of the death of seven service members killed during a mortar exercise accident in March, according to a statement from the Marines. Lt. Col. Andrew McNulty, the officer in charge of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, was replaced temporarily by Maj. Thomas M. Siverts, the unit's second in command. Brig. Gen. James Lukeman said he replaced McNulty because he ""lost confidence in him as the commander of this battalion."" Capt. Kelby S. Breivogel, who commanded Company A, and Chief Warrant Officer-3 Douglas H. Derring, the battalion Marine infantry weapons officer, were also relieved of their duties. They will be reassigned, the Marines said. The Marines were killed by an explosion during a mortar training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada on the night of March 18. Eight other people were injured. After the accident, the Marines discontinued use of the 60mm rounds and mortar tubes, but the Marines statement said a preliminary investigation determined the mortar system ""functioned properly"" at the site of the explosion. ""We have no reason to question the safety of the system when it is employed as designed and as Marines are trained to employ it,"" the press release said. The full investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing. The Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high desert training facilities for military units.

"Editor's Note: Matthew Continetti is the associate editor of The Weekly Standard. His book ""The Persecution of Sarah Palin"" is slated for publication by Penguin Sentinel in the spring of 2010. Sarah Palin's charisma is such that she doesn't need to hold an office to wield influence, Matthew Continetti says. (CNN) -- ""Everything changed on August 29 in politics in Alaska,"" Sarah Palin told NBC's Andrea Mitchell this week. The reference was to the day last year when John McCain announced that Palin, a 44-year-old mother of five who became Alaska's governor only in December 2006, would be his presidential running mate. McCain's surprise pick altered the trajectory of the 2008 campaign -- for a few weeks, at least -- and launched Palin, until then an unknown political neophyte, on the path to global celebrity. But it also set in motion a chain of events that, a little more than 10 months later, would culminate in Palin's surprise announcement that she would leave her office effective July 26. Before the day she joined the 2008 Republican presidential ticket, Alaskans saw Sarah Palin as a champion of ethics in government who had twice defeated oil interests, governed with Democrats in a bipartisan manner and brought down powerful members of her own party. She enjoyed record approval ratings, and her major initiatives had all been signed into law. But the good times didn't last. By the following July, Palin's approval numbers had sunk to the mid-50th percentile, the coalition on which she governed had collapsed, and most of her time was spent combating a hostile media and frivolous ethics complaints. What happened? The campaign. The reaction to Palin's nomination was as visceral as it was unhinged. Knowing almost nothing of the feisty hockey mom turned political dragon-slayer, some in the media turned rumors -- had Palin supported Patrick Buchanan? Had she been a member of the Alaska Independence Party? Did she believe that dinosaurs were around a couple thousand years ago? -- into established facts. Not content to examine Palin's actual record, the press did its best to transform the unconventional, pragmatic politician into a fire-breathing social conservative who was outside the American mainstream. Democratic partisans committed to Barack Obama's election demonized Palin until she became the emblem for everything liberals think is wrong with America. Comedians lampooned her accent, her looks, her religion, her education and her family. The same McCain aides who championed Palin for vice president later turned on her and leaked damaging (and false) information to a press eager for any tidbit confirming its view that the governor was unqualified and reckless. One lousy interview with Katie Couric didn't help. Something about Sarah Palin riles people up. After the McCain-Palin ticket lost the election and the governor returned to Alaska, the onslaught against her did not cease. The Democrats in the state legislature who once had been Palin's allies turned on her. Her opponents, continuing their never-ending search for dirt, inundated the governor's office with 150 Freedom of Information Act requests for documents relating to Palin's schedule and contacts. The Anchorage Daily News counts 18 ethics complaints filed against Palin. All of them have been dismissed, but at great cost to the state in man-hours and wasted resources. The Palin family's personal legal liability is around half a million dollars. Meanwhile, the father of her grandchild went on a publicity tour flacking ""intimate"" details about her family, and David Letterman joked on national television about Alex Rodriguez impregnating her underage daughter Willow. (He later apologized, saying he intended for the joke to be about Palin's 18-year-old daughter, Bristol. As if that would make it any more tasteful.) And McCain sources kept providing ridiculous insinuations about her to reporters (all on background, of course). Palin did nothing to deserve the acrimonious venom that has been flung at her non-stop since she first appeared onstage with McCain. The professional, emotional and financial toll on her has been incredible. Partisan agendas and personal animosities have left her with few friends and many opponents in Alaska. And so, last week, she did what she is used to doing. She shook up the playing field. On July 26, Palin will be a free woman. No longer will she have to juggle official responsibilities, a national political following and her children. She can travel freely to the Lower 48 without worrying about how it may affect her standing back home. She can defend herself and her family against slander without the controversy distracting from the duties of high office. She can make money to pay the bills. She can pick her battles without being hemmed in by the state legislature and bureaucracy. Palin is impulsive. Her charisma is such that she does not need to hold an office to command attention or wield influence. She resigned from the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission all of a sudden in 2004, plunged into a Republican gubernatorial primary in October 2005 and joined McCain's campaign without hesitation. Two of these three dizzying moves ended up in victory, and one did not. Two out of three isn't bad. Why shouldn't Palin think another gamble might pay off? Palin herself may not know her next move. Speculation about her presidential ambitions is premature, though it will be much easier for her to build a national organization now that she has no professional ties to Alaska. Whatever she does will be noticed, that's for sure. Because the attention lavished on Palin's decision is further evidence of her unwitting ability to bring out deep-seated feelings of admiration -- and loathing -- in people. We will be hearing from Palin, and from the Palin-haters, for a long while to come.","Palin's impulsive moves have yielded positive results in the past, Continetti says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles County sheriff's captain is under investigation, suspected of springing a prisoner from jail to get free tips on his golf swing. The lessons from Frank Carrillo, a convicted jewel thief with a reputation as an expert golfer, allegedly took place on a course on Catalina Island, where Carrillo was serving a sentence on charges of theft, including stealing during a golf match a World Series ring that belonged to former Dodgers catcher Jimmy Campanis and a Rolex watch. Acccording to a claim from sheriff's deputy William R. Cordero, Capt. Jeff Donahue ""illegally transported (inmate Frank) Carrillo to a local golf course where he was given golf lessons by Carrillo."" The claim says that the captain had ""Carrillo's prison yellow jumpsuit and wristband removed ... then had Carrillo outfitted in civilian golf clothes including a polo shirt and Docker pants."" In his claim against the County of Los Angeles, Cordero alleges he has been threatened, harassed, transferred and not promoted because he blew the whistle on the golf outing. The claim says Donahue told Cordero that L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca cleared the golfing excursion. ""Sheriff Baca did not condone any golf outing and would not ever,"" sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore told CNN. ""We take this very seriously. This is something we have been aware of and we are conducting an internal investigation to find out what exactly did or did not happen."" Donahue, who is part of the sheriff's force at Avalon that polices California's Catalina Island, is on medical leave. He did not immediately return a call to the station seeking comment. Documents show Carrillo was convicted in December of 2010 of three counts of grand theft, receiving stolen property and two counts of burglary.","Alleged lessons from a convicted jewel thief lead to an investigation .

"(CNN) -- For decades, fans of Oscar Wilde have paid tribute to the Irish writer by leaving kisses on his tomb at Paris's famed Pere Lachaise Cemetery. But years of greasy lipstick smears have badly damaged the memorial, a stone angel designed by modernist sculptor Jacob Epstein. Now the monument has been painstakingly cleaned and restored -- and surrounded by a glass barrier to protect it from the makeup-laden pecks of passers-by. The freshly renovated sculpture was unveiled -- on the 111th anniversary of Wilde's death -- by his grandson, Merlin Holland, and British actor Rupert Everett. Ireland's arts and heritage minister, Dinny McGinley, said the occasion was ""an opportunity to celebrate anew the life and works of one of Ireland's great modern writers, Oscar Wilde, who gave generously of his genius to the entire world."" Wilde, the dandyish author, poet and playwright, wrote ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" in London in the 1880s and 1890s. He moved to France in 1897, living there in self-imposed exile after serving a two-year hard labor prison sentence for gross indecency following a trial which scandalized Victorian society. ""His last few years were very sad,"" said Donald Mead, Chairman of the Oscar Wilde Society. ""But there is always the sense that he was able to rise above his misfortunes, to remain buoyant and happy. ""His letters say a lot about his lack of money, but they are also very entertaining, full of amusing anecdotes and stories. They paint a picture of someone who was down, but certainly not out -- though of course he was 'out' in the modern sense."" He died penniless in Paris on November 30, 1900, aged just 46, and was given a 'sixth class' burial outside the city. His remains were moved to Pere Lachaise years later. Epstein's sculpture for the site was unveiled in 1914, and has long been a site of pilgrimage for Wilde's fans. In the early 1960s, one visitor hacked off the angel's genitals, and the grave has been plagued by graffiti for many years. The graffiti was cleaned off in the 1990s when the tomb was listed as a historic monument, but despite a sign asking visitors not to deface it, the 'tributes' have continued, with ink giving way to lipstick. Experts fear that if the tradition continues, the sculpture may be damaged beyond repair. ""The grease base of the lipstick penetrates the stone and long after the coloring pigments have faded, a grease 'shadow' is still visible,"" Paris's Irish Cultural Centre said in a statement. ""The tomb is close to being irreparably damaged; each cleaning has degraded some of the stone surface and rendered it more porous and has subsequently necessitated a more drastic cleaning."" Mead said he hoped those who made the pilgrimage to the cemetery in future would pay tribute to Wilde in a less destructive manner. ""It has reached the point of no return really,"" he told CNN. ""There has been wanton vandalism, destruction.

"(CNN) -- It's getting a lot of chatter, but is it real? A new story about some New Jersey hospitals seeing a spike in births nine months after Superstorm Sandy has sparked talk that there just might be a post-Sandy baby boom. Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch is seeing a 35% jump, and two other hospitals are seeing 20% increases, a review by the Asbury Park Press found. It's the latest in a series of reports suggesting that when Mother Nature knocked out the power, some couples who were cooped up at home let nature take its course there, too. As CNN's Susan Candiotti reported in March, some doctors have been overwhelmed with business. ""It got to the point where we had to stop seeing new obstetrical patients to the practice,"" said Dr. Robert Rubino, who runs an OB/GYN practice in West Orange, New Jersey. ""We think we have a Sandy baby,"" Rubino's patient Meredith Swormstedt and her husband Hank told CNN. Stephanie Tych and Brian Boruch said the same. ""Well, there was no TV,"" Boruch said, blushing. Tych put it this way: ""We just got closer."" For these couples, there's no doubt that Sandy -- amid all its destruction -- led to something joyous. A study suggests some natural disasters lead to an increase in pregnancies -- not where the destruction is most severe, but in areas that are affected and remain livable. ""You may run out of power, but you're not running for your life. There's probably more opportunities for reproductive behavior,"" says Richard Evans, an assistant professor at Brigham Young University and author of the 2007 study ""The Fertility Effect of Catastrophe."" In 2009, CNN affiliate KPRC reported on some hospitals seeing an increase in births after Hurricane Ike. But some hospitals in the area struck by Sandy are not reporting any increase in birth rates nine months after the storm. Sandy still bringing down homes, but families vow to be back . New York City's Mount Sinai hasn't seen any such spike, Dr. Raymond Sandler, head of labor and delivery for the hospital, told CNN on Wednesday. The idea that people have more babies after natural disasters is ""just not documented,"" he says. ""I don't know why people are even saying it."" These days, most people plan when to have children, and don't suddenly change their minds in a storm, says Sandler, who has worked in obstetrics in New York for 40 years. And those who ""don't practice safe sex -- they're going to have babies whether the lights are out or not,"" he said. Snopes.com, the online myth debunking site, says the baby boom reports that inevitably follow nine months after crises ""typically prove to be nothing more than natural fluctuations in the birth rate,"" or, in many cases, no variation in the birth rate at all. Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit that provides information about population trends, has looked at birth rates for decades and never found clear evidence that a region has a baby boom nine months after a disaster. It's possible, but it's ""hard to pin down"" variations ""to a single event,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. When post-storm baby booms are reported, they're usually by individual hospitals, not broad regions, he said. So people in a small area may have stayed in and stayed busy, but they didn't represent a big swath of the population. Nine months after the New York City blackout in November 1965, The New York Times reported on a sharp increase in births. The report turned out to be inaccurate, which the Times itself later acknowledged. It will be some time before it can be determined whether Sandy caused an overall baby boom in the Northeast. Birth figures would need to be tallied and studied for numerous factors, particularly in areas that have been growing anyway. But for the couples CNN spoke with, what matters is the baby boom at home. Hank and Meredith Swormstedt told CNN they ruled out one name for their child pretty quickly: ""Not Sandy.""","Report suggests a baby boom 9 months after Superstorm Sandy at some N.J. hospitals .

"(CNN) -- An ancient race that lived 2,700 years ago in the Gobi Desert may have been among the first to use cannabis for medical or religious purposes. Researchers believe an ancient Gushi shaman may have consumed or burned pot for medical or religious purposes. Nearly two pounds of the plant was found stashed in the tomb of a Gushi shaman. It was high in the chemical compounds that provide its psychoactive properties. ""It had evidence of the chemical attributes of cannabis used as a drug,"" said Dr. Ethan Russo, an author of a study published in the Journal of Experimental Botany. ""It could have been for pain control. It could have been for other medicinal properties. It could have been used as an aid to divination."" The Gushi people were a Caucasian race with light hair and blue eyes who likely migrated thousands of years ago from the steppes of Russia to what is now China. A nomadic people, they were accomplished horsemen and archers. Chinese archaeologists excavating a network of 2,500 tombs near the town of Turpan in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region unearthed the shaman's grave, which contained the cannabis, along with a trove of artifacts such as bridles, archery equipment and a rare harp. The shaman is thought to have been about 45 years old when he died. Many of the bodies recovered in the area were found in an incredibly well-preserved, almost mummified condition. The shaman, however, was a skeleton. ""The deceased was laid out on the bottom of this tomb on a little bier,"" Russo said. ""This individual seemed to be very high status because of the variety and quality of the grave goods, including the equestrian equipment, the archery equipment and the large amount of cannabis."" Russo said no pipe for smoking the cannabis was found in the shaman's tomb. Researchers think he might have eaten the cannabis or possibly put it on a burning fire to create fumes. They don't think it was used to make hemp clothing or rope, as some other early cultures did. Genetic analysis of the plant suggests it was cultivated rather than gathered from the wild. This find is not the first or the oldest example of ancient people using cannabis, but it may be the best studied. ""There may have been older finds of cannabis, but not with this level of scientific investigation attached to them,"" Russo said.","About two pounds of potent cannabis found stashed in Gushi shaman's tomb .

"(CNN) -- The heads of both major political parties battled Sunday over the handling of Rep. Anthony Weiner's scandal, with the Republican Party boss accusing Democrats of inaction and the Democratic Party leader accusing Republicans of a ""double standard."" In a heated debate on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that ""for the first 10 days"" of the scandal, ""the only job (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's."" Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz fired back that Priebus' argument failed ""the straight-face test."" The debate came the same day that TMZ published photos of Weiner, in various states of undress, which he apparently took of himself in a locker room. TMZ reported that they were taken in the House members' gym and sent to at least one woman. Weiner's office declined to comment on the photos, and CNN could not confirm the details reported by TMZ. See photos at TMZ.com . After apologizing last week, Weiner said he had exchanged ""messages and photos of explicit nature with about six women in the last three years,"" communicating with them online and, occasionally, on the phone. Wasserman Schultz issued a statement Saturday calling for Weiner's resignation. Pelosi also called for him to step down Saturday. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer said Sunday that Weiner should consider resigning. ""I think that certainly he has to consider that option,"" Hoyer said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""I don't see how he can proceed and effectively represent his constituency."" In the interview on ""Meet the Press,"" Wasserman Schultz was asked why she called for Weiner's resignation at this point in the so-called ""sexting"" scandal. She said Democrats had been giving Weiner ""some breathing room to be able to be circumspect, do the right thing, make a decision, reach the conclusion that he needed to step back, and step down on his own."" When he had not done so by Saturday, ""it was important to weigh in,"" she said. Priebus said ""it's a question of leadership."" Weiner ""turned this town and this country into a three-ring circus,"" Priebus said. ""We've got leadership and a Democratic Party that are defending a guy that deserves no defense."" Wasserman Schultz said Priebus' argument ""doesn't pass the straight-face test from a chair of a party none of whose leaders called for Senator Vitter, who actually broke the law, to resign, who is still serving (in) office."" Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, admitted in 2007 to ""a very serious sin"" after he was linked to a prostitution scandal. Wasserman Schultz also cited former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, who had an extramarital affair with a staffer's wife and later resigned. ""You never called for his resignation, so it's a double standard and it's unacceptable,"" she said. When asked about those situations, Priebus responded he was ""not defending these guys,"" and turned the discussion to the economy and President Barack Obama's policies. Wasserman Schultz said she spoke briefly with Weiner. She described him as ""incredibly apologetic"" and ""devastated"" about the conduct he has been engaged in. Weiner's spokeswoman said Saturday that the congressman is seeking treatment ""to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person."" He will take a ""short leave of absence,"" Risa Heller said in a statement. Wasserman Schultz said a leave of absence is not enough. A party cannot force a lawmaker to leave, however. ""A member of Congress makes his own decision, and that's certainly going to be up to Anthony Weiner, but we have made it clear that he needs to resign,"" she said. Speaking to the media on Saturday, Weiner said he has ""made some serious mistakes and I'm trying to redeem myself,"" adding that his ""remarkable"" wife -- Huma Abedin, a senior aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- is doing well. A Democratic source familiar with conversations among Weiner and Democratic leadership said the congressman does not want to make a decision on his future in Congress until Abedin returns from a trip with Clinton in Africa. She is scheduled to return Thursday. Meanwhile, authorities in Delaware have closed an investigation into contact between Weiner and a teenager in the state. C.R. McLeod, spokesman for the New Castle County government, told CNN on Sunday that the police concluded their investigation Friday ""and at this point they won't have anything else to pursue unless further evidence comes to their attention."" In a statement Friday, New Castle County Police said detectives had ""conducted an interview with the teen and she has made no disclosure of criminal activity nor inappropriate contact by the congressman."" Weiner told reporters the contact involved ""nothing explicit, nothing indecent. Absolutely nothing inappropriate."" An attorney representing the teen's family said in a statement Sunday that the 17-year-old had Twitter contact with Weiner, and that the tweets ""were not salacious or in any manner inappropriate."" No photographs were ever sent to her, the statement said.","NEW: Anthony Weiner's office declines to comment on the photos published by TMZ .

"(CNN) -- The rise of Brazil as an economic force has brought with it a policy challenge familiar here in the United States: immigration. Recently crowned the world's sixth-largest economy, Brazil has become an immigration magnet, both to low-skilled workers --some of whom enter illegally -- and high-skilled workers looking for opportunities in the country's thriving sectors. Brazil historically has been welcoming to immigrants, but the challenge now is more pronounced as the government seeks to accept foreigners while protecting its hard-won prosperity. The country faces two simultaneous challenges: how to deal with recent illegal immigration, mostly from Haiti, and how to make it easier for highly educated immigrants to get work permits. A number of Brazilian ministries have either proposed or are deliberating policies as the country ushers in a new era of immigration. ""You cannot become the sixth economy in the world with impunity,"" Defense Minister Celso Amorim, a former foreign minister, said recently. Before, people left Brazil to chase a better life, he said. Now, the tide has turned. ""Naturally, we have to study how to act during this new situation. It's not just Haitians, but Brazilians who are returning. We have to try to exercise the same humanitarian spirit that's present in Haiti (where Brazil leads a U.N. mission), and in a manner that compatible with our means,"" Amorim said. In 2011 through September, Brazil processed 52,353 work permits to immigrants, a 32.8% increase over 2010. Brazil's needs and wants have created the situation where there are ideas to limit the entry of some immigrants and entice the entry of others. In recent decades in Brazil, the education levels of the population have increased significantly, said Ernesto Amaral, a demographer and professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In that period, an increase in the number of educated workers meant more competition for jobs and a negative impact on wages, he said. ""But this negative impact is decreasing because we have the demand for skilled labor in Brazil,"" he said. In other words, Brazil's boom has created an environment where the demand for high-skilled jobs is now outpacing the growth of Brazil's educated workforce. To meet this challenge, Brazil will have to ramp up its education efforts even more. ""Immigration is important in the short run. We need these workers in Brazil right now,"" he said. At the same time, an opposite effect is happening for low-skilled work, Amaral said. The percentage of low-educated Brazilians is decreasing, but the demand for low-skilled labor is decreasing faster, he said. Amaral summed up the way that Brazilians, usually welcoming to immigrants, see this development: ""We want to help these low-skilled people, but there is a limit."" Facing with illegal immigration from Haiti, Brazil's National Council on Immigration agreed this month to provide 1,200 work visas per year to Haitians affected by the 2010 earthquake who emigrate to Brazil. The work permits will be good for five years, a period during which the immigrants will find jobs and apply for extensions, or will return home. Unlike other work visas in Brazil, applicants need not have a job contract in hand when they arrive. Under the plan, those immigrants already in the country who entered illegally will be ""regularized."" Unlike the United States, where illegal entry by low-skilled workers is often viewed as a threat, Brazilians are extolling the positives such newly-legalized immigrants can bring. ""For example, the Haitians speak French and could be useful in the cities where the World Cup games will be held,"" Labor Minister Paulo Roberto dos Santos Pinto said. The country's justice secretary, Paulo Abrao, is another immigration cheerleader. ""Brazil can be an example to the world of an immigration policy that is open and democratic that reflects our historical welcoming tradition,"" he said on Twitter this week. He continued: ""Immigrants add cultural value to Brazil and collaborate in the development of the nation."" In addition to providing visas for the Haitians, the health department offered 1.3 million reais (U.S. $745,000) for healthcare for them. But pleasantries aside, Brazil has an economy to protect, and the work visas might signify a closing of a door rather than an opening. ""The attempt to grant visas is an attempt to limit and control the number that come, rather than being generous and open,"" said Albert Fishlow, professor emeritus at Columbia University and the author of ""Starting Over: Brazil Since 1985."" The approach toward immigration by Brazil and the United States isn't that different after all, he said. ""Both countries want to benefit from advances in technology and both countries want to attract people who are relatively skilled and have an opportunity to contribute to that,"" Fishlow said. As for low-skilled immigration, there are other forces raising opposition to their entry. The Haitian immigrants are arriving mostly to the western states of Amazonas and Acre, in the heart of the Amazon rain forest. A debate of great importance in Brazil currently is how to protect the Amazon. This is the larger issue behind the immigration debate, Fishlow said: will the Amazon be less protected with an influx of newcomers? Meanwhile, the country's Secretary of Strategic Affairs has created a team that will propose a new national immigration policy wit emphasis on high-skilled workers. One reported proposal would create two ""lines"" for foreigners applying for work visas in Brazil. One for highly-educated applicants, and one for everyone else. The coordinator for the project, Ricardo Paes de Barros, declined to speak to CNN about the commission's deliberations.","Brazil is experiencing an increase in immigration .
It's economy is attracting both low- and high-skilled labor .
The country has been open to immigration, but challenges remain ."
"(CNN) -- The leader of the hacking group LulzSec has been charged in connection with an attack on a government website in early April, Australian police officials said Wednesday. In a news release posted on their website, the Australian Federal Police said the man was a 24-year-old Internet technology professional from Point Clare, a suburb on the New South Wales coast, about 75 kilometers (46 miles) north of Sydney. He is charged with two counts of unauthorized modification of data and one count of unauthorized access to (or modification of) restricted data. The man faces up to 10 years for the first two charges and up to two years on the third charge. Police didn't release the man's name, but said he worked for a company that did work for government agencies. The release called him the ""self-proclaimed leader"" of the hacking group. ""The AFP believes the man's knowledge and skills presented a significant risk to the clients of the company for which he was employed had he continued his illegal online activities,"" the release stated. On June 2, 2011, LulzSec burst onto the cybersecurity scene with a splashy exploit: It published a trove of data stolen from 1 million user accounts on Sony's website. It followed the Sony hack with a string of high-profile feats, including crashing the CIA's website.

"(CNN) -- Monday is the second day of the year, which means millions of Americans have started new diets. They resolved to lose weight, get in shape, and they are starting strong. Sadly, the odds are that almost all of these resolutions will soon be broken and abandoned. Close to half of all dieters end up heavier than ever. Virtually none will lose weight permanently. The same is true for the country as a whole. Obesity has become the country's leading public health problem. Yet as we talk and talk about the issue, the country only becomes fatter and fatter. The problem for the country echoes the problem for individuals: Willpower is not enough. ""(It's a) basic instinct, even stronger than the sexual instinct, to store calories to survive the next period of starvation. And we live in an environment where there's food every half mile. It's tasty, cheap, convenient, and you can eat it with one hand."" Thus says Martijn Katan of the Institute of Health Sciences at VU University in Amsterdam, author of one of the many studies on the limits of dieting, quoted in U.S. News & World Report. If you as an individual want to change your weight, you must change your whole life. Likewise, to reduce obesity in modern society, we will have to alter the way society is organized. Weight gain is driven by two trends: increases in calories consumed and decrease in calories expended. Modern America induces both. For example: The after-inflation cost of sugary soda has declined by an estimated 48% over the past 20 years. Correspondingly, consumption of sugary soda has soared: Sugary soda is now the single most important source of calories in the American diet. For example again: The number of Americans who work at physically taxing jobs continues its steady decline. Even those jobs that demand physical labor -- manufacturing, for example -- are much less grueling than they used to be, as electrically powered machines do the lifting and shifting that used to consume human energy. While Americans expend fewer calories at work, they spend more time in cars -- almost twice as much as in the 1970s. They spend 26 hours per week consuming TV or online entertainment. Americans could theoretically compensate for more sedentary lifestyles by stepping up their recreational exercise -- but only about 20% of Americans bother. Some 80% never do -- including presumably all those failed dieters. Want to change this? It's no small project. It would involve the redesign of cities, the relocation of schools, the reinvention of our modes of eating and amusement. First lady Michelle Obama has made healthy eating her special project. Good for her, and let's hope her efforts lead to success. But if we are to succeed, we should understand: The campaign against obesity will have to look a lot less like the campaign against smoking (which involves just one decision, to smoke or not to smoke) and much more like the generation-long campaign against highway fatalities, which required the redesign of cars, the redesign of highways, and changes in personal behavior like seat-belt use and drunk driving. The good news is that the campaign against highway fatalities has yielded real progress: down two-thirds since the mid-1960s. The bad news is that, for most of us, it will take more than a New Year's resolution. However, if you are seriously resolved, congratulations -- and see you on the jogging path. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says Americans eat more, exercise less than in earlier generations .

"(CNN) -- Richard III is the king we British just can't seem to make our minds up about. The monarch who reigned from 1483 to 1485 became, a century later, the blackest villain of Shakespeare's history plays. The three most commonly known facts of his life are that he stole the crown, murdered his nephews and died wailing for a horse at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. His death ushered in the Tudor dynasty, so Richard often suffers the dual ignominy of being named the last ""medieval"" king of England -- in which medieval is not held to be a good thing. Like any black legend, much of it is slander. Richard did indeed usurp the crown and lose at Bosworth. He probably had his nephews killed, too; it is unknowable but overwhelmingly likely. Yet as his many supporters have been busy telling us since it was announced Monday that Richard's lost skeleton was found in a car park in Leicester, he wasn't all bad. In fact, he was for most of his life loyal and conscientious. To fill you in, a news conference held at the University of Leicester on Monday confirmed what archaeologists working there have suspected for months: that a skeleton removed from under a parking lot in the city center last fall was indeed the long-lost remains of Richard III. News: Richard III: Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? His official burial place -- under the floor of a church belonging to the monastic order of the Greyfriars -- had been lost during the dissolution of the monasteries that was carried out in the 1530s under Henry VIII. A legend grew up that the bones had been thrown in a river. Today, we know they were not. What do the bones tell us? Well, they show that Richard -- identified by mitochondrial DNA tests against a Canadian descendant of his sister, Anne of York -- was about 5-foot-8, suffered curvature of the spine and had delicate limbs. He had been buried roughly and unceremoniously in a shallow grave too small for him, beneath the choir of the church. He had died from a slicing blow to the back of the head sustained during battle and had suffered many other ""humiliation injuries"" after his death, including having a knife or dagger plunged into his hind parts. His hands may have been tied at his burial. Opinion: What will the finding of Richard III mean? In other words, we have quite a lot of either new or confirmed biographical information about Richard. He was not a hunchback, but he was spindly and warped. He died unhorsed. He was buried where it was said he was buried. He very likely was, as one source had said, carried roughly across a horse's back from the battlefield where he died to Leicester, stripped naked and abused all the way. All this is known today thanks to a superb piece of historical teamwork. The interdisciplinary team at Leicester that worked toward Monday's revelations deserves huge plaudits. From the desk-based research that pinpointed the spot to dig, to the digging itself, to the bone analysis, the DNA work and the genealogy that identified Richard's descendants, all of it is worthy of the highest praise. Hat-tips, too, to the Richard III Society, as well as Leicester's City Council, which pulled together to make the project happen and also to publicize the society and city so effectively. However, should anyone today tell you that Richard's skeleton somehow vindicates his historical reputation, you may tell them they are talking horsefeathers. News: Back from the grave, King Richard III gets rehab . Richard III got a rep for a reason. He usurped the crown from a 12-year old boy, who later died. This was his great crime, and there is no point denying it. It is true that before this crime, Richard was a conspicuously loyal lieutenant to the boy's father, his own brother, King Edward IV. It is also true that once he was king, Richard made a great effort to promote justice to the poor and needy, stabilize royal finances and contain public disorder. But this does not mitigate that he stole the crown, justifying it after the fact with the claim that his nephews were illegitimate. Likewise, it remains indisputably true that his usurpation threw English politics, painstakingly restored to some order in the 12 years before his crime, into a turmoil from which it did not fully recover for another two decades. So the discovery of Richard's bones is exciting. But it does not tell us anything to justify changing the current historical view of Richard: that the Tudor historians and propagandists, culminating with Shakespeare, may have exaggerated his physical deformities and the horrors of Richard's character, but he remains a criminal king whose actions wrought havoc on his realm. Unfortunately, we don't all want to hear that. Richard remains the only king with a society devoted to rehabilitating his name, and it is a trait of some ""Ricardians"" to refuse to acknowledge any criticism of their hero whatever. So despite today's discovery, we Brits are likely to remain split on Richard down the old lines: murdering, crook-backed, dissembling Shakespearean monster versus misunderstood, loyal, enlightened, slandered hero. Which is the truth? Somewhere in between. That's a classic historian's answer, isn't it? But it's also the truth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Jones.","Dan Jones: Richard III's remains found; some see chance to redeem his bad reputation .

"(CNN) -- Help me out. What's a word for feeling the pressure of a deadline but also pleasure in meeting it? I've got it -- plessure. Nowadays, it seems that a new portmanteau -- a word that is a combination of two words -- pops up every hour or so. You might have just met a frenemy for brunch -- a hybrid word going back decades -- where the two of you shared a cronut before distracting each other with a heated discussion of ""Sharknado."" Who knows? The discovery that you both experience spasms of affluenza could make for the beginning of a wonderful bromance. Chillax, I'm not about to go on a curmudgeonly rant denouncing hybrid words. On the contrary, perhaps they herald a new phase in American verbal creativity. Invented by French chef Dominique Ansel earlier this year, ""cronuts"" are a cross between croissants and doughnuts. In New York City, the pastry debuted in Ansel's Soho shop to big crowds. They were such a hit that a black market on Craigslist sprang up where one cronut can fetch as much as $40. ""Sharknado"" is a SyFy TV movie about -- you guessed it -- a tornado that tosses man-eating sharks out of the sea onto land. The hashtag #Sharknado took Twitter by storm. Apparently, the word inspired the movie. Is there a trend in the air? Familiar words are being reshuffled and transformed into dazzling new things. We throw old words into new configurations in a rush to keep up with our faster pace of life, the same way we throw on the clothes nearest to us, no matter how mismatched, if we have to rush out of the house. Maybe it has something to do with technology. The mind reels as it tries to keep up with all the scintillating gadgets and toys. BlackBerry and PCs seem so yesterday. Even IMs feel old compared to some of the newer chat programs. And now we have an explosion of apps where word play is child's play. Move over, Instagram and Pandora; make way for Snapchat, WhatsApp and NearMe. You have to wonder if there isn't a little bit of nostalgia in the portmanteau craze. It's as if we are saying to all the changes: ""Hold on! Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater!"" (Don't be a ... throwbaby?) Hybrid words come in many flavors. Some have an undertone of irony, and even cynicism, to them: anticipointment, Frankenfood, craptacular. Twenty years ago, genetically modified food was the stuff of science fiction; hence Frankenfood was born. The concepts behind ""craptacular"" and ""anticipointment"" -- the disappointment we feel after the anticipation aroused by hype has been deflated by reality -- are the product of jaded intelligences that see through the commercial artifice around them. There is something almost decadent, and a little bit Roman, about our rising tide of portmanteaus. In the 17th century, a concept like ""frenemy"" might have been coined by some caustic French writer with an epigrammatic wit. You might even say that a hybrid is an epigram manque. But, then, we are in a cultural phase now that seems more conceptual and visual. Words like ""cronuts"" or ""Sharknado"" conjure up hard-to-forget images. But will people remember them in 100 years? It depends on whether the words' meanings will still resonate with people. ""Sharknado"" will probably go the way of the movie it inspired, and cronut seems particularly well suited to NYC in 2013. But who knows? Cronuts could stay with us as long we eat them. Some words like metrosexual or screenager say a lot about the way we live. We've all felt at one time or another as if we've fallen through the looking glass into some strange new world, where what was familiar to us even five years ago has been turned on its head. It was, after all, Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty who first coined the word ""portmanteau"" and defined it: ""two meanings packed up into one word."" Unlike Mr. Dumpty, however, we are kept together by our hybrid words, or at least enabled to rearrange the broken pieces of our familiar experience into something we understand. Maybe the best thing about them is that, with their fusion of disparate words and ideas, they break down any notion of cultural purity. In the end, they capture the most humane promise of American life: the only way through is together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lee Siegel.","Lee Siegel: It seems that a new portmanteau -- a hybrid word -- pops up every hour .

"(CNN) -- Jerry Sandusky is a pedophile and was rightfully convicted, filmmaker John Ziegler said. Yet he came out in Sandusky's defense in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan late Monday, disparaging witness testimony that led to that conviction. The A.M. radio talk show host recently released controversial interviews he conducted with the former Penn State assistant coach. Sandusky will probably be incarcerated for the rest of his life for child sex abuse convictions, but he has had his say outside the prison walls in these recorded phone conversations, which Ziegler partially posted on the Internet. In the audio clips, Sandusky attempted to discredit an eyewitness in the case against him and downplayed what head coach Joe Paterno may have known about his activities. Paterno family: Freeh report 'factually wrong' It was harmless fun . Sandusky recalled in one anecdote trading swats with an undressed boy who was showering near him, but mentioned no sexual acts. He depicted it as mutual amusement for both the boy and him. ""He would get the last smack,"" Sandusky said, ""and then I would chase him, like, and I ran him into a wall ..."" Ziegler combined Sandusky's account with what he called evidence corroborating it. In this case, Sandusky did not recall the presence at the incident of a key witness who testified against him. ""I never saw Mike McQueary. I don't know if the young man saw him,"" Sandusky told Ziegler. McQueary, another former Penn State assistant coach, had testified during the trial that he walked in on Sandusky raping a child in the showers at a school facility. Sandusky scoffed at the testimony. ""I don't understand how anybody would have walked into that locker room from where he was and heard sounds associated that was sex going on,"" Sandusky told Ziegler with a laugh. Ziegler then held up a paper to Morgan, allegedly a statement from the victim in Sandusky's narrative, saying that nothing happened. McQueary was lying, the filmmaker suggested, because prosecutors encouraged him to. Still, Ziegler said he believes Sandusky committed abuse with the horseplay behavior he described. The conviction on actual sexual acts was a ""rush to judgment"" in Ziegler's eyes. During the trial, eight young men gave testimony about Sandusky groping them in a car, soaping them in the shower and sexually assaulting them on a basement waterbed. 'The Sandusky 8' describe seduction, molestation and betrayal . Ziegler is fighting for JoePa . Ziegler, a native of Pennsylvania and a former Philadelphia sportscaster, is fighting in the name of Joe Paterno. ""Joe Paterno's dying wish was -- 'just find out what the truth was,'"" Ziegler insisted. ""No one has done that for Joe Paterno."" Talking with Sandusky was ""the only way to do that,"" he said. Sandusky, who refused to take the stand in his own case, spoke eagerly to him for three and a half hours, according to Ziegler. Paterno's family has objected to the recording's release. ""The Paterno family would prefer to remain silent on this matter,"" the family's attorney, Wick Sollers, said in a written statement, ""but they feel it is important to make it clear that they had no role in obtaining or releasing this recording. Moreover, they believe that any attempt to use this recording as a defense of Joe Paterno is misguided and inappropriate."" The family advised the public to inform themselves via the website Paterno.com and reports from official legal and law enforcement sources. But on their website, they have defended the iconic late head coach's reputation, saying the allegations that he knew of the danger Sandusky posed are overblown. Letters by Sandusky, wife blame everyone else . A man on a mission . Ziegler is passionate about his mission, and he has confidence in his opinion. Those appear to be defining qualities, whenever he tackles an issue. He fights for the reputation of Sarah Palin and is a decided Tiger Woods fan. He goes after the Republican establishment for being too liberal or serving their own pocketbooks, and at times opts publicly against Republicans, preferring Libertarian alternatives. He regularly lambasts the media. His list of favorite topics can be found on his website. The sex abuse scandal has tarnished the Penn State sports program's celebrated reputation and wiped out part of the impressive record racked up by the Nittany Lions under Paterno from the annals of football history. Last July, the NCAA fined Penn State University $60 million. It also stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late head coach. The university demolished a memorial statue depicting Paterno in a visionary pose leading a past team to victory. Paterno died on January 22, 2012, of cancer while the wounds to his legacy were still bleeding. Ziegler asserts that the Penn State football legend, who made a deep mark on the American sport for over six decades, did not cover up for his abusive former assistant coach. In his documentary project, titled ""The Framing of Joe Paterno,"" he is working hard to acquit 'JoePa."" ""Jerry Sandusky had his day in court. Joe Paterno never did,"" Ziegler said. ""This is all about Joe Paterno's alleged culpability, which I don't believe the facts back up. I think he was railroaded."" During his at times heated appearance on Piers Morgan, Ziegler accused Morgan of having defamed Paterno on his show. Morgan asked him to calm down. Ziegler partly blames the media for Paterno's fall. He asked Sandusky what he thought his late boss knew about him. ""If he absolutely thought I was (a pedophile), I'd say no,"" Sandusky said. ""If he had a suspicion, I don't know the answer to that."" Who the interview hurt . Penn State, which has alleged that Paterno knew what danger Sandosky posed, joined Paterno's family in objecting to the release of Ziegler's interview. ""Jerry Sandusky's statements today continue to open wounds for his victims, and the victims of child sexual abuse everywhere. We have tremendous respect for the men who came forward to tell their stories publicly,"" said Penn State spokesman David La Torre. The statement from the Paterno family's attorney echoed that sentiment. ""The release of the audio recording of Jerry Sandusky is a sad and unfortunate development,"" Sollers said. ""... Releasing a recording at this time, nearly a year after he was found guilty on 45 counts, is transparently self-serving and yet another insult to the victims and anyone who cares about the truth in this tragic story."" Sandusky was sentenced in October to 30 to 60 years in prison for abusing 10 boys during a 15-year period. On February 21, he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence with the Pennsylvania Superior Court, according to court records.

"(CNN) -- To avoid getting caught with their pants down, Venezuelan officials say they will confront a toilet paper shortage by importing 50 million rolls to meet demand. Toilet paper is just one of the basic goods and foodstuffs that have been disappearing from store shelves over the past few months, as the government and private companies blame each other for the scarcity. Venezuelan Minister of Commerce Alejandro Fleming announced the toilet paper measure on Tuesday, the state-run AVN news agency reported. Repeating the government's stance, he blamed the media for provoking fear in consumers, who in turn begin hoarding items. ""There is no deficiency in production, but an excessive demand generating purchases by a nervous population because of a media campaign that has been created to undermine the country,"" Fleming said. ""We are going to saturate the market so that our people will calm down and understand that they should not let themselves be manipulated by the media that says there are shortages."" But Venezuelans say the shortages are very real, as staples such as rice and cooking oil are scarce. The lack of toilet paper is apparent in Caracas, where shoppers hurry to buy rolls and make long lines when the bathroom tissues are in stock. Venezuela's monthly demand for toilet paper is about 125 million rolls a month, Fleming said. The government also casts blame on private companies, who they accuse of hoarding their products in hopes of selling it later at a higher price. But businesses and the political opposition say government policies, including price controls on basic goods and tight restrictions on foreign currency, are to blame. The regulation discourage production, and many producers can't break even with the price controls, they say. Other hygiene products, such as tooth paste and soap, might also be imported in bulk to meet demand, Fleming said. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Venezuela is facing a shortage of a number of basic goods .

"(CNN) -- An old meatpacking plant on Chicago's South Side is being transformed into an eco farm, which its founders says will produce food sustainably, while creating zero waste. American entrepreneur John Edel is the founder of ""The Plant,"" a vertical-farm initiative that he hopes will show people the ease of adapting to green food production in urban living environments. A vertical farm is an urban agriculture concept whereby food is grown in and on top of buildings in city areas. In order for this process to work, urban farmers use a variety of techniques, including hydroponics -- cultivating plants in water -- and aquaponics, which uses by-products from fish farming to assist hydroponic growth. With the world's population surpassing seven billion people and the rapid pace of urbanization, finding space to grow food is becoming an increasing challenge -- one that Edel and his team of volunteers at The Plant are rising to. Watch: A farm on every roof top . In 2010 Edel began repurposing the meatpacking plant and two years on it has opened its doors to both the public, and business opportunities. Edel says of The Plant's ethos: ""It started out minimal (waste) because that's how I've always operated ... Using as little resource as possible to do things. At a certain point I realized if we built an anaerobic digester, we could get our waste down to zero."" The Plant's anaerobic digester uses bacteria to break down organic waste into biogas -- comprised of methane and carbon dioxide -- and material that can be used as fertilizer. A ""combined heat and power system"" will convert the methane into energy, which Edel says will take The Plant completely off grid and allow it to produce large quantities of food with zero waste output. Despite still being under construction The Plant currently has five tenants, including aquaponic farms, a hydroponic farm, bakers, tilapia fish breeders, a mushroom garden and a kombucha tea brewer (a type of tea said to have health benefits). Their products are sold to local restaurants, cafes and markets, as well as used to produce more food within the farm itself. Read more: Futuristic farm shop grows food in synthetic veg patch . Recycling is also a big part of the inner workings of The Plant and tenants work with each other to use their waste output in their food production and farming techniques. For example, the tilapia fish produce ammonia-based waste, which is sent through a biofilter before the nitrates are fed to plants growing in hydroponic beds. The plants absorb the nitrates, cleaning the water, which is then returned to the fish in an example of a ""completed loop cycle."" Edel says: ""The key to this farm is the closing of loops: energy loops; resource loops; money loops -- by keeping jobs local. If you can close the loops, you can make things more sustainable."" Supported by $1.5 million in grant money from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, The Plant operates under a social-enterprise model, with a non-profit side and a for-profit side. It provides tours of the facility for interested members of the public and conduct lectures, outreach programs and demonstrations for the local community to show them how to grow food in various urban environments. Edel hopes to have the farm fully operational by 2014 and says that the facility will create 125 new local jobs.","John Edel is building a zero waste veritcal farm on Chicago's South Side .

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space -- the date was April 12, 1961. Twenty years later on April 12, astronauts John Young and Robert Crippen got on board the space shuttle Columbia, a craft that looked more like a plane that a rocket ship. It launched an entirely new era in space flight. Now, on the anniversary of those two historic events, NASA is scheduled to announce where the retiring orbiters Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis will call home. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden will make the announcement Tuesday during a ceremony at the Kennedy Space Center commemorating that first flight of Columbia on April 12, 1981. NASA officials say the orbiter Atlantis, being readied for the final shuttle flight this summer, will be the backdrop for the announcement. Hundreds of center workers are expected to attend -- many of them will likely lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends. Because the announcement is being made at Kennedy, the speculation is that the visitor center here will be awarded one of the shuttles. It is one of more than 20 locations around the country with collective fingers crossed. The drama mirrors the bidding to host an Olympic games. In Texas, home of the Johnson Space Center, members of that state's delegation publicly lobbied for a shuttle. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, said during a news conference, ""No city in the world deserves an orbiter more than Houston, Texas."" Besides Florida and Texas, the Museum of Flight in Seattle wants one. In fact, one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed is already up. The museum's president, Doug King, says museum officials don't have any inside information. ""I think that confident may be too strong a word. I think that hopeful is probably a better one,"" he says. Facilities in Chicago, New York, Dayton, Ohio, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, also all want one. Landing an orbiter will be huge. The Kennedy visitor center estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year. The economic impact to the area is estimated at $15 million. At New York's Intrepid Museum, Executive Director Susan Marenoff told CNN, ""Figure over 300,000 people additional to the Intrepid, to New York City. Couple that with $106 million in economic benefit, we think that's a pretty good deal."" Rep. Giffords plans to attend husband's shuttle launch . A good deal, Marenoff says because the winning locations have to fork over $28.8 million to NASA for the vehicles. They also must guarantee a climate-controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle. That's still a bargain, officials at the bidding locations say, because of return on investment as one of only three locations in the world that will have a shuttle that flew in space. One of the orbiters -- Discovery, the oldest -- is already believed to be spoken for. The overwhelming odds are it's heading to the Smithsonian. The Enterprise, a test shuttle, which never flew into space, is there now. It would be awarded, at a discounted price, to one of the locations that does not get either Endeavour or Atlantis. The announcement of the winning locations will make one thing crystal clear: the space shuttle program is coming to a close. The winged lifting bodies launched satellites, built a space station, launched and repaired a telescope. Now, they become museum pieces.","Several sites are vying to be the final homes of the retiring space shuttles .

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- The fate of a former Army intelligence analyst accused in the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history is now in the hands of a military judge. Closing arguments in the court martial of Bradley Manning, accused of handing over hundreds of thousands of documents on the Iraq War and other issues to WikiLeaks, wrapped up on Friday. ""While the U.S. government showed trust in Manning, he was trusting in WikiLeaks,"" chief prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said in rebuttal comments that followed the defense summation. Manning, among other counts, is charged with aiding the enemy, which carries a potential life prison sentence. He has pleaded guilty to nearly a dozen lesser charges that carry a sentence of up to 20 years behind bars. Judge Col. Denise Lind will render a verdict. Lead defense attorney David Coombs guessed that a decision was possible next Tuesday or Wednesday at the earliest. In closing arguments, Coombs said prosecutors ""cherry picked"" information and took statements ""out of context"" in alleging Manning'[s crimes. In addition to a Iraq War combat video and documents, Manning is accused of downloading and transmitting information about detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and diplomatic cables, officials said. Fein said on Thursday in the courtroom at Fort Meade, Maryland, that Manning was not interested in obeying the oaths and non-disclosure agreements he swore to before going to Iraq. He also indicated during his summation that Manning did all of it knowing that enemies of the United States, including al Qaeda, would be able to access the information. ""Manning had no allegiance to the United States,"" Fein said, adding that he was ""not a whistle blower; he was a traitor."" But Coombs said the government failed to make a convincing case. ""The evidence is circumstantial. The government failed to prove actual knowledge"" that the information he leaked would get to the enemy, he said. Manning has said previously that he passed on information that ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him but he didn't give WikiLeaks anything he thought would harm the United States if it were made public. WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information. Coombs on Friday made several points in trying to upend the prosecution arguments. The defense showed the Iraq War video that is at the heart of the case. The video was shot from a U.S. Apache helicopter as it attacked a group of people in Baghdad in 2007. A Reuters TV news cameraman and his driver were among a dozen people killed. Manning, 25, has said the video and the behavior of the Americans involved bothered him to the point where he uploaded the images to WikiLeaks. ""Did they all deserve to die? That is what PFC Manning is seeing when he watches this,"" Coombs said. Coombs said Manning told Adrian Lamo, a former computer hacker who tipped federal authorities to Manning's activities and testified for the prosecution, that he believed the leaks would ""disclose true casualty figures in Iraq"" and it was ""important that the information got out."" Coombs also pointed to a photo that was shown several times in court on Thursday. Prosecutors depicted a smiling Manning in a cross-dressing image as proof he was proud of the crimes he is accused of committing. But Coombs said Manning, who is gay, was happy because the picture showed a situation in which Manning could ""be himself."" Manning has attracted a number of supporters who claim he is a whistle blower. On Friday, Lind barred a member of the media for allegedly posting threatening messages regarding some court-martial participants. Details were sealed. Earlier in the day, military officials removed the man's belongings from the media center. He was wearing a ""Support Bradley Manning"" shirt when he arrived at court.","NEW: Military Judge Col.

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- Floating 245 miles over the Earth Tuesday, NASA engineers Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan tethered themselves to the International Space Station and paused to absorb the view. ""My goodness, Mike, look down ... absolutely breathtaking,"" Garan said as they floated over the Yucatan Peninsula. ""Welcome back to our other office."" The last spacewalk of the shuttle era began about 40 minutes behind schedule. Veteran astronaut Stephen Bowen was speaking to the engineers from Houston's Johnson Space Center during the walk, which was scheduled to last just over six hours. The excursion was Fossum's seventh spacewalk and Garan's fourth, according to a NASA statement. Fossum and Garan had been at the International Space Station for several weeks before the crew from Atlantis arrived Monday on the last shuttle flight of the 30-year-old program. Members of the Atlantis crew helped choreograph the spacewalk from inside the space station, but only Fossum and Garan ventured outside. While on the spacewalk, the engineers were expected to recover a broken pump and stow it in the shuttle's cargo bay. They also planned to retrieve an experiment from the bay and mount it outside the space station before deploying another experiment, according to NASA. On Monday, the crews learned they are not in danger from an orbiting piece of debris, the space agency said. The agency had been tracking a piece of the COSMOS 375 satellite, saying it could come close to the station.  But NASA said Mission Control verified that the debris will pass a safe distance from the station and shuttle. The scrap is one of more than 500,000 pieces of debris tracked in Earth's orbit, according to NASA. The space agency also announced Monday that Atlantis would stay in space one day more than originally planned. The shuttle, which was scheduled to land July 20, will now make what NASA called a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center at 5:56 a.m. July 21. Atlantis lifted off Friday on NASA's final space shuttle mission. The first shuttle, Columbia, blasted off in April 1981. Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to International Space Station Alpha, a football field-sized construction project in orbit. In 134 missions, the five space shuttles have ferried 355 astronauts into space. When Atlantis lands, it will leave the United States with no way to lift humans into space for the first time in decades.  NASA will rely on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Engineers Mike Fossum and Ronald Garan begin excursion .

"(CNN) -- Ahead of their meetings in Mexico City this week, President Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto hinted that they wanted to put economic ties atop their agenda. But reports that Mexico is restructuring the way it cooperates with American officials on security matters -- in essence restricting communication -- threaten to impose a shadow over the positive economic story the leaders want to tell. The apparent friction highlights the critical security relationship and illustrates the complexities of U.S.-Mexico relations. ""We spend so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner, responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border,"" Obama said this week. But writing a new narrative on U.S.-Mexico relations that doesn't lead with Mexico as a major transit point for narcotics, or the United States as a market hungry for the drugs, isn't easy. That was made clear by the spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border about changes to how Mexico cooperates with the Americans. Under the new rules, all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong confirmed to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. It is a drastic change from recent years, when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts. So in the days leading up to Obama's arrival in the Mexican capital, the buzz was not about the economy, but whether Mexico was being uncooperative with the United States. Osorio Chong downplayed the idea that the change signified a retreat in security cooperation. The United States ""should have the confidence that things are on a good path,"" he told Notimex. In a conference call with reporters, Obama administration official Ben Rhodes said it was natural that Peña Nieto, who has been in office for only five months, would want to revisit its security structure. ""We're currently working with the Mexicans to evaluate the means by which we cooperate, the means by which we provide assistance, and we're certainly open to discussing with Mexico ways to improve and enhance cooperation, streamline the provision of assistance,"" said Rhodes, who is the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. ""Our goal is not to have a certain amount of presence in terms of security efforts in Mexico; it's to cooperate with the Mexicans so that we can meet the interests of both our countries."" But analysts say impact of the changes should not be underestimated. U.S. officials who had built rapport and personal relationships with Mexican counterparts now have an obstacle to their communication, said George Grayson, an expert on Mexican security issues and professor of government at the College of William & Mary. ""The door is not wide-open like it used to be,"" he said. There is a lot to boast of on the economic front, but security will likely remain a key part of how U.S.-Mexico relations will be judged. Among U.S. officials, there is an unspoken concern about whether Peña Nieto will merely give lip service to the the idea of security cooperation or whether he will provide real substance, said David Shirk, former director of the Trans-Border Institute in San Diego. ""I've talked to many people at very high levels that have expressed these concerns,"" Shirk said. ""There is a kind of wait-and-see attitude. I think U.S. ofificals want to give Peña Nieto the benefit of the doubt."" What is clear is that Peña Nieto rejects the ""kingpin"" strategy of his predecessor, Felipe Calderon, who made the capture of cartel leaders the centerpiece of his security plan. A number of high-ranking drug cartel leaders were killed or captured during Calderon's term, but the results usually backfired -- new leaders rose in their place, rival cartels fought for the leftovers and a high level of violence persisted. Peña Nieto has talked about focusing on violence reduction, and engaging in educational, social and economic reforms. But this broad vision has not yet produced a defined security strategy. ""The question is, what (do) you replace the kingpin strategy with?"" Grayson said. The changes to protocols between U.S. and Mexican officials are likely part of the process to figure that out, but one that could rankle the United States, said Tony Payan, a Mexico expert and fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. The previous strategy of identifying kingpins and going after them suited the United States, which has the tools and capabilities to aid in those operations, Payan said. A more hands-off approach may not go over well. ""Clearly, there is disagreement on how to approach this issue,"" he said. When Obama and Peña Nieto speak publicly together on Thursday and Friday, their economies will be the easy things to talk about, Payan said. Half a billion dollars in trade is indeed something to brag about, and is a storyline that has been overlooked too often. Obama and Peña Nieto are expected to trumpet these achievements to the press. ""I think the ugly part of the conversation (about security) will be in private,"" Payan said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Presidents Obama and Peña Nieto want to focus on economy .
But the security issue always looms large .
Recent news about changes to security cooperation raises concerns ."
"(CNN) -- The fiery crash that Jenelle Embrey witnessed last year prompted her to become a leading critic of the Jeep Cherokee's safety record. The car driving behind her was rear-ended by a truck on a highway near Winchester, Virginia, in October. The 1998 Jeep Cherokee crumpled like an accordion when a tractor-trailer hit it at more than 60 mph. All three occupants were alive after the impact, Embrey says. But two of them died in the subsequent fire. ""The whole thing had gone up in flames,"" she said. ""And we watched those people burn to death."" Desperate to help, her father, Harry Hamilton, ran to the Jeep and broke the windows with his bare hands. Chrysler recall controversy: What's next . He pulled Zackary Santor out alive. But Heather Santor, his mother, could not be saved. Nor could the other young passenger, Acoye Breckenridge. ""He was hollering and screaming and waving his hands,"" Hamilton recalled. ""And his head -- the back of his head was burning."" Hamilton says the wreck was a searing experience. ""It was days before I could sleep over 10 minutes of time,"" he said. But were these tragic fatalities in any way related to the Jeep's design? Or were they simply the unfortunate outcome of an unsurvivable crash? Chrysler Group, which owns Jeep, says that the model of the Grand Cherokee meets safety standards. Embrey says the people would not have died if the fuel tank of the Jeep Cherokee was not so far back toward the rear of the vehicle. ""They can take another vehicle and run into the back of that vehicle up to 70 miles an hour, and it doesn't catch fire,"" she said, ""because there isn't a gas tank right there."" But Chrysler Group sees it differently. The company says statistics show that Jeep models such as the Cherokee are no worse or better in rear-end crashes than similar vehicles by other makers from that period. ""The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee meets and exceeds all applicable federal safety standards,"" the company says in a statement, ""including the stringent requirements of the applicable FMVSS 301 -- the standard by which a vehicle's fuel system design is evaluated in the U.S. -- and has an excellent safety record over many registered vehicle years."" Embrey has mounted a personal campaign against the Jeep design. Her online petition has drawn more than 100,000 signatures, and she has spent thousands of dollars of her own money to buy billboards criticizing the company. But Chrysler maintains that the root cause of the Winchester fatalities was the crash impact. ""This tragedy was the result of a violent, high energy crash caused by a distracted tractor-trailer truck driver who rammed into the back of the 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee at highway speed,"" it says. In a rare rebuff, Chrysler Group has refused a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration request for a recall of 2.7 million SUVs. The government agency says the gas tank design used in 1993 to 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees and 2002 to 2007 Jeep Libertys is unsafe. Chrysler says that the design of the gas tank is commonly accepted in many other vehicles. It's the first time since 1996 that an automaker has fully challenged a recall demand from the safety agency. CNN's David Gracey contributed to this report.","Jenelle Embrey says the fiery crash occurred because of the placement of the fuel tank .

"(CNN) -- An ambulance that rushed former South African President Nelson Mandela to hospital two weeks ago broke down on the way there, but the anti-apartheid icon's health was not compromised, a government spokesman said Saturday. Mandela has been hospitalized in serious but stable condition in Pretoria since June 8 for a recurring lung infection. ""When the ambulance experienced engine problems, it was decided that it would be best to transfer to another military ambulance which itself was accompanied for the rest of the journey by a civilian ambulance,"" spokesman Mac Maharaj said. South Africa's first black president gets round-the-clock care, and his house is retrofitted with medical equipment that mirrors that of an intensive care unit. The military ambulance he used at the time is fully-equipped and includes intensive care specialists and nurses, and two quick response vehicles, according to the spokesman. ""All care was taken to ensure that the former President Mandela's medical condition was not compromised by the unforeseen incident,"" Maharaj said. Mandela, 94, has become increasingly frail over the years and has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010. Despite his rare public appearances, news of his ailment sparks concerns worldwide. ""I think the concern, the anxiety shown by people throughout the world and South Africa is perfectly understandable,"" Maharaj said this month. ""The most important thing is that we should realize that this is a life that we need to celebrate, even when he's with us. And we will celebrate it, even when he is not with us."" Mandela has been in and out of hospital in recent years. His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during the apartheid era, and he has battled respiratory infections over the years. Last year, he spent the Christmas holidays undergoing treatment for a lung infection and gallstones, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting against apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation. In 1993, Mandela and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. The iconic leader was elected the nation's first black president a year later, serving only one term, as he had promised. Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Last year, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. Mandela's impact extends far beyond South African borders. After he left office, he mediated conflicts from Africa to the Middle East. He turns 95 next month.

"(CNN) -- Two days after a massive fertilizer plant explosion leveled parts of a central Texas town, killing 14 people and displacing many more, residents moved into recovery mode Friday after investigators announced they had nearly finished search and rescue efforts. The fiery explosion ripped through the heart of West, a close-knit town about 75 miles south of Dallas and about 20 miles north of Waco. Before Wednesday, West was known as the home of Scott Podsednik of the Boston Red Sox and as the ""Czech heritage capital of Texas,"" boasting the best kolache in the state. ""It's going to be a long recovery for this community,"" Gov. Rick Perry said. The death toll included the city secretary, who was also a member of the volunteer fire department, said Mayor Tommy Muska. The victim was the only person with the password to the city's Facebook account, Muska said, preventing others from posting updates about the incident. In total, five West firefighters died battling the blaze, along with one Dallas firefighter and four emergency responders, the State Firemen's and Fire Marshals' Association of Texas said Thursday. ""It's devastating. I've been a member of the firefighters for 26 years,"" Muska said. ""These guys are my friends."" The explosion tore through the roof of West Fertilizer Co., charring much of the structure and sending massive flames into the air. Muska rushed to the scene to assist in crowd control about 1.5 blocks from the plant. The explosion, which registered as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake, blew his hat off, he said. It also destroyed his home, he said, making him one of many in the small town of 2,800 to be displaced in the blast's aftermath. Many, including him, are staying in hotels or with friends, he said. The destruction made it hard to account for exactly how many people had been displaced, McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said Friday. He estimated that 99% of people originally thought to be missing had been accounted for. Felton and Muska joined Perry in thanking volunteers from across the state who came to assist in cleanup. They also expressed gratitude for donations of food and clothes, but said they were running out of places to store them and asked that people instead donate money through the Red Cross and Salvation Army. ""We've hit the saturation point on receiving stuff, clothes, food, those kind of things, and we're running out of places to put it,"" Felton said. It's still unclear what caused the blast, which Brad Smith felt in his home 50 miles away. ""We didn't know exactly what it was,"" Smith said. ""The forecast said a line of thunderstorms was going to come through. My wife and I looked up and wondered, 'Did it get here six hours early?' "" Local authorities are still working with federal officials, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to determine the cause of the deadly explosion, Perry said. It's unclear whether the plant had safety problems. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency fined the company that ran the fertilizer plant $2,300 and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. Seven years ago, the company had a complaint against it for a lingering smell of ammonia, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality website shows. The blast came as the nation remained on edge after the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday that killed three and left about 180 injured. It happened two days before Friday's 20th anniversary of a fire in Waco that ended a federal agents' siege against members of the Branch Davidian sect. More than 80 sect members and some federal agents died. What's clear, though, is the blast stunned residents of this town and left behind a trail of charred devastation. Perry surveyed the scene from a helicopter and on the ground. ""We are blessed we didn't lose more people than we actually did,"" he said. CNN's Elizabeth Landau, Greg Botelho, Josh Levs and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Two more fatalities have been identified, bringing number of dead to 14 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A dancer-choreographer has filed a claim against Michael Jackson's estate related to alleged child sex abuse by the late pop icon. Wade Robson, now 30, denied in testimony at Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005 that he had been molested by the singer. Two months after Jackson's death in 2009, Robson said they had ""a wonderful relationship"" and he called Jackson ""a kind human being."" The lawyer for Jackson's estate called the new accusations ""outrageous and pathetic."" The details of the allegation are sealed by the Los Angeles probate court where Robson's lawyer filed the claim last week, according to a court document obtained Tuesday by CNN. The deadline has long passed for creditors to file claims against Jackson's estate, but Robson is asking the probate court to allow him to file a late creditor's claim. The sealed documents include an affidavit from Dr. David Arredondo, a San Francisco-based child psychiatrist, the filing said. Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005, partly based on the testimony of Robson, his sister and his mother. ""It's absurd,"" said Tom Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in the trial. ""He was one of the strongest witnesses for the defense at Michael Jackson's criminal trial in 2005. He was adamant under oath that he had never been molested at any time."" A housekeeper at Jackson's Neverland Ranch testified that she saw Jackson showering naked with Robson during a visit in the early 1990s, but he denied it at the trial. ""He withstood very aggressive cross-examination by the prosecutor,"" Mesereau told CNN Tuesday. ""He stood his ground and never wavered in saying Michael Jackson had done absolutely nothing improper to him."" Robson met Jackson in his native Australia when he was just 5. Jackson invited him for frequent stays at Neverland after Robson and his family moved to Los Angeles two years later. Their visits continued until he was 13, according to court testimony. Robson paid tribute to Jackson In an interview with ""Entertainment Tonight"" to promote his choreography work on the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2009. ""I just had a wonderful relationship,"" he said. ""I learned so much from him, as an artist and as a kind human being, and it's my goal to just try and continue as much as I can in my own little world that legacy."" ""We talk so much about him as the pop legend, which is important, but it's nice to remember that he was a man, that he was a father,"" Robson said. ""And that's what it's really about is a father and his children, and he was a wonderful dad."" The 2005 trial in Santa Barbara County, California, centered on charges that Jackson had molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor who often visited his ranch. He was also charged with plying the boy with alcohol, and conspiring to abduct, extort and falsely imprison the child and his family. He was acquitted on all counts. ""I've known Michael for a long time. I've spent many hours talking to him about everything. I trust him. I trust him with my children,"" Joy Robson, the mother of Wade Robson, testified when called as a prosecution witness. Robson said she let Wade, who was then 7, and daughter Chantal sleep in Jackson's bedroom from the first visit. ""Mr. Robson's claim is outrageous and pathetic,"" Jackson estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said in a prepared statement. ""This is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate to him or with him. Now, nearly four years after Michael has passed this sad and less than credible claim has been made. We are confident that the court will see this for what it is."" Mesereau said it was ""suspicious timing"" for the claim to be filed at the start of the trial of the Michael Jackson wrongful death case, in which Jackson's mother and children are suing concert promoter AEG Live. AEG Live lawyers have said they would bring up the child molestation charges against Jackson as part of their defense. Coincidentally, Robson is artistic director for singer Demi Lovato's tour, which is being promoted by AEG Live, according to his website. When asked about it Wednesday, AEG Live attorney Marvin Putman denied there was any connection between the sex abuse accusation and the current trial.

"(CNN) -- It seems like everybody loves a good scandal except the people involved in it. How must it feel to be Jill Kelley right now? Talking heads, journalists and the Chatty Cathys everywhere are telling stories about her and how she might be tied to the downfall of America's top spy, David Petraeus. National security secrets could be at stake, though no one has offered proof of a breach. Jill Kelley, honorary consul . She's kept quiet, yet details of her personal life are quickly leaking out. Reports don't reveal much except that she's a socialite who threw charity events for the military community in Tampa where she lives with her oncologist husband and three kids. Her hometown newspaper in Philadelphia trotted out some basic biography: Kelley's parents immigrated to the United States from Lebanon in the 1970s and once ran a restaurant in New Jersey. She has a twin sister. A picture of Kelley walking out of her home wearing a smart canary yellow dress and carrying a hot pink handbag has led stories on major news outlets with headlines such as Family: Scandal will 'brand' Jill Kelley 'for life' and Jill Kelley: Five Facts About the Petraeus Affair's Mystery Woman. It all sounds so salacious. And some of it is very harsh. A senior official close to another military superstar ensnared in the controversy -- the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen -- called Kelley a ""bored, rich socialite involved with every single senior commander"" because she did unpaid work as a military ""honorary ambassador."" Allen has his own role in this controversy. More on him later. What is known, beyond all the speculation and whispered excitement, is what the FBI has said, according to U.S. officials: Last summer, Kelley went to a friend who worked at the agency's Tampa branch because she was receiving allegedly ""jealous"" e-mails from an unknown person. That person is now believed to be Paula Broadwell, a woman with whom Petraeus was having an affair. Petraeus, who has acknowledged his relationship with Broadwell, is a married father of two who many regarded as one of the finest military commanders in recent U.S. history. Petraeus pillow talk: 'A spy agency's worst nightmare' Before the scandal broke, Broadwell said in numerous interviews to plug her book about him, titled ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,"" that she spent hours with Petraeus in Afghanistan. The two bonded on long runs together, she said. Critics have described Broadwell's biography as gushing. The Daily Show's Jon Stewart joked about whether her book made Petraeus look ""awesome or incredibly awesome."" Now ""All In"" is being parsed for double entendres. FBI investigators, whose investigation began with Kelley's complaint, eventually found explicit e-mail exchanges between Petraeus and Broadwell that revealed the affair. Petraeus resigned as CIA chief on Friday, writing to CIA staff that he'd acted in ways ""unacceptable both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours."" What we know so far . Cue the insatiable news media and its endless news cycle. By Monday, FBI agents had searched Broadwell's tony home in Charlotte, North Carolina, telling CNN they were looking for any documents sensitive to national security. Back in Tampa, Kelley called 911 on November 11 complaining that a man she didn't know was on her property and told police that she is an ""honorary consul general,"" which meant she has ""inviolability."" Listen to Kelley's 911 calls . ""So they should not be able to cross my property,"" she told the 911 operator. ""I don't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well ..."" Kelley called police at least five times concerning people in and around her home, Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy told CNN. Reporters are outside the residence. Kelley appears to be a volunteer who helped to welcome international visitors to Tampa but had no official job with the U.S. government or the State Department, CNN learned Wednesday. Top military brass have been guests at the Kelley home, but it's unclear if Allen or Petraeus were aware of the Kelleys' financial difficulties or the unusual background of a charity they founded. Public records show that in April of 2010, about six years after the Kelleys purchased their $1.5 million home, Regions Bank filed to foreclose on the property, saying the couple hadn't made a mortgage payment since September 2009. The Kelley family faced at least nine lawsuits involving money, according to public records, including large unpaid credit card bills of more than $320,000. The records also say the Kelleys founded a cancer research charity in 2005 called the Doctor Kelley Cancer Foundation. But in a telling 2008 federal tax return, the Kelleys' charity reported that it spent the exact same amount of money as it raised -- $157,000. The charity's money paid for parties, transportation, legal bills and other administrative costs. There is no evidence any of the money was used for cancer research or caring for cancer patients. Asked for the Kelleys' side of the story, a source close to the family told CNN the source didn't have enough information to respond. For its part, the U.S. Central Command released a statement saying that Kelley has ""no official position with U.S. Central Command. She is a volunteer and a private citizen, not an employee; because of this, and because there is an ongoing investigation, we have no additional information to provide."" Kelley and her husband, Scott, haven't talked to reporters. Earlier they released two sentences: . ""We and our family have been friends with General Petraeus and his family for over five years. We respect his and his family's privacy and want the same for us and our three children."" More glimpses at the Kelleys come from a gossip column in 2010 in the Tampa Bay Times. It describes Petraeus and his wife arriving in a 28-cop motorcade to a pirate-themed party under a white tent on Jill and Scott Kelley's front lawn. High-profile partiers munched lamb and crab cakes. Petraeus wore a tan baseball hat and an outfit that looked more suited for mall speed-walking than black-tie waltzing. Holly Petraeus, to whom he's been married for more than 37 years, posed for a photo with Kelley and her twin sister, Natalie Khawam. Photos: Who's who in the Petraeus scandal . Kelley was dedicated to helping host parties that benefited the military, local event planner Linda Baldwin told the Tampa Bay Times. ""Jill was such an awesome client,"" said Baldwin, the owner of Events by Amore, which catered the pirate party Petraeus attended. Kelley ""did so much for the military, fabulous mother and amazing wife; can't say enough nice things about her. She never spared anything for the military. It was all about them."" Karyn Anjali is a longtime social and celebrity columnist for Tampa area high society magazine Panache Vue. She said she frequents many military functions as well as the celebrity affairs in the area. She told CNN she'd never heard of Kelley. ""I have no idea who she is. I have handled all the major events in this town for a long time now, and I am a little surprised I don't know her,"" Anjali said. ""A lot of us go to the same places, the same restaurants for lunch, the same parties, the same functions. I myself am quite well-known, and I do not know her."" So far the only member of Kelley's family who has spoken to reporters is her brother David Khawam. ""My sister got anonymous e-mails,"" he told CNN affiliate KYW Philadelphia. ""Because of her stature and her position, she was scared. She filed a complaint with the local authorities, and that trickled down to everything that's going on right now."" Kelley is a ""dedicated mother, a dedicated wife,"" her brother added. After that initial interview with the affiliate, Khawam refused to talk further and referred all media inquiries to Judy Smith, Washington's top scandal spinner who is said to have inspired the new television drama ""Scandal."" Jill Kelley has retained Smith and top Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell, famous for representing clients such as disgraced former Sen. John Edwards and ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Widening scandal focuses on 'flirtatious' e-mails . Regardless of who is talking, the scandal involving Kelley is growing by the hour. The Pentagon said Tuesday that the investigation surrounding Petraeus and Broadwell has expanded to include Allen. Allen replaced Petraeus after he left that post to lead the CIA. According to U.S. officials, the FBI has looked at between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of documents â€” most of them e-mails â€” and have found ""potentially inappropriate"" correspondence between Kelley and Allen. Some of the e-mails between Allen and Kelley might be described as ""flirtatious,"" according to a defense official who was cleared to speak to the media. However, the official told CNN that flirtatious could mean anything from ""Hey, you look good in that dress the other night"" to something more serious. ""There was no security information exchanged. There was nothing hateful in the messages,"" the official said. ""It was not threatening."" The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex .

"(CNN) -- America's image of New Yorkers combines swagger, style and an unwillingness to get pushed around. Humphrey Bogart once warned a Nazi commander in ""Casablanca"" that ""there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade."" Seventy years ago, movie audiences would have laughed in appreciation of the city's toughness. Today, however, Rick Blaine would hardly recognize the place. Mayor Michael Bloomberg hit the panic button over soft drinks this week, proposing a citywide ban on any serving of sugary-sweet soda more than 16 ounces in restaurants, movie theaters and street carts. Bloomberg claims that he needs to have the cops throw themselves between consumers and liquid refreshment to save citizens from themselves and prevent obesity. Big Gulp, meet Big Brother. Overheard on CNN.com: Doughnut lovers' lament, washed down with a giant soda . This is just the latest intervention staged by Hizzoner. His past decrees banned smoking, not just indoors in places of business, but also outside of businesses and in parks. Bloomberg also banned restaurants from cooking with artificial trans fats. In those cases, he took a lot of criticism as being a health hysteric and a food nanny, but at least an argument existed that consumer choice might have been irrelevant. Restaurants don't usually advertise all of their ingredients on the menu, for instance, and few people get asked permission before someone lights a cigarette in the doorway of an establishment. Soft drinks: Public enemy No. 1 in obesity fight? In this case, though, no such argument exists. People purchase the volume of beverage they desire, and in almost every case, plenty of choice exists for smaller quantities. The outcome of barring the sale of anything larger than 16 ounces of Coca-Cola or Pepsi at the ballpark will be that more containers will get thrown out as people just buy more units, and that waste will have to be disposed of later. Consumers will pay more and have more inconvenience in purchasing what they want to drink, and will still end up drinking the same amount anyway. Is drinking soda really that bad for you? The new restrictions make little sense for most other venues. Fast-food restaurants have customer-accessible fountains in most cases for in-store dining. Few people buy the large size, and many of these restaurants no longer bother with size at all for those sales, sticking with one standard size. Will Bloomberg start regulating how many refills each customer gets, too? For that matter, many traditional restaurants offer free refills on soft drinks, too. If Bloomberg caps those, what happens when customers just buy another soft-drink order? Will the restaurant be forced to stop serving root beer far more quickly than they stop serving beer? A soda per day may raise heart-attack risk . Nor do the drink categories make sense, either. Bloomberg's order won't apply to alcoholic beverages, even though many of those are loaded with calories, especially beers and ales, or to dairy-based drinks. As Reason's Jacob Sullum points out, that means that while New Yorkers will no longer be able to ingest 240 calories drinking a 20-ounce Coke, they will still have no trouble buying a 24-ounce, 520-calorie double-chocolatey frappucino at Starbucks, or a 20-ounce, 800-calorie milkshake. Now, some of those choices may be better than others, although it's hard to argue that the dietary value of milk justifies ingesting an 800-calorie drink as opposed to the 240-calorie cola. But more to the point, that's a decision that free people should be able to make on their own. New Yorkers shouldn't have to ask Bloomberg, ""Mayor, may I?"" when selecting an otherwise-legal and nonlethal beverage. Eatocracy: How I kicked my Coke habit . Bloomberg justifies his nanny-state interventions by pointing to the social costs of obesity, but there is no direct causal link between obesity and 20-ounce sodas with sugar in them, and neither would it be anyone's business at all except for the increasing government control and subsidies for health care. Bloomberg's insistence on dictating consumer choices has a more direct connection to an assumption that government should control our access to health care than obesity has to a couple of Big Gulps. Perhaps it's time for New Yorkers to put their mayor on a power diet, and to wise up about the real trade-offs between expanding safety-net programs and personal choice. Soft drinks won't be the last of the usual suspects that Mayor May I will round up in his crusade to dictate his choices and eliminate everyone else's. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Morrissey.","Ed Morrissey: New York mayor's proposal to ban soda size servings is wrong .
He says it makes no sense: What's to stop people from drinking too much soda?
He calls Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal a nanny-state rule .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago Sharon Twitchell was miserable. Sharon Twitchell lost 110 pounds and went from wearing a size 22 to a size 2 in 10 months. Carrying 227 pounds on her tiny 5'2"" frame, the 51-year-old mother and wife could barely squeeze into her plus-size clothing.  Twitchell is the first of eight CNN.com I-Reporters who shared their weight loss stories with CNN. They revealed their secrets and reflected on the defining moments that motivated them to lose a combined total of 1,167 pounds and how the weight loss has changed their lives.  ""I was wearing a size 22 and getting my clothes at stores where the biggest size was a 24. I asked myself, 'Where are you going to buy your clothes after you get bigger than a size 24?'"" said Twitchell. Adding to her misery, Twitchell says her ballooning weight was also wreaking havoc on her 31-year marriage. ""We were literally just co-existing together, like roommates,"" recalled Twitchell. ""Friends asked my husband to e-mail them a picture of us. Later, I discovered that he had sent them an old photograph taken when I was much smaller. Even though he loved me, he was embarrassed at how much weight I had gained."" Afraid she would have to purchase clothing from online stores catering to larger women, Twitchell told her husband she'd had enough and was ready to make a change. Initially, Twitchell made an appointment with her physician in hopes that he would write her a prescription for a pill to help her lose weight. Instead, she says she saw the ""w"" begin to form on his lips and knew he was going to recommend she try Weight Watchers. Uncomfortable with the thought of going to actual meetings, Twitchell lost 30 pounds on her own and eventually joined the online Weight Watchers POINTS program on October 26, 2004. She also bought an elliptical machine and a recumbent bicycle and started working out six days a week. The pounds melted off. Ten months and another 80 pounds later, she reached her goal weight on August 26, 2005. Twitchell says she hasn't been this size since before her first daughter was born. She now weighs 117 pounds and wears a size 2 or 4, depending on the store. How has this changed her life? ""I have a marriage again,"" says Twitchell, who recently retired and relocated with her husband from New Jersey to their new home in the mountains of western North Carolina. ""When I finally reached my goal (weight), my wedding ring was two sizes too big. I had already had it resized twice and the jeweler was hesitant that I might lose more weight. Rather than resize it, my husband bought me a new beautiful diamond ring and when he gave it to me he said this was a renewal of our wedding vows,"" she recalled. Twitchell says her husband keeps telling people that he's got his wife back. This August, the couple will celebrate their 33rd wedding anniversary and they couldn't be happier. ""If I can lose 110 pounds, anyone can,"" says Twitchell.  iReport.com: Have you lost weight? Share your story, photos and video.

"(CNN) -- With the first round of voting over, Egypt's ruling Freedom and Justice Party declared Sunday that citizens had given their thumbs-up to a controversial draft constitution. But a coalition of 123 local rights groups that monitored the Saturday referendum alleged widespread abuses. And the nation's electoral commission acknowledged that it received -- and will investigate -- complaints of voter intimidation, bribery and other violations. The commission said it would not announce official results until after second phase of voting December 22. But that didn't stop President Mohamed Morsy's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) from claiming that 56.6% of the ballots were in favor of the draft; while 43.5% rejected it. Read more: Egyptians vote on controversial constitution . The big turnout in Alexandria -- Egypt's second most populous city and a stronghold of conservative Muslims -- appears to have made a big difference in tilting the preliminary results towards a 'yes' vote, party members said. ""The democratic process in this first phase of this referendum ... stresses the people's desire to reach political and constitutional stability, despite all the unjust and harsh smear campaigns,"" the party statement said. ""The process took place in an atmosphere full of integrity, transparency, and under full judicial supervision as well as presence of local and international media and human rights groups."" Ten of the nation's 27 provinces voted in the referendum Saturday. The remaining provinces will hold their referendum in the second round. ""There were cases of voter intimidation, delaying the voting process, and early closure of some voting centers with no clear reasons,"" the Egyptian Coalition for Monitoring Elections said in a statement late Saturday. The government-funded National Council for Human Rights backed up some claims of minor violations, including early closure of voting stations. A rocky road to referendum . The path to the referendum has been marred by violent incidents on both sides as well as extensive institutional and political power struggles. President Morsy and his allies have rushed the document to a popular vote. Sentiments about the national charter have been split down the same political lines of those who support the president and those who oppose him and have been equally as heated. Those opposed to it feel it contains subtle wording that limits rights and gives too much political power to religious figures and institutions. Many in the opposition called earlier for a boycott of the referendum, but most swung around to urging citizens to turn out and vote ""no."" Liberal opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei -- better known globally than in his native Egypt due to his former role as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- is one of them. ""Is holding the referendum under improper judicial supervision, clear lack of security, and violations the road to stability? or is it playing with the nation's fate? Responsibility comes with Governance,"" he tweeted late Saturday. Supporters of the draft constitution herald what they say is its protection of personal rights, especially its provisions on handling of detainees in the judicial system, which made capricious use of its powers under deposed autocratic president Hosni Mubarak. Hassan el-Shafie, a senior cleric and member of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the constitution, called opposition to the document ""purely political,"" saying the highest Islamic institution in the land ""has made it ultimately clear that the country must be a modern democratic nation."" International rights group Human Rights Watch says the draft constitution ""protects some rights but undermines others."" It ""fails to end military trials of civilians or to protect freedom of expression and religion,"" it said in a statement. Egypt's Christian leaders have neither come out for or against the constitution, but instead encouraged believers to vote their own conscience. Read more: Egypt and the Middle East's struggle for rule of law . A controversial edict . The rocky road to the referendum began when judges threatened to shut down the assembly tasked with drafting the constitution. President Morsy then issued an edict in late November declaring all of his past and present decisions immune from judicial review until the holding of the constitutional referendum. He also sacked the head of the judiciary. The judicial system has many in its ranks who are loyal to former autocratic President Hosni Mubarak. The Islamist president's opposition saw the exceptional move as a grab for dictatorial powers and poured into the streets, converting Tahrir Square in central Cairo back into the center of public discontent it had been during the uprising that brought down Mubarak. The president has since dropped his provocative decree going forward, but the situation has remained tense, and violence has continued. Morsy's Islamist allies rushed the drafting of the constitution to completion, which some saw as a tactic to allow him to drop his controversial edict more quickly. Others feared it to be another grab for power. Non-Islamist assembly members quit the process, which served to increase suspicion against the Islamists. The outcome of the election and the unrest associated with it are important to the stability of volatile North Africa and the Middle East -- where Egypt is a key player -- and the situation is being watched closely around the world.

"Bab al-Salama, Syria (CNN) -- It's raining on the camp, and water is seeping into the unheated tents. Women use long brooms to try to sweep muddy water out from in between their shelters. They stack up foam sleeping pads and roll up blankets, in a vain attempt to keep them from getting soaked. When artillery rumbles in the distance, the camp's residents don't even flinch. Like so many of the other children here, 9-year-old Mohammed Hoot is wandering around the camp, bored. To keep his head dry, Mohammed wears an oversized leather jacket over his head. Inside a pair of plastic sandals, his feet are bare, unprotected from the puddles and plummeting temperatures. ""We've been living here for a month ... it's too small, it's not big enough for us,"" the surprisingly vocal little boy says, pointing at the tent where he and nine other family members sleep at night. Hoot's family fled fighting in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, like many of the more than 6,000 people living in this rain-soaked camp, erected in a border customs compound on the Syrian side of the border with Turkey. ""We want to enter Turkey ... they are not letting us in,"" says Hoot. Photos: Life inside refugee camp | Refugees face brutal winter . The Turkish government says it no longer has room to house displaced Syrians in the 14 refugee camps it is currently operating on Turkish soil. Unsafe in Syria, unwanted in Turkey, these people are living in limbo. They are but a fraction of the legions of Syrians made homeless by the war. According to the United Nations' admittedly conservative estimates, the conflict has pushed close to two million Syrians out of their homes. In other words, roughly one in 10 Syrians is now living on the run. The U.N. says some 1.2 million Syrians are displaced inside Syria. Meanwhile, more than half a million Syrians have registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees after fleeing across borders. And there are more coming every day. ""Since the beginning of November, the number of registered refugees region-wide has risen by about 3,200 a day,"" the UNHCR announced this week. More: Refugee figures only part of the crisis . Agency officials estimate there are hundreds of thousands of additional Syrian refugees who have not registered with local authorities in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, because they are surviving off of their savings or the hospitality of friends and relatives. But after more than 20 months of conflict, there are signs that resources for wealthier refugees are running out. ""A lot of the increase is from people who are in neighboring countries but they've run out of everything,"" said Ron Redmond, a UNHCR spokesman in Beirut. ""Some of them have already been displaced internally for weeks and months moving from place to place and they are now coming out. And some of them are in a weakened state and the cold weather is certainly a danger to them, especially the children,"" Redmond added. ""And these are people who lived a good life at one time. They had nice homes, they had good apartments, they had cars."" As Syrian refugees go, Ali Moraly knows he is one of the luckier ones. After he ran away from Syria three months ago, Moraly had enough money and connections to rent a small one-room apartment in Istanbul, where he practices his violin daily. More: Inside Syria's underground TV channel . ""I feel so much ashamed of myself, being in a warm place and having my violin with me and playing music while people have to stand in long queues in order to have something to eat,"" he says. Insecurity and a feeling of hopelessness drove him to pack his bags and leave his home and parents in Damascus, possibly forever. ""I used to practice the violin while hearing gunshots just go by my window,"" Moraly recalls. Now, this 32-year-old violinist -- who used to perform at the Damascus Opera House -- is one of the faceless millions of Syrians now living on the run. ""The moment when you know that this time, if you just pack and leave, you might not be able to decide the time when you come back ... that itself is a very painful experience,"" Moraly says. More: Rebels say endgame in sight . The exiled musician tries remain optimistic about the conflict that is ravaging his homeland. ""If this is a part of a process which will make my country more free and a more promising nation that will have tolerance and social fairness and equality, then this the price that we have to pay,"" he explains. Moraly's future is uncertain. He does not know where he will be living several months from now, and he has no idea when he will be reunited with his sister, who fled with her husband and children to the U.S., or with his parents, who remain in Damascus. Like so many others, Moraly focuses on the present, unable to plan for the future. ""We don't think about the future any more, all we are waiting for is the toppling of the regime,"" says Adham Ismail, a 24-year-old resident of the camp in Bab al Salama.

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old accused in a high school shooting that left three dead in Ohio pleaded not guilty Friday, and his bail was set at $1 million. T.J. Lane was indicted in the shooting deaths of three classmates at Chardon High School. A judge ruled last month that he could be tried as an adult. Lane sat quietly during Friday's brief proceedings, answering a few questions from Geauga County Judge Forrest Burt. Lane's attorneys said they reserved the right to enter a later plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Authorities allege that on February 27, Lane walked up to a table at the high school cafeteria and started firing. ""He was silent the entire time,"" said Nate Mueller, who was a few feet away from the gunman. ""There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire."" A teacher identified as Frank Hall helped chase the gunman out of the school. Police arrested Lane a short time later. When the violence ended, six students had been shot, and in the following days, three died: Daniel Parmertor, 16; Demetrius Hewlin, 16; and Russell King Jr., 17. Finding 'new normal' after school shooting . Days after the attack, prosecutor David Joyce said Lane admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into school that morning and firing 10 rounds, choosing his victims randomly. Joyce said that in the months since the bloodshed, he has met with the families of the victims on a constant basis. ""Their child was murdered,"" he said. ""Justice for them would be to see Mr. Lane detained for an extended period of time."" Though Lane could be tried as an adult, federal law prohibits capital punishment for anyone under the age of 18. ""Obviously, he can't be put to death as a juvenile, but he can certainly be sentenced to life without parole,"" Joyce said. ""That's up to a jury to decide."" Lane was indicted on six charges: three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and felonious assault. Burt ordered Lane to a juvenile detention center until June 18, when he will be transferred to the Geauga County Jail.","NEW: Attorneys say they might enter plea of not guilty by reason of insanity .

"(CNN) -- Riding a bicycle around the city at night can be a perilous pastime with traditional bike lights providing a rather dim reminder of a cyclist's presence on the roads. But a new prototype light system called Revolights could soon make life in the cycle lane a good deal safer and leave bike enthusiasts beaming. The wheel-mounted LED lights not only provide greater illumination of the rider's path, say its San Francisco-based creators, but also make a bike far more visible from the front, back and the side. When stationary, as their promotional video shows, the lights flash in a simple sequence. But as soon as you start peddling they form a solid arc of white and red light. This dazzling effect is created with the aid of a magnet (attached to the fork) and an algorithm. Together, they measure the wheel speed and tell the lights when and where to flash. The system is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery housed in the wheel hub. Revolights' founders -- inventor Kent Frankovich, Adam Pettler and Jim Houk -- are using the online fundraising platform Kickstarter in a bid to turn their eye-catching patent pending prototype into a finished product. Backers pledging $200 or more will receive the finalized design prior to its public release which is scheduled to take place in spring 2012.","New Revolights prototype makes cyclists more visible from front, rear and sides .

"(CNN) -- The world's super-rich had between $21 trillion and $32 trillion of wealth hidden in tax havens by the end of 2010, a new study says. The size of these unreported financial assets is equivalent to, or even larger than, the combined GDPs of the United States and Japan, representing up to $280 billion in lost tax revenues. The study, titled ""The Price of Offshore Revisited,"" was released Sunday by the advocacy group Tax Justice Network. Written by James Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey & Co., the study drew data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and central banks. The number of the global elite who parked their fortune overseas is fewer than 10 million people, or 0.14% of the global population, the report says. It also shows that major private banks such as UBS, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and HSBC handled the most assets on behalf of the super-rich. According to the group's 2011 Financial Security Index, which ranks nations and territories providing tax havens, Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and Singapore are among the biggest destinations. In a statement, Henry, senior adviser of the Tax Justice Network, said that ""it turns out that this offshore sector --- which specializes in tax dodging -- is basically designed and operated, not by shady no-name banks ... but by the world's largest private banks, law firms and accounting firms, headquartered in First World capitals like London, New York and Geneva."" The report also calculates capital flight from 139 developing countries between 1970s and 2010. Of the top 20 developing countries that lost tax revenue overseas, China ranks first, with nearly $1.2 trillion siphoned offshore by 2010. Russia and South Korea follow, with $798 billion and $779 billion missing respectively. ""Since most of missing financial wealth belongs to a tiny elite, the impact is staggering,"" Henry said. ""For most countries, global financial inequality is not only much greater than we suspected, but it has been growing much faster."" The Tax Justice Network says the estimated offshore fortune is conservative, adding it excludes non-financial assets such as real estate, yachts and artworks.","Global super-rich had at least $21 trillion of wealth in tax havens, a new study says .

"(CNN) -- The FBI said Monday night that a Tennessee mother and her 14-year-old daughter are dead, though the man they believe abducted them -- along with two other daughters -- remains at large. Authorities previously reported that they had found two bodies Friday at a Guntown, Mississippi, residence tied to the kidnapping suspect, Adam Mayes. But it was not until Monday that the Shelby County, Tennessee, medical examiner positively identified the pair as Jo Ann Bain, 31, and her daughter Adrienne Bain, according to the FBI. Mayes is considered armed and dangerous, with authorities asking for the public's help in tracking down him and the two other girls, 12-year-old Alexandria Bain and 8-year-old Kyliyah Bain, whom he also allegedly abducted. Authorities established contact with and tried to interview the 35-year-old Mayes soon after the mother and her three daughters were reported missing on April 27 by Jo Ann's husband from Whiteville, a western Tennessee town of 4,600 people, but then he fled, Joel Siskovic, the spokesman for the FBI bureau in Memphis, Tennessee, told CNN affiliate WPTY. He was last seen May 1 in Guntown, the same northern Mississippi town where the bodies were found. Details haven't been released as to how or exactly when they died. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation late last week issued an Amber Alert asking for the public's help in finding the Bain sisters and for information leading to Mayes' arrest. Aaron T. Ford, special agent in charge at the FBI's Memphis bureau, told CNN on Sunday that investigators believe all the kidnapping victims ""were transported across state lines into Mississippi."" Local, state and federal law enforcement's focus is now in Union County, Mississippi, where Guntown is located, the FBI agent said. Authorities have also pointed out, however, that Mayes has connections to Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida and could be en route to Arizona. Mayes may be using the alias of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass, his Facebook profile name, the FBI said Monday. Rick Foster, whose wife was a lifelong friend of Jo Ann Bain and whose daughter was a classmate of Adrienne Bain, recently told CNN that Mayes had been a friend of the Bain family for years. Mayes lived about 90 miles away in Mississippi, Foster said, but would stay with the Bains when he was in the Whiteville area. He described Mayes as ""a big kid in a grown man's body."" Mary Patterson, Mayes' landlord in Alpine, Mississippi, told WPTY that she thought he was a ""kind"" and ""fun guy."" ""If somebody told me this, I would have never believed it,"" she said. Authorities characterize Mayes as a white man who has blue eyes and brown hair, weighs about 175 pounds and stands 6-foot-3. He recently cut his own hair and may have done the same to the three children, according to the Amber Alert. As for the Bains, Foster described the marriage between Jo Ann and her husband, Gary, as ""perfect"" and said the family had planned to move to Arizona once the school year ends. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Mayes' arrest and to the missing girls. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Jo Ann Bain and her daughter Adrienne were found dead in Mississippi, the FBI says .

"(CNN) -- It might look like science fiction but the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) hopes to turn this humanoid robot into a seafaring fact in an effort to improve firefighting capabilities on board military vessels. Currently at the development stage, the Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot (or SAFFiR for short) is intended to combat fires in the cramped conditions of a ship, saving lives and costly equipment. Armed with cameras and a gas sensor, the battery-powered SAFFiR will be ""capable of activating fire suppressors"" and throwing ""propelled extinguishing agent technology (PEAT) grenades,"" says the NRL. Read more: Gorilla gene map gives evolution clues . Despite its decidedly flat-looking feet, the NRL says the robot will be a ""sure-footed sailor"" capable of ""walking, balancing and traversing obstacles"" autonomously. Furthermore, it will be able to interact with humans as part of a wider firefighting team. It is being developed in conjunction with researchers at Virginia Tech and the University of Pennsylvania, as a next step from Virginia Tech's CHARLI-L1 (Cognitive Humanoid Autonomous Robot with Learning Intelligence) robot. CHARLI-L1 is a five-foot tall humanoid robot built by students from the Virginia Tech College of Engineering's Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory. The NRL says SAFFiR will be tested on board the ex-USS Shadwell -- a decommissioned landing ship dock used for fire fighting experiments -- towards the end of 2013.","Robot being developed by U.S. Naval Research Laboratory will tackle fires on military vessels .

"(CNN) -- I recently became the proud owner of a bobblehead moose magnet. The jaunty little guy sports a Nova Scotia T-shirt, and while made in China, he reminds me of a lovely Canadian adventure lacking only in a real moose. Doug Lansky knows all about the draw of those touristy retail emporiums packed to the ceilings with tacky T-shirts and plastic bric-a-brac. He's the author of ""Crap Souvenirs: The Ultimate Kitsch Collection."" The book, released this month, features more than 150 tchotchke photos, some of which Lansky collected from travelers online. He's still collecting photos of these gems on his website crapsouvenirs.com. CNN asked Lansky to explain his terminology. He provided the following answers via e-mail: . What's a ""crap souvenir?"" For starters, I want to be clear that ""crap souvenir"" is just a snarky way to say ""awesomely kitsch."" These are a collection of entertaining souvenirs that are, you might say, so bad, they're good. It was hard to find a litmus test for tacky -- nearly all souvenirs possess an element of tackiness. (Finding kitsch-free souvenirs is a far more difficult task.) In the end, it was a gut reaction. I suppose I was looking for something that invoked an emotion that landed somewhere between a cringe and a laugh. Is the photo better than the vacation? What criteria did you consider for an ""awesomely kitsch"" or remarkably crappy souvenir? It was almost more difficult to define what was a souvenir. Sure, it's French for ""to remember,"" but that doesn't help the selection process much. Your first thought, like mine, might be that a souvenir is a memento you bring back from a trip. Seems reasonable, but consider the example of a German tourist who picks up an iPad while visiting New York's Apple Store. He might consider it a souvenir of his visit. And his device is a souvenir for him, but iPads in general aren't. So, Rule 1 is that it has to be a souvenir on its own standing. Rule 2: It should be an object on sale to the public. There may be a life-size polar bear in a cowboy hat and hula skirt standing in front of a tourist shop that makes for memorable souvenir photos, and one could argue that any item is for sale if you make the right offer, but if it isn't specifically there to be sold, it doesn't count. Travel Snapshots: Not-so-kitsch souvenirs . Rule 3 is a bit more complicated. It should be tied to a location. One way is simply to print the name of the town, city or country on it. But that would also qualify any random object that says ""Made in China."" So it has to be tied to a place in a way more substantial than being outsourced for production. In lieu of a printed location, the item might include national colors or depictions of a famous icon or be made of well-known items endemic to that locale. This was my working guideline. However, after all this reasoning, there were a few exceptions that were simply too deliciously kitsch to pass up. What's the tackiest souvenir you've ever come home with?

"(CNN) -- Never let it be said that Formula One driver Kimi Raikkonen is lacking in confidence. Although he managed to finish third last season, the Finn was still a whopping 74 points behind world champion Sebastian Vettel, but former world champion Raikkonen remains confident that Lotus can challenge the sport's elite in the coming season. ""It's clear from working with them that they are racers, and you can see in their history that they've won championships,"" the 33-year-old driver, who won the drivers' championship with Ferrari in 2007, told Lotus' official website as the team became the first to unveil its new 2013 car this week. The Finn made his return to F1 in 2012 after a two-year absence and propelled his Lotus car towards the front of the grid, grabbing a win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to finishing third in the drivers' championship. ""Nothing I saw last year made me think that another championship was impossible in the future,"" added Raikkonen. ""Of course, there is some pretty tough competition out there and everyone wants to win. ""The team have beaten everyone before and there's nothing to say they can't do it again."" Many observers were surprised to see Raikkonen, who spent time racing in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship during his two-year absence, return to F1 and enjoy immediate success despite being a veteran of 19 previous grands prix wins. But Raikkonen never lost doubt in his own ability as a driver. ""I knew I could still perform well in Formula 1 given the right opportunity,"" the Finn continued. ""It was only other people who had doubts. ""There will be a new car which we'll want to develop and get working at its best. There are always changes in the sport; some small, some big. Generally everything's pretty similar, and the feeling of racing on track is pretty familiar."" Raikkonen is entering the final year of his contract with the British-based team, but he is yet to sit down and discuss his future. ""I'm not really thinking beyond this season at the moment, but I'm sure there will be talk before the end of the year,"" said Raikkonen, who will turn 34 in October. ""I enjoyed my comeback to Formula One last year and there's no reason to say I shouldn't enjoy the 2013 season too. I know there will be big changes to the cars and regulations for 2014, so who's to say that won't be exciting.""

"(CNN) -- It was a day of records for Bayern Munich, but the German football club's mission is only one-third complete. Saturday's 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt gave the Bavarian side a record-extending 22nd title since the elite division was formed in 1963, and 23rd national championship overall. With six games still to play, it marked the earliest clinching of the title -- and made Bayern the first team of any of the major European leagues to be crowned this season. The club had previously twice triumphed with four games left, in 1973 and 2003. Jupp Heynckes, who is 68 next month, became the oldest coach to win the league in what will be his second and final season in charge in his third spell at the club. Former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola will take over at the end of this campaign, but before then Heynckes is hoping to complete an unprecedented treble of the German Cup and European Champions League -- and make amends for the disappointment of losing last year's final in Munich. ""The fact that we have won the title after 28 games is extraordinary, it's simply fantastic,"" Heynckes told reporters. ""One of the things FC Bayern have demonstrated this season is that we're a top side, but we have done it with harmony in the team. ""We can be confident we will achieve something in the Champions League."" Bayern already have one foot in the semifinals of Europe's top club competition, taking a 2-0 lead to Italy for Wednesday's second leg against Juventus. Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the only goal in Frankfurt to earn Bayern's 24th win in 28 league games this season, leaving the team 20 points clear of second-placed two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Bayern's David Alaba missed a 26th-minute penalty, hitting a post after midweek scorer Thomas Muller was fouled, but Schweinsteiger scored seven minutes after halftime with a backheel from Philipp Lahm's cross to dent the home side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. It was Bayern's 11th successive league victory since the winter break -- the first time a Bundesliga team has won so many in a row in one season. It also means Bayern will have led the Bundesliga from start to finish for the fifth time -- no other club has done it even once. Dortmund came from behind to win 4-2 at home to third-bottom Augsburg, with striker Julian Schieber scoring twice in a rare start as coach Jurgen Klopp rested key players ahead of Tuesday's Champions League home clash with Spanish club Malaga with the quarterfinal tie poised at 0-0. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropped six points behind Dortmund after being held 1-1 at home by Wolfsburg, while Schalke went three points above Frankfurt with a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Borussia Monchengladbach went seventh with a 1-0 win over Greuther Furth that left the visiting team rock bottom and nine points adrift in the battle to avoid automatic relegation. Hamburg's European hopes were hit by a 1-0 home defeat by Freiburg, which followed last weekend's 9-2 thrashing by Bayern. It moved Freiburg above Frankfurt into fifth place on goal difference.","Bayern Munich clinch German league title for a record-extending 23rd time .

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh lifted a two-year-old state of emergency on Wednesday, less than two weeks ahead of parliamentary elections. A girl with the national flag painted on her cheek marks Victory Day in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Tuesday. The order was issued Tuesday by President Iajuddin Ahmed, according to Shahenur Miah, a government spokesman. The announcement came on the 37th anniversary of the establishment of Bangladesh as a nation, known as Victory Day. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December 29. To stem a tide of political violence, a military-backed government took control in January 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency. It also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics. The caretaker government adopted emergency powers that allowed authorities to arrest a person without a court warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said. A wave of detentions followed. By some estimates, more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes. Among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians, including the leaders of two prominent political parties, Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP. Since the country's independence in 1971, the Awami League or the BNP has ruled Bangladesh for all but eight years. Both women have served as prime ministers at one point or another. The most recent crackdown took place in June when police detained or arrested more than 18,000 people in 11 days and came after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Parliamentary elections scheduled for December 29 .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- The family of Olympian Oscar Pistorius said Monday they are ""shaken"" by the ""graphic images"" leaked to the media last week that purportedly show the blood-spattered bathroom where the double amputee track star fatally shot his girlfriend in February. ""It has always been our plea that the legal process be allowed its run its course with integrity,"" the Pistorius family said in a statement. ""The leaking of evidential material into the public domain, before the court case, does not advance this process."" The statement comes a day before Pistorius is due to appear in court where prosecutors are expected to ask magistrates to postpone the case pending further investigations. Pistorius, 26, is charged with killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of February 14. The graphic photos of the crime scene were published by Sky News on Friday and show a trail of blood leading from a bathroom; blood on the walls, stairs and a couch inside the house, and a Valentine's Day card with ""Ozzy"" -- Steenkamp's nickname for Pistorius -- written on it. The photo of the bathroom shows a toilet covered in blood, a door with a missing panel and what appear to be two police-marked bullet holes below the level of the door's handle. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the photos, and police spokesman Brigadiere Phuti Setati declined to comment on how Sky News obtained the pictures. Pistorius, known as the ""Blade Runner"" for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to his amputated legs, has said he thought there was an intruder in the house. Afraid of being attacked, he ran on his stumps to the bathroom, where he shot through the door from a relatively low angle four times. It was only upon returning to his bedroom, Pistorius says, that he realized Steenkamp was not in bed and that she had been the one in the bathroom. The state alleges it was premeditated murder: Pistorius had an argument with Steenkamp then put on his prosthetic legs, walked to the bathroom and shot through the door from a relatively higher angle, intentionally killing her. His uncle told CNN last week that Pistorius is a broken man over the incident and described his nephew's grief as ""unthinkable."" ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument? How would you feel? It's unthinkable,"" Arnold Pistorius said. His family said Monday they ""fully stand behind Oscar."" ""We believe in him, love him and will support him every step of the way in what lies ahead,"" the statement said.

"Minneapolis (CNN) -- It's hard to find a lot of things in Williston, North Dakota, where thousands of workers have flocked for high-paying oil jobs. Houses and apartments are in short supply, and those living in temporary abodes must wait for hours at run-down truck stops for a hot shower at the end of a long workday. Evan Jensen, 18, found that out firsthand when he visited the oil boomtown a few months ago to help his brother find work there. The recent high school graduate, who is attending college this fall, knew there was an opportunity to make money in Williston, considered ground zero in the oil boom region known as the Bakken. Lured by the possibility of six-figure salaries, thousands have flocked to the region, leaving nearly everything in short supply. CNNMoney.com: Workers score payday in North Dakota . Jensen's first idea was to create a camper with bunk beds, and rent that. But then he had a better idea. ""While we were there we were getting pretty smelly,"" Jensen said. ""[We thought] 'Man, you can't get a shower anywhere.' So that's where [the idea] really sparked."" Jensen said during peak after-work hours, popular truck stops in the area utilize a number system and people line up for showers. Sometimes the wait can be two or three hours, he said. ""I mean the truck stops -- they're just nasty,"" Jensen said. ""They're hard to get in and out. You get to certain ones ... and it's just a zoo."" He said one man told him when he's ""feeling desperate for a good shower"" he'll drive 60 miles out of the way. He mentioned the idea of a shower house to his dad and, during their nine-hour drive back to their home in South Dakota, they mulled it over. ""By the time we got home I was on the edge of my seat because I was so excited,"" he said. A week later, enough time for his parents to realize he was serious and not being a fickle teenager, his folks asked if he was ready. He said he was. Jensen used an old 53-foot semi-trailer from his father and, with the help of his family and friends, spent three weeks outfitting it with five private shower stalls. They also installed a washer and dryer, an office, and bought a separate water tanker. In mid-June, they took the tanker and trailer up to Williston. ""We had a blast doing it,"" Jensen said. Gallery: Check out other boomtown opportunists . Showers run $10 a pop -- $5 if you live in the makeshift village of campers where the mobile shower trailer is located. When he first got it up and running, Jensen was manning it from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m. He soon changed that when he realized 90% of his customers were coming between the peak after work hours of 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. These days, the place is staffed by one hired employee, because Jensen is focused on his move to school. So far, they're averaging between 20 and 25 customers a day, and he said he has probably made more than $5,000 -- although it will be awhile before he pays off the start-up costs. Ideally he'd love to sell the business. He has put an ad on Craigslist.com asking for $95,000 ""or best offer."" Classes at McNally-Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota, start September 6. Jensen said music has been his ""absolute passion"" since he was a kid. He taught himself how to play guitar a few years back. ""I just love creating music. It's a blast, I could do it forever,"" he said, adding that performing his own work isn't necessarily what he's after. ""I'd rather make somebody a rock star that has better vocal talent than I do."" Jensen said that while his parents would always be there to assist if he really needed it, the burden of tuition rests squarely on him. He is determined to balance his passion for music with the reality of life. ""Music is what I absolutely love doing, but for anything in life, if it doesn't pay the bills you gotta find something that does,"" he said.","Evan Jensen, 18, noticed a lack of showers on a recent visit to Williston, North Dakota .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats acting like Republicans. Republicans acting like Democrats. The 2016 presidential contest is shaping up to be the political equivalent of gender-bending. Democrats are coalescing early around a front-runner who certainly will be lavishly funded, Hillary Clinton. She's campaigning on the familiar GOP platform: ""Next in line."" Meanwhile, a twice-beaten Republican Party finds itself doing as Democrats often did in the Reagan era, surveying a field of little-knowns and hoping for magic. The Republican field is led by two freshman senators: Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, plus a member of the House and the party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan. Three things are immediately striking about the top of the Republican field: . 1) It's not only Washington-based, but it's all congressionally based. There is no governor in the top three, no general, no former Cabinet secretary, nobody with any notable private-sector accomplishment. 2) It's light on accomplishment. Ryan has to date been the most productive of the top three, but none of his famous budgets have been passed into law. Paul can cite no legislative accomplishments at all, only a stunt filibuster against the entirely imaginary menace of drone strikes against American citizens on American soil. Rubio has taken a lead role in immigration reform but must make some tough decisions about whether his future is best secured by negotiating a deal or scuttling one. None of the three Republican front-runners has any administrative experience to speak of. 3) It's intensely doctrinaire. Ryan was the author of much of the Republican Party's post-2009 tea party program. Rubio has to date shown himself an undeviating follower of that program. Paul dissents from some aspects of that program but in the direction of even greater extremism. A party rebuilding from back-to-back presidential defeats has to face the possibility that the problem may be bigger than its candidate, bigger than its campaign tactics. There are a couple of obvious ways to address that possibility: . The party might look for an outsider nominee, a candidate so attractive in his or her own right as to offset the party's own unpopularity. This is what Republicans did by nominating Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 after five consecutive defeats by New Deal Democrats. Or the party might allow an insider some latitude to edge back toward the political center. This is what Democrats did in 1992 when they nominated a pro-death penalty, pro-welfare reform, pro-free trade governor of Arkansas after losses under the party-line liberals, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. In 2016, however, Republicans as yet show no inclination to try either remedy. No independent superstar; no deviation from party line orthodoxy. The one Republican with the highest cross-partisan appeal, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has been consigned to fourth place. As the saying goes, the first step toward recovery is to acknowledge the problem. The problem in 2012 -- as in 2008, as in the near-death experience of 2004, as in the popular vote loss of 2000, as in the loss of 1996, as in the loss of 1992 -- was the GOP's failure to offer an economic program relevant to the problems of middle-class Americans. The party's present three front-runners would not only repeat that failure, but double down on that failure. The Republican Party desperately needs renewal, its early presidential front-runners are characterized by their rejection of change. At a time when voters reject generic Republicanism, Republicans themselves are rallying to two of the most generic Republicans in the party -- and a third, Paul, who diverges from generic Republicanism only by offering voters even more of what they most dislike about today's GOP. The party talks about learning from its mistakes. Thus far, the main thing the party seems to have learned from those mistakes is how to repeat them.

"Boston (CNN) -- On this brisk April morning in Boston's South End, worshipers filled New England's largest Roman Catholic church. It was a time to pray -- and reflect on the torrent of violence this city has seen. Last Sunday, a special blessing was said here for the runners in the Boston Marathon. Now, there were people sitting on the wooden pews who might have witnessed the tragedy. They were all scarred inside. Almost a week has passed since bombs made from pressure cookers blew up near the finish line of the race. Three people died, and more than 170 were wounded. Many remain in hospitals. Cardinal Sean O'Malley knew his role was to help heal. He greeted people ahead of Sunday Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. It was in this sprawling 19th-century stone building that President Barack Obama quoted scripture Thursday to bring comfort and resolve for those still reeling from the Boston Marathon bombings. It was time again to seek solace. Maria Fernandez attended the service with her friends. ""This is the best place to be right now if you're from here and want to support Boston,"" she said. Inside the church, all eyes fell on four large photos of the victims, candles flickering in front of them. Life edges back to normal in Boston, with lives forever changed . Some prayed. Others whispered. O'Malley, Boston's archbishop, hoped the service reinforced Boston's communal ties after the tragedy. ""We are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week's violence,"" he said. ""Some of those here were among those injured. But everyone has been affected."" He voiced what so many have been thinking: Why would anyone do this? What were the bombers thinking? It has been ""very difficult to understand what was going on in their heads,"" he said. He said he was struck by the outpouring ""of goodness and generosity"" of first responders and others. ""Our challenge is to keep this alive."" O'Malley cautioned against revenge and retaliation. He asked those incensed by Monday's attack not to focus their anger randomly against any ethnic or religious group. ""We must build civilization on love, or there will be no civilization at all,"" he said. He even quoted John Lennon. ""Everything will be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it's not the end."" ""Our faith goes beyond that optimism,"" O'Malley said. ""Love is stronger than death."" Outside the cathedral, stores and coffee shops were abuzz with chatter Sunday morning. The tone turned somber as people filed into the church. A week of bruising news . ""It's a good thing to be here right now,"" said Dennis O'Rourke, hurrying up the cathedral steps. There were other services Sunday in Boston. Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders gathered for an interfaith service on Boylston Street, near the marathon finish line. A week ago, it was a place of carnage. On Sunday, it became a sanctuary -- an open-air church, synagogue, mosque and temple, rolled all into one. Volunteers wore white T-shirts that said: ""Do you want a hug?"" They embraced strangers on the street. The area remains a barricaded crime scene. Old South Church of Boston was closed Sunday for the first time since the city's colonial days. Parishioners were invited to attend morning service at the Church of Covenant. ""We are shaken, but we are not forsaken,"" the church said in a statement. Central Reform Temple announced cancellation of Sabbath Eve service on its website, citing emergency conditions in Boston. ""We are determined to gather together for worship and mutual support as soon as possible,"" the temple said. Instead, the Friday service was scheduled for Sunday morning at nearby Emmanuel Church. Temple Israel opened its doors to the congregation of Trinity Church for a 10:30 service Sunday. Trinity is in Copley Square, near the marathon finish line, and it remains closed. Trinity's congregation filled the sanctuary at Temple Israel, which can seat about 900 people, said Rabbi Ronne Friedman. The clergy and staff were surprised in the best possible way that so many people showed up. The synagogue, he said, was honored to host Trinity in an hour of need. ""It was beautiful, moving,"" he said. ""And it was a reminder of the deep bonds that exist between us. It reminded us all that our proximity is not just geographical. ""After the trauma of the past week, we are in proximate relationship with one another spiritually and psychologically. I think we all very much felt it was one Boston."" Imam Talal Eid of the Islamic Institute of Boston said Muslims were participating in interfaith prayers. ""I know that in all mosques, there have been prayers said for the victims,"" he said. The holiest day of the week for Muslims is Friday, but several Boston mosques were closed then because of the lockdown during the massive manhunt for one of the bombing suspects. The same was true for synagogues, which hold services Friday evening and on Saturday. With Monday will come a new week. Officials have called for a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m. Then, the bells will toll in Boston and the entire state of Massachusetts. And everyone will stop to remember. CNN""s David Ariosto reported from Boston and Moni Basu from Atlanta.","Bostonians filled churches Sunday to pray and heal .

"Washington (CNN) -- It won an Academy Award, made people forget ""Gigli"" when they think Ben Affleck, and now the movie ""Argo"" may even pull off another feat -- help move legislation through Congress. Ex-Iran hostages hope 'Argo' win boosts quest for reparations . The frustrated Foreign Service officer on the phone as the U.S. embassy in Iran was under assault at the beginning of ""Argo"" was in real life John Limbert. ""That part of it was quite real. I mean, very much speeded-up but quite real,"" Limbert said from his home in suburban Washington. The keepsakes and collages on the walls of Limbert's study constantly remind him of his harrowing 444 days as a hostage in Iran 34 years ago. Not that he would ever forget. But for most people in America, the Iran hostage crisis was a distant memory until ""Argo"" brought it all back. Iran to add lawsuit over 'Argo' to cinematic response . Unlike the six Americans who hid with the Canadian ambassador who were the focus of ""Argo,"" Limbert was one of the 52 Americans held -- and tortured -- by Iranians for 14 months. ""I had a gun to my head, I was in solitary for nine months,"" recalled Limbert, who said that as a political officer at the embassy, he was not beaten and physically tortured as much as CIA officers were. ""Ten minutes before this happened, I was thinking about what's going to happen in Iran, what's going to happen to the left, what's going to happen to the right, what's going to happen with the former Shah, what's going to happen with U.S. relations. All the things that, sort of, all the inside the Beltway stuff that we think about. ""Ten minutes later, all that was gone,"" he continued. ""That didn't matter at all, and I thought about only one thing...Get me out of here. How am I going to get out? How am I going to get out of here? And frankly, I didn't care what it took."" He was subjected to the mock executions depicted in ""Argo."" ""They came in at 2 in the morning with, I think, masks and guns, pulled us out together to a place, lined us up against the wall, started chambering rounds into their guns, yelling orders. We didn't know what was going to happen... I thought we were gone,"" Limbert said. When Limbert and his fellow hostages were finally freed on January 20, 1981, they learned the U.S. government gave up something big in return: As part of the Algiers Accords agreed to a day earlier, the hostages were barred from suing Iran in U.S. court to seek compensation for their ordeal. Decades of court challenges have gone nowhere and appeals to administrations in both parties have failed. The Obama administration has said it stands by the promise in the Algiers Accords not to sue Iran. Now, Sen.Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, is pushing legislation to get the former hostages financial reward in a different way. He wants to put a surcharge on fines against companies that violate sanctions against Iran and use that money to create a compensation fund. Isakson says the popularity of ""Argo' is helping. ""A lot of people have seen it. They understand the abject horror that these people went through. I think most everybody will identify with the crisis and the suffering these people went through, and hopefully it will give us the impetus and the momentum to see to it that all these many years they're actually compensated for their treatment,"" Isakson said. His bill would allow hostages to get $10,000 a day for each day of captivity, which comes to $4.4 million total for each hostage. Isakson argues that finally compensating the hostages will send a message to Iran and to U.S. personnel around the world, especially after four were killed at the U.S. consulate in Libya. ""It just magnified that our diplomats overseas in harm's way day in and day out are in constant danger,"" Isakson said about the Benghazi attack. ""They need to also know that if they get violated, if they are captured, if they are tortured, that we'll have their back -- that America will stand strong for them."" After Limbert was freed, he returned to the foreign service for the rest of his career. He knew Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was one of the four killed in Benghazi. ""He was one of our best. What a tragic loss, from him and the others who were there. They need protection. There has to be protection, and also there has to be accountability for what goes on,"" he said. Limbert acknowledges that getting compensation from companies that violate sanctions against Iran is not ideal, but says decades of failed attempts to get direct accountability from Iran make him and other former hostages believe it is not in the cards. But he argues Iran needs to get the message once and for all that storming a U.S. Embassy and holding Americans hostage for more than a year has consequences. ""The message has been so far, frankly, has been to the Islamic Republic: You got away with it. You can do these things and there are no consequences. Well, what kind of message does that send on a moral level, on a human level, and on a political level? If someone can get away with this, they can get away with worse. What kind of a foreign policy do you run? What kind of a moral policy do you run when people can do something as outrageous as this, as shameful as this, that something violates every principle, not just of international law and conventions?"" Isakson now has a Democratic co-sponsor, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, so the effort is now bipartisan. Still, Democratic Senate sources say the legislation will likely need to be tweaked before Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, will move it through his committee. For example, $4.4 million appears excessive to some lawmakers. But Limbert agrees with Isakson that the climate is now different thanks to ""Argo."" ""Before the film came out and before this renewed interest, we frankly had difficulty getting anyone to listen to our case,"" Limbert said. ""We got expressions of sympathy, we got, you know, praise for our bravery, our service to our country. But frankly, that's not what we were looking for,"" he said.","Iran hostage crisis was a distant memory for many until the film 'Argo' brought it all back .

"(CNN) -- A New York Times front-page article Monday detailed a new phenomenon in news coverage of the presidential campaign: candidates insisting on ""quote approval,"" telling reporters what they can and cannot use in some stories. And, stunningly, reporters agreeing to it. This, folks, is news. Any way you look at it, this is a jaw-dropping turn in journalism, and it raises a lot of questions. Among them: Can you trust the reporters and news organizations who do this? Is it ever justified on the candidate's side or on the reporter's side? Where is this leading us? As someone who's been covering presidential campaigns since the 1950s, I have no delusions about political reporting. Candidates bargaining access to get the kind of news coverage they want is nothing new. The thicket of attribution and disclosure deals is a deep maze reporters have been picking their way through even before my time. But this latest tactic by candidates revealed by the Times gives me, to say the least, great pause. It should give every citizen pause. Essentially, what the Times described was the rapid rise of ""quote approval"" -- a strategy deployed by campaigns requiring reporters to send quotations they intend to use to candidates' press officers, to be sliced, diced, edited and drained of color or unwanted consequences, and reporters going along, fearing that if they don't, they won't get access. A look at media coverage of Romney's Bain pain . Here's how it works: Let's say a reporter is granted an interview with a senior strategist of the Obama or Romney campaign. A condition for the interview would be that before the reporter could send the story to the editor, he or she would have to agree to submit for approval every quote intended to be used to the campaign press staff. Let us mark well this Faustian bargain. It is for the benefit of the politicians, at the expense of readers, listeners and viewers. It is not in the public interest; it is designed to further the candidates' interests. Political operatives cannot be blamed for wanting this. We, the press, should be held accountable for letting them have it. Thomas Jefferson said: ""The only security of all is in a free press."" A free and truly independent press -- fiercely independent when necessary -- is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy. One of the most important roles of our journalists is to be watchdogs. Submitting to these new tactics puts us more in the category of lapdogs. For many years, it has been typical journalistic practice for high-ranking officials on the campaign or in the White House to demand that interviews be conducted ""on background"" -- meaning reporters agree to not use direct quotes or identify the person by name. Hence, conventions such as ""As one campaign official said ..."" This, in many cases, is defensible. Diane Sawyer's ""Hot"" Newscast . But the practice described in the Times is something new and different. This is the officials or candidates regularly insisting that reporters essentially become an operative arm of theadministration or campaign they are covering. ""Quote approval"" nullifies, or at least seriously dilutes, reporters' ability and duty to be honest brokers of information. When the quotes are sanitized, then delivered intact with full attribution, the public has no way of knowing what the concealed deal was. Please know that there is no joy in calling attention to these things. I respect and empathize with reporters and editors who must compete in today's environment. And I know full well that when I've been covering campaigns, which I still do, I've made my mistakes and have been far from perfect. About all of us doing this line of work, I'm often reminded of a sign in an old Wild West cow town saloon that said, ""Please don't shoot the piano player, he's doing the best he can."" But we journalists can do better. We must. Media Blitz Batters Romney . Dean Baquet, the excellent managing editor for news at the Times, said in Monday's story, referring to quote approval: ""We don't like the practice. We encourage our reporters to push back. Unfortunately, this practice is becoming increasingly common, and maybe we have to push back harder."" Yes. The Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and a few other newspapers, along with the major networks, are among the few news outlets that have the leverage to push back -- soon and hard. It's action worthy of us. And it's important. It matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Rather.","Reporters are agreeing to let candidates vet their quotes before they appear in stories .

"(CNN) -- Italian voters may finally be losing their appetite for Silvio Berlusconi's off-color ""jokes,"" but if the rise of Beppe Grillo is any indication, there's still more than enough room in Italian politics for another showman. Known as the ""clown prince"" of Italian politics, Beppe Grillo is a 64-year-old comedian turned politician whose Five Star Movement (M5S) is winning the hearts, minds and votes of Italians fed up with mainstream parties. ""My vision was just to make jokes about politicians,"" the comedian, whose real name is Giuseppe Piero Grillo, told CNN before the elections. ""Then I made this joke about how this politician was stealing -- and he actually was."" That joke about Socialist politician Bettino Craxi on Italian TV show Fantastico in the 1980s saw him effectively banned from television. He then took his energetic, polemical and provocative act to the theater. During one performance Grillo smashed a pile of computers on stage while lamenting modern society's dependency on technology. Years later, technology would be the key to his success. Since then he's found a new audience at huge public rallies rallies and on the internet: it's been dubbed the ""Beppe boom."" Despite his searing attacks on the political class, Grillo does not blame former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for Italy's current problems. ""Berlusconi was a consequence,"" he said. ""He was the ultimate salesman but one who publicized products with no substance, like a shop with a beautifully lit window but nothing concrete to sell. His political appearance is already history, ancient history even."" Italy's octogenarian president, Giorgio Napolitano, had dismissed the surge in support for Grillo, saying the only boom he knows was the economic one in the mid-80s. But the comedian dismissed the criticism. ""He doesn't understand there are millions of Italians out there who can't stand this any longer. ""You can't ask an Italian, an entrepreneur, a family to make sacrifices when the presidency costs about 240 million euros a year. Do you understand this? Our president earns three times as much as (U.S. President Barack Obama). An Italian ambassador earns 20,000 euros per month. Merkel earns 9,000 a month. You cannot expect sacrifices right now, because we should all make sacrifices right now or no one will."" This kind of talk has touched a raw nerve with Italian voters, roughly a quarter of whom cast ballots for M5S in the lower house of parliament. This success reflects a growing trend in other parts of Europe where disillusionment is seeing a shift away from mainstream parties. ""We have a lot of trouble right now, and he's a different way to do politics, to change things from the ground,"" said Grillo supporter Martina Paladino. ""We don't trust the parties any more,"" added Laura Antimianni, a G5S candidate. ""They didn't do good things in the past and they're not doing them in the present."" ""Italian politics are not changing. We have the same politicians as we did five years ago. It's time to change -- I want to see new faces,"" said Matteo Cavalca, a Grillo supporter. While there is little doubt Grillo can entertain a crowd, questions remain over whether he can destabilize mainstream Italian politics. His critics dismiss him as a loudmouth and say he simply doesn't have the policies for the mainstream stage. But asked about his position on the euro, for instance, Grillo replied: ""I'm not asking to leave the euro, but to sit around a table and ask it better to maintain the status quo thus taking Italy on this downward slope or is it better to ask what we'd need to sacrifice in order to get out of the euro. Is it better with or without the euro?"" ""Ten out of 27 countries don't have the euro. They don't have a risk of defaulting. We have undersold our democracy by spreading it. Enough is enough."" What seems clear after the election is that Grillo's movement will a force to be reckoned with in Italian politics for the foreseeable future. Grillo has called M5S ""an experiment of hyper-democracy. The one thing that I have understood is that we are going through an ethical change of culture, not politics. ""It is a cultural revolution of the society: to change the political class is the first step. The one thing I am certain of is that the political class is finished. They have liquefied in political diarrhea. There is nothing left ... nothing.""","Comedian turned politician Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement (M5S) is popular with Italians .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The parents of a 17-year-old boy killed by a tiger at the San Francisco Zoo said the attack has forever ruined Christmas for them, while police are investigating whether someone helped the tiger escape. The victim's parents, Marilza and Carlos Sousa, express shock at the death of their son. The area of the zoo in which the Siberian tiger killed Carlos Sousa of San Jose has been deemed a crime scene, San Francisco Police Chief Heather Fong said. The zoo's director, Manuel Mollinedo, said officials have not determined how Tatiana, who weighed more than 300 pounds, escaped from her exhibit area and attacked three patrons Tuesday before police shot and killed her. Sousa's parents, Carlos and Marilza Sousa, said they were in shock and were having trouble believing what had happened. ""It's hard to believe,"" said the elder Carlos Sousa, who said he and his wife learned about their son's death Wednesday morning. ""I had to go identify the body. It's pretty mangled up.""  Watch the family's reaction to the attack » . Marilza Sousa put a photograph of her son on the family Christmas tree and said she'd never be able to celebrate the holiday again. ""Our Christmas is with him,"" she said. ""No more Christmas."" Police said Sousa was killed just outside the tiger's enclosure. The two others, who were injured, were about 300 yards away by a cafe. The two survivors were in stable condition Wednesday and doing well, San Francisco General Hospital said.  Watch as the tiger's victims are rushed to the hospital » . The head of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums said this was the first-ever visitor fatality due to an animal escape at a zoo accredited by the association. Ron Magill of Florida's Miami Metrozoo told CNN that the Siberian tiger is ""the most powerful cat on the face of this planet."" Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Mollinedo was asked about an incident last year, in which Tatiana chewed flesh off a keeper's arm during a public feeding demonstration. Mollinedo said that Tatiana ""was acting like a normal tiger"" at the time, and that the zoo modified procedures to increase safety. California's Division of Occupation Safety and Health determined the zoo was at fault because of hazardous conditions in the Lion House and lack of specialized safety training for employees. The zoo made changes that the state safety division ordered. The Lion House, the zoo's big-cat exhibit, was closed for more than six months after that incident. Sousa's sister Beatrice appeared told CNN Wednesday night that the family has not received information about the investigation. ""There's a lot of pain. You know, no words for it. It's just too much,"" she said. ""Our family is very, very hurt."" The zoo was closed Wednesday while officials investigated the tiger attack. Mollinedo said the zoo will probably reopen Thursday, but the Lion House will remain closed ""until we get a better understanding of what actually happened."" Tatiana was held in an exhibit area that included a 20-foot moat and an 18-foot wall, Mollinedo said. The 4-year-old tiger was born at the Denver Zoo and came to San Francisco in 2005. Experts from other zoos will inspect the setup to help suggest modifications to assure safety, he said. ""We have deemed the site, as of last night, a crime scene,"" Fong said Wednesday, and police are working to gather evidence and witness statements. Fong said fire and police responded to emergency calls shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday. When police arrived, they saw the tiger ""sitting next to a person on the ground,"" and the tiger turned back and began attacking the person again, she said. Officers yelled at the tiger to stop, and did not fire immediately ""for fear that they would not be able to contain their fire,"" she said. ""When the yelling was occurring, the animal turned toward the officers,"" who then shot and killed the animal, Fong said.  Watch as animal expert Jack Hanna discusses the attack » . Authorities carried out multiple searches to ensure there were no other victims, she said. The zoo had closed at 5 p.m., and only around 20 people were still there, Mollinedo said. The other victims of the tiger attack have not been publicly identified. Dr. Rochelle Dicker, a surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, said the two ""young men"" injured are ""in very stable condition."" In fact, she said, ""they look absolutely fantastic."" Doctors are focusing on ensuring that the patients don't develop infections, she said, adding that they ""will be on antibiotics for some time. ""By the time they got here, they were very, very stable -- not close to death,"" Dicker told reporters. ""Really, it was just a matter of washing out their wounds."" Jim Maddy, president of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, issued a statement expressing ""sympathy to the family of the guest that lost his life, and our deepest hope that the two injured guests will recover."" Read about other escapes and attacks by captive animals . Maddy called the San Francisco Zoo ""great,"" and noted that it is accredited by the association. ""Until this incident, there had not been a visitor fatality resulting from an animal escape at an AZA-accredited zoo. ""AZA mandatory accreditation standards require safety and emergency protocols that go beyond federal, state or local requirements. Regular safety training and annual emergency drills are required by these mandatory accreditation standards."" He said association rules ""require that the San Francisco Zoo provide a thorough report to its independent accreditation commission, which will review it and determine any actions that need to be taken. We will not speculate on what action might be taken until the facts are fully reviewed."" Along with Siberian tigers, an endangered species, the zoo has rarer and smaller Sumatran tigers.

"Washington (CNN) -- Diplomatic tensions between the United States and Venezuela showed no signs of slowing Monday as the State Department announced that two Venezuelan diplomats had been expelled. Orlando Jose Montanez Olivares and Victor Camacaro Mata were declared personae non gratae and ordered to leave the country in response to the South American nation's decision to kick out two U.S. officials last week, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. ""Around the world, when our people are thrown out unjustly, we're going to take reciprocal action,"" she said. ""We need to do that to protect our own people."" The expulsion of the Venezuelan diplomats comes after Venezuelan officials -- just hours before announcing President Hugo Chavez's death last week -- said they were expelling two U.S. Embassy officials and accused them of plotting to destabilize the country. ""In the day or days that followed there was some pretty heated rhetoric coming in our direction,"" Nuland said Monday. ""I think I called it at one point a page from the old 'Chavista' playbook that we were hoping was going to change. ... There is work that we would like to do together, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism, counternarcotics, economics and energy relations, but it's going to take a change of tone from Caracas."" The expelled Venezuelan diplomats have left the United States, Nuland said. Camacaro worked in the Venezuelan Consulate in New York, and Montanez worked at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, she said. The expelled U.S. officials, both air attaches at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, were accused of having meetings with members of the Venezuelan military and encouraging them to pursue ""destabilizing projects,"" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said. ""We will not allow any foreign interference in our country,"" Jaua said last week. Nicolas Maduro, then vice president and now Venezuela's interim leader, also suggested as he criticized the U.S. Embassy officials last week that someone had deliberately infected Chavez with cancer. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied the accusations. ""This fallacious assertion of inappropriate U.S. action leads us to conclude that, unfortunately, the current Venezuelan government is not interested an improved relationship,"" he said. It isn't the first time that diplomatic tensions have surged between the two countries. Last year the State Department declared Venezuela's consul general in Miami persona non grata -- Latin for unwelcome or unacceptable person -- and expelled her from the United States. In 2008, Venezuela expelled the U.S. ambassador to the South American country. A day later, the United States said it was expelling the Venezuelan ambassador.

"(CNN) -- Blood found on the scene of a Michigan kidnapping belonged to the victim, police said Thursday. Jessica Heeringa, 25, was abducted late last month from an Exxon station in Norton Shores, where she was working alone, sometime around 11 p.m., police have said. Investigators found ""suspicious substances"" at the station and turned them in to the state's crime lab, which identified some of it as blood. A DNA analysis matched it to Heeringa, the Norton Shores Police Department said. The amount of blood found was small, police said. Authorities notified the family of the findings. Suspect's face . Police have put a face with the description of a man suspected of kidnapping the gas station cashier. He is a white male, about 6 feet tall, between 30 and 40 years old, with wavy hair parted in the middle. On Tuesday evening, police released a sketch of the suspect. Police also are looking for a silver minivan -- possibly a Chrysler Town and Country -- that was seen at the gas station. ""We have one witness who placed that vehicle there and saw the driver. That's what we based that description on so far,"" Norton Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV. Video from a nearby business showed the suspected minivan in the area around the time Heeringa went missing. The video is blurry, the van is only seen for a few seconds, and neither a driver nor license plate can be seen. ""I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you could blow it up and I could see the driver inside. But that doesn't exist for me,"" Shaw told WOOD. But it is something. ""It does give us some hope that we've got some accurate information out there to work with,"" he told the station. How she disappeared . Heeringa was scheduled to close the Exxon station where she was working alone at 11:30 p.m. on April 26. But at 11:15, police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned. ""It's very suspicious why there's nobody here,"" the 911 caller says in a tape. The way the station was left, police say, led them to believe somebody abducted Heeringa. ""Her purse and other belongings were undisturbed. In addition, the store's cash drawer was found out, and no money was missing,"" police said in a statement. Heeringa is described as 5 feet 1 inches tall, weighing 110 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, has said that she suspects someone familiar with the gas station and possibly known to Jessica took her daughter. ""I think whoever did this had been in the gas station before and maybe Jessie knew him,"" Shelly Heeringa said. ""He probably lured her out by saying he needed help,"" she said. ""Jessie would have helped anybody. And that was probably her downfall."" Lack of surveillance images . The station did not have security cameras, something that police said has hindered the investigation and that Shelly Heeringa said always troubled her. ""When I knew she was working there, when I knew (the store) had no security cameras, when she was going to be by herself, I expressed my concern about it all the time to her how worried I was,"" the mother said. But those concerns apparently didn't trouble Jessica. ""She just thought she could handle everything,"" Shelly Heeringa said. The mother also thanked the community of 22,500 on the shores of Lake Michigan for its support in the search for her daughter. ""So many people have been trying to help us find Jessie. It's just been wonderful,"" she said. People with information that may help find Jessica Heeringa are asked to call Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691.","Police say blood found at a North Shores service station belongs to Jessica Heeringa .
She was taken from the station late last month, police say .
Suspect is a white male, 30 to 40 years old, 6 feet tall with wavy hair parted in the middle .
Police also are looking for a silver minivan ."
"(CNN) -- What's next in Syria's civil war? The answer will have major implications on Syria's neighbors and the Middle East. The Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia is among the most prominent countries backing the Syrian opposition. Meanwhile, Iran -- the Shiite Islamic republic across the Persian Gulf -- casts itself and its allies in Damascus as part of an ""Axis of Resistance"" to domination of the region by outsiders. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has warned that ""enemies are striving to waste Muslim governments and nations' energy and wealth by pushing them to fight one another,"" Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported. So what's at stake for Syria's neighbors? The Gulf monarchies . The Saudis and some of the neighboring Persian Gulf states fear Iran's push to develop nuclear technology and the spread of Tehran's influence in the region. Bahrain's rulers accused Iran of fomenting unrest among its majority Shiite population during a wave of anti-government protests in 2011, but a government inquiry later found little evidence to support that contention. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched forces to Bahrain to help bolster their smaller neighbor. Saudi King Abdullah said a year ago that there was ""no justification"" for the Syrian crackdown. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are believed to be sending arms and assistance to the Syrian rebels, while the United States -- a leading ally of both countries -- has been providing nonlethal assistance. More: What options are left in Syria? Lebanon . Syria dominated Lebanon for much of its independence and kept troops there until 2005. Now many fear its civil war threatens to upset the careful sectarian balance of Lebanese politics. Syria and Iran support Hezbollah, the anti-Israel Shiite militia that has become a powerful force in Lebanese society. But a large segment of the Lebanese population supports the rebels, and 36,000 Syrians have taken refuge in Lebanon since Bashar al-Assad's government launched its crackdown on opposition in 2011, according to U.N. figures. In addition, Lebanon still hosts more than 400,000 Palestinian refugees from the Arab-Israeli wars -- and tensions fueled by that refugee population helped spark the civil war that wracked the country from 1975 to 1990. More: Clashes in Lebanon on 'Syria Street' Iran . Already facing intense pressure from sanctions aimed at making it halt its production of nuclear fuel, Tehran is strongly backing longtime allies in Damascus. As the leading Shiite power, it's solidly behind al-Assad, a member of the minority Alawite sect, a Shiite offshoot. And the alliance with Syria allows Iran to project power from the Gulf to the Mediterranean, not only through Syria but via the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah. Andrew Tabler, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, calls Syria ""a keystone"" for Iran. ""There is sort of a cold war taking place between the two sides,"" Tabler told CNN in May. ""I think you can see that playing out in terms of Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Turkey clearly on the side of the opposition in Syria, while the Iranians are strongly backing the regime. What's at stake is larger than what's within Syria's borders."" More: What's Iran getting out of al-Assad support? Turkey . NATO member Turkey is hosting Syrian opposition groups and more than 50,000 refugees. It's a vital link for the opposition, which brings in opposition fighters and weapons via Turkey. Turkey, meanwhile, has built up forces on its border after Syria shot down a Turkish fighter jet over the Mediterranean in June. The United States and Turkey are developing contingency plans for the possible collapse of al-Assad's government, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said. And the Turks, who have battled Kurdish separatists in their southeast for decades, fear that movement may gain a foothold amid a power vacuum in Syria. The separatist Kurdistan Workers Party raised the movement's flag over several ethnic Kurdish communities along the border, raising alarms in Ankara. Iraq . In the last decade, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fled to Syria amid sectarian warfare between Sunnis and Shiites and a persistent insurgency that followed the U.S. invasion of 2003. American commanders blamed Syria for allowing fighters to pass through its territory and into Iraq to fight U.S. troops. Now, Syrian refugees are starting to take shelter in Iraq -- about 10,000 at the latest count -- and Western powers fear jihadist groups such as al Qaeda are moving across the porous border to battle al-Assad's forces. The Iraqi government, now dominated by Shiite parties, is still battling the fundamentalist Sunni jihadists.","Syria's crisis is bleeding into its neighbors .

"(CNN) -- Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified a new disease among people in Asia that causes AIDS-like symptoms but is not associated with HIV. The study, released in the New England Journal of Medicine Thursday, found patients with the disease were making antibodies that attacked their immune systems. ""We all make molecules and proteins in the body that tell our immune system how to function properly,"" said Dr. Sarah Browne, a clinical investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH and the lead author on the study. ""They tell different immune cells when to turn on and when to start fighting infection,"" she said. ""We found a large number of the patients that we studied with serious opportunistic infections make an antibody that blocks the function of one of these molecules, which is interferon-gamma."" Without functioning interferon-gamma, people become more susceptible to certain types of infections -- infections people with working immune systems normally don't get, she said. The disease is being called an adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome because it strikes adults. Cases date back to 2004, with most of them occurring in Thailand and Taiwan. The NIH has been studying the disease since 2005. ""It's rare -- more prevalent over in Southeast Asia,"" Browne told CNN. ""But we have been diagnosing it here in the U.S. in individuals of Asian descent."" So far NIH has seen about 12 cases, all of them in people of Asian descent. According to Browne, most patients survive. There have been deaths in other countries, she said, but did not know how many. No one has died in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, says it's important to note the disease is not contagious. ""It is not a virus, that's the first thing. It's not a new AIDS-like virus,"" Fauci said. ""It's a syndrome that was noticed and discovered in Asia where people get opportunistic infections similar to HIV/AIDS, but the cause of the syndrome is not an infection like HIV."" Fauci said researchers ""found the people have an autoimmunity, where their bodies are making antibodies against a protein that's important in fighting infection. ""The reason the body is making that antibody is unclear but it isn't a virus like HIV that's causing it,"" he said. "" It's autoimmune disease, and people get secondary infections similar to AIDS."" The study was already in the early stages in 2009, when Kim Nguyen, a 62-year-old Vietnamese woman from Tennessee, came to NIH suffering from symptoms that would be linked to the mystery disease. A little more than 200 people -- almost exclusively from Thailand and Taiwan between the ages of 18 and 78 -- were studied. All were HIV-negative. ""We want to understand what triggers people to make these antibodies in the first place,"" Browne said. ""And we want to use that information to guide treatment -- because really, when you treat the infection you're treating the symptom. You're not treating the underlying cause."" Right now, doctors are simply treating the infections. For many of the patients, that's sufficient, Browne said, but for those cases where it's not, they are trying to find ways to target the antibodies themselves by lowering the antibody levels and trying to reverse the immunodeficiency. Both Fauci and Browne believe a combination of both genetic and environmental factors are most likely at play, but don't yet know what those factors are. ""Overall it appears to be a chronic disease, but we have not yet studied it for a long enough period of time to know the long-term prognosis,"" Browne said. ""We don't yet know what factors may distinguish those with mild versus those with severe disease.""","Patients with disease are making antibodies that attack their immune system .

"(CNN) -- Peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi expressed dismay Tuesday at the lack of progress in ending the civil war in Syria and called on the U.N. Security Council to act. ""Syria is being destroyed bit by bit and, in destroying Syria, the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world,"" the U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy told reporters after meeting in private with the Security Council. ""That is why I believe Security Council simply cannot continue to say, 'We are in disagreement; therefore, let's wait for better times.' I think they have got to grapple with this problem now."" Brahimi blamed the government of President Bashar al-Assad and opposition activists for the impasse. ""Objectively, they are cooperating in destroying Syria,"" he said. The Security Council has proven ineffectual in brokering a peace, with China and Russia casting vetoes to block resolutions on sanctions. Brahimi suggested a return to the Geneva communique of last June as a possible way of making progress. The proposal was drawn up during a conference in the Swiss city that brought together representatives from world powers that had been at odds over the conflict. The resulting proposal called for a cease-fire, a transitional government and a new constitution, though it did not specify whether al-Assad would have to step down. Russia and China joined France, Britain, the United States and Turkey in agreeing on the plan. Arab League nations also signed on to it. But neither the opposition nor al-Assad's government has signaled a willingness to sign on to it. Still, the declaration contains ""a lot of elements that would provide for a reasonable solution to the conflict,"" Brahimi said. ""The council has got to reaffirm the attachment and support for Syria's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, also for the rights of every citizen in Syria to their human rights and dignity, irrelevant of gender, religion or any other element,"" he added. The communique calls for the creation of a transitional government with full executive powers. ""I think that there was a very clever, creative ambiguity in this declaration and I have told them that that ambiguity has to be lifted now,"" he said. ""You've got to say what these full executive powers mean ... all the powers of state have got to go to that government."" Asked about rumors that he planned to resign, Brahimi was resolute: ""I am not a quitter,"" he said. ""The United Nations has no choice but to remain engaged with this problem -- whether I am there or not. The moment I feel that I am totally useless, I will not stay one minute more. I didn't want this job. I didn't look for it. I don't need it as a job. So if I'm doing it, it's because -- maybe stupidly -- I feel sense of duty."" Brahimi's predecessor, former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, resigned from the same post last August. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Brahimi gave the Security Council ""a frank and very grim assessment."" Though ""a lot"" of council members expressed support for his efforts, there were ""no answers,"" Rice said. ""There are no promises of any big breakthrough."" The envoy's comments came on the same day that the executed bodies of scores of men were found Tuesday in Syria, yet another grisly discovery that opposition activists blamed on the government. Residents pulled 80 of them from the Queiq River in the town of Bustan Al-Qasr, near Aleppo city, opposition activists said. An opposition video -- the authenticity of which CNN could not verify -- showed a row of bodies splayed on a muddy river bank, their heads bearing wounds, their hands tied behind their backs. Some of the bodies showed signs of torture. Abu Faris, an opposition spokesman in the Aleppo countryside, said 20 of the victims had been identified by their relatives who said the men had been arrested and detained in Aleppo by Air Force intelligence. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency blamed the killings on Jabhat al-Nusra, an Islamist opposition group. ""The families have identified a number of the killed, stressing that Jabhat al-Nusra abducted them because of their rejection to cooperate with this terrorist group,"" SANA reported, citing a media source. ""The bodies, which terrorists and TV misleading channels have claimed that the army killed their owners, were found in the side where terrorists present,"" SANA quoted one of its reporters as saying. It was the latest report of mass killings in the Syrian civil war, a battle between al-Assad's government and insurgents. In all Tuesday, 228 Syrians were killed Tuesday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The Syrian unrest started nearly two years ago when the government cracked down on civilians peacefully protesting government policies. The conflict morphed into a civil war. Since then, it has claimed more than 60,000 lives, according to the United Nations. ""The regime adds another massacre to its record while the entire Arab world and the international community keep watching the Syrian misery in silence and complete hypocrisy,"" the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. In the opposition video, men can be heard shouting, ""This is unbelievable!"" and ""Some were children, children for God's sake!"" One man can be heard saying, ""Tell the world these were not soldiers. They were not fighters. They are human beings. How come they know what the law of gravity is but they don't know anything about human rights."" Opposition groups have regularly reported massacres by government forces and their allies. Some of the more notorious reports include incidents in Taftanaz, Houla, Homs, Hama, Tremseh, Daraya, and Halfaya. Bombings in Aleppo and Damascus have resulted in many deaths. Great migrations . The international aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, called Tuesday for international donors to support humanitarian operations in opposition-held areas in Syria. The group said in a statement issued ahead of a donors conference in Kuwait City that areas under government control receive nearly all international aid. ""The current aid system is unable to address the worsening living conditions facing people inside Syria,"" said Dr. Marie-Pierre Allie, president of MSF. ""The participants in the Kuwait City conference must acknowledge the legitimacy of cross-border humanitarian operations intended for Syria and grant them the financial, administrative and logistical support they require."" The number of refugees registered with the United Nations jumped by 110,000 in January, bringing the total to more than half a million. If the refugees awaiting registration are included, the number exceeds 700,000, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. Read more: Fleeing violence in nighttime trek to Jordan . ""It's an unrelenting flow,"" UNHCR spokeswoman Sybella Wilkes said in Geneva. When Syrians flee to neighboring countries, they arrive in need, Wilkes said. ""The last thing that Syrians wanted to do was leave their country,"" she said, adding that it's not unusual for families to be displaced internally six times before finally deciding to leave their home country. They often require with health conditions that have gone untreated and require urgent attention, Wilkes said. Recently, one woman lost a child at a U.N. station shortly after delivery because she had not received basic prenatal care, Wilkes said. Teen refugee: Prince Charming is dead . The exodus of refugees accelerated in the second half of 2012, Wilkes said. A year ago, the United Nations had registered fewer than 20,000 refugees from Syria, which has a population of more than 22 million. Six months ago, the number rose to 120,000. By December, the number had climbed to 471,000. And now, nearly 585,000. Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon are sheltering the most Syrians, with more than 150,000 each. ""We have in Jordan day shifts and night shifts"" to register new refugees, Wilkes said. ""In Lebanon, we have double shifts."" U.S. humanitarian aid . U.S. President Barack Obama has approved $155 million in humanitarian aid for people in Syria and refugees fleeing the violence. That brings the aid total to $365 million, making the United States the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to Syria. The U.S. government has imposed sanctions against Syria, worked to isolate the regime, and backed the opposition but has refrained from intervening militarily. CNN's Tom Watkins, Hamdi Alkhshali, Joe Sterling, Ben Brumfield, Salma Abdelaziz and Saad Abedine reported from Atlanta. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report from Beirut, Lebanon.","NEW: Doctors Without Borders says most international aid goes to government-held areas .

"(CNN) -- The new North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has brought Disney characters and fun fairs to the images disseminated by the secretive regime's state media. The question now is whether his rule has also added a touch of South Korean pop culture. A video published on www.uriminzokkiri.com, a North Korean government website, draws on imagery from the highly successful pop video ""Gangnam Style"" by the rapper PSY to poke fun at a South Korean presidential candidate. The North Korean video starts with a picture showing a person apparently in the midst of performing the world famous horse dance from ""Gangnam Style."" The face stuck on the dancing figure is that of Park Geun-hye, the candidate for the governing Saenuri Party in the upcoming South Korean presidential election. Park tapped for presidential bid . The video goes on to mockingly evoke Park's support for the past actions of her father, Park Jung-hee, South Korea's former dictator whose legacy still divides the nation. The military dictator who went on to win elections was behind the rapid economic growth of South Korea during the 1960s, following the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to1953 and devastated the peninsula. Supporters say he economically transformed the country, but critics say he disregarded democracy to do so and committed human rights abuses. More on North Korea: Kim Jong Il's chef returns after fleeing . Set to an upbeat 1960s big band instrumental soundtrack, the video includes images from the era of Park Jung-hee's rule. The video shows the hallmarks of North Korean production. It was not clear when it had been uploaded to the official North Korea site, or by whom. Park Geun-hye has said she will focus on welfare policies if she is elected in the presidential elections in December and will engage with North Korea if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. The hit video for PSY's ""Gangnam Style"" has been viewed more then 220 million times on YouTube since it was uploaded in July, garnering fame for the rapper around the globe.

"(CNN) -- It's typical for high school students to encourage their classmates in competition with ""you guys are going to win."" What makes it different in the case of Carmel, New York, High School seniors Dylan Meehan and Bradley Taylor is what they won: the superlative of ""Cutest Couple,"" as highlighted in the school yearbook. And until the news went viral, the decision, says Carmel Principal Kevin Carroll, ""hasn't really been a big deal in the school."" ""I thought at this stage as we are now, it shouldn't be a news event. All the reactions are coming from outside. The yearbooks were distributed Wednesday, and we didn't get any calls until someone posted it online,"" Carroll, whose school is about 65 miles north of New York City, told CNN Tuesday. Taylor, 17, said he sees the honor as a great achievement and a turning point for their school. ""At first we weren't able to run because for the title, they were only allowed to pick a boy and a girl,"" he told CNN. ""But a bunch of our friends made an uproar, and they changed it. So now you vote 'student one' and 'student two.' And I guess a lot of people voted for us and we won. So many people came up to us saying, 'You guys are going to win.'"" A mutual friend introduced the two last year during a Brown University visit. Later on, they started dating. ""I came out to my family a week or two after I started dating Brad,"" said Meehan, 18. ""He was the one encouraging me to come out to them."" ""I feel like both of our families always knew but I told my parents a month before we started dating,"" said Taylor. Taylor's father, Robert Taylor, agreed with Carroll in saying that in this day, it should be no surprise that a gay couple won the ""Cutest Couple"" title. ""I think of it as any other normal day. He won. OK. Lots of people win 'Cutest Couple,'"" said the elder Taylor. ""Back in the day it was different races being together, so for me it shouldn't be anything,"" Robert Taylor said. ""He's very excited that he won."" Bradley Taylor, who has participated in plays at his school, and at a community theater, received a full scholarship to the New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Meehan also will enroll at NYU's Gallatin in the fall. Chelsea Blaney, another of their friends, posted their yearbook photo together on Tumblr and said she got resoundingly positive reactions. ""Two of my best friends won 'Cutest Couple' of our senior class,"" Blaney said on her Tumblr account.

"Washington (CNN) -- A custody battle involving the ""best interests"" of a 3-year-old Cherokee girl was taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, an issue spanning the rights of adoptive parents and the desire to preserve Native American families within tribes. Oral arguments played out in emotional terms, with Justice Anthony Kennedy admitting ""domestic relations pose the hardest problems for judges. ... If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the first domestic relations judge, as a special master, we would do it. But we can't."" Several parties have a stake in what happens to this girl: Her biological mother and father, the adoptive parents, the federal government, the Oklahoma-based tribe, and a legal guardian appointed by the state to represent the child's interests. The appeal was filed by Matt and Melanie Capobianco, who legally adopted Veronica in 2009, shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child. The South Carolina Supreme Court in July ruled for the biological father, Dusten Brown, who had sought custody after the child's birth. He is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation and is raising the child in Oklahoma. Brown had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption, but his attorneys say he did not understand the extent of the waiver, and that the birth mother misrepresented the child's American Indian heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized. At issue is whether Brown, as the onetime non-custodial father, can gain parental custody, after the non-Indian mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe. A special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions, since the current 556 federally recognized-tribes all fall under Interior Department oversight, giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights. The Capobiancos lawyers say federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a ""parent."" While a thin majority may conclude Brown deserves custody, the high court was clearly torn by the conflicting applications of state and federal law. ""If the choice is between a mother, a biological father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit,"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor, ""why do you think that the federal statute requires that it be given to a stranger rather than to the biological father when the statute defines 'parent' as the biological father?"" But Chief Justice John Roberts questioned the assertion Brown was initially enthused about becoming a father. ""There is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy and nothing at the time of the birth, to support the child or the mother,"" he said. ""So he was excited by it; he just didn't want to take any responsibility."" The federal law in question is the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families, in many cases to non-Indian homes. The legislation was designed to ""promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings."" Brown's relationship within the ""federally recognized government"" of the Cherokee Nation means Veronica is a member of the tribe and subject to its jurisdiction. ""It's not anyone's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home,"" said Todd Hembree, the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe's attorney general. ""But we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be Indian homes first."" As with many custody fights, there is wide factual disagreement over the circumstances of both the couple's breakup and subsequent adoption of the child. Opposing sides even disagree on what legal issues the high court should address. The Capobiancos think the issue should be about whether the ICWA law can improperly block adoption proceedings voluntarily initiated by a non-Indian mother who had sole custody of her child, due to what the adoptive parents say is the Indian father's failure to establish a legal parent-child relationship under state law. But Brown argues that he successfully established paternity under state law, and qualifies as a ""parent"" under the ICWA, thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter. He said in legal papers that the child was conceived when the couple was engaged. But he claims that the biological mother, who claims Hispanic heritage, broke off the now-strained relationship by text message. He agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support, but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption. And Brown claims the biological mother tried to ""conceal"" his Indian heritage during the adoption process with the Capobiancos, who live in Charleston, South Carolina. Establishing such heritage would normally make it very difficult for the Cherokee Nation and state social services to agree to any non-Indian adoption and removal from the state. On the flip side, without that designation, state law would have made it hard for Brown to get custody. By this time, Brown went to Iraq on a one-year deployment in the U.S. Army, making it hard to press his custody claims. Veronica lived with the Capobiancos for two years before the high court in South Carolina ruled for the father. Brown took his daughter back to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on New Year's Eve 2011. The state's top court that ruled in his favor said Brown had ""a deeply embedded relationship"" with his American Indian heritage, in which Veronica will be raised. But the Capobiancos point to another part of the state court's conclusion: That despite a ruling against them, they were ""ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment."" That court said its hands were tied, and that federal law trumped state law. ""Our lives have been turned upside down and our home is empty with her,"" Melanie Capobianco told CNN last month. ""What would any parent feel like if their child had been removed out of their home abruptly and with no contact whatsoever? It's unbearable."" In arguments, attorney Lisa Blatt representing the Capobiancos, warned a ruling against her clients would discourage interracial adoption. ""You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they want to adopt"" a native American child, she said. ""And you're basically relegating the child to a piece of property with a sign that says, 'Indian-- keep off. Do not disturb."" Blatt said the father's initial agreement to give up his parental rights meant he forfeited any subsequent efforts to establish custody, when the child was already in a happy, stable home environment. But several justices questioned her assertion the law's intent to protect against the ""breakup of the Indian family"" did not apply to a man whose only initial relationship to the girl was one of biology. ""It seems to me he's the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the Indian family"" protected under the federal law, said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""The father, the mother, and the kid."" Brown's attorney Charles Rothfeld later said state courts made a thorough best interest determination. Yet some on the bench noted the girl and her biological father were listed in legal documents as being less than 1 percent Cherokee. ""Is it one drop of [Indian] blood that triggers all these extraordinary rights?"" asked Roberts. The Obama administration is supporting the birth father and the continued use of the ICWA law. As a single mother with two other young children, the biological mother felt she had no choice but to give her daughter up for adoption, said a legal brief filed by her lawyers. They say she complied with the adoption laws in both states and with the tribe. The couple also says they long wanted to be parents and had seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization. She is a child developmental psychologist and he is an automotive body technician. They were in the room when Veronica was born, and had an ""open"" adoption, meaning the biological mother could and did maintain a relationship with Veronica. Both the Capobiancos and Brown attend the court arguments Tuesday but did not acknowledge the other. Brown told CNN afterward he was looking forward to getting back home to Oklahoma to see his daughter. ""She's asking for me to be there,"" he said. Now married to another woman since June, the father says Veronica is in a happy, stable environment in Oklahoma. His attorney John Nichols said Brown ""has done as much as humanely possible to get his daughter and keep her. He wants to raise that child."" The case is Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, a Minor Child Under the Age of Fourteen Years (12-399). A decision is expected in June.","Cherokee Indian man won custody of his biological daughter .

"(CNN) -- His music transcended trends and cultural barriers. Pandit Ravi Shankar's life, which traversed nearly a century, ended Tuesday. The legendary sitar player, who taught Beatle George Harrison how to play the stringed instrument and brought Indian music to the West, passed away at age 92 in the early evening in San Diego, near his home, according to his wife, Sukanya, and daughter Anoushka Shankar, who were by his side. Shankar was the father of jazz singer Norah Jones as well. He is also survived by three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, according to his record label, East Meets West Music. His health had suffered over the past year, according to a statement from his record label, and he underwent heart valve replacement surgery last Thursday. ""Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the surgeons and doctors taking care of him, his body was not able to withstand the strain of the surgery,"" his wife and daughter said. Shankar's gift went beyond his skills on the strings . In the 1960s, he took Eastern music mainstream in the West. He lent ethereal, spiritual sounds to the Fab Four through his friendship with Harrison, who recorded them on the ""Sgt. Pepper's"" album in the song ""Within You Without You."" Virtuoso performances at Monterey in 1967 and Woodstock in 1969 helped cement Shankar's place in Western musical history as an ambassador of Eastern wisdom to a generation looking for new values. ""Ravi was a great loss musically, spiritually and physically. God bless to Ravi's family. Peace & Love,"" Beatle Ringo Starr said in a statement released through a representative. Singer Peter Gabriel hailed Shankar as an inspiration who ""opened the door to non-western music for millions of people around the world."" ""He was very serious about his music, and I remember at one WOMAD performance, he stopped the music to ask his audience not to point their feet at him as that was seen as offensive in India,"" Gabriel said in a statement. ""He was also warm, witty and mischievous as a man. He will be badly missed."" Even actress Pamela Anderson weighed in tweeting one of Shankar's music videos. In Bangladesh's bloody war of separation from Pakistan in 1971, Shankar and Harrison launched what UNICEF calls the first massive fund-raising pop event, The Concert for Bangladesh, to generate donations for the flood of refugees pouring into India. Opinion: Shankar, emissary for world beat . Later, from 1986 to 1992, Shankar put his politics into practice as a member of India's upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha, or state assembly, serving with India's current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ""It was difficult, often, to judge what was more remarkable -- the man or his music,"" Singh said of Shankar on Wednesday. He praised him as one of India's ""most effective cultural ambassadors."" Both houses of parliament observed a moment of silence in his honor. Shankar's musical career had a long life before and after the '60s. He was born on April 7, 1920, and when he and Harrison met, he was already 46 and famous in India as a classical musician, according to his record label biography. His classical career outlived his counterculture fame, but he continued to meld East with West and composed concertos, which harmonized his sitar with orchestras. He played duos with American classical violin maestro Yehudi Menuhin and composed with American minimalist Philip Glass. He also wrote film music for the Hollywood movie ""Gandhi."" Shankar kept homes in the United States and India. Despite ill health, he shared a stage with his daughter Anoushka, also a sitar virtuoso, in early November. It was his last public performance.

"(CNN) -- A year after a fierce crackdown silenced erupting street protests, not many Iranians living in the country can defy the hardline Islamic government without fearing for their life. But Mohammad Reza Shajarian, is using his voice like never before. ""Art by its nature is a form of objection,"" the legendary musician said in an interview during his tour of the United States. ""It can object against love, life, or governments and when art becomes rebellious, it can intimidate governments."" Shajarian, 69, sparked his a high-profile protest last year when he publicly objected to state TV and radio broadcasting one of his most popular anthems, ""Iran, Ey Saraye Omid"" (Iran, the land of Hope), to celebrate the contested re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The song was first performed by Shajarian back in the early days of the 1979 revolution when a popular movement dethroned the Shah. Shajarian was outraged the current Iranian government used his work to drum up patriotic support. ""I'm not going to allow my own work to be used against me,"" said Shajarian, an outspoken critic of the hardline regime. In order to channel his own discontent with the escalating violence at the time, Shajarian collaborated with his colleagues and within a day composed ""Zabaneh Atash"" (Language of Fire) to capture the political and social climate of the post-election fallout. The song begins this way: . Lay down your guns! I am tired of this gruesome needless shedding of blood . Whether the gun is in your hand or another's . It is the language of fire and mayhem . Shajarian's new release became an instant hit as a battle cry especially for Iran's youth, many of whom are clamoring for change. ""You shouldn't beat people over the head with guns, you have to talk to them logically,"" Shajarian said. Shajarian spent most of his life in Iran and was one of a handful of musicians the Islamic regime allowed to stay and perform in the country after the 1979 revolution. But he has also been met with opposition and has only been able to perform in fewer than a dozen concerts in Iran over the past three decades. Shajarian's interpretations of Persian poetry is lyrical, his voice soulful. He music has captivated Iranians for decades but he has also earned international accolades, including the UNESCO Mozart Medal, the Golden Picasso Medal and two Grammy nominations. In an effort to encourage cross cultural dialogue and reinvigorate Iran's traditional music profile, Shajarian recently toured Australia, the United States and Canada with 16-member Shahnaz Ensamble, comprised of some of Iran's finest classical musicians. Also on stage with him was his daughter Mojgan, who is breaking barriers as a solo female vocalist. Under Iranian law, women can only perform in part of a larger group and soloists are limited to women-only audiences. ""It doesn't make any logical sense to forbid women from singing solo,"" Shajarian said. ""There is this impression that a women's voice can arouse a man but does a man's voice not arouse a women? What kind of arousal?"" Shajarian remains a strong voice of the Iranian people. He is a voice for change.","Iranian musician is using his voice like never before .

"(CNN) -- As an estimated one billion people around the globe take part in events to mark the 42nd Earth Day, Paolo Nespoli's images provide a striking reminder of our planet's awe-inspiring beauty and fragility as an eco-system. During a six-month mission to the International Space Station (ISS) last year, the Italian astronaut snapped around 26,000 images, posting daily updates on Twitter. ""I really tried to capture what I was seeing. I was amazed by the response from people. It was very fulfilling for me. I was doing something which was very interesting for me, but it made me more happy that I could share the images,"" Nespoli said. Nespoli explained to CNN what it's like to see the world ""turning around your feet"" and the unique perspective space travel provides on our planet and humans' collective impact on it. Describe the view of Earth from space? Paolo Nespoli: ""It's a most unreal view you have from up there. It's look as though it's painted. One of the things you gain up there is an appreciation of planet Earth as a kind of ship. It looks like a ship flying in space. ""A lot of the time you're up there you are working so you don't have a lot of time to look out of the window. When you do, most of the time you see oceans and clouds -- which is really nice. ""But it really takes a little bit of time before you acquire a perception of where you are and what you are looking at and how to look at it in the best way. ""After a month, a month and a half, something strange happens -- you look out of the window and you know where you are. You might be over Australia, Africa, you just know. It's amazing how you just develop this."" How high does the ISS orbit? PN: We are 400 kilometers (248 miles) above the Earth and fly at a velocity of 20,000 kilometers-per-hour (12,400 mph) -- the equivalent of about 7.7 kilometers-per-second (4.8 miles-per-second). How did traveling to space change your outlook on Earth? PN: ""I felt like a human being, a terrestrial guy -- not an Italian or a European. I felt like an earthling. ""You get an appreciation of how delicate the planet is. You see the atmosphere which covers the Earth like a blanket. It looked like if I would blow on it too hard it would float away. We know if that get's corrupted in a certain way that's the end."" How do you think humans are affecting the planet? PN: ""The impact we are having on this planet is surely microscopic when we look at one single event, but when you look at it and you repeat these events all over - a few miles across here, a few miles across there, a river here, a river there, a city here, a city there -- and it's clear we are a major force in shaping the crust of this planet and its clear we have the capability of imparting changes. ""I cannot say we are bad, or that we are causing the planet to go hot or cold. We don't have enough data. But it's clear that we are doing things that have a huge potential of making changes. We need to understand more. It's a risky situation with a very delicate eco-system balance which can be dramatically skewed."" Thoughts on the future of space travel? PN: ""I think space travel will become successful as a tourism activity. I wish everybody could go up there and see the world from a different point of view, with different eyes. ""I would, for sure, send up the politicians (some of them we should leave there!) to change the way they think, but I would also send up philosophers, journalists and theologians.""","Italian astronaut captures amazing images of Earth from International Space Station .

"(CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed four suspected militants Friday, intelligence officials said. It was the latest in a spate of suspected drone attacks that the United States has carried out in Pakistan since U.S. forces killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in the early morning hours of May 2. The suspected drone fired two missiles on a vehicle in the area of Miran Shah of North Waziristan, a region near Pakistan's border that is rife with Islamic extremists, two intelligence officials said. They asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Suspected U.S. drone strikes, a source of tension between the two nations, have increased in pace in Pakistan since bin Laden's death. The United States has carried out six suspected drone strikes in Pakistan in the past 15 days, according to a CNN count based on information from Pakistani intelligence sources. That works out to an average of one strike every 2.5 days. From January 1 through May 5, by contrast, the United States conducted 20 suspected strikes, an average of one drone strike every six days, according to CNN's count. The recent increase, however, probably is not due to intelligence gained from bin Laden's compound, Bill Roggio, a military affairs analyst and editor of the Long War Journal, has said. ""This uptick is not unusual from a recent historical perspective, he said. ""What has happened, since the bin Laden raid, is that the U.S. has not felt pressured to dial back the attacks due to Pakistani sensibilities."" The United States has conducted a string of drone strikes in a fairly short time period before, he said, while at other times several weeks have passed without such a strike. He attributes a lull in the first months of this year to tension between the United States and Pakistan over the arrest of CIA contractor Raymond Davis and other disputes between the countries' intelligence services. Authorities in Pakistan detained Davis after he shot and killed two men in what he described as a case of self-defense. Davis was released after a payment was made to the men's families.","A suspected drone strike has killed four suspected militants .

The hotel staff contacted rangers around 5 p.m. when Stensby had not yet returned. Park officials conducted a search on foot with a dog team and a California Highway Patrol helicopter, and Stensby's body was found at the base of the 317-foot waterfall around 6 p.m. Monday, the release said.

"(CNN) -- Four suspected U.S. drone strikes have pounded Pakistan's tribal region since the American military killed terror leader Osama bin Laden, actions that signal an uptick in the U.S. fight against Islamic militants. The latest was Friday, when four suspected militants died in the Datta Khel region of North Waziristan, according to two Pakistani intelligence officials, who said an unmanned aircraft fired four missiles at a militant's vehicle. Drone strikes have been controversial in Pakistan because of concerns over civilian deaths and disrespect for Pakistan's sovereignty. ""I don't think the U.S. cares about the Pakistani sensibilities,"" said Bill Roggio, a military-affairs analyst. ""I think it's game back on."" North Waziristan is one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, and Datta Khel has a strong presence of militants, Roggio said. Based on a count by the CNN Islamabad bureau, Friday's suspected drone strike was the 24th so far this year compared to 111 in all of 2010. The Long War Journal, a website that provides analyses and reporting on war-related matters, said the U.S. military launched only two strikes in April and seven in March, in both North Waziristan and South Waziristan. Roggio, the managing editor of The Long War Journal, told CNN that there have been drone-strike pauses during spring months in the past, but he said the latest lull came during problems between the United States and Pakistan. He cited the disagreements over the case of Raymond Davis, the CIA contractor who had been incarcerated and later released after allegedly shooting and killing two Pakistanis, and Pakistani rage about a couple of the drone strikes. But Roggio said he believes the dynamics have changed after bin Laden was killed May 2 in a hideout in the Pakistani military garrison town of Abbottabad. He said there's a lot of U.S. impatience with the Pakistanis and that's ""no big secret after the bin Laden raid."" He emphasized that the Pakistani military hasn't taken on militants in the Datta Khel region, which Roggio calls a ""snake pit"" and a ""known al Qaeda hub."" ""It's clear now they are just gonna keep doing it,"" he said, referring to the drone strikes. The other drone strikes since bin Laden's death occurred last Friday, Tuesday, and Thursday. North Waziristan is in the same dangerous northwestern Pakistani swath as the district of Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where a twin suicide bombing killed at least 80 people on Friday. The province borders Mohmand Agency, one of the seven district tribal regions where the Pakistani Taliban members are based. The Pakistani Taliban said it carried out the bombing in retaliation for the killing of terror leader Osama bin Laden. Nearly all of those slain were military recruits who had just completed their training, a government official said. About 140 others were injured. Mohmand is believed to be a hideout for Taliban fighters and al Qaeda-linked militants fleeing last year's military operation in the district of South Waziristan and ongoing U.S. drone strikes in North Waziristan. The Pakistani army has carried out numerous ground and air operations in Mohmand but they haven't been able to stamp out the militants. Last December, around 150 militants ambushed six security checkpoints in Mohmand, killing 11 Pakistani soldiers, officials told CNN. Earlier in December, a twin suicide attack targeting a government building in Mohmand killed at least 40 people. Roggio said the Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based. They make attacks on Pakistani targets and cross the border into Afghanistan for attacks, Roggio said. They are different from the Afghan Taliban, focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. The group is headquartered in Quetta, Pakistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, and have close links to al Qaeda, Roggio said.

"ANGOLA, Louisiana (CNN) -- He is not a killer, but the state of Louisiana is determined to execute Patrick Kennedy for his crime. Patrick Kennedy, 43, is on Louisiana's death row for the rape of his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The New Orleans native faces that reality as he sits on death row at Louisiana's maximum security prison, the largest prison in the nation. The Louisiana State Penitentiary, or Angola Prison, is the size of Manhattan and surrounded on three sides by the Mississippi River. Unlike the 3,300 inmates awaiting execution nationwide -- including the 94 other men at Angola -- Kennedy, 43, is a convicted rapist. The victim was his 8-year-old stepdaughter. For the first time in 44 years, a state is preparing to execute a man for a felony other than murder. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether Louisiana can use capital punishment in child rape cases. The constitutional question before the justices is whether the death penalty for violent crimes other than homicide constitutes ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. The high-profile examination of the death penalty also raises anew a national debate over selective prosecution and race. ""A lot of people think there should not be the death penalty [in this case] because the child survives,"" said Kate Bartholomew, a sex crimes prosecutor in New Orleans. ""In my opinion the rape of a child is more heinous and more hideous than a homicide."" Kennedy's appellate attorney, Billy Sothern, argues, ""When we look at what it means to be cruel and unusual, this is exactly the kind of thing that raises these serious concerns of the constitutionality of Mr. Kennedy's death sentence."" Kennedy was sentenced to die in 2003 for sexually assaulting his stepdaughter in her bed. The crime occurred in a quiet neighborhood in Harvey, across the big river from New Orleans. Besides severe emotional trauma, Louisiana prosecutors said the attack caused internal injuries and bleeding to the child, requiring extensive surgery. The former moving company driver had claimed two teenage boys committed the crime near the family's garage, a story the girl -- identified in court papers as ""L.H."" -- repeated for 18 months after the ordeal. An African-American teenager was initially arrested, based on Kennedy's allegations, but later was cleared of any wrongdoing. Kennedy also is African-American. Police in Jefferson Parish quickly turned their suspicions on him as the attacker. The girl later accused her stepfather, after she returned home from a temporary stay in foster care. Kennedy has denied the charges, but the state supreme court upheld the conviction and punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court, both in 1976 and a year later, banned capital punishment for rape -- and by implication any other crime except murder. But Louisiana 19 years later passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers contended the earlier high court cases pertained only to ""adult women."" Death penalty opponents say Louisiana is the only state to actively pursue lethal injection for child rapists, and argue, among other things, that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims. ""If they're going to face the death penalty for raping a child, why would they leave a living witness?"" said Judy Benitez, executive director of the Louisiana Foundation against Sexual Assaults. Benitez also says testifying in a death penalty case can be deeply traumatic for child. And the risk of wrongful prosecution may be higher is such cases since children might prove to be unreliable witnesses for the prosecution, because of their susceptibility to suggestive, leading questions. No one in the United States has been executed for rape since 1964. Other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason, aggravated kidnapping, drug trafficking, aircraft hijacking and espionage. None of these crimes have been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades, if ever. In the appeal filed with the high court, Sothern argues Louisiana ""flouts the overwhelming national consensus that capital punishment is an inappropriate penalty for any kind of rape."" The law's supporters counter that besides murder, no crime is more deserving of the death penalty, and the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances. For its victims, ""It takes away their innocence, it takes away their childhood, it mutilates their spirit. It kills their soul. They're never the same after these things happen,"" said Bartholomew, an assistant district attorney in Orleans Parish. ""Louisiana has been a pro-death penalty state for a very long time,"" the prosecutor added. ""And I think a lot of people agree with the death penalty for this type of case here in our state."" Five other states have similar laws. Four of them -- Florida, Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina -- have had them for years but not applied them in decades. Texas enacted its version in June, but no defendant has yet been designated death-eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana. Skin color has also played a role in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape. ""When we look at the death penalty in the South we always need to be conscious of the role that race plays,"" said Sothern, deputy director at the Capital Appeals Project, which represents all the state's death row inmates. ""And I think that the fact that Mr. Kennedy [is] a black from Jefferson Parish, a place with a troubling record of racial discrimination, I think that that speaks volumes."" Sothern cites Department of Justice statistics showing that all 14 rapists executed by Louisiana in the past 75 years were African-American. Nationwide from 1930 to 1964, nearly 90 percent of executed rapists were black, he said. Kennedy recently was joined on Louisiana's death row by another child rapist -- Richard Davis, who is white. Davis' legal appeals have barely begun. The justices will no doubt consider loneliness of Louisiana's aggressive position when deciding whether a national consensus now exists to allow a broader range of crimes to become subject to capital punishment. The high court has in recent years banned execution for the mentally retarded, underage killers and those receiving an inadequate defense at trial. Angola prison officials would not make Kennedy available for comment. The youngster at the center of the case is now in college and wants to be a lawyer. Her family says that like most underage victims, she has been scarred forever, and they believe her assailant deserves the jury's punishment. ""It's going to be justice,"" said Lynn Ray, the victim's cousin. ""It's going to be that she can look forwards and not backwards, and not have to look over your shoulders, and one day see him. Or see him coming after her."" A ruling from the high court is expected by late June. E-mail to a friend .","Supreme Court hears arguments Wednesday .

"Granite Falls, Minnesota (CNN) -- As a boy in Ireland, Francis Markey dreamed of becoming a priest and serving parishioners all over the world. His dream of ordination came true, but his relationship with parishioners has become the object of international scrutiny. Now 82 years old, Markey is sitting in an Indiana jail awaiting extradition to Ireland to face the charge that he raped a boy more than 40 years ago. His story is part of a growing crisis in the Irish Catholic Church, which has recently admitted its leaders hid, moved and even exported suspected pedophile priests abroad to cover up horrific crimes. Deeply Catholic Ireland has been badly shaken by a government-backed report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other church authorities covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004. Child sexual abuse was widespread then, the report found. Pope Benedict XVI said Wednesday that he has finished writing an official statement, or pastoral letter, on the child abuse scandal facing the Irish church and he is expected to release the letter on Saturday. The head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, said Wednesday that the church's response to abuse had been ""hopelessly inadequate."" As a priest, Markey was first suspended in 1964 and sent for psychiatric treatment in Dublin. Throughout the '60s and '70s he was suspended and sent for treatment three times. Eventually, he was sent to New Mexico, where the Catholic church ran a treatment facility for priests with various addictions and sexual problems. In 1982, Markey resurfaced in the tiny Minnesota town of Granite Falls to fill in for a priest at the small parish of St. Andrew. It was there and then that a boy would come to the priest's home, just across the street from church, and find himself in Markey's arms. ""As I was leaving, he gave me a hug and as he did so he stuck his tongue down my throat,"" that person, now grown, told CNN. ""He had been drinking. ... I can't say if he was drunk but he was definitely drinking."" The man, who requested anonymity, said the abuse never went further. But Markey's arrest in Indiana, based on the accusation against him in Ireland, has refocused attention not only on the Irish church, but also on the secrets of a small-town Minnesota parish. ""To this day, I wonder how many people ... had encounters with him,"" said the man who says Markey kissed him as a child. Markey's attorney did not return calls from CNN. The Rev. James Moran, the St. Andrew priest who Markey filled in for in the early '80s, said he knew nothing of the allegations against Markey. But the diocese overseeing St. Andrew told CNN that Markey was sent from the church to treatment because parents were concerned he had an ""unnatural attraction to minor males."" He never returned to the parish. Now, decades later, some of Markey's former Granite Falls parishioners may see their old priest again -- in the benches of a courtroom in Ireland, where he is expected to stand trial.","Francis Markey awaits extradition on charge he raped a boy 40 years ago .

It's still out there, with elevated levels in most states, and can have serious consequences. But the reported activity of influenza-like illness has decreased nationwide. The most recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, released Friday, concludes that ""influenza activity remained elevated in the United States, but decreased in most areas"" in the week of January 27 to February 2, for which the latest information is available. What to do if you have the flu . In the latest report, 38 states reported widespread influenza activity, down from 42 the week before. Although the proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness, 3.6%, is still above the national baseline of 2.2%, it is lower than the previous week's estimate of 4.2%. The disease is still claiming lives, however. ""The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was above the epidemic threshold,"" the report said. The number of pediatric deaths from influenza rose by 14, for a total of 59 this season. While that is more than the 34 pediatric deaths for all of last year's season, it is much lower than the 153 pediatric deaths in the 2003 to 2004 season, which saw a similar H3N2 virus responsible for a lot of illness, for example. Adult deaths due to flu are not tracked by the CDC. Populations most at risk of serious illness from the flu should see their doctor if they become ill, CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden said previously. These include very young children, senior citizens and people with underlying health conditions. If a patient is short of breath or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. But most patients should not go to an emergency room, he said. Just get plenty of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. Does influenza sorbet relieve your flu symptoms? The flu vaccine is about 62% effective, but it's the best tool available to prevent the illness, health officials say.","CDC: 38 states reported widespread influenza activity from January 27 to February 2 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court focused Wednesday on whether ""evolving standards of decency"" in the United States forbid a resumption of capital punishment for any felony but murder. But the justices offered no clear indication of how they will rule in the case of a man who is on Louisiana death row for raping a child. Patrick Kennedy, 43, is on Louisiana's death row for the rape of his 8-year-old stepdaughter. ""The trend since 1995 has been more and more states are passing statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that do not result in death"" to the victims, said Chief Justice John Roberts, who appeared to support the state's position. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer expressed concern about applying the death penalty fairly. ""It gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed,"" Breyer said, summarizing the position of death penalty opponents. He wondered whether degrees of child abuse could be capital eligible, including molestation not involving intercourse. Patrick Kennedy, 43, would be the first convicted rapist in 44 years to be executed in a case in which the victim was not killed. He was sentenced to die in 2003 for sexually assaulting his 8-year-old stepdaughter in her bed. In addition to severe emotional trauma, the attack caused internal injuries and bleeding to the child, requiring extensive surgery, Louisiana prosecutors said. Both in 1976 and a year later, the U.S. Supreme Court banned capital punishment for rape -- and, by implication, any other crime except murder. But 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers argued that the earlier high court cases pertained only to ""adult women."" In oral arguments Wednesday, Kennedy's lawyer, Jeffrey Fisher, faced spirited questioning from several conservative justices. ""Our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be [for] particularly heinous crimes,"" Justice Antonin Scalia said. ""And one could say the rape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a child of 12 or under."" But Fisher said Louisiana's law ""is particularly at odds with national values"" on whether the death penalty should be expanded. The high court has in recent years banned execution for the mentally retarded, underage killers and those receiving an inadequate defense at trial. Those exceptions drew a good deal of interest from the justices in the one-hour argument over what the trend now is. ""What about treason?"" asked Justice Anthony Kennedy, a possible swing vote. He noted that the European Convention on Human Rights generally opposes the death penalty, except for treason. ""You can slaughter your fellow citizens, but if you offend the state, you can be put to death."" And Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz told the high court that ""few evolving standards are more pronounced than the growing understanding in modern society of the unique and irreparable harm caused by violent child rape."" Florida, Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have long had death-penalty laws for rape but have not applied them in decades. Texas enacted a version in June, but no defendant has been designated death-eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana. Texas and other states have submitted a ""friend of the court"" brief in the case, supporting Louisiana's position. Kennedy recently was joined on Louisiana's death row by another child rapist, Richard Davis. Davis' legal appeals have barely begun. Arguing for the state, Juliet Clark, Jefferson Parish assistant district attorney, described in some detail the injuries suffered by the victim in an attack Clark called ""savage."" In their appeal, Kennedy's lawyers repeatedly raised the issue of skin color and whether that has played a factor in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape. Kennedy and the victim are both African-American. Billy Sothern of the Capital Appeals Project cited Department of Justice statistics that all 14 rapists executed by Louisiana in the past 75 years or so were African-American. Nationwide from 1930 to 1964, nearly 90 percent of executed rapists were black, he said. But race did not come up in court Wednesday. No one in the United States has been executed for rape since 1964. Other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason, aggravated kidnapping, drug trafficking, aircraft hijacking and espionage. None of these crimes has been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades, if ever. Supporters of Louisiana's law say that besides murder, no crime is more deserving of the death penalty, and that the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances. Death penalty opponents contend, among other things, that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims. A ruling is expected by late June.

"(CNN) -- My friend Christine was into yoga long before it went mainstream, and she was good at it. She attended yoga camps, went on a yearly trek to India and even ritually cleansed her sinuses with warm saltwater -- literally sucked it up through her nose. She claimed it possessed a healing value and kept her from getting a cold. That was the '70s. She tried to convince me back then that yoga would be good for me, that it would loosen up my muscles and increase my body's longevity. I wanted nothing to do with it. ""Are you kidding?"" I said. ""I can't stand still for two minutes, and you want me to do yoga?"" Yoga: Tap into the many health benefits . I loved running and playing sports like soccer and volleyball, things that kept me moving all the time. The idea of stretching didn't really appeal to me. Neither, for that matter, did sucking saltwater into my nose. Twenty-five years went by, and lo and behold, I found that my body was getting more and more prone to injury, just like Christine predicted. The breaking point came six years ago, when I injured my hamstring at the beginning of Grandma's Marathon in Minnesota and ended up walking 21 miles to finish the race in six hours and 14 minutes. Not exactly the kind of record I had been hoping to set. I figured if I wanted to keep being able to run, I had better learn how to stand still. Fortunately, I learned that there are different flavors of yoga. I tried Iyengar Yoga at first, and I can definitely see the appeal -- it's a slower, more meditative practice, good for feeling centered and grounded. But Iyengar also uses a lot of props, and I didn't like that kind of interruption. It made it harder for me to get into a rhythm. Then one day I was working out at my gym when I noticed a class doing a very different kind of yoga -- power yoga, or Ashtanga. No props, no time wasted, and the people were in constant motion. Granted, it was a more ""sedentary"" motion, if you will -- a series of poses like Downward Facing Dog and Warrior and Triangle -- but they switched from one to the other so fast it felt like a real workout. In fact, the only thing I didn't like about Ashtanga was that the pace really wore me out. Turns out that the 30-something yoga students were in better shape than the Marathon Man. Why you really should get 'Fit By 40' Over time, I've improved -- and not just physically. Sure, my muscles feel looser than they have in years, and . I'm avoiding injuries as I grow older. My teacher, Janice, even tells me that my poses are improving. There's more than that, though. Call it a cliche, but yoga really does feed your soul as much as it does your body. I've learned that as much as I love being active and on the go, it really is necessary to take time out of each day to slow down, to forget about your computer, your smartphone and all those e-mails, to take some time away from your kids and your job and your responsibilities. To stop moving and focus simply on staying put. Now, does that mean I'll start inhaling saltwater sometime soon? My sinuses are doing just fine without it, thanks. But yoga has become a valuable part of my life, and it can do good things for you, too.

"(CNN) -- At least 24 people, including 10 children, were killed when a massive tornado struck an area outside Oklahoma City on Monday afternoon, officials said. At least seven of those children were killed at Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, Oklahoma, police said. Emergency personnel scoured the school's rubble -- a scene of twisted I-beams and crumbled cinder blocks. The tornado was 1.3 miles wide as it moved through Moore, in the southern part of the Oklahoma City metropolitan area, the National Weather Service said. The estimated peak wind ranged from 200 to 210 mph, which would make it an EF5, the most powerful category of tornado possible, according to the agency. Latest updates: . -- The number of people injured during the devastating tornado is 353, Gov. Mary Fallin's office said in a statement Wednesday evening. -- Moore, Oklahoma, Mayor Glenn Lewis said Wednesday that the last six people missing from this week's tornado have been accounted for. Five were found alive. The sixth is dead, and the body was located at the medical examiner's office. The mayor was not sure whether that death was included in the official count of 24. -- About 4,000 insurance claims have been filed so far, said Kelly Collins, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Insurance Department. Previously reported: . -- President Obama will travel to tornado-ravaged Oklahoma on Sunday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. -- Residents of Moore will be allowed back into their neighborhoods as of 3 p.m. local time Wednesday, Mayor Glenn Lewis said . Light vehicles will be allowed but heavy equipment, trailers and satellite trucks will be prohibited, he said. Press will be allowed, but the media will have to be out by dark . -- About 10,000 customers in Moore still don't have power, down from a high of 37,000, Gov. Mary Fallin's office said. -- Insurance claims related to damage from Monday's tornado and storm in metropolitan Oklahoma City are likely to top $2 billion, said Collins. -- The state Medical Examiner's Office, which is starting to release the names of the people who died in the disaster, said 10 of the 24 people who died are children. -- The mayor of Moore said he'll try to get an ordinance passed requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new housing projects. ""I have six councilmen, and I need four votes to get it passed,"" Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN on Wednesday. -- The seven child victims at Plaza Towers Elementary were in a classroom -- not a basement -- and they did not die from flooding, Moore Fire Department Chief Gary Bird told CNN on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Oklahoma Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb told CNN the children had drowned in a school basement. -- Craig Fugate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told CNN the agency is in ""good shape"" to support the recovery in Oklahoma and in other disaster zones, such as rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy in New Jersey and New York. ""We got full allocation last year with the Sandy supplemental funds. We are looking to continue the response here as well as the previous disasters. If we have another hurricane, we may need more money,"" he said Wednesday. -- About 2,400 homes were damaged in Moore and Oklahoma City, said Jerry Lojka of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.

"(CNN) -- Arriving at an airport and jumping into a taxi is the preferred option for most, and a necessary expense for time-pressed business travelers. But try passing off a $300 airport to city center fare and your accounts department may like to have a chat with you when you return to the office. That's how much the average cab ride from Tokyo's Narita airport into the city center costs, making it the world's most expensive, according to a new survey by British foreign exchange company, Moneycorp. By comparison a single ticket on the Narita Express train to the heart of Tokyo costs $28. Tokyo's main international airport is 66 kilometers (41 miles) from the city, explaining a large part of the expense. Despite a weakening currency, making the journey almost 10% cheaper than at the same time last year, Japan remains an expensive destination for many visitors. Click on the map to learn how much each airport to city center taxi fare costs. Per kilometer the taxi journey from Narita costs $4.42, but is not the priciest by distance. That dubious honor goes to Copenhagen. Despite being only 8 kilometers from the city center of the Danish capital, an average taxi fare from the airport cost $50 ($6.50 per kilometer). Geneva in Switzerland is the next most expensive fare per kilometer. Visitors to Oslo's Gardermoen airport and Milan's Malpensa will also have to budget in high transfer costs; the Norwegian capital and Italian city costing visitors $112 and $106 respectively to reach the city center. Both cities are over 40 kilometers from the airports. ""It's interesting that some of the biggest variations in taxi costs are in mainland Europe,"" said Tracey Tivnan of Moneycorp in a press statement. ""For example, the taxi fare from Milan Malpensa airport to the city center will cost you more than Â£70 ($106). This compares to just Â£2.17 ($3.30) from Sofia airport to the center of Sofia."" Elsewhere, of the popular destinations surveyed, the cheapest airport taxi fares can be found in Asia. The traffic-choked ride into Delhi costing on average $4.10, and Bangkok, $8.58.","New survey shows most expensive taxi rides from airports to city centers .

"(CNN) -- Oilfield services giant Halliburton will plead guilty to destroying computer test results that had been sought as evidence in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Company officials threw out test results that showed ""little difference"" between the number of devices Halliburton said was needed to center the cement casing in the well at the heart of the disaster and the number well owner BP installed, according to court papers. The issue has been key point of contention between the two companies in hearings and litigation ever since the April 2010 blowout. BP and Halliburton are still battling over responsibility for the disaster in a New Orleans federal courtroom. BP had no comment on the plea agreement Thursday evening. The Deepwater Horizon blowout killed 11 rig workers and unleashed the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. The federal government estimates more than 200 million gallons poured out of the ruptured well, located nearly a mile underwater off southeastern Louisiana. The environmental effects of the disaster are still being determined, and BP says it has paid out $32 billion for cleanup, compensation and penalties. The Halliburton tests, which used a computer simulation, were run in May and June 2010. After each of the two rounds of tests, a Halliburton executive ordered the simulations destroyed, the charges state. ""During ensuing civil litigation and federal criminal investigation by the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, subsequent efforts to forensically recover the deleted Displace 3D computer simulations from May/June 2010 were unsuccessful,"" according to prosecutors. In a court filing in 2011, BP accused Halliburton of destroying evidence -- including ""inexplicably missing"" computer modeling results -- ""to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial."" Halliburton has agreed to pay the maximum fines available, be put on probation for three years and cooperate with federal agencies that are still investigating the spill, the Justice Department said in a statement announcing Thursday's agreement. In addition Halliburton has made a $55 million ""voluntary contribution"" to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a payment ""that was not conditioned on the court's acceptance of its plea agreement."" A federal report in 2011 concluded that BP, Halliburton and Deepwater Horizon owner Transocean all violated federal offshore safety regulations and shared responsibility for the disaster. Halliburton is the last of the three major players to admit criminal wrongdoing in the 2010 blowout and resulting oil spill. BP has admitted to manslaughter and 13 other criminal counts and agreed to pay $4 billion in fines, while Transocean admitted to violating the Clean Water Act and paid $1.4 billion in civil and criminal penalties. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Halliburton destroyed computer tests after Deepwater Horizon, prosecutors say .

"(Financial Times) -- Lambeth Palace has ordered an independent inquiry into investments made by the Church of England's £5.2bn investment fund after the Financial Times revealed that it had indirectly invested in Wonga, the payday lender. The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was ""embarrassed"" and ""irritated"" that the Church Commissioners had indirectly invested in Wonga, the payday lending firm that he has vowed to ""compete out"" of business by encouraging credit unions to be set up in churches across the country. In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Friday morning, Justin Welby said that the amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was about £75,000 out of investments totalling £5.2bn. The church, which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in payday lending, invests in Accel Partners, the US venture capital firm that led Wonga's 2009 fundraising. He said: ""Now, it shouldn't happen, it's very embarrassing, but these things do happen. We have to find out why and make sure it doesn't happen again."" ""We can't say that we tolerate bad things but we have to live in the real world . . . how do you actually live in the complexity of today."" When asked if capitalism was amoral, he said: ""I don't think capitalism is necessarily amoral, it can sometimes be immoral but it is not of itself immoral."" Lambeth Palace said an independent inquiry would be launched into how ""this serious inconsistency"" occurred. Jonathan Bartley, co-director of Ekklesia, the religious think-tank, told the BBC that the church had acted within its own investment guidelines. ""I don't think the Church of England needs an inquiry . . . if you look at its policies, they're very clear. The Church of England can invest in payday loan companies, or those that invest in payday loan companies, provided it's not more than 25 per cent of their business,"" he said. ""The 25% figure is exactly the same for pornography, gambling . . . in armaments it's 10 per cent. They've gone down a route to maximise their profits; they're absolutely explicit that they want to make 5 per cent above the rate of inflation."" Archbishop Welby has been a prominent critic of short-term lenders, and has previously supported the introduction of a cap on the amount an individual can borrow from these companies. In an interview with the magazine Total Politics published this week, he revealed he had met with Errol Damelin, founder and chief executive of Wonga, to inform him of the Church's plans to go head-to-head with him on short-term loans. ""I said to him quite bluntly we're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we're trying to compete you out of existence,"" said the Archbishop. The Church's plan revolves around opening its network of 15,000 church premises to existing credit unions and offering volunteers to help run them. The Church has played an increasingly active role in the debate over ethical banking in recent months, both as an investor and because Archbishop Welby was an outspoken member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","The amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was about £75,000 out of investments totalling £5.2bn.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Three weeks after BP plugged its crippled Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico with cement and mud from above, crews are ""fishing"" for pieces of drill pipe that need to be removed from inside the well's blowout preventer before crews can move on to the ""bottom kill"" -- the permanent fix for the well. Once those pieces of drill pipe are retrieved, crews will be able to replace the Macondo well's old blowout preventer with a new one awaiting use on the nearby ship, the Development Driller II, BP spokeswoman Catherine Hill confirmed Thursday. Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist on Thursday discontinued a state of emergency for the Keys (Monroe County) and 18 other peninsula coastal counties threatened by the spill. Seven Panhandle counties -- Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay, Gulf and Franklin -- are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid, Crist's office said in a statement. Thad Allen, the man in charge of the government response to the Gulf oil crisis, said Wednesday that the ""fishing"" operations had been delayed by a buildup of hydrates -- chemicals that form at low temperatures and high pressures toward the sea floor -- that temporarily jammed the cap that trapped oil in the well starting on July 15. Crews flushed the system to loosen the cap and began ""fishing"" through the top of the well again. BP definitely plans to remove at least two smaller, cut pieces of pipe, but the status of a third, longer piece of drill pipe is unclear -- and that will affect how crews proceed, Allen said. He added that they are trying to determine if the third piece was affected by the cement poured into the top of the well during the ""static kill,"" process at the beginning of August -- and if so, how. Crews are trying to determine what to do if they can't retrieve the third piece of pipe. They may have to try to remove the old blowout prevent with the third piece of drill pipe still attached, Allen said. The retired Coast Guard admiral said Wednesday he is ""hesitant"" to give out any timeline for the process until they figure out the condition of the third piece of drill pipe. Crews need to replace the blowout preventer to ensure that the pressure inside the Macondo well will remain at a safe level when they intercept the Macondo well through a relief well at nearly 18,000 feet deep. ""Our first goal is to do no harm,"" Allen said in a teleconference last week. Investigators also want to examine the original blowout preventer, which did not work properly to choke off the well as it should have. Once the new blowout preventer is in place and Allen gives crews the green light to resume drilling, it will take them about four days to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the ""bottom kill"" process of plugging the well from below will begin. Allen has said cementing will require another several days. The environmental disaster began after an April 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 men. Two days later, the platform sank and oil from the Macondo well underwater started gushing into the Gulf. Investigators don't want the drill pipe to damage the blowout preventer because they want to see it ""as is"" to determine the blowout preventer's role in the calamity. The government says 205.8 million gallons of oil escaped from the well before it was sealed on July 15. Even though oil has not flowed from the well site since July 15, seven Panhandle counties including Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay, Gulf and Franklin are to remain under an extended state of emergency in order to qualify for economic aid under state and federal disaster guidelines. There have been no reported physical oil impacts to the Keys from the April 20 Transocean/BP explosion and subsequent spill, according to Captain Pat DeQuattro, sector Coast Guard Key West sector commander .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities announced Saturday the arrest of a drug kingpin -- nicknamed ""El Kilo"" -- based in the country's northeast and suspected of having links to the mass graves recently found in the region. Security forces have captured Martin Omar Estrada Luna, who is a presumed leader of the Zetas drug cartel in San Fernando, a town in the border state of Tamaulipas, the government said in a statement. No information was immediately provided on how, when or where he was detained. Mexico's attorney general had previously identified Estrada Luna as one of three prime suspects behind the mass graves. Authorities began finding the graves earlier this month during an investigation into a report of the kidnapping of passengers from a bus in late March. The investigation led them to San Fernando -- the same place where in August of last year, the bodies of 72 migrants were found at a ranch. Officials recovered 10 more bodies from the clandestine graves Wednesday and Thursday, bringing the total number of bodies found to 126, state attorney general's spokesman Ruben Dario Rios Lopez said. In the wake of the grisly discovery, the Tamaulipas state governor appointed a new head of public security. Tamaulipas is one of Mexico's most active states when it comes to drug trafficking. The Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel operate in the state and have strongholds there. The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and also for the deaths of the 72 migrants found last year. One of its presumed members, Jose Manuel Garcia Soto, was arrested earlier this month and is a suspect in the killing of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata. Nationwide, the Mexican government says there have been some 35,000 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on the cartels in December 2006.

"Washington (CNN) -- Without Huma Abedin publicly forgiving him, it is unlikely that Anthony Weiner would be running to become New York's next mayor. ""If his wife had not been by his side, Weiner's hot dog would be cooked,"" said Ana Navarro, a Republican political consultant and CNN contributor. From the start of Weiner's campaign, Huma Abedin's blessing had been critical. Once Weiner acknowledged a desire to run for mayor, a year after the former New York congressman resigned over a sexting scandal in 2011, Abedin blessed her husband's political aspirations in a number of high profile interviews. Borger: Weiner's problem is our problem, too . And on Tuesday, after another round of sexting allegations emerged, Abedin once again stood beside him and publicly announced her forgiveness. ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony,"" Abedin said. ""It was not an easy choice in any way, but I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage."" Huma Abedin steps from scandal's shadow into spotlight . Political consultants, psychologists and crisis communicators all give different opinions on why Abedin, a powerful Washington adviser and close confidant to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, publicly forgave her husband. But by standing next to Weiner on Tuesday, Abedin joins a long line of political wives -- including Clinton, her mentor -- who stood next to their men as they answered questions about sexual impropriety. Winning back trust -- from your wife . Most experts said if Abedin hadn't stood next to him, Weiner's campaign for mayor could have been finished. Instead the campaign is severely damaged, but not irreparably. ""From a communication standpoint, I or any other person in my field would say the same thing. Tell the truth, get your wife up there with you, get her support and win the election,"" crisis communication expert Robbie Vorhaus said. Vorhaus said that winning the support of the person closest to you -- the person whose trust you damaged the most -- is the most important part of that formula. Opinion: Why does Weiner's wife stay? ""Once you have a wife, a spouse, standing up there and saying, 'I forgive him,' what right do we have, theoretically, to hold it against him,"" Vorhaus said. ""The truth is the ultimate spin and if he comes out and says, 'I made a mistake, I made my peace with my wife and she has forgiven me and now I want to be mayor of New York.' What do you, as a voter, say?"" Calls for 'Carlos Danger' to step aside pour in . Does a wife's blessing help make a political comeback? ""Yes, it is critical,"" said Don Goldberg, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton and a partner at the Bluetext communications company. But that might be changing, he said. ""I think we are in a real transition period here,"" he said. As proof, Goldberg points to newly elected Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina. After the then-governor admitted to sneaking away to Argentina to be with his mistress in June 2009, Jenny Sanford moved out of the governor's mansion and later divorced him. But Sanford, after offering a mea culpa to the people of South Carolina, triumphed in special election last month. ""I think the conventional wisdom that the wife has to be supportive and that they can't be out there trashing you,"" Goldberg said. ""South Carolina may show that is changing, though."" Congress, lewd photos and NYC's mayoral race: An Anthony Weiner timeline . Politics and publicity . Women in Abedin's position are in a no-win situation, said Dr. Jeff Gardere, a clinical psychologist. ""If they don't stand by that person, their family could be very much hurt by this,"" he said. There are a number of reasons that women stay with an unfaithful man, Gardere said: Children, religious beliefs, a feeling that they can change. But when politics and publicity are involved, the situation is dramatically altered. Hillary Clinton was with her husband in January 1998 when he denied having ""sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."" Though she notably distanced herself from him as they later walked to Marine One, the duo is still married today. ""I think the campaign is much more difficult when the person next to you walks away,"" Gardere said. ""The message is 'I am through with this person, I think he is deeply flawed.' If you, the person who knows him best, walks away from him, it is harder for the public to believe in him."" The enduring image of Tuesday's news conference -- where a uncomfortable Abedin stood next to her husband -- sent mixed messages to voters and was a risky proposal, Navarro said. ""Not having the wife next to you can be certainly, in the short term, a death knell,"" Navarro said. ""But having her out there is a risky proposal because for most people, certainly most women, it was painful to watch her public humiliation and the guy responsible standing right next to her, looking over her shoulder. I think every woman watching that puts herself in that position."" But according Goldberg, sort of public awkwardness is better than the alternative. ""I think that having the wife somehow involved, to whatever degree is very important,"" Goldberg said. ""What is important is to be viewed as not totally accepting, because then it looks like the marriage is a joke. But you have to have enough sense of acknowledgment and contrition that is looks and sounds genuine."" Should Huma stand by her man? A mutually dependent relationship . The theory Darrell Hayes, a crisis communications professor at American University, thinks about most when he sees a news conference like Weiner's is ""co-dependency."" ""It is the idea that people assume that it is better to fight through the relationship than break it off,"" Hayes said. ""I get the sense that is the case with Anthony Weiner."" The reason for co-dependency, Hayes speculates, is possibly political aspirations for the family, not just her husband. That opinion was echoed by a number of experts. As for why Abedin stood next to Weiner, Goldberg said, ""It is probably a combination of support, humility, embarrassment and ego."" Navarro, who described Abedin as ""a very strong, independent, successful"" woman, said her standing beside Weiner on Tuesday opened the family up to a different line of questioning. ""Why do people want this so bad that they are willing to subject themselves to this humiliation again?""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan opposition has rejected a ""road map"" proposal by the African Union to bring an end to fighting between them and the government of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition leaders said Monday. Rebel leaders Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said they would not agree to any plan that fails to include Gadhafi's removal. The African Union plan, which Gadhafi agreed to in principle, does not provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people, Ghoga said. Can AU broker a peace deal? Cheers erupted from supporters when the announcement was made. The leaders said the opposition remains open to any other proposals the African Union may make. Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities in his North African nation and allow outside forces to help keep the peace, his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement. The announcement came the same day UNICEF, the United Nations children's agency, released a statement saying that at least 20 children -- some as young as 9 months old -- have been killed by shrapnel or bullet wounds in the city of Misrata. Ramtane Lamara, the African Union's commissioner for peace and security, read the agreement with Gadhafi early Monday, flanked by Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim. U.S. official: Prospect of stalemate looms . The deal announced Monday does not address whether Gadhafi will step down, nor is it binding. It has four basic elements, according to the memorandum detailed by Lamara: . -- An immediate end to all fighting. -- Libyan authorities' cooperation ""to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance."" -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya. -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities, including opposition figures, with the aim of setting up ""an inclusive transition period"" to adopt and implement ""political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis."" The agreement, which the statement said Gadhafi had signed off on, states that the final resolution must consider ""the aspirations of the Libyan people for democracy, political reform, justice, peace and security, as well as social ... development."" Report tracks ""sweeping changes"" in Mideast . No timetable was spelled out as to when and if a cease-fire might take effect or the political transition might take place. In the agreement, Gadhafi does voice support for the ""deployment of an effective and credible monitoring mechanism."" ""Leader Moammar Gadhafi expressed his full confidence in the African Union and its ability to successfully carry out the peace process in his country,"" the statement said. Gadhafi's government has announced unilateral cease-fires before, only to continue to attack the opposition. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still ""waiting to get a full readout"" from participants in the African Union's peace mission in Libya. ""We've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire,"" Clinton said. But she said there also must be, among other things, a resumption of water, electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been ""brutalized by Gadhafi's forces."" ""These terms are non-negotiable,"" Clinton said. She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power. The African Union's special committee on Libya has representatives from Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Uganda and South Africa. Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way. Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council, which Lamara heads. As such, opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals, which include Gadhafi's ouster. The talks come as violence continues in the North African nation, where pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces have been engaged in bitter fighting since February. In Misrata on Monday, at least five civilians -- including two toddlers, a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people injured in mortar attacks, two eyewitnesses said. Libyan state TV reported that ""colonial crusader enemies"" hit civilian and military positions in al-Jufra district in central Libya. After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces, Libyan rebel fighters recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya over the weekend after apparently holding off Gadhafi's better-equipped forces. Tony Blair's take on Libya . Amnesty International said Monday that it had fresh evidence of extrajudicial executions apparently committed by forces loyal to Gadhafi near Ajdabiya in recent days. Researchers of the rights groups reportedly saw the bodies of two opposition soldiers who had been shot in the back of the head after their hands had been tied behind their backs. In Misrata, NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city over the weekend, destroying 14 tanks, said a witness who did not want to be named for security reasons. NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack. On Sunday, two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-Gadhafi snipers near the city center, another witness said. The snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings, the witness said. At least eight people were killed and 22 injured in fighting Saturday between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels, according to medical sources in the city. Shahida Azfar, UNICEF's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, called for an immediate end to the siege of Misrata. ""Until the fighting stops, we face the intolerable inevitability of children continuing to die and suffer in this war zone,"" Azfar said in the statement Monday. CNN's Reza Sayah and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 5 civilians killed and 20 people wounded in Misrata, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- A decade ago, Britain's Labor government was badly divided over whether to join the Euro. The prime minister strongly supported the idea, as did much of the British business community and many leading media voices. One of the proponents' most effective tactics was to ridicule opponents as cranky and xenophobic -- even borderline racist. Here for example is a correspondent for the Guardian deriding some of them, members of the U.K. Independence Party (Ukip), back, in 2004. ""In the pub I encounter Reg Mahrra, an Indian Ukipper . 'I want out of Europe,' he says. 'Europe is a disease.' "" That's hardly an argument to take seriously. Only ... the Euro opponents were totally right. Right for the wrong reasons, but still right. It's human nature to assess difficult questions, not on the merits, but on our feelings about the different ""teams"" that form around different answers. To cite a painful personal experience: During the decision-making about the Iraq war, I was powerfully swayed by the fact that the proposed invasion of Iraq was supported by those who had been most right about the Cold War -- and was most bitterly opposed by those who had been wrongest about the Cold War. Yet in the end, it is not teams that matter. It is results. As Queen Victoria's first prime minister bitterly quipped after a policy fiasco: ""What wise men had promised has not happened. What the damned fools predicted has actually come to pass."" Which brings us to the uproar over the Heritage Foundation's study of the fiscal effects of immigration -- and the revelation that one of the study's coauthors wrote a Ph.D. dissertation asserting large and enduring differences in intelligence between different ethnic and racial groups. Heritage is a powerful conservative think tank in Washington, very influential on Capitol Hill. On May 6, Heritage released a study of the likely budget effects of the Senate plan to open a ""pathway to citizenship"" for the 10+ million people who live in the United States in violation of the nation's immigration laws. The study found that the plan would add $6.3 trillion to the nation's budget deficits over the next 50 years. That conclusion ignited a huge controversy. Still, even the fiercest critics had to concede the basic validity of Heritage's claim. In the words of Keith Hennessey, formerly director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush and an ardent supporter of the ""pathway to citizenship"": ""I expect making 8-9 million people here illegally into U.S. citizens would increase future deficits once these people are eligible for benefits."" The pathway to citizenship will add to deficits because of these basic demographic facts about the illegal population: It is very large and it is very low-skilled. As is, the immigrant population in the United States earns less and depends more on government benefits than the native-born population. As formerly illegal residents gain access to more benefits, that dependency can only rise. Perhaps the ultimate cost of legalization will be less than Heritage estimated: $4 trillion, say. Conceivably, the cost could be even higher. But it will be a cost, and it will be large -- nobody can gainsay that. Instead, critics respond with a non-sequitur: never mind the effects on government budgets, look instead at immigration's impact on the overall economy. The trouble for them, however, is that every reputable study -- headed by the most exhaustive of them all, the 1997 National Academy of Science study -- finds that the economic benefits of immigration are very small, fractions of a penny for each dollar of national income, with the largest share of those benefits captured by the immigrants themselves. But it's a basic rule of politics: If you can't disprove the message, you try to discredit the messenger. And one of Heritage's messengers sure enough proved discreditable. While work on the Heritage study was led by that think tank's welfare expert, Bob Rector, the heavy number-crunching was done by a recent Harvard Ph.D., Jason Richwine. Richwine believes in a racial hierarchy of intelligence, with Jews and East Asians at the top and blacks at the bottom. Richwine has expressed that opinion in a number of places, including at a 2008 panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute. I happened to be the moderator of that panel. I hadn't met Richwine before, and this discussion was my first introduction to his work. Afterward, I asked him to come to my office for a talk. I told him then that he faced a choice: He could be a serious scholar of immigration -- or he could play in the fever swamps, but not both. Obviously, he did not heed my advice. Shortly after, he left AEI to find employment at Heritage. U.S. immigration policy has long been sullied by racial prejudice: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the 1907 deal with Japan to stop migration from that country, the immigration acts of 1921 and 1924 that sought to halt migration of all groups except Northwest Europeans. It's a shameful story, and the Richwine episode scratches at those painful national wounds. But it's also true that math is math. We know how much low-skilled legal immigrants earn. We know how much government assistance legal immigrant households use. We can make projections about the likely budget costs of enrolling 10+ million formerly illegal residents as legal ones. Maybe Richwine did his math wrong. If he did it wrong, it would remain wrong even if he spent his leisure hours rescuing orphans from burning buildings. Maybe he did his math right. Then it would remain right even if he moonlighted as Grand Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Yet what is especially strange about the Richwine incident is this: . The people who will lose most by the Senate's immigration plan are precisely American citizens of minority origin. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be unemployed than whites. More ominously, they are more likely to be numbered among the long-term unemployed -- people who have been out of work six months or more. The long-term unemployed face an especially difficult path back to the labor market. The New York Times reports: . ""Though businesses are reluctant to acknowledge bias in their hiring practices, some human-resource managers and consultants say privately that unemployment can be a red flag on a rÃ©sumÃ©, signaling that a worker may have outdated skills, or may be a short-timer who is desperate enough to take any work now but will leave when something better comes along. The National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, reported that companies across the country often posted job notices explicitly excluding applicants who are unemployed. ""Such discrimination against the unemployed is becoming more widespread as jobs are in short supply and employers can have their pick of applicants, according to labor and community leaders. They say it has created a blacklist of the unemployed, many of whom were laid off in recession-driven downsizing rather than because of performance issues. ""In New York City, on average, 372,000 people were unemployed in 2012, 38 percent for a year or longer, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blacks and Hispanics accounted for disproportionately large shares of the long-term unemployed."" There's only one way to prod employers to hire the long-term unemployed: super-tight labor markets. In the late 1990s, when the unemployment rate tumbled to the lowest levels since the mid-1960s, employers became interested in categories of workers they usually rejected: former welfare recipients, the disabled, and so on. In the late 1990s, the black-white wage differential closed at the fastest rate since the civil rights era. The Great Recession has hit almost all Americans hard. But -- no surprise -- mass unemployment has had its worst effect on the poorest and most marginal. A 2013 study by the Urban Institute found that before the recession, the typical white family had four times the wealth of the typical black family. Since the recession, the gap has widened to six-to-one. The only thing that can close this gap is to tighten the labor market. And yet the Senate plan is a plan to slacken labor markets, and keep them slack for decades. That's not a bug. That's a feature. Not only will the plan legalize the formerly illegal, but it will hugely increase future immigration flows of both permanent and temporary workers: agriculture workers, technology workers, even ski instructors. The labor market is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as any other market. If supply is dramatically increased at a time when demand is already low, expect wages to steeply fall. That's not an unintended effect of the immigration bill. It's the intended effect. America's legacy of racial oppression casts a long shadow. That legacy is not yet anywhere close to overcome. Yet it's more than a little astonishing that the proponents of the Senate immigration bill would claim the banner of anti-racism to justify a measure that will deepen and prolong the subordination of those American ethnic groups already most deeply subordinated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Heritage Foundation report estimated cost of immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- A nonprofit group founder became the third person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment, telling CNN Wednesday that he tried to kiss her at least four times during a business meeting at a restaurant when he was a congressman. Filner couldn't be immediately reached for comment. He has recently responded to other accusations of sexual harassment in recent weeks by asserting he will eventually be vindicated, but he acknowledged he needs ""help"" and has been ""clearly doing something wrong."" Morgan Rose met with Filner in April 2009 at a Marie Callender's Restaurant & Bakery across the street from Filner's congressional office in Chula Vista, California, she told CNN. Rose was lobbying the congressman about her organization, America's Angel Campaign, a group devoted to working with domestic violence in military and other families, she said. Why we act on stupid impulses . Filner allegedly looked her up and down, stared into her eyes and said, ""Your eyes have bewitched me,"" Rose said. Filner allegedly then made a remark along the lines of, according to Rose's paraphrasing, ""You'll have to excuse me for what's about to happen. It's your fault,"" Rose said. Filner then moved to her side of the booth, sat beside her, pinned her to the wall, and put his arm around her, Rose alleged. Rose avoided the advances, and Filner was suddenly interrupted by his ringing cell phone, Rose charged. Filner got up from the booth, gathered his materials and left the restaurant, Rose said. Rose spoke of the incident to her closest friends and didn't pursue the matter because she feared her nonprofit might somehow suffer, she told CNN. But when Rose heard of similar accusations against Filner in recent weeks, she called a victim's hotline at the sheriff's department and spoke with a captain. A spokeswoman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department couldn't comment on any victim's call to the hotline, which the agency set up on Friday in the wake of the accusations against the mayor. Spokeswoman Jan Caldwell did acknowledge that investigators have received calls into the tip line. Rose is now working as a San Diego school psychologist, she said. She is also still executive director of the nonprofit. On Tuesday, political consultant Laura Fink accused Filner of patting her ""posterior"" while at a fund-raising event in 2005 when she working as the deputy manager of Filner's congressional campaign. On Wednesday, Fink told CNN that Filner should resign. The alleged sexual harassment occurred during a fund-raising dinner, and Fink guided Filner from table to table. One guest told Filner that Fink ""had worked her tokus off,"" Fink said. ""The congressman told me to turn around and patted me on the bum and said, 'Nope, it's still there' and laughed,"" Fink told CNN. Fink wrote to Filner's chief of staff and demanded that Filner apologize, she said. Filner responded, and ""he mumbled an apology"" and added something ""I just did not understand,"" Fink said. Fink said she didn't go public with the incident at the time because she was trying to build her political career. But she said she now feels emboldened to tell her story after Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene McCormack Jackson, sued him for sexual harassment Monday. Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding the mayor would not change his behavior. Filner has been battling allegations of sexual harassment for several weeks, but none of the women leveling those claims came forward before Jackson filed her suit in state court. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, called on Filner to resign, telling reporters, ""Apologies alone will not take care of this injustice."" In a statement issued Monday evening, Filner said he was ""saddened"" by the accusations, but ""I remain committed to the people of San Diego and the work that needs to be done."" ""Once due process is allowed to unfold, I am certain there will be a better understanding of this situation,"" he said, adding, ""I humbly ask that through this vicious storm of controversy, people take a moment and temper their rush to judgment."" Filner said last week that he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts."" But he has also acknowledged, ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them,"" Filner said in a statement earlier this month. ""It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong."" Filner, 70, served five terms in Congress before being elected mayor in 2012. He has said he will not resign. Jackson said she decided to resign after Filner's deputy chief of staff resigned in June. Filner ""refused to listen to someone he had known for 35 years, and who told him explicitly, during a senior staff meeting, that his behavior with women was terrible and possibly illegal."" Filner ""laughed it off,"" she said. She said Filner challenged her to provide one example of improper behavior; when she brought up his comments about wearing underwear, ""he had no comeback,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- An Australian woman often described as the world's oldest blogger has died at the age of 108 after posting a final message about her ailing health but how she sang ""a happy song, as I do every day."" Olive Riley posted more than 70 entries on her blog -- or ""blob"" as she jokingly called it -- since February 2007 . Olive Riley died Saturday at a nursing home in New South Wales. Riley posted more than 70 entries on her blog -- or ""blob"" as she jokingly called it -- since February 2007. On the site, The Life of Riley, and in a series of videos post on YouTube, Riley mused on her day-to-day life. She also recounted living through two world wars and raising three children on her own while working as a cook and a bar maid. ""She had a wonderful memory, and an amazing zest for life,"" said her friend Eric Shackle, who met Riley at a nursing home while visiting his wife, who has since passed. ""Just two weeks ago, she recalled the words of a song that was popular before World War II, and sang the chorus with me."" In a post titled ""Washing Day,"" Riley wrote: ""You 21st Century people live a different life than the one I lived as a youngster in the early 1900s. Take washing day, for instance. These days you just toss your dirty clothes into a washing machine, press a few switches, and it's done."" She then described how she helped do laundry as a youngster, starting with finding ""a few pieces of wood to fire the copper for Mum."" ""When the water in the copper began to boil, Mum would add a cupful of soap chips, and throw in a cube of Reckitt's Blue wrapped in a muslin bag to whiten the clothes,"" she wrote. ""Then she put in all the dirty clothes, first rubbing out the stains with a bar of Sunlight soap. ... that was jolly hard work."" Riley was born in 1899 and would have turned 109 on October 20. She took up blogging at the suggestion of Mike Rubbo, who filmed a documentary on her life four years ago. ""First of all, I had to explain to her what a blog was and that took some doing,"" Rubbo said. ""Then I got across the idea it was sort of a diary that she would share with the world. ""The reason for its popularity is that she was such a standout talent -- just so touching and funny and such a great story teller."" Various others have at times been labeled the world's oldest blogger, including Spain's Maria Amelia who was born in 1911 and given a blog by ""my grandson, who is very stingy."" Riley was 12 years older than Amelia. In her final post, dated June 26, Riley wrote how she felt weak ""and can't shake off that bad cough."" She wrote of singing a ""happy song, as I do every day,"" with a visitor to the nursing home, ""and before long we were joined by several nurses, who sang along too. It was quite a concert!"" Said Shackle: ""The thousands of loving messages she received from fellow bloggers in such places as Iceland, India, Iran, North and South America and Australia helped keep her alive in her final year.

"(LifeWire)  -- Like 20- or 30-something singles, older men and women are dating and embracing their sexuality. But many older singles -- some of whom have already been down the aisle -- aren't looking to exchange their single status for a band of gold. Some older Americans are looking for companionship rather than marriage. ""We are not aiming for great changes in the second half of life, but looking for fulfillment in who we are now,"" says Sharon Romm, a Seattle-based psychiatrist and author of ""Dating After 50: Negotiating the Minefields of Midlife Romance."" ""Not everyone wants another marriage. Someone might want a companion for going to concerts on Saturday night and not much more. Others might absolutely want -- or not want -- sex as part of another relationship."" Dating dynamics . More than a third of Americans over 50 are divorced, widowed, separated or have never married, according to a tally of statistics released in 2006 by the U.S. Census Bureau. ""Many over 50 are no longer looking for that one person, that 'soul mate',"" says Dr. Philip Belove, a marriage and family therapist based in Bellows Falls, Vermont, who specializes in midlife relationships issues. ""If you have a life that you like and things you want to do and interests to pursue, maybe you don't want to sacrifice some of those priorities in order to be someone else's soul mate."" This sentiment doesn't just apply to confirmed bachelors, either. For many women, their careers and hobbies rank higher on their priority list than do romantic relationships, according to Belove. As Margaret Murchie, a 52-year-old realtor in Honolulu, Hawaii, a self-proclaimed independent woman who dates but has never been married, puts it simply, ""They have to make me happier than I am now on my own."" A 2003 AARP study of 3,501 singles aged 40 to 69 showed that about one-third of those surveyed were either in a relationship or dating one person exclusively. A comparable percentage had dated one or more people in the previous three years. But of those who were dating, just 8 percent listed ""to find someone to marry"" as their reason for doing so. Indeed, 49 percent said they were simply looking for someone ""to talk to and do things with."" Of course, dating isn't always easy, particularly for those who may be dipping back into the dating pool after years on the sidelines. But there are many ways for older Americans to meet and get to know one another, many geared specifically to their cohort: . • Online dating and social networking sites, like BOOMj.com, SeniorFriendFinder.com, Match.com and eHarmony.com help seniors find like-minded people with whom they can connect. • Travel programs, such as Elderhostel offer learning adventures worldwide. • Volunteer programs, like the Senior Corps, connect those with community service programs in need. • Competitive and recreational sports programs, such as Sports for Active Seniors in Madison, Wisconsin, and the West Virginia Senior Sports Classic, target active older adults. • Institutes of higher education, such as The Ohio State University's Program 60 or the University of North Florida's Learning for a Lifetime, offer tuition waivers or discounted classes for seniors. Sexual evolution or revolution? Just as older Americans aren't letting the years stop them from dating, they're not letting it end their sex lives, either. Many of the 3,005 U.S. adults aged 57 to 85 surveyed for a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported having sex at least once within the past year: . Among the oldest group of sexually active adults, 54 percent were having sex at least twice a month, while 23 percent reported engaging in sex at least once a week. The study published August 23 defines sex very loosely to include mutual activity that doesn't require intercourse. ""It is time that our society's traditional thinking that disconnects old age and sex be revisited,"" says Ruth S. Jacobowitz, author of ""150 Most-Asked Questions About Midlife Sex, Love, and Intimacy."" ""We're all living longer, so our needs to relate sexually are lasting longer."" But older Americans who are sexually active face health issues, too. • Although HIV/AIDS is a threat to Americans of all ages, about 19 percent of Americans infected with HIV/AIDS are 50 or older, according to the U.S. government's National Institute on Aging (NIA). The NIA doesn't break down transmission rates among this demographic -- for example, through drug use, heterosexual or homosexual contact -- but the institute does point out that older adults in general tend to know less than younger Americans about how HIV/AIDS is transmitted and the necessity of using condoms. They are also less likely to be tested for the disease. • Aging can affect sexual performance. Both men and women may find that it takes longer to become aroused as they grow older, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This may be caused by health problems like heart disease, by medications being taken to treat health conditions, or simply by stress or concerns about a changing appearance as one ages. • The NIH notes that women in the midst of menopause, which causes estrogen levels to decline, may experience pain during intercourse. Contrary to a commonly held assumption, however, a study by the New England Research Institute and the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 2000 found that lower estrogen levels did not lower a woman's libido. • In men, aging can cause impotence. About 5 percent of men aged 40 report having this problem, and it increases to about 15 percent of men aged 70, according to the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department said Monday it is suing Puerto Rico's police department for discrimination, alleging a female officer suffered three years of harassment for her race, color and religion. The allegations are the latest in a series of claims against the commonwealth's troubled police force, and they follow an agreement last week between the Justice Department and Puerto Rico to reform the island's 17,000-strong force. The suit alleges the PRPD, the nation's second-largest police department, subjected officer Yolanda Carrasquillo to verbal harassment from 2007 to 2010, violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It says a civilian co-worker ""regularly used racial and other offensive slurs directed towards Carrasquillo, and other black or dark-skinned employees, that disparaged her race, color and Christian faith."" The verbal abuse happened daily and was often in front of police supervisors, the suit says. Carrasquillo made numerous complaints to her supervisors, but the department never took any meaningful steps to stop the harassment or discipline the person responsible, the Justice Department said. The department failed to follow its own anti-harassment policy that requires supervisors to prevent and stop discriminatory behavior after they become aware of it, the suit says. CNN reached the spokeswoman for the police department's superintendent, who said she would call back if he was able to make a comment. There was no reply by late Monday. The Justice Department's lawsuit seeks monetary damages for Carrasquillo and asks the PRPD to develop and implement policies that would prevent employees from being subjected to harassment on the basis of race, color or religion. Carrasquillo originally filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which referred the matter to the Justice Department. ""Public employers should set an example for others by upholding the law and taking prompt and effective action to stop discriminatory harassment,"" said Jocelyn Samuels, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the department's Civil Rights Division. Last week, the Justice Department and Puerto Rico signed a major civil rights agreement to fix a pattern of police misconduct by the PRPD, mostly relating to the department's interaction with the public. It is pending final approval by a federal judge. The pact covers 11 core areas including use of force, searches and seizures, equal protection, civilian complaints, training and supervision. An earlier Justice Department investigation uncovered evidence that officers failed to adequately investigate sexual assault and domestic violence allegations. Journalist Dania Alexandrino in Puerto Rico and CNN's Carol Cratty in Washington contributed to this report.","The suit says the PRPD discriminated against a female officer for 3 years .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina woman pleaded guilty to filing fraudulent claims for relief from the Gulf oil disaster, authorities said. Charlette Johnson pleaded guilty to two counts of submitting false claims to a federal agency, two counts of aggravated identity theft and eight counts of wire fraud in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Monday, prosecutors said. Johnson, 41, was the first person to be charged with fraud in connection with relief from the BP oil spill, a Department of Justice spokeswoman said. She may also be the first person to plead guilty of the seven people charged with fraud in connection with the oil spill, the spokeswoman said. But the BP oil spill wasn't the only disaster for which Johnson fraudulently applied for relief, authorities said. Johnson also fraudulently claimed she needed assistance for property damage ""caused by Hurricane Katrina for a home in New Orleans that she never owned and in which she never lived,"" federal authorities said in a statement . Johnson also placed a claim in the name of her sister for ""damage caused by the wildfires to a home in Malibu, California, that neither she, nor her sister, had ever owned, and in which neither she nor her sister had ever lived."" In all, Johnson was able to fraudulently obtain more than $75,000 in four years from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to court documents. For some of the time Johnson committed the fraud, she was on active duty with the Army and was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, court documents said. Johnson also goes by the first name Charlotte Johnson. For one of the claims she used her name, Charlette Johnson. Later she used other names such as Minnie Blount, Robert Garner, Sabrina Conner, Lexxus Johnson and Otis McNeil. ""When someone seeks to profit from tragic disasters and attempts to trade on other peoples' misfortune for personal gain through lies and deceit, they will be held to account for their actions,"" said U.S. Attorney George Holding of the eastern district of North Carolina. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","Charlette Johnson was the first person to be charged with fraud in the Gulf oil spill .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The death toll from a sophisticated attack by Islamic extremists against soldiers in Yemen jumped to 184 Tuesday, three Yemeni officials told CNN. Air raids on militant positions since the attack have left at least 42 militants dead in Abyan province, security officials said. The attack Sunday at an army base by Ansar al-Sharia, which is allied with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, originally claimed the lives of 90 soldiers and wounded many others. A spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington issued a statement giving a much lower death toll, saying ""73 martyrs"" died in the ""battles in Abyan."" But officials on the ground in Abyan gave CNN the higher death toll. The attack ""illustrates AQAP's complete disregard for human life,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. She vowed that the United States will continue to support Yemen's new President Abdurabu Hadi ""and the Yemeni people as they work to realize their aspirations for a brighter and more prosperous future."" The attack was a humiliating defeat to Yemen's army in a power struggle against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The militants seized large amounts of weaponry -- including rocket launchers, mortars, armored vehicles and tanks -- and appeared to have had help from within the security apparatus, according to Yemeni officials. The bloodbath took place near Zinjibar, a town on the Arabian Sea where Ansar al-Sharia has been active for nearly a year. One Yemeni official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said militants began attacking an army base from the east, drawing the fire of troops, and then began attacking from the other side of the base. The ""reinforcement response was too slow,"" he said, adding that was partly because of sandstorms in the area. ""Troops were basically slaughtered by the militants. The attacks happened so suddenly; and this time they were more organized than we expected,"" one senior security official said. On Monday, more attacks took place. Al Qaeda-linked militants occupied a Republican Guard garrison in the province of Baitha before the Yemeni army overtook it, a Yemeni government official said. A police chief in Aden's 6th precinct survived an assassination attempt, but his bodyguard was killed, the government official said. It was unclear who was behind the attack, but al Qaeda-linked militants have stepped up assassinations. ""Political bickering"" is under way about what to do in the province of Abyan, where the attack occurred, as politicians play a blame game over why such violence has been on the rise, the official said. Meanwhile, U.S. trainers are helping the Yemeni government in its effort to retake al-Kowd, the town in Abyan closest to the military base where Sunday's attack occurred, two Yemeni security officials said. U.S. officials had no immediate confirmation. Air attacks went on through the night Monday and into Tuesday morning in an effort to kill militants and destroy their tanks and other vehicles, the officials said. Hundreds of troops were deployed to Abyan, and nearly 1,000 more will reach the province by Tuesday night, the Interior Ministry said. ""This will take time, but the government will not be lenient when dealing with terrorist groups,"" said Ali Obaid, a spokesman for the military committee. Militants were weakened by government raids on their hideouts in Ansar al-Sharia, he said. At least 146 troops have been wounded since Saturday, security officials said. Experts warn that al Qaeda is planning to conduct powerful attacks in six Yemeni provinces. Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center, said pamphlets belonging to al Qaeda were distributed to residents informing them of the attacks to come. ""This is just the beginning, and al Qaeda attacks will spread quickly in March. Security authorities must be on high alert or risk seeing another bloodbath like the one in Abyan,"" Mohammed said. ""Sanaa, Baitha, Hadramout, Aden and Shabwa provinces are all on the al Qaeda hit list."" CNN's Hakim Almasmari, Mohammed Jamjoom and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: 184 soldiers were killed in the Sunday attack, Yemeni officials say .

"(CNN) -- A recent warning from the FBI about hackers targeting guests' data when they log into hotel Wi-Fi overseas was a salient reminder to travelers of the risks to data security on the road. The alert, from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, was addressed to U.S. executives, government workers and academics but did not specify a particular country of threat. It warned of a spate of incidents of travelers encountering bogus software update pop-ups when they used hotel internet connections overseas. When they clicked on the ""update,"" malicious software was installed on their computer. Hotel Wi-Fi connections are particularly risky, said Sian John, UK security strategist at Symantec, because they are often set up without proper security settings. But they are merely one data-security threat among many facing business travelers. From a data-security standpoint, travel is inherently risky, and the likelihood of private personal or corporate data being compromised is greatly increased the moment you hit the road, she said. ""One of the major ways data loss happens is when people are traveling,"" she said. ""You're not in a secure area ... That is where the risks tend to arise."" See also: Why are we still paying for hotel Wi-Fi? John said a major risk was that in getting online while on the road, travelers often turn to free Wi-Fi internet connections -- in hotels, but also at airports, conference centers and business facilities. While security settings vary from network to network, many are left open and unmonitored, and travelers are frequently unaware that they could be unwittingly exposing themselves to data loss by logging on. ""Anyone can connect to them, which means anyone can look at the traffic going across them,"" she said. ""It's very easy to sit on one of these things and pick up the traffic going through them. There are devices out there that let you hijack them."" Gary Davis, McAfee's director of global consumer marketing, said there was a growing trend of hackers setting up mock Wi-Fi hotspots in public places, which appear at the top of the list of available Wi-Fi connections. ""People will see 'free Wi-Fi' and click on it, and when they do that they open themselves up to great exposure,"" he said. The best approach is to be wary and steer clear of Wi-Fi hotspots that do not seem legitimate -- ""something (that) looks like it's not quite right, not the proper name they might expect,"" he added. Once compromised, hackers can take total control of a device, including removing all the data contained on it. Android devices are currently the devices most targeted by hackers, Davis said. ""We saw a 1,200% increase in malware targeting Android devices just in the first quarter of this year,"" he said. John said the best approach for business travelers when using public Wi-Fi is to remotely log into their employer's virtual private network, or VPN, which ensures all data received and sent from a device is encrypted. Travelers can also better protect themselves by using encrypted protocols -- simply typing ""https:"" instead of ""http:"" at the beginning of URLs -- although ""https:"" is not supported by all websites. And they should avoid transmitting sensitive information, such as work documents or credit card details, over public Wi-Fi spots. ""I would be cautious of doing anything sensitive on them,"" John said. But the risk of data loss begins even before logging on, she said. ""People forget about the over-your-shoulder problem when traveling,"" she said. Travelers engrossed in their work in cafes, departure lounges or on transport are often unaware of prying eyes around them. ""Most people don't have a privacy screen on their laptop still, so anyone sitting next to you can look over your shoulder and see what you're doing."" See also: World's best airport restaurants . Another common cause of data loss is travelers losing their device outright, particularly when passing through security checkpoints. ""People put it in a tray and forget to put it back in the bag,"" she said, adding that hundreds of laptops are left in busy airports each week. For that reason, some companies -- particularly in sensitive fields such as finance, pharmaceuticals and defense -- often issue top executives working with blank travel laptops especially for the trip. ""When they come back, the company can then analyze what, if anything, happened on the devices, wipe them and reuse them,"" she said. While the techniques used by hackers could be hard for non-IT professionals to detect, the best defenses against data loss are surprisingly common sense. Make sure security updates are completed before traveling. Keep a close eye on your possessions. And, like any traveler, give a wide berth to anything that seems slightly off. While there have been major cases of data loss as a result of deliberate corporate espionage, John said, ""there are also many, many instances of carelessness."" ""Wherever you're traveling, take care of everything you've got,"" she said. ""People take care of their passport -- you need to take the same care of your information technology.""","FBI has warned travelers that hackers are targeting their data via hotel Wi-Fi .
I.T. experts say the risk of data loss is much higher when traveling .
Public Wi-Fi in airports, conference centers and other public places is also risky .
Data loss also commonly occurs through lost laptops and 'shoulder surfing'"
"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Eating a box of Girl Scout Cookies in one sitting will be a little bit easier this year: The Girl Scouts of the USA confirmed Wednesday that it has reduced the number of cookies per box to save money because of rising transportation and baking costs. People buying Girl Scout cookies like these on their Web site this year can expect fewer cookies in the packages. Michelle Tompkins, a national Girl Scout spokeswoman, said that ""the cost of baking a cookie today is significantly higher than it was even a year ago, and our bakers cannot continue to absorb these rising costs."" She also said transportation costs have increased 30 to 40 percent from a year ago. The combined cost increase prompted the organization to ""lower the net weight of our cookie boxes slightly rather than ask our customers to pay a higher per-package price during these difficult times,"" Tompkins said in a written statement. There will be two to four fewer cookies in boxes of Thin Mints, Peanut Butter Sandwiches, Shortbread Cookies, DoSiDos and Trefoils, she said. The Girl Scouts also reduced the size of some cookies, but Thin Mint lovers shouldn't worry that their sweet snacks will get any slimmer: Only the Lemon Chalet Cremes will change shape. Tompkins said it is too early to tell how Girl Scout Cookie sales will fare for the year. She said the cookie-selling season ranges from October to May, with the bulk occurring between January and March. Each individual council determines when its scouts will sell, and many have just begun in the past few weeks. Tompkins said she's heard a range of comments on how sales are going: One council in Texas is having its best year ever, which attributes to new marketing, and other groups are reporting low numbers. Sales average $700 million a year, she said. ""We hope Girl Scout Cookie lovers will understand the situation and continue to support our girls,"" she said. ""As the premier leadership organization for girls, we also intend to use these circumstances as a business learning experience for the girls.""","Girl Scouts reducing the number of cookies per box to save money .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Family members requested a humanitarian pardon Wednesday for former Peruvian strongman Alberto Fujimori, saying he should be released from prison because of health problems. The 74-year-old Fujimori is serving four concurrent sentences, the longest of which is 25 years, for corruption and human rights abuses. He underwent surgery September 19 for a recurring lesion in his tongue and returned to the clinic nine days later because of problems with scarring of the wound, the state-run Andina news agency reported. 2011: Longtime Peruvian fugitive turns himself in . ""This request is argued on the basis of medical facts,"" said Keiko Fujimori, the former president's daughter, who was quoted by Andina. Family members say the ex-president, who has suffered from mouth cancer, will die if he remains a prisoner. ""We will have to evaluate if the conditions of imprisonment, which in any light are different than what prisoners in the country normally receive, affect the health of Mr. Fujimori,"" said Julio Arbizu, Peru's top anti-corruption prosecutor. ""That does not seem to be the case."" In recent weeks, word of the Fujimori family's plans to request a pardon has riled political opponents. Human rights activists have said granting a pardon to the former strongman would be an insult to victims of his regime, Andina reported. 2009: Ex-Peruvian president sentenced for giving spy chief $15 million . Alberto Fujimori is a polarizing figure in Peru, the country he led from 1990 to 2000. His strong hand is credited with defeating the Shining Path terrorists who destabilized the country, and his austere economic policies reined in hyperinflation. But stability had a cost, which in his case was an authoritarian streak that included the killing of civilians. After winning a third term whose constitutionality was challenged, he was finally brought down by an Andean-sized corruption scandal. In 2009, a special supreme court tribunal sentenced him to 25 years in prison for authorizing the operation of a death squad responsible for killing civilians. In separate trials, Fujimori was found guilty of breaking into the home of a former spy chief to steal incriminating videos, taking money from the government treasury to pay the spy chief, authorizing illegal wiretaps, and bribing congressmen and journalists. 2009: Former Peruvian president sentenced to fourth prison term . As his decade-long presidency neared its end in 2000, Fujimori fled Peru for Japan, where he holds dual citizenship because his parents were born there. Japan refused to honor Peru's request to return him for trial, saying its nationals should be subject to Japanese law and pointing out the two countries have no extradition treaty. He attempted to resign from the presidency by fax from Japan, but Peru's congress refused to accept it, instead declaring him morally unfit to govern. He arrived in Chile in 2005 in what some saw as a possible attempt to return to Peru and seek office there in 2006. He was under house arrest for six months in Chile and was extradited to Peru in 2007. The former leader still has both fierce critics and strong supporters in the South American country. His daughter Keiko lost a bid for president last year. Rallying cries in support of her father were common among crowds at her campaign events. Now that she and her siblings have filed paperwork with Peru's justice ministry requesting a pardon, President Ollanta Humala -- the man who defeated her at the polls -- will have the final say. His decision could have wide-ranging consequences. Political analysts say a decision in favor of the Fujimori family could change Peru's political panorama, converting old rivals into allies. 2009: Report finds Peru's Fujimori pleads guilty in bribery case .

"(CNN) -- Election officials in Pakistan barred former President Pervez Musharraf from running for a parliament seat, his lawyer said Tuesday. ""We will challenge it in the Supreme Court to show the world (the) biased attitude of the judiciary against Musharraf,"" Ahmed Raza Qasoori told CNN. Musharraf resigned as president of the south Asian nation five years ago and went into exile in London and Dubai. He returned to Pakistan recently, saying he planned to contest three court cases and run in upcoming elections. The former president faces accusations in a Karachi court that he illegally deposed and detained 62 senior judges during a period of emergency rule he imposed six years ago. He is also accused of not doing enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto, the country's first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan. She was assassinated on December 27, 2007, after leaving a campaign rally in Rawalpindi, just two weeks before the general election. She was the leading opposition candidate facing off against Musharraf. In the third case, he is charged with ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. He had been disqualified from running because he declared a state of emergency in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move had been ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. Musharraf maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts. In his final years of president, he made many enemies . Some Pakistanis are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership would help to restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency. The Pakistan Taliban have vowed to send a death squad to target the former president, if he returns to the country. Musharraf has said he has been living under threats of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and targeted the Taliban. Musharraf was ultimately granted a bail extension on the three cases. He was initially granted ""protective"" bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to the country. The former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007, after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for ""misuse of authority."" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court's ruling on whether he could seek another five-year term.","Musharraf will challenge decision .
He faces three court cases .
The former president had been in exile after leaving Pakistan ."
"(CNN) -- European Champions League winners Chelsea have announced the signing of Brazil international Oscar from Internacional. The 21-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil at the London Olympics and has joined the English Premier League club on a five-year deal. Oscar, who has been compared to compatriot Kaka, came through the youth system at Sao Paulo and was part of the Brazil side that won the Under-17 World Championships in 2008. He moved to Internacional in 2010 and made his debut for the national side in September 2011, having represented his country at every level from Under-15 upwards. Oscar's first international goal came in a 4-3 friendly defeat to South American rivals Argentina, played in the United States last month. He is the third high profile signing of the close season by Chelsea, who secured their first ever European Champions League triumph last season. Belgium international Eden Hazard joined the London club from French side Lille for a reported fee of $49 million, while Marko Marin was also signed from German side Werder Bremen. The trio of attacking players will look to provide the ammunition for Spain striker Fernando Torres, after Chelsea stalwart Didier Drogba left the club for China. Midfielder Frank Lampard, who has been at Chelsea since 2001, said the club's close season business will add fresh impetus to an experienced side, that also contains former England captain John Terry. ""Last year we proved to be a great team and a great unit in the second half of the season with what we achieved,"" he told the club's official website. ""This year maybe we are slightly different because we have more new young players coming in so there might not be the settled togetherness that we had on the pitch because we had been together a long time but there is an excitement about our team as well and that's probably the main difference. ""Everyone is trying to impress, and you never lose that in pre-season, there's not one manager I've met yet who will close the door on any player. ""We are all playing for our season at this stage trying to show Robbie that we are fit and ready regardless of last year. We have to perform at a high level to stay in the team because of the quality of the squad we have."" Chelsea begin their Premier League campaign on Sunday 18 August with an away game at Wigan Athletic.","Premier League club Chelsea announce the signing of Brazilian international Oscar .

"(CNN) -- ""Argo,"" praise yourself. That's what Hollywood did on Sunday night, anyway. ""Argo,"" which told the story of the rescue operation that saved six Americans during the Iran hostage crisis, took home three Oscars at the 85th Academy Awards, including the biggest award of the night: best picture. It was both an expected and yet unlikely conclusion to an awards season that took off in strange directions, though it ended up pretty much where the Oscar prognosticators thought it would. Director Ben Affleck, who co-produced the film with George Clooney and Grant Heslov, acknowledged the strangeness of the process in his acceptance speech. Back in early January, ""Argo"" was considered an Oscar also-ran, if only because Affleck was overlooked in the best director category. In the entire history of the Oscars, just three films had won best picture without a directing nomination, and just one, ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" in the last 80 years. But then the film caught fire, winning awards from the producers', directors' and actors' guilds, as well as a Golden Globe, AFI Award and BAFTA. The bandwagon seemed unstoppable, except for that lack of a directing nomination. Affleck, however, really was happy just to be here and gave a nod to his up-and-down past in his speech. ""I never thought I would be back here, and I am,"" he said, thanking many people who were kind to him in Hollywood when he couldn't repay them. The film was also honored for its screenplay, by Chris Terrio, and William Goldenberg's editing. ""This is nuts!"" Oscar night itself held few surprises after a season that seemed to promise an anything-goes affair. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the appearance of one of the presenters: first lady Michelle Obama, who joined Jack Nicholson via satellite to read the winner of best picture. But most of the show met expectations. Jennifer Lawrence, just 22, won best actress for her performance as a troubled widow in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" The performer was as down-to-earth in her acceptance as she's been all season. Indeed, she almost came down to earth literally, slipping on her flowing dress as she approached the stage. ""This is nuts!"" she exclaimed before thanking the other nominees in her category. She concluded with happy birthday greetings for Emmanuelle Riva, nominated for ""Amour."" Riva turned 86 Sunday. Daniel Day-Lewis set a record with his third best actor win, this time for playing Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg's film ""Lincoln."" The usually serious actor got off perhaps the funniest acceptance of the night when he turned to Meryl Streep, who had presented the award, and noted that originally their roles were supposed to be reversed. ""It's a strange thing, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher, and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln,"" he said to laughter. ""I'd like to see that version."" Streep won best actress last year for playing Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady."" In a mild surprise, Ang Lee won the Oscar for best director for ""Life of Pi."" The film, based on the novel by Yann Martel, won four Oscars, the most for any film. ""Thank you movie god,"" he said, praising ""all 3,000"" people who worked on the movie with him. Anne Hathaway (""Les Miserables"") won best supporting actress and Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained"") won best supporting actor. Hathaway looked at her statue in wonder. ""It came true,"" she said. MacFarlane shines . James Bond, too, emerged a winner. After 50 years of great (and not-so-great) Bond themes, one of them finally won: Adele's ""Skyfall."" The music, in fact, carried much of what was an uneven broadcast. Shirley Bassey, the original James Bond hit singer, dazzled with a version of ""Goldfinger."" Soon after, Jennifer Hudson raised the roof, and got a standing ovation, for a remarkable version of ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,"" from ""Dreamgirls."" Hudson won an Oscar for playing Effie, who sings the song, in 2006's film version. Adele sang ""Skyfall,"" and Barbra Streisand sang ""The Way We Were"" for co-writer Marvin Hamlisch, who concluded the ""In Memoriam"" segment. Host Seth MacFarlane started slowly, but got looser (and funnier) as the show stretched into its fourth hour. His opening consisted of some mild jokes, only a couple of which drew gasps, and some dandy song-and-dance numbers. William Shatner, in character as ""Star Trek's"" James T. Kirk, offered advice -- he was from the future, after all -- so MacFarlane wouldn't go down as the ""worst Oscar host ever."" But it was later in the show that MacFarlane really shined, whether it was maintaining an affable, cracking-wise-in-the-living-room demeanor or simply keeping the proceedings moving along as much as the Oscars can be moved along. At one point, welcoming Michael Douglas and Jane Fonda to give the best director honor, he quipped, ""They remember when this town was cocaine trees as far as the eye can see."" ""My taste aside, this is a great show for people who love Seth MacFarlane and musical theater. Which is pretty much Seth MacFarlane,"" tweeted Time's James Poniewozik. Twitter, of course, was the appropriate place to crack wise, and express displeasure with Oscar's choices. ""Just a friendly reminder that Harry Potter never won an Oscar. Apparently, inspiring an entire generation isn't good enough,"" wrote Professor Snape. (For those who've never seen one of the eight Potter movies, Snape is a wizard professor.) ""So are they going to do the BIG FOUR AWARDS in the next 12 minutes?"" said Michael Buckley, noting the show's typically glacial pace. And at least one person was upset at a snub during the ""In Memoriam"" segment, which began with Ernest Borgnine, paid tribute to critic Andrew Sarris among many others, and concluded with Hamlisch. ""Will someone at the academy ask why Andy Griffith, who was in more than a dozen films, not in the memoriam while publicists were?"" tweeted Chuck Raasch. Affleck rising . Snubs seemed to be the theme of this year's Oscar season, none more than Affleck's for director. But he wasn't having it. Ten years ago, after all, he was a punch line. After winning an Oscar in 1998 for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"" with his good friend Matt Damon, he'd plunged into critical and/or box-office failure -- ""Bounce,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Changing Lanes,"" ""Daredevil"" -- topped by ""Gigli,"" the 2003 flop that became synonymous with the word ""flop."" He was a tabloid staple -- romances with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez will do that -- and so ripe for mockery that Mindy Kaling (!) played him as a track-suited doofus in her off-Broadway play, ""Matt and Ben."" The Oscar? Just luck. After all, in ""Matt and Ben,"" the script for ""Good Will Hunting"" literally falls from the heavens. Sunday night, he showed that you make your own luck. It was a topic he touched on a few weeks ago, when the film's ride to the top was just picking up steam. ""I just feel so incredibly honored to be nominated as a producer for this movie, to be here at the big party,"" he told reporters at the Oscar luncheon in early February. ""I don't get into worrying too much about who got what and who didn't get what. I mean, I've had many, many, many, many, many, many years watching from home."" As he thanked the academy for the best picture prize, he graciously paid tribute to many people, from ""Lincoln"" director Steven Spielberg to the nation of Canada, which some observers believe got short shrift in ""Argo."" His words, perhaps, might inspire a little more humility on the part of people who raged on his behalf. ""You can't hold grudges. It's hard, but you can't hold grudges,"" he said, tearing up. ""And it doesn't matter how you get knocked down in life, 'cause that's gonna happen. It matters how you get up.""","NEW: ""Argo"" wins best picture .

"(AOL Autos) -- Let's face it. Tires are usually one of the most un-fun things to buy for a car. Most of us aren't too concerned about the process. We're just trying to buy a set of discount tires that turn out to be better than four pencil erasers. Chris Neiger found cheap tires by giving up 3 hours of his day and all dignity for his aging car. Recently, I set out to buy some discount tires of my own. Manned with my laptop and cell phone, I aimed to unearth the best discount tire deals on the Internet. Now, there are some big-name choices, such as Sears Tires and National Tire and Battery. Since I've bought some discount tires online before, I knew the first place to look was Tire Rack. This site is incredible. You can find tires for almost any car and get a really good deal. Plus you can read surveys and reviews from customers who have bought the same tires you're buying. Six tire buying tips: . 1. Buy new. Saving money on discount tires is great, but not at the expense of sacrificing traction or safety. 2. Know the factory size of your tires, usually found on the inside door hinge of the driver's side. 3. Shop around for the best deals on discount tires by checking local and online stores. 4. Determine how long you're going to need the tires and buy within your budget. 5. Know the factory warranties and shop guarantees for your tires before you purchase them. 6. Do your research. Not all tires are created equal nor are the expensive ones always the best. Since Tire Rack is an online company and they don't own any air wrenches themselves, you can search through a list of mechanic shops right on their Web site who will accept your delivery of tires and will put them on the car for you at their designated price. When I ordered a set from Tire Rack in the past, I got a set of good tires for a great price. They deliver through UPS and FedEx, so there's no guessing game on that front. Tire Rack sometimes offers rebates and other special deals. Although the site may have some of the cheapest prices online, it may also cause you to spend a little more than you anticipated. The price you're quoted for a set of tires does not include the extra fill-in-the-blank you pay in order to have the tires shipped to you or your mechanic. In my case, the cheapest delivery charge was a FedEx delivery that cost me $36. This was in addition to the several hundred I was already paying for the tires. Depending on where you live, the charge for having tires delivered may vary, so make sure to confirm a three-day delivery as opposed to overnight if you want to keep costs down. The real problem came when I took my Tire Rack tires to the local mechanic and was charged $90 for what they called a ""basic tire package."" I'd hate to see the deluxe version's price. This was simply the mounting, balancing, disposal fees, parts and labor. If you want to go the Tire Rack route, call some mechanics in your area before you take the tires there and find out which one has the best installation price. Keep in mind that the bigger the tires and rim size, the more money it costs to have them mounted. Tire Rack can be a great choice for discount tires if you keep your shipping cost down and you find a cheap mechanic. Altogether, I spent an extra $126 on top of the cost of the tires, but that did not outweigh the savings I was getting on the tires. Little price, big pain at Wal-Mart . If you're simply looking for the best deal on discount tires, my advice is to go with the name synonymous with savings, Wal-Mart. Regardless of your feelings toward the franchise, you will get a good set of tires at a cheap price. My Wal-Mart experience was probably like most people's normal shopping experience at the store: great deals mixed with rising blood pressure. One of the great advantages to buying discount tires through Wal-Mart is that you can order the tires online and have them sent to any one of their tire and lube stores for free. That's right, free shipping. A couple months ago, I did just that. Thinking I would try a different route to save money, I purchased my discount tires through Wal-Mart instead of Tire Rack. Oh, and did I mention they mount your tires for free? With free mounting and only $5 a tire to balance (compared to $20 at my mechanic) it's hard to pass up that kind of savings. The problem I ran into with Wal-Mart was their customer service. When I asked how long it would take for everything to be completed, I was told an hour and half. I thought to myself, ""I can kill an hour and a half in Wal-Mart. Where's the electronics section?"" What I should have realized was that I was being quoted a time by a tire and lube service cashier clerk, not one of their mechanics. I periodically checked back every twenty minutes after the initial hour had gone by to see if they were through. Three long cell phone conversations, two walks up and down just about every aisle in the store and almost three hours later, my car was finally ready. When I rounded the corner, I could see my car sitting in the parking lot, but something was wrong. I was in the middle of a cell phone conversation with my wife, complaining about my day wasted. I walked up to my car to see the finished product and couldn't help but yell out mid-sentence, ""And they put whitewalls on it!"" Needless to say I did not ask for whitewall tires, nor did I want them. Now that I could drive away at last, there was no way I wanted my car to go back into that garage to have those tires turned around. Regardless of the waiting, the wailing and the whitewalls, I was able to buy four brand-name 80,000-mile discount tires, shipped and installed for under $300. I'm sure that I could have gotten the whitewall tires turned around with no problem from Wal-Mart's mechanics, but it was a personal decision based on how much more time it would have taken. I just want to let our readers know that sometimes you do pay for the best price. In my case, they charged me one perfectly good Thursday afternoon and any dignity my 13-year-old car was still clinging to.

"(CNN) -- CNN and the Cartoon Network's presentation of the AC360Â° special feature, ""The Bully Effect,"" spotlight a serious issue affecting children across our nation. The film underscores the damaging consequences of bullying and the need to prevent and respond to it. Lawmakers have a responsibility to ensure that our schools are safe, which is why I have made addressing this problem a priority in the United States Senate. I firmly believe that all children have a right to an education free from fear of being bullied. The denial of this basic right is a betrayal of children who simply want to learn. Anderson Cooper: Say no to bullying . The impact of bullying for students and for our nation are severe. In an era when a quality education matters greatly in a competitive global economy, students must be able to focus on their studies. Bullying distracts students who worry more about surviving the day unscathed than about the grades on their report card. Research has indicated that bullying causes increased absenteeism, dropout rates and academic underachievement, all of which undermine a child's ability to succeed in the classroom and beyond. I am particularly disturbed by stories of bullied youth who feel powerless to change their situation and who choose not to seek help from adults. A recent report from a newspaper in my home state of Pennsylvania told the story of a 12-year-old boy who regularly asks his parents not to report when he has been bullied because he fears possible retaliation. Rather than speak up about the threatening environment at school, he felt that his only option was to keep quiet or risk making things worse. Putting an end to bullying will require a consistent message from adults, including lawmakers, that young people can make a real difference in their lives and the lives of others when they speak up about bullying and harassment. Recently, I reintroduced bipartisan legislation to help prevent bullying and harassment -- the Safe Schools Improvement Act. My bill, which I'm proposing with co-sponsor Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, will require school districts that receive federal funding to develop codes of conduct that specifically ban bullying and harassment. This includes cyberbullying and bullying based on a student's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion. At the end of the 112th Congress, 41 senators had joined Senator Kirk and me in supporting this important, commonsense legislation. A new study found that the psychological side effects of bullying can extend up to a decade after the harassment has ended. Moreover, this elevated risk of mental health effects occurs not only with victims of bullying but also with the bullies themselves. Faced with the possibility of such far reaching consequences, it is more important than ever that we put a stop to the intimidation of our youth. I applaud those who are already working to make schools a place where all children can achieve their full potential without fear of being bullied, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to work with me in passing the Safe Schools Improvement Act. Watch the AC360 special documentary, ""The Bully Effect,"" on March 3 and March 9 at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Casey.

"(CNN) -- Geraldine Ferraro defended her controversial comment that Sen. Barack Obama's campaign was successful because he was black, telling an interviewer Tuesday that she was being attacked because she was white. Comments by former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro are drawing criticism from the Obama campaign. ""Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says, 'Let's address reality and the problems we're facing in this world,' you're accused of being racist, so you have to shut up,"" she told the Daily Breeze of Torrance, California. ""Racism works in two different directions. I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?"" In another interview Tuesday, she compared Obama's situation to her own 24 years ago, when she was the first female candidate for vice president. She told a FOX News interviewer, ""I got up and the question was asked, 'Why do you think Barack Obama is in the place he is today"" as the party's delegate front-runner? ""I said in large measure, because he is black. I said, Let me also say in 1984 -- and if I have said it once, I have said it 20, 60, 100 times -- in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would never have been the nominee for vice president,"" she said. In her first interview with Daily Breeze, published late last week, Ferraro said, ""If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman, he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept."" She also said Hillary Clinton had been the victim of a ""sexist media."" Obama himself has called the comments ""patently absurd."" ""I don't think Geraldine Ferraro's comments have any place in our politics or in the Democratic Party. They are divisive,"" he told the Allentown Morning Call. ""I think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd. And I would expect that the same way those comments don't have a place in my campaign, they shouldn't have a place in Sen. Clinton's, either,"" he added. Earlier, Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod, called for Clinton to sever ties with the former New York congresswoman, who serves on her campaign's finance committee. ""When you wink and nod at offensive statements, you're really sending a signal to your supporters that anything goes,"" Axelrod said. Axelrod said the comment by Ferraro, coupled with Clinton's ""own inexplicable unwillingness"" to deny that Obama was a Muslim during a recent interview, was part of ""an insidious pattern that needs to be addressed."" Ferraro could not be reached for comment. Clinton told The Associated Press that she did not agree with Ferraro's comments. ""It is regrettable that any of our supporters on both sides, because we've both had that experience, say things that kind of veer off into the personal,"" she said. ""We ought to keep this on the issues. There are differences between us. There are differences between our approaches on health care, on energy, on our experience, on our results that we've produced for people. That's what this campaign should be about."" The former congresswoman is the latest Clinton surrogate to launch a firestorm with comments that related to Obama's heritage or ethnicity. Clinton's husband, former President Clinton, drew sharp criticism from black leaders for a series of comments he made before the South Carolina primary, including comparing Obama's campaign to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 run. Former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, a major Clinton backer, said several times that an Obama presidency would improve the world's image of the U.S. because of the Illinois senator's Muslim roots. Obama, however, said Kerrey's comments were intended to highlight Obama's Muslim heritage in voters' minds. And shortly before the Texas primary, 84-year-old Clinton supporter Adelfa Callejo told CBS 11 News in Dallas, Texas, that Obama would have trouble attracting Latino support because he was African-American. ""When blacks had the numbers, they didn't do anything to support us,"" Callejo said. ""They always used our numbers to fulfill their goals and objectives, but they never really supported us, and there's a lot of hard feelings about that. I don't think we're going to get over it anytime soon."" Last month, when Hillary Clinton was asked whether she would reject and denounce Callejo's remarks, she said, ""People get to express their opinions,"" adding that ""a lot of folks have said really unpleasant things about me over the course of this campaign."" Later, her campaign released a statement saying that she had been unaware of the substance of the remarks during that interview and both denounced and rejected them. Obama has faced his own headaches. Foreign policy adviser Samantha Power ended her connection with his campaign last week after telling a Scottish interviewer that Clinton was a ""monster."" Power also made remarks about Obama's Iraq war policy that were used by the Clinton campaign in recent attacks.

"(CNN) -- The leader of the Syrian opposition met Saturday with the foreign minister of Russia, a longtime ally of the government that rebels hope to topple. Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, head of the Syrian National Coalition, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich, Germany, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. It gave no details and al-Khatib and Lavrov did not immediately respond to requests for comments. The opposition chief also met in Munich with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who had harsh words for the Syrian leadership. ""President (Barack) Obama and I and nearly all of our partners and allies are convinced that President (Bashar al-) Assad, a tyrant hell-bent on clinging to power, is no longer fit to lead the Syrian people and he must go,"" Biden said, according to a transcript of his speech released by the White House. ""The opposition continues to grow stronger. And as the Syrian people have their chance to forge their own future, they will continue to find a partner in the United States of America,"" he said. Russia has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership. Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to take action to end the conflict and force al-Assad to step down, stressing that outside powers shouldn't be picking Syria's leaders. In December, Russia invited al-Khatib to peace talks in Moscow or another location. The opposition chief said the group was open to talks, but not in Russia. He said then that Russia had overlooked atrocities in Syria, and must condemn the crimes before his group can engage in talks. When the Arab Spring revolts erupted across the region in early 2011, Syrians took to the streets to demonstrate against al-Assad's rule. The Syrian leader quickly responded with a crackdown by police and the army that exploded into a civil war. The United Nations says the conflict has now killed more than 60,000 people. The carnage continued Saturday, as at least 101 people were killed, the opposition said.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A 63-year-old man wanted in connection with the murder of five people in a remote Japanese hamlet has been captured after a manhunt involving more than 400 police. Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a ""suspicious"" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN on Wednesday. The following morning, two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims' respective homes. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. The wanted man -- who lived next to the burned out houses -- disappeared, prompting a huge manhunt. Police found the man in the mountains barely 1 km from the village. He was barefoot, wearing only his underwear when he was discovered, police spokesman Kazutaka Umemoto told CNN. The man was then taken to the nearest police station at Shunan for questioning. The case attracted significant media attention after a note, apparently written in the form of a ""haiku"" poem -- a short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: ""Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows."" They have refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings. Mitake is a remote, mountainous community with less than 20 inhabitants. According to local media, the arrested man lived alone, and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents. Reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7-8 years ago. One of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.","Police have captured a 63-year-old man in connection with a series of killings .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- Two hours of tanks, bands and goose-stepping under a blazing sun. Mass military parades are a North Korean specialty, but this year had added meaning: the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War that Pyongyang calls ""Victory Day."" Thunderous applause and shouts of ""Mansei,"" meaning ""Live long and good health,"" signaled the arrival of the country's leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao. Men and women alike raised their hands to applaud Kim. When he waved to the assembled crowd, thousands waved back. Peace is precious to North Korea. This is how one army officer summed up the speech given by Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae. Read more: Cosmetic change, but no real reform . The officer claimed there was no mention of the United States or South Korea, both considered enemies of the state, meaning the rhetoric is vastly different to a few months ago when nuclear was threatened. Tensions have eased significantly recently, with the North Korean military saying it wants to resume joint recovery work with the United States to search for the remains of around 8,000 Americans still missing in action in the country sixty years later. The parade looked to the past and present of the military. A dozen trucks filled with Korean War veterans drove slowly through Kim Il Sung Square past Kim Jong Un and the leadership with the elderly fighters dressed in uniform smiling and waving energetically. Many would have been in their 80s or 90s. Soldiers then filed past in perfect unison armed with the weapons used in the 1950-1953 war. A highly choreographed event with barely a step out of place. The military practices two or three times a week for up to four months for this one day, according to the officer. Even though there was no verbal anti-American rhetoric, the visual messages were clear. On the front of every tank a special message has been painted in Korean. It said ""let us annihilate U.S. aggressors, blood enemy of the Korean people."" And one of the floats showed an American flag crumpled beneath a model of a Korean tank. Read more: U.S. vets honor fallen comrades in S. Korea . Messages from helicopters flying overhead read: ""We will defend Kim Jong Un to the death."" Helicopters also staged a dramatic fly by, flying between buildings in pairs to pass just a few hundred feet from the leader. Fighter jets flying overhead drew a gasp from the enraptured crowd. Bronze statues of the country's founder, Kim Il Sung, and his son, Kim Jong Il, were paraded through the capital's main square as were giant photos of the former leaders. And the part of the parade that will be scrutinized around the world for any sign of new technology was the display of missiles in Pyongyang's arsenal. An army officer pointed to one that looked like a mid-range missile and said it could reach the U.S. island of Hawaii. The military parade was the center piece of celebrations surrounding the 60th anniversary. Saturday is a national holiday in North Korea and tens of thousands of residents who joined in the public procession waved plastic flowers above their heads as they ran past the leader's balcony smiling and cheering. It is an emotionally charged time for North Koreans attending the official festivities. The parade follows the opening of a Korean War cemetery Thursday and the Arirang mass games Friday night.

"Boston (CNN) -- Pounding his fist on the witness stand Thursday, real-estate developer Richard Buccheri, 73, described the day he came face-to-face with Boston's alleged Irish mob kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. He had called Buccheri to a meeting to discuss the positioning of a fence on a property Bulger associate Kevin Weeks wanted to buy, Buccheri said. He said they had barely sat down when Bulger banged on the table and told Buccheri, ""You know Rich, sometimes you should just keep your mouth shut. You know Kevin Weeks is like a surrogate son."" Buccheri's opinion on the positioning of the fence was not favorable to Weeks. Raising two fingers to his mouth to demonstrate, Buccheri said Bulger ""takes a shotgun off the table and sticks it in my mouth. Then he took it out, punched me in the shoulder and said, 'Richard you're a stand-up guy. I'm not going to kill you."" But then, he said, Bulger ""puts a 45 to my head"" and demands $200,000 in 30 days, ""threatening to kill me and my family."" Buccheri said he cut a check for the 200-grand, which Bulger's henchman, Steve Flemmi cashed days later. Buccheri said he had to give a Braintree bank teller verbal permission to cash the gargantuan check. Flemmi finished up his six days of testimony Thursday. He described a decades-long journey that included extortion, meetings with FBI agents and slayings. Flemmi testified he was by Bulger's side for most of it, saying both were FBI informants. He described hundreds of occasions when he and Bulger met with FBI agents. The defense suggested Wednesday that Flemmi would say anything to sweeten his deal with prosecutors and possibly get out of prison, even though the government has never raised that as a possibility. Flemmi was arrested in 1995, was found guilty and was sentenced in 2001 to 10 years in prison for extortion and money laundering. In 2003 he pleaded guilty 10 murders and was sentenced to life in prison. Bulger attorney Hank Brennan asked Flemmi whether he hoped to get out of prison one day, and Flemmi said, ""I'm still alive. There's always hope."" Brennan also highlighted Flemmi's relatively comfortable living conditions. ""It's like the Club Med of federal facilities,"" he said. ""You really think so?"" Flemmi responded, apparently incredulous, about the undisclosed prison. Brennan also asked about an apparent delicatessen on the premises serving salmon, steak, and smoked oysters. Flemmi denied such a place exists, saying, ""If I fed some of that food to my dog, he'd bite me."" He then complained about the July Fourth prison meal saying disgustedly, ""The hotdogs were burned. The hamburgers were burned."" Flemmi was spared the death penalty on the 10 murder charge after agreeing to testify against Bulger and his disgraced FBI informant handler, John Connolly. Authorities say Connolly accepted thousands of dollars from Bulger and his crew in payoffs and, in turn, tipped them off to law enforcement activity. Connolly was convicted of federal and state crimes and is serving 40 years in Florida. Under Flemmi's plea deal, the government allowed him to keep numerous properties including a home, at least four condos and a coin laundry. Despite Connolly's conviction and Flemmi's testimony, Bulger's lawyers have argued in this trial that he was not an FBI informant. Authorities say Connolly, who was raised in the same housing projects as Bulger, cut a deal with the alleged mob figure in 1975. Bulger would give information about the Italian mob -- the FBI's prime target -- while Bulger, authorities said, got names of rival gang members and other informants who had dirt on him. He is accused of killing those people. Without that FBI protection, prosecutors say, Bulger and Flemmi's reign of terror would not have been as successful or lasted as long as it did, from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. Bulger rose to the top of the notorious Winter Hill gang, prosecutors say, before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after the crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. He was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city. The girlfriend, Catherine Greig, was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture. At his arraignment in July 2011 he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts. Through his lawyers, the 83-year-old defendant had argued he was given immunity by the FBI and a former prosecutor. The judge dismissed the claim, saying any purported immunity was not a defense against crimes Bulger faces. Prosecutors plan to call two more witness Friday, and expect to rest their case on the 30th day of trial. The defenses amended witness list, which was cut virtually in half to 32 witnesses last week, was whittled down to a potential 16 witnesses after Judge Denise Casper ruled some witnesses irrelevant and the defense withdrew a handful. The list is subject to further change. Among those virtually certain to testify are four FBI agents who the defense says will testify Bulger was not an informant for FBI in Boston. The government argued that Bulger is not ""charged"" with being an informant and the testimony could confuse jurors. But Casper said that, ""given the centrality of the government's allegation of Bulger being an informant to all of the matters in this case, I think those are proper witnesses."" Also on the stand Thursday afternoon was bar owner Kevin O'Neil, one of the O's in ""Triple O's Bar,"" an establishment that doubled as one of Bulger's many headquarters in the 1970s and '80s. O'Neil said he had Bulger on the payroll, but he was never an employee. When prosecuting attorney Zachary Hafer asked why he was on the payroll, O'Neil responded, ""He asked."" Hafer: ""Why didn't you say 'No'""? O'Neil: ""I didn't think it was smart."" O'Neil testified that in Christmas of 1994 he got a call from Connolly, who said, ""Get ahold of the kid because his friend has a problem."" In rapid-fire questioning, Hafer asked, The Kid?--""Kevin Weeks""; the friend?--""Jim Bulger""; the problem? --""I believe indictments."" O'Neil testified that he then saw Connolly talking to Weeks shortly after that call. O'Neil said he never saw Bulger again after that day. Prosecutors say Connolly tipped Bulger off to a 1995 indictment, causing Bulger to go on the run, landing himself on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in California. Besides the slayings, Bulger is accused of using violence, force and threats to shake down South Boston's bookmakers, loan sharks and drug dealers. The Irish mob allegedly laundered its ill-gotten gains though liquor stores, bars and other property it owned in South Boston. CNN's Gary Carter contributed to this report.","Real-estate developer Richard Buccheri says ""Whitey"" Bulger put a gun to his head .

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- An Army computer investigator testified late Sunday that a search of military computers used by Pfc. Bradley Manning in Iraq revealed that he had downloaded the same secret documents and videos that were released online by WikiLeaks. This was the first testimony in Manning's preliminary military hearing appearing to link him to WikiLeaks. The Army private faces 22 charges -- foremost among them, aiding the enemy -- after being accused of distributing hundreds of thousands of secret government documents to the website WikiLeaks, which then posted them online. The Army investigator, Special Agent David Shaver, said that the search of Manning's computer revealed the electronic footprints of which documents Manning had collected and when. He said there were computer code references to hundreds of thousands of secret State and Defense Department documents on the computers, and in some cases the full documents themselves. In addition he mentioned finding on Manning's computer videos that also were leaked, with one showing a U.S. Apache helicopter attack that killed two Reuters journalists in Baghdad in 2007 . And Shaver said a forensic analysis of Manning's computers showed Manning had searched for information about WikiLeaks more than 100 times, as well as information about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. ""A lot of the searches seemed out of place,"" Shaver testified. Manning is accused of stealing and leaking State and Defense Department secrets while serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. Shaver said his investigation also found that Manning had created a small computer program to download a large amount of files automatically. Manning's defense team gets a chance Monday morning to cross examine the Army computer expert. This third day of the Article 32 hearing is the latest stop along the road to a possible court martial of Manning on multiple charges including aiding the enemy and publishing government secrets on the Internet. The presiding investigating officer said the hearing would go into closed session Monday morning to consider classified information. The hearing went into closed-to-the-public session Sunday afternoon for more than an hour to consider the same issue. During the day, Manning -- who turned 24 Saturday -- chatted with his civilian and military lawyers sitting beside him and appeared to pay close attention to the testimony. He seemed unruffled about lengthy descriptions of his emotional outbursts in Iraq, or the details of the searches of his computers. Earlier Sunday, military prosecutors portrayed Manning as a highly skilled, calculating traitor -- in sharp contrast to the defense argument that he was a uniquely talented soldier who was picked on by colleagues and was struggling to come to grips with his sexual identity. The alleged crimes occurred at a forward operating base in Iraq, where Manning and others worked 12-hour shifts inside a secure computer room sifting through reports of insurgent threats as well as downloading games, music and movies. The private was there between November 2009 and May 2010, when he was arrested. Manning was widely recognized for his computer skills, as well as being known for his emotional outbursts -- like scuffling with co-workers, slamming his fist on tables and even being seemingly unresponsive as he stared at his computer screen, according to testimony over the first three days of the preliminary hearing at Fort Meade, which is located between Washington and Baltimore. An officer who supervised the private said Sunday that she'd recommended that he be removed from the computer room outside Baghdad after he fought with a fellow soldier. Capt. Casey Fulton, the first witness on the hearing's third day, said she also recommended that Manning's weapon be taken away. At the same time, Fulton described the Army private -- who had access to classified government computer networks -- as trained, experienced and knowledgeable. She agreed with a defense attorney that Manning was her ""go-to analyst"" on various computer projects. ""He was very good in researching and compiling data,"" Fulton said. Numerous witnesses have described Manning's work as an intelligence analyst at a forward operating base in Iraq. It was during that stint that he is accused of downloading secret documents and distributing them. In response to defense questions, Fulton described how music, movies and games had been downloaded to government computers. Manning is accused of downloading government documents while pretending to listen to a Lady GaGa CD. Fulton conceded it was impossible to monitor everyone inside the computer room, known as a Sensitive Compartmentalized Computer Facility. ""There is only a limited amount of supervisors; we can't supervise everyone every second of the day,"" Fulton said. A computer expert who worked in Iraq as a private contractor testified that Manning boasted about his computer skills. ""He said, 'If people knew what I did with computers, they would be amazed,'"" said Jason Allen Milliman. ""He seemed kind of serious and kind of joking at the same time. I didn't know how to take him."" Milliman said the computer that Manning shared with Sgt. Chad Madaras -- with the former working the day shift, and the latter the night shift -- had an unusual amount of problems. Testifying by telephone from Fort Drum, New York, Madaras said the computer would be running smoothly when he left for the day, only to have problems when he returned 12 hours later. He told prosecutors he had never tried to access records of terrorist detainees held at Guantanamo Navy Base in Cuba or other secret government sites. And he said he never used Manning's computer profile and didn't know any of his passwords. Manning's civilian defense attorney, David Coombs, clashed again Sunday with the presiding officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, when he repeatedly asked Madaras whether the private had been picked on. Coombs complained the investigating officer ""should not arbitrarily limit cross-examination."" Madaras described emotional outbursts by Manning in the secure computer facility at base, located outside Baghdad. On one occasion, he said that Manning became non-responsive, sitting and staring at his computer screen. ""Did he seem to be an outcast in the unit?"" Coombs asked. ""Yes, sir,"" Madaras replied. Two witnesses called to testify Sunday -- Sgt. 1st Class Paul Adkins and Warrant Officer Kyle Bolonek -- refused to answer questions, invoking their right to remain silent. It was not clear why both men, who had worked with Manning in Iraq, didn't answer questions. Adkins has been reduced in rank, from master sergeant to sergeant first class. The Defense Department has said 15 military personnel were disciplined in the aftermath of the WikiLeaks scandal. The military also subsequently restricted the number of people who could download secret information. It instituted new rules requiring two people to authorize any downloads, and set up alerts whenever there is any mass transfer of information. At the time of Manning's last deployment to Iraq, there was no technology to block soldiers from downloading and stealing massive amounts of government secrets, a military computer expert testified Sunday. Capt. Thomas Cherepko said intelligence analysts like Manning could move information back and forth from their official computers and a shared computer hard drive. Testifying by telephone, he said there was nothing preventing a soldier from burning a CD of classified information, taking the CD, and then distributing whatever files were on it. ""The only thing preventing that is trust,"" said Cherepko, who served with Manning at the same base in Iraq. The captain said that no other soldier in Manning's unit did anything to exploit weaknesses in the computer system and transfer material to a personal computer. Each person using the secret government computer system had to read and sign a document agreeing to secrecy and security rules. Once the investigation was launched, this document for Manning could not be found, according to Cherepko. Earlier testimony in the preliminary hearing portrayed Manning as someone troubled by Army discipline during his deployment to Iraq, and who was struggling with sexual orientation and gender identification issues. If convicted on all counts, Manning could face the death penalty. However, Army prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction, and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer.","NEW: Investigator: Manning's computer had secret documents and videos .

"(CNN) -- News of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured 178 others Monday has understandably dominated CNN's coverage this week. You can follow the live updates here, as events unfold. Two men believed to be suspects in the case have been identified. One died of injuries suffered during a confrontation with police Friday, and the other was arrested after a standoff with police, causing jubilation in Boston. But while all eyes were on the Boston suburb of Watertown, there was plenty going on elsewhere. Here are five stories you may have missed: . 1. A deadly wave of bombings blasted Iraq Tuesday, ahead of elections there Saturday. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Shiite neighborhoods, police checkpoints and political offices were among the targets. At least 42 people were killed, with more than 257 others wounded. 2. The founder of the French company that made controversial breast implants, went on trial over the scandal. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. Mas was arrested in January 2012 in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his products were perfectly safe. 3. A powerful earthquake struck Pakistan's border with Iran, Tuesday, killing 34 people and injuring 80 others in Pakistan, sources say. Officials earlier said that dozens more were injured in both countries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was preliminarily measured at 7.8 magnitude. The Iranian Seismological Center said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5. Army doctors and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces took part in rescue efforts in Mashakel, according to a Pakistani official involved in relief efforts. 4. A Pakistani court confined the country's former president Pervez Musharraf to his home Friday. The move came a day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court after a judge revoked his bail. The development is the latest legal setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month, five years after he resigned as president and left the country, to fight a series of court cases against him. He had been seeking to run in upcoming elections. 5. New Zealand's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Wednesday. The country became the first in the Asia Pacific region to pass the legislation, ahead of Australia, whose gay community feels the country is falling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed the bill by a convincing margin of 77 votes to 44, amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry. Overjoyed supporters of the legislation in the public gallery burst into song in celebration.","A deadly wave of bombings blasted Iraq ahead of elections on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- For the first time since the queen's coronation in 1953, the dress, robes, jewels, diamonds and uniforms worn on that day have finally been brought together again. The coronation dress and the robe that Queen Elizabeth II wore as she walked down the aisle at Westminster Abbey on Coronation Day on 2 June 1953 are the centerpieces of the showcase at the Buckingham Palace. ""It's one of the most important days of her life being crowned as sovereign and I think it must bring back a lot of very happy memories,"" said the exhibition's curator Caroline de Guitaut. British couturier Norman Hartnell designed the white satin dress with embroidered national and Commonwealth floral emblems and attached pearls, crystals and sequins. The robe that the queen wore when she left Westminster Abbey to go to Buckingham Palace is made of English purple silk-velvet and is more than 6.5 meters long from the shoulder to the tip of the train. The embroidery of wheat ears and olive branches, which includes 18 different types of gold thread, was produced by the Royal School of Needlework and took 3,500 hours to complete. De Guitaut added: ""I think it's very difficult to put a price on these very unique and very special objects and of course they're just so redolent of that magnificent day, that very famous day in our national history."" The outfits worn on the day by the then four-year-old Prince Charles and his two-year-old sister Princess Anne can also be seen. The Halo tiara that the queen's sister Princess Margaret wore and which was later loaned by the queen to Kate Middleton when she married Prince William at Westminster Abbey is part of the exhibition. Visitors will also be able to stroll through 19 state rooms in the palace. ""There are lots of other works in the visitor room which people will see and encounter and also will give them a sense of what it was like to be in Buckingham Palace on that day,"" de Guitaut said. After the official coronation, more than 8,000 guests were invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate the occasion at banquets. The exhibition shows recreations of the table settings and flowers of the series of banquets that foreign heads of state and the royal family attended. This year's exhibition is part of the public opening of the palace every year when the queen leaves on vacation. It runs from 27 July until 29 September 2013.","Queen Elizabeth II's coronation regalia from 1953 goes on display at Buckingham Palace .

"(CNN) -- A little more than a month after taking office, President Obama addresses a joint session of Congress tonight, the 76th time a president has done so. Ronald Reagan was the only president to postpone his speech to Congress. Tonight's speech by Obama will not technically be a ""State of the Union"" address. Since 1977, new presidents haven't called their first speech before Congress that.  When a ""State of the Union"" isn't » . Check out other tidbits of presidential address/State of the Union history to quench your thirst for political trivia. The 2009 speech . • Tonight's address will be the 220th State of the Union/""annual message"" in the nation's history. • It will be the 76th time a U.S. president has delivered the address as a speech before Congress. • The last Democratic president to address a Democratic-controlled Congress was Bill Clinton in 1994. The history . • Only U.S. presidents give solo addresses to joint SESSIONS of Congress; prominent Americans, foreign heads of state and other officials address joint MEETINGS of Congress. • The U.S. Constitution requires the president to brief Congress on the state of the union: ""He [the president] shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" • The idea for a State of the Union address originated from a British monarchy ritual. The king would give a speech from the throne at the opening session of Parliament. • George Washington delivered the first ""annual message"" on January 8, 1790, at Federal Hall in New York. • Washington and his successor, John Adams, delivered their annual messages as speeches before Congress. Thomas Jefferson, the third president, discontinued this practice in 1801, saying the elaborate, formal ceremony (which included a ""president's throne"") too closely resembled a king addressing his subjects. Instead, Jefferson's private secretary carried the written message to Capitol Hill, and it was read to the chamber by the clerk of the House. The practice of written annual messages continued for 112 years. • Woodrow Wilson resumed the practice of delivering the ""annual message"" as a speech before Congress on December 2, 1913. Wilson's decision was controversial at the time. Almost every president since has delivered the address in person, rather than in writing. • The president's message was not referred to as a ""State of the Union"" until January 6, 1941 (Franklin Roosevelt's eighth address). Before that, the ""State of the Union"" was generally referred to as the president's ""annual message."" • Harry Truman delivered the longest State of the Union in 1946 at 25,000 words; Washington's 1790 address was the shortest at 833 words. • The only postponement of a State of the Union occurred in 1986. Ronald Reagan was scheduled to deliver his address on January 28, 1986, the same day the space shuttle Challenger exploded. The speech was delayed until February 4. • The practice of inviting surprise guests to sit in the House Gallery began in 1982 when Reagan recognized Lenny Skutnick, a good Samaritan who pulled a survivor out of the frozen Potomac River in Washington, D.C., after an Air Florida plane crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. The guests sit in the first lady's box. The logistics . • At least one member of the president's Cabinet is designated not to attend the speech in person to ensure the presidential line of succession. The choice of which Cabinet member stays away rotates among the departments. This year, Attorney General Eric Holder will not attend. • The State of the Union is delivered in the chamber of the House of Representatives, before members of both the House and the Senate, as well as the justices of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet and international dignitaries. • The president is escorted into the House chamber by members of both the House and the Senate, and his arrival is announced by the sergeant-at-arms of the House. The House speaker then introduces the president. • Seated behind the president during the address are the top members of each chamber of Congress: the president of the Senate (a.k.a. the vice president) and the speaker of the House. If there is no vice president, or if the vice president does not attend, the president pro tempore of the Senate sits in the vice president's seat. • Members of the Supreme Court usually attend the State of the Union (seated front-row, center), though they do not play an official role.","Obama's address will be the 220th State of the Union/""annual message""

"(CNN) -- Journalist Michael Hastings, known for his 2010 profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to the officer's abrupt retirement, died in a car accident in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The 33-year-old had been a reporter for BuzzFeed since last year, when he was hired to cover the Obama re-election campaign. ""Michael was a great, fearless journalist with an incredible instinct for the story, and a gift for finding ways to make his readers care about anything he covered from wars to politicians,"" BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said in a statement. ""He wrote stories that would otherwise have gone unwritten, and without him there are great stories that will go untold."" Hastings was also a contributor to Rolling Stone, and it was his profile in that magazine about McChrystal that led to the the general leaving his position. In his profile, Hastings quoted McChrystal and his staff criticizing and mocking key administration officials. The young reporter wrote that McChrystal and Obama ""failed from the outset to connect,"" and that the president looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by top military officials. Hastings wrote that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocked Vice President Joe Biden. The fallout of the article was significant, with the general resigning from his post as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, followed by his retirement from the armed forces. ""Hastings' hallmark as reporter was his refusal to cozy up to power,"" his obituary in Rolling Stone read. ""While other embedded reporters were charmed by McChrystal's bad-boy bravado and might have excused his insubordination as a joke, Hastings was determined to expose the recklessness of a man leading what Hastings believed to be a reckless war.""

"(CNN) -- After moving from New York to Virginia Beach five years ago, Jennifer Herzog started noticing something odd when exiting grocery stores. Her hands and forearms felt hot, looked red and were swollen. After a few errands, she identified the irritant: plastic bags. ""There are some plastic bags that do it, and there are some that don't,"" Herzog said. ""All grocery bags pretty much are bad."" She started noticing other irritants, too: She began to have a similar response to fragrances as she had to plastic bags. Now, when she hugs someone wearing certain perfumes or colognes, her face turns red and swells. Dermatologist Joseph Fowler says skin reactions to fragrances and perfumes are common, but to have a reaction from finished plastic products like plastic bags is extremely rare, though not undocumented. ""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy, usually when they're in the raw material state, and the unfinished products,"" said Fowler, co-author of a medical textbook on dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. ""But because the chemicals in finished products are bound so tightly, it's awfully hard for them to penetrate to the skin and set off the allergy."" Then again, the finished products may not be the real problem. A reaction to plastics like Herzog's may have more to do with residue from the manufacturing process than the plastic itself, says materials science expert Andrew Dent. ""There are additives to make the plastic bags easier to process that manufacturers are putting on the outside surfaces,"" said Dent, vice president of materials research at Material ConneXion. ""That could also be the problem."" Others may react with redness and swelling to plastic bags, but they don't necessarily have an allergy. A condition called dermographic urticaria, in which the skin becomes inflamed from scratching or rubbing, is far more common, Fowler explains. For those with the condition, carrying heavy bags from the grocery store could be enough to cause a reaction. Herzog, however, has developed allergies to some chemicals in plastics and perfumes, her doctor tells her, as well as to seasonal allergens like pollen. Her doctor explained that allergies to just about anything can develop at any time. ""I don't understand how it just comes out of nowhere, because I never, never had issues,"" Herzog said. She wonders whether things could just as suddenly get even worse for her or for people she knows. It's a notion she's confronted with not just in her personal life but also at work, in the catered food she arranges for groups of children and preteens at big events. Despite being 28 years old, Herzog has worked in the food and beverage industry long enough to see a dramatic increase in the number of children with food sensitivities, she says. She wonders whether people are generally becoming more sensitive to things. ""It's amazing how many allergies these kids have. It's insane. We're preparing more special meals than regular meals. Which is weird, because then when you do adult functions, you maybe have like one or two allergies. The chefs are becoming very well-versed in this now."" Herzog's observations have some backing in peer-reviewed medical studies. The latest numbers -- now two years old -- draw from 40,000 children in the U.S. and reveal that 8% of those under the age of 18 have food allergies. That's twice the number estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using data collected in 2007. Dr. Ruchi Gupta, who led the study finding the 8% figure, says that's probably a conservative number, in part because her team discounted reports by parents when the symptoms sounded more like a food intolerance, such as to gluten or lactose, than a true food allergy. Although Gupta and the CDC used parent surveys to make their estimates, hospital records show a similar upward trend. U.S. hospitals discharged about 4,135 children with diagnosed food allergies each year between 2001 and 2003. For the period from 2004 to 2006, that average annual number jumped to 9,537, according to the CDC. ""Food allergy among children in the United States is becoming more common over time,"" states the CDC website. Whether food intolerance to lactose and gluten is also increasing is harder to determine, in part because the conditions often go undiagnosed. As the medical community grapples to understand the problem and what can be done about it, businesses have had to adapt and accommodate. ""It's a matter of life and death, especially with children. Six or seven years ago, you'd just say, 'Sorry, that risk is too much to take. I (would) suggest they bring something with them, or they don't come,' "" said Jennifer Delaye, president of the International Caterers Association. ""Now, today, it's a standard way of doing business. Entire menus are designed around that.""","""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy,"" Dr. Joseph Fowler says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Grammy-winning and multiplatinum-selling rapper Lil Wayne suffered a seizure and ""is recovering,"" his record label's publicist said Friday. The New Orleans artist arguably occupies the highest rungs of the hip-hop world, but he shares them with fellow rapper Drake, who hails from Toronto. Drake appeared at the Los Angeles hospital, where Lil Wayne is being treated, with an entourage of Wayne's friends. They pulled up chairs in the hallway near his room and set up a vigil. Twitter has lit up with rumors, spreading fears of the worst for Wayne's outcome, but a Tweet in his name attempted to calm the tempest. Lil Wayne's ready for rap retirement . ""I'm good everybody,"" read a message from Lil Wayne's Twitter account. ""Thnx for the prayers and love."" While acknowledging a medical issue, members of the New Orleans artist's camp have shot down reports that he was near death. ""Dont believe the nonsense about comas and tubes to breathe ... that's false!!"" tweeted Mack Maine, the president of Lil Wayne's Young Money label, around 5:20 p.m. (8:20 p.m. ET) Friday. Sarah Cunningham, a publicist with the Young Money record label, acknowledged that Lil Wayne had a seizure. The public relations department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Los Angeles hospital where the rapper is reportedly being treated, did not confirm or deny that Lil Wayne is there, per its policy. Maine didn't offer much detail, though he did say that he and Lil Wayne had been watching the Syracuse University Orange play Georgetown in the Big East men's basketball tournament. ""Wayne is alive and well!"" the record label president wrote on Twitter. The rapper's independent publicist, Kia Selby, said only, ""Lil Wayne is doing well."" She strongly denied reports he was in a medically induced coma, as reported by TMZ. Born Dwayne Carter, Lil Wayne is one of the rap world's most successful artists. He won best rap album for ""Tha Carter III"" at the 2008 Grammy awards, and took home three more Grammys the following year. Beyond winning over critics, he's also been a commercial success. Last September, Billboard reported the rapper had tallied 109 hits on its Hot 100, surpassing the record previously held by Elvis Presley. But he's also run into trouble outside the studio and stage. Lil Wayne was arrested in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater after police said they found a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. He ended up pleading guilty to felony gun charges and spending eight months at New York's Rikers Island jail. CNN's Denise Quan reported from Los Angeles and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","NEW: Fellow rapper Drake and other friends set up vigil outside his room .

"(CNN) -- Forget ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight."" In a few months, ""The Hunger Games"" phenomenon will be taking over the pop culture world. Although it will be feeding off the tween demographic, this franchise will chew up those other guys and spit them out. But what exactly is this ""Hunger Games"" wonder that has so many folks talking months before the movie (which just wrapped up filming earlier this month) is even released? Like many of the wildly successful film franchises these days, it began with a book. Suzanne Collins is the mastermind behind ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy, which has been gaining momentum over the last few months for both its suspenseful plot and overarching message about society. The plot revolves around a dystopian society where punishment for a previous rebellion has resulted in a televised event. One boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district (there are 12 total) are selected at random and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, where ""tributes"" must fight to the death until only one is left standing. ""The Hunger Games"" gives us a heroine named Katniss, a strong-willed and unwavering spirit, who volunteers for the games in order to spare her younger sister. Once inside the death match arena, she must get down and dirty to outlive her competitors, but there's one slight problem. Her hot friend Peeta gets cast into the games, too. In the midst of all the slaying, Katniss finds herself embroiled in a love triangle with her longtime pal Gale, who is watching the games from his home, and Peeta, who confesses his love for her inside the arena. Katniss' emotional turmoil of love or death makes Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" look like child's play. Apparently, Collins' twisted plot came to her one night while she was channel surfing between a competition reality show and a news program about the Iraq war. She blended the two shows and ""The Hunger Games"" was born. The first film of the franchise is slated for release on March 23, 2012, while the second film is already booked for November 2013. Fans can only hope director Gary Ross doesn't soften the book, because the twists and turns will make for an edge-of-your-seat thriller. At this rate, the film is set to have more passion than ""Twilight"" and more action than ""Harry Potter."" The film has already faced some controversy. When Lionsgate announced that Jennifer Lawrence had been cast to play Katniss, both fans and critics questioned the choice, believing she was too old, too blond and too pretty to play a ruthless warrior. However, if her success in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" is any indication of her range, Lawrence has the potential to nail this role and pave the way for kick-butt female heroines. The movie's lead male stars will likely rise to instant fame, just as Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner did with ""Twilight."" The relatively unknown actors Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale) will provide plenty of eye candy for the film. Other stars on the bill include Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) and Lenny Kravitz (Cinna). The film was originally meant to be low budget, however the hype has pushed the movie to a nearly $100-million production, the Los Angeles Times reported. The cast and crew wrapped filming earlier this month after an 84-day shoot, and a recently released teaser trailer has given fans a taste of what's to come. The hype may have escalated the budget, but the film may still exceed all expectations -- and be one lucrative franchise that reaches audiences of all ages. Now, with only a few months until the first film's release, you still have plenty of time to pick up the book if you haven't read it. But be warned, once you finish the addictive read, you'll probably hunger for more.","Suzanne Collins is the mastermind behind ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy .

"New York (CNN) -- The Nathan's Famous hot dog-eating contest has always separated the men from the boys, as far as eating competitions go, but this year it will separate the men from the women -- with separate challenges for the sexes. George Shea, chairman of the annual event's sponsor, Major League Eating, says that with more women competing, it was the right decision to make. ""There was a feeling that what woman have done is nothing short of fantastic, but they were being overshadowed by the men,"" Shea said. As Nathan's Famous readies for its 96th annual July Fourth International Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island, the ladies will go first in vying for their own championship belt. The women's competition will abide by the same rules, with at least 10 female contestants required to eat as many hot dogs and buns as they can in 10 minutes. Qualifying events for the contest begin April 23 and will be held in 13 cities including Las Vegas, Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York and Pittsburgh. Events will also be held in Canada and China to qualify for the July 4 contest. Although the men's competition will feature a grand prize of $20,000 and the famous championship belt, the woman's purse will be $5,000. Why the disparity? Shea says that the overall prize money will eclipse that of past years and that although the money is meaningful, the instant celebrity for the first female hot dog-eating champion will make up for the shortfall. In 2010, reigning champion Joey Chestnut took home the championship belt for the fourth year in a row after scarfing down 54 hot dogs and buns, although he'd eaten a record 68 dogs in 2009. The leading female contender for this year's event is Sonya Thomas, who downed 36 hot dogs in the co-ed 2010 contest, falling short of her personal best of 41 hot dogs in 2009. A strong challenger will probably be 45-year-old Juliet Lee from Germantown, Maryland. Lee, who owns a hair salon, is ""excited"" and hopes to best her personal record of 34 hot dogs, which she accomplished a year ago. Lee, who weighs 100 pounds, says she's participating ""not for the money but because it's a passion."" She prefers seafood, she says. German tourist Birgit Felden broke the Nathan's gender barrier in 1984 as the first female competitor, downing 11 hot dogs and buns. Major League Eating is launching a global effort to find Felden and have her come back to Coney Island this year.","The first woman to compete was a German tourist, in 1984 .

"(CNN) -- Google is tightening its grip on the booming tablet market, with a new tablet, updated version of Android and a social take on games. The company announced a new version of its popular Nexus 7 tablet during a press event Wednesday in San Francisco. Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android and Chrome, unveiled a slimmed-down, speedier version of the tablet, which will start at $229 when it goes on sale next week. The new Nexus 7, made by Asus, has undergone some subtle physical changes. The size of the device has been trimmed down while keeping the screen the same dimensions. The higher resolution screen is now 1,920 by 1,200 pixels, packing in 323 pixels per inch. The amount of RAM has been doubled, and the CPU is twice as fast as the previous Nexus 7. The company also said that it has improved its speaker performance and that it can last for nine hours of high-definition video playing. Netflix will be one of the first apps to take advantage of the new video-friendly specs. The streaming-video company's new Android app will stream movies at 1080p on the Nexus 7. The device will run Android Jelly Bean 4.3, a new version of Google's Android operating system. Google unveils $35 device that streams video to your TV . Tablets are on track to take over PCs, and Google has a bigger stake in the boom than its own flagship devices. Half of all tablets sold worldwide are based on Android, according to the company. ""By the end of 2013, consumers are going to buy more tablets every year than personal computers,"" Pichai said. The new version of Android 4.3 will have parental controls so you can prevent the little ones from seeing saucy content or inappropriate apps. There are also user profiles for tablets that end up in the hands of multiple users. The company expects to have more than 70 million tablet activations this year. Many of those users are downloading content such as apps, music and movies from the Google Play store. The Play store has more than 1 million apps and has seen more than 50 billion downloads, according to the company. A new app, called Google Play Games, is similar to Apple's Game Center. In it, Android users can see what games their friends are playing and go up against other users, checking out their accomplishments on leader boards. Older Nexus devices will also be able to test out the Android upgrade -- existing Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and Galaxy Samsung devices will receive over-the-air updates for the operating system. The Wi-Fi versions of the Nexus 7 will be available starting July 30, and an unlocked LTE version of the tablet will go on sale in the coming weeks.","Google unveils new tablet, version of Android .

"(CNN) -- Back in the 1950s, Hollywood fell in love with the idea of truth serum. All manner of spies, murderers and other bad guys were given a needle containing sodium pentothal on the big screen and soon were babbling away uncontrollably as to their guilt or complicity with Red China or the Soviet Union. As recently as 2004 in ""Meet the Fockers,"" a former CIA agent played by Robert De Niro injects his would-be son-in-law, played by Ben Stiller, with the stuff to get the lowdown on his love life. Stiller's character confesses, in a foreshadowing of Arnold Schwarzenegger's amorous ways, to having had a child with his housekeeper, although whether he did or not is far from clear. Harry Potter knew all about truth serum. Veritaserum was used on a variety of miscreants and by evildoers. It was so powerful and feared that its use was strictly controlled by the Ministry of Magic. In reality, magical thinking is all it really is. There is no such thing as truth serum. But that news has apparently not reached Colorado. The judge in charge of the mass murder trial of James Holmes seems to think Hollywood was onto something with its fascination with truth serums. He has approved the use of a ""narcoanalytic interview"" -- such as a ""truth serum"" like sodium pentothal -- as part of a competency evaluation to determine whether Holmes was legally insane at the time he allegedly went on a rampage in a theater in Aurora, Colorado. Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring many more. Sodium pentothal -- the original ""truth serum"" -- was discovered in 1936 by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee L. Tabern working in Chicago at Abbott Laboratories. They were trying to create an injectable drug for use in general anesthesia. Their discovery was a success and had a huge impact on surgery. Sodium pentothal is still used today to knock out patients before they are given another, longer-lasting anesthetic to keep them unconscious during surgery. Sodium pentothal made surgery far less painful. It also has an interesting side effect. People under its influence lose their inhibitions and babble on about all sorts of things, leading to some amusing moments for surgical teams. This loss of inhibition gave a few researchers hope that the drug or something like it could be used to get the truth out of people in police stations, security interrogations or trials. But outside of Hollywood, no drug passes muster as a potion capable of getting accurately at the truth. People do get uninhibited and talk more freely, but they don't necessarily stop lying or fantasizing. They also grow more compliant, tending to agree with those asking them leading questions. There is no solid evidence that what is said under the influence of a ""truth"" drug correlates reliably with the truth. For the most part, people yammer away. If anything, they behave as if they were drunk rather than diligently affirming the sober truth. There is no drug that is going to shed trustworthy light on Holmes' state of mind last year when, police say, he donned a gas mask as well as full body armor and grabbed a rifle, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun and at least one .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol to launch a heinous attack. No drug can tell us what he was really thinking. In giving permission to use drugs, the judge has opened the door to a line of defense in which Holmes' lawyers can argue that if drugged, he is being forced to testify against himself against his will. As much as some might hope for a thing such as a truth serum, none exists. Whether Holmes was bad or mad when he allegedly caused so much misery to so many people will not get resolved by a technique beloved by Hollywood movie directors but not by scientists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arthur Caplan.","Judge in Aurora shootings approved use of drugs for competency evaluation .

"(CNN) -- Two reactions seize people in the face of a horrific event like the mass murder of little children in Newtown, Connecticut. The first is shock, the second is a rush into activity. The reason we rush into activity is to escape the numbness of shock and the pain that follows it. But if we bury ourselves in every detail of the story, staying glued to the TV, reliving the event in our imaginations and obsessing over the meaningless of violence, we may be working against the healing process rather than helping it. Medical science knows a lot more about the effects of trauma on the brain than it did even five years ago. One salient point is that post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, affects not just the immediate victims of violence, whether in war or the result of crime, but also bystanders and witnesses. Another discovery is that brain trauma causes abnormal activity in at least three areas of the brain. The amygdala, responsible for emotions, is over-activated. The hippocampus, responsible for short-term memory, starts to recycle the traumatic event obsessively. The prefrontal cortex, especially in the area that mediates emotions, becomes weaker. Opinion: To help kids with tragedy, slow down, listen . The overall result is that you can't stop reliving the traumatic event and feeling its impact, while your ability to get past your emotions is lessened. We've all experienced the PTSD state of the brain through mass tragedies like the attacks on 9/11. The symptoms are familiar, yet neuroscience allows us to see that healing consists of getting out of the pattern just described. Throwing yourself back into the traumatic event only increases the symptoms. An event like Newtown creates suffering. Suffering can be defined as the pain that makes life seem meaningless. Animals suffer, of course, and often deeply. Some, like the elephant, are capable of mourning for their kind if one dies. Humans, however, are subject to complex inner pain that includes fear, guilt, shame, grief, rage and hopelessness. September 11 revealed that it was an illusion to think that our society was immune to such suffering. That illusion abruptly burst again with Newtown. Thinking back, I was traveling on 9/11, and when I landed at a Midwest airport, I met people beseeching to know what to do about their distress. In those first moments, shock was just giving way to tears, so all anyone could do was to try to feel safe again on the most basic level. A parents' promise: I will keep you safe . I reflected on my own experiences with grief. ""Hold each other,"" I offered. ""Don't be afraid to ask for contact. Reach out and tell your loved ones that you do love them. Don't let it be taken for granted. Feel your fear. Be with it and allow it to be released naturally. Pray. Grieve with others if you can, alone if you must."" These were simple, basic remedies for the immediate reaction of shock. Grieving is often different for men and women, because men tend not to let their emotions out in front of others as easily as women can. Men have been taught that it is a sign of weakness to show public emotion, and so feel safer crying alone. But for anyone, peering into the brain as we now can do, the physiological story is that trauma disrupts the balance of feeling, memory and decision-making. They need time and care to come back into balance. Studies have shown that even in the face of tragedy, and despite the fact that a memory may be indelible, emotional balance for many victims can return to normal states within two years. This is cause for hope. When terrible things happen: Helping children heal . After shock and numbness, the second stage is that powerful emotions rise to the surface, often after being buried for years or decades. All around us we see rage and sorrow starting to erupt. (President Obama's call for an end to gun massacres expresses emotions that are strong today but will be tested tomorrow when politicians face the National Rifle Association and begin to calculate the odds of getting re-elected if a powerful lobby opposes them.) At the same time, over-sensitivity sets in because the brain's control mechanisms are weak. The most common incidents -- the slam of a door, a car backfiring, a surprise tap on the shoulder -- can cause a panic reaction. In ensuing days, this unguarded anxiety can begin to spread like a contagion. The third stage of suffering comes when you face your inner wound and either move to heal it, strike out against your symptoms, or choose denial. Each person affected by a trauma usually falls into a confused mixture of all three responses. But the most basic choice is whether to keep suffering or alleviate it. For the sake of bringing suffering to an end after Newtown, we should pause over the choices that everyone can make as an aid to healing: . Hold each other in loving awareness. Speak gently. Resist viewing negative images over and over. Walk away when the conversation contains negativity. Keep your life as structured as possible -- This is especially true when dealing with children in the aftermath of tragedy. Try not to be alone -- Eat meals as a family, allow friends to offer consolation even when being around others is painful. Forgive yourself when you feel like a victim, but take steps to grow out of victim thinking. Allow for someone else's point of view. It is difficult to express inner pain, and we all do it imperfectly. What may seem like anger and frustration from others is often the best they can do. Because it reaches so deep, your sense of suffering may be subtle, like a gray fog rather than a sharp physical wound. To truly judge how healing is progressing, it is important to do more than regain everyday normality. Become involved in your own healing, let time be your ally, and go as deeply as you can into the reservoir of peace that lies inside you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deepak Chopra.","Deepak Chopra: We delay healing when we obsess over details of a tragedy .
Chopra: Trauma disrupts the balance of the brain and it needs time to come back .
After shock, powerful emotions rise that the brain has difficulty dealing with, he says .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man accused of killing three women and wrapping their bodies in trash bags in East Cleveland pleaded not guilty in the case Wednesday, the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court said. Michael Madison, 35, pleaded not guilty to 14 counts in the deaths of Angela Deskins, 38, Shetisha Sheeley, 28, and Shirellda Terry. The first pretrial hearing is set for August 6. Madison is being held with bail set at $6 million. The three bodies were found near Madison's East Cleveland apartment -- at different sites within a few blocks from one another -- on July 19 and 20, police said. More questions than answers in Cleveland's run on high-profile crime . The indictment charges Madison with two counts of murder for each woman: one alleging murder and the other alleging murder while kidnapping. He's also charged with three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a body, one count of rape, and one count of having a firearm despite being a convicted felon. Madison is a registered sex offender, having been convicted of attempted rape in 2002. New charges accuse suspect of rape . A grand jury indicted him on the 14 counts Tuesday. When his bail was set on July 22, Madison had been charged only with three counts of aggravated murder and three counts of kidnapping. The bodies were discovered after someone noticed a foul odor coming from a garage he leased, police said. One body was found in the garage; another was found in the basement of an empty home; and another was discovered in a field, police said. The decomposed bodies were wrapped similarly in plastic garbage bags and taped up, authorities said. Madison was arrested after a standoff at his mother's Cleveland house.

"(CNN) -- Long before Europeans began settling in Australia, people from India arrived on the continent and interbred with the aboriginal population there, a new study says. The Indians may also have introduced dingoes to the vast Australian landmass, it suggests. Last words: Phone app bids to save dying aboriginal language . The genetic scientists behind the study are challenging the conventional view that the humans who first arrived in Australia at least 40,000 year ago remained essentially cut off from outsiders until European mariners showed up in the 17th century. In an article published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, the team of researchers says an analysis of the genetic history of Australian Aborigines and other peoples indicates the contact with Indians took place roughly 4,000 years ago. That period coincides with the arrival of the dingo in Australia, according to archaeological records, suggesting the Indian migrants may have brought the wild dog with them, the genetic study says. Read more: Aborigine protesters burn Australian flag . The Indians could also have prompted changes around that time in the Australian inhabitants' tool technology and food processing, according to the scientists, who work at German and Dutch research institutes. They based their findings on large study of genetic data from aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, island Southeast Asians and Indians. Their analysis supported the theory that indigenous groups in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines are descendants of a wave of migration out of Africa tens of thousands of years ago. But it also showed what the scientists called ""substantial gene flow"" between the Indian and Australian populations ""well before European contact."" They estimated that the Indian-Australian interaction took place 4,230 during the Holocene, the current geological period.","People from India arrived in Australia about 4,000 years ago, a genetic study says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Natina Reed, one-third of the early 2000s R&B trio Blaque, was struck by a vehicle and killed Friday night in Georgia, Gwinnett County police said Saturday. Reed, 32, was walking in traffic on a major roadway just north of the metro Atlanta city of Lilburn ""for some unknown reason"" when she was struck around 10:30 p.m., according to Gwinnett police spokesman Sgt. Rich Long. The driver of the vehicle, who was not charged in the incident, called 911 while the passenger administered CPR. Reed was pronounced dead at Gwinnett Medical Center. Blaque, best known for the 2000 hit ""Bring it All to Me,"" was discovered by TLC's Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes. The group's self-titled album debuted in 1999. Lopes herself died in a 2002 car accident in Honduras. Fellow Blaque members Shamari Devoe and Brandi Williams took to Twitter on Saturday to remember Reed. ""My world as I know it has forever changed. Until we meet again, may you find comfort in the arms of an angel. I love you Natina,"" Devoe tweeted.

"(AOL Autos) -- Which star do you most associate with car-chase movies: Steve McQueen or Michael Caine? Gene Hackman or Burt Reynolds? Honor Blackman, star of the James Bond film ""Goldfinger,"" poses on an Aston Martin DB5 car in 2002. Although most car-chase movies pack some serious A-list talent, we like to think that in many cases the real star in this particular movie genre is the car: from McQueen's super-tight Ford Mustang in ""Bullitt"" to the stripped-down Dodge Charger in Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof."" But which movie has the best car-chase scene in history? We take a look. 10. ""Cannonball Run"" (1981) Almost everyone knows that Hollywood's cheesy celebration of America's intercoastal car culture is one big car chase involving spectacular cars, including a Ferrari 308 GTS, an Aston Martin DB5 and a gorgeous opening sequence where a Lamborghini Countach makes short work of a Pontiac Firebird police cruiser. But perhaps less well known is the original coast-to-coast sprint run undertaken by speed racer Erwin George Baker in 1914. The 11-day drive made his name in the New York press, who forever associated him with the Chicago Express steam train christened ""The Cannon Ball."" Trivia: The ambulance driven in the movie by Burt Reynolds and sidekick Dom DeLuise was a modified Dodge Tradesman used by Car and Driver editor Brock Yates when he tried to resurrect the famous race in the 1970s, as part of a protest against the onset of 55 mph speeding limits nationwide. 9. ""Death Proof"" (2007) Quentin Tarantino continues to push the limits of speed and taste in ""Death Proof."" The film is a stock car- and violence-infused tale that features for a quarter of its run-time a fantastic chase sequence involving a stripped down bad-ass 1969 Dodge Charger and a heavily modified 1970 Dodge Challenger with a girl -- actress and former stuntwoman Zoe Bell -- splayed on its hood. Apparently, Tarantino came upon the idea for a ""death proof"" car after filming the car-crash scene in Pulp Fiction and telling a friend he wanted to buy a Volvo for safety reasons. AOL Autos: 2009 Dodge Charger . The friend informed him that a decent movie stunt team could easily ""death proof"" any car for him. Hence was born the ""Death Proof"" movie concept. And Stuntman Mike. Doesn't that name still give you chills? 8. ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) Car chases ostensibly over a half mile, otherwise known as street racing, received attention when ""The Fast and Furious"" lifted the lid on a high-adrenaline Tokyo Drift racing scene that burgeoned in popularity in Japan and the U.S. in the late 1990s. The movie explored the phenomenon through a fictional world of ultra-hip hijackers who used heavily modified Japanese cars to steal high-end electronic components. It's a cops and criminals yarn with a high-octane twist that features some seriously customized old-school cars including a Honda Civic, Toyota Supra and a Mazda RX7 -- though if you look closely, a retro Dodge Charger also features, too. AOL Autos: Honda Civic . Tokyo Drift racing, where drivers work in teams while skidding all four wheels around a tight circuit, now features at many events on the IRL circuit, catching a tailwind from the movie's popularity. Look out for the new ""Fast and Furious"" film soon. 7. ""Mad Max II: The Road Warrior"" (1981) You'd be hard pressed to name any of Mel Gibson's cobbled-together vehicles in his 1981 sequel to ""Mad Max"" -- which may boast the highest number of chopped and recharged V8s outside of Havana, Cuba -- but that doesn't stop ""The Road Warrior"" being considered a car-chase classic and one of the best action movies out there. Motley collections of cut-throat bandits, nomads and braggarts populate Australia's barren, dystopian landscape and blow-up any number of heavy machines, including police cars, motorbikes and a big-rig fuel tanker. It's all in their quest for that all-important and -- in a post-apocalyptic world -- rare substance: fuel. The explosive 20-minute chase scene to end the movie still exhilarates nearly 30 years after the movie's release. And don't we all want an engine intake like Max's infamous ""blower?"" 6. ""Vanishing Point"" (1971) A Dodge Challenger R/T gives you some serious leverage when you're involved in a bump-and-run two-car contest on a one-track road in the middle of the American west -- and it's the only road out of the desert heat. AOL Autos: Dodge Challenger . Stanley Kowalski, a renegade Barry Newman, used five separate first-generation Challengers, including the 375-horsepower 440 Magnum, to full effect in forcing numerous hapless drivers off the road on the hazard-ridden 15-hour sprint from Denver, Colorado, to San Francisco, California, as he's pursued by cops, racers and bandits alike. Dodge released its highly anticipated and heavily retrofitted Challenger update in 2008, with the film's cult following no doubt waiting patiently for any word on a commemorative ""Vanishing Point"" model. 5. ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (1974) We're not talking about the remake starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, which boasts some pretty spectacular car-chase sequences itself, but the 1974 original that features a 34-minute chase sequence over the Long Beach, California, ports complex that some consider the best ever captured on celluloid. A mediocre cast and stilted dialog may put off many, but the film that centers around a group of car thieves and their bid to steal 48 cars over a couple of days accomplishes what it set out to do: Exhilarate viewers in movie theaters and destroy as many cars as possible (in this case, 93). An amazing collection of Ford Mustangs, Rolls-Royces and Cadillac limos make up the list that car thief H.B. ""Toby"" Halicki -- who did all his own stunts -- is given to steal for a South American drug lord. Few, though, compare to the film's famous 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1, christened ""Eleanor"" and driven by Halicki. 4. ""The French Connection"" (1971) Gene Hackman bumping and weaving his way around the intersection of Stillwell Avenue and 86th St of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, while pursuing a bandit on a subway train offers to this day a fantastic driver's eye perspective of driving through New York at rush hour. We're just kidding. But the chase featuring a 1971 Pontiac LeMans remains a classic as a result of its impromptu crashes that weren't supposed to be part of the action but were left in the sequence after several stunt drivers mistimed their entrance into the car chase, striking Hackman's car instead of narrowly avoiding it as he chases a train-bound drug dealer. The sequence took several days to shoot even though the chase's screen time is barely two-and-a-half minutes. Director William Friedkin also put together a similarly fantastic car chase in 1985's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" 3. ""The Italian Job"" (1969) Michael Caine's famous ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off,"" has become a familiar refrain among ""Italian Job"" fans who love the British actor's Cockney twang and the 1969 comic car caper that saw a collection of car thieves attempting a high-stakes bank heist in the Italian city of Turin. Indescribably hip on its release, and a personification of Cool Britannia, the famous car chase featuring three red-white-and-blue Minis motoring through tight streets -- and even indoors -- was a landmark in quirky and fun car-chase sequencing and cinematography. The 2003 remake cleverly twinned audience appeal with the film following the 2001 release of BMW's new MINI Cooper that featured in the updated film, leading some to suggest it was merely a two-hour commercial for the new model. AOL Autos: MINI Cooper . Trivia: Turin, or Torino, forms part of Italian car giant Fiat's moniker-- Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino. 2. ""Ronin"" (1998) Although it will never be regarded as Robert de Niro's best dramatic performance, 1998's ""Ronin"" doesn't land on our list for its dialogue. In unbelievable realism, viewers are treated to chase scenes with sport sedans such as a BMW M5, Peugeot 406 and, perhaps most famously, an Audi S8. Plenty of police cars, trucks and motorcycles meet their end and more than 300 stunt drivers were employed to give the real-time chases scene an air of metal-crunching realism amid a character-driven plot that involves CIA operatives, mercenaries and multiple double-crosses surrounding a mysteriously valuable briefcase. There are few actors that can capture the mixture of terror and exhilaration involved in a car chase quite like De Niro, while Jean Reno is the only actor who could make driving a Peugeot an exercise in steely manhood. Director John Frankenheimer pretty nearly perfected the art of filming gritty car chase sequences in 1966's ""Grand Prix."" 1. ""Bullitt"" (1968) ""Bullitt"" is perennially voted one of the best car movies of all time and we're comfortable following suit. In the 1968 classic, real-life racing enthusiast Steve McQueen barrels after bad guys on the streets of San Francisco in an epically cool 1968 Ford Mustang in a delicious ""Highland Green"" color. AOL Autos: Ford Mustang . In a cityscape that gets most drivers nervous for its ups and downs, San Francisco proves the ultimate car chase backdrop. Lieutenant Frank Bullitt is not only one of the coolest cops of all time, he proves to be one of the best wheelmen we've ever seen. This is a must-see film and hands-down the best car chase movie of all time.","In most car-chase movies, the real star is the car, author says .

"(CNN) -- I finished this column at 7 a.m. Friday morning, interrupting my vacation to write it. About six hours later, President Obama made an impromptu appearance in the White House briefing room, sharing in detail his thoughts and feelings about the verdict in the case of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin. In a deeply stirring moment, the president said, ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" President Obama went on to talk about the historical context of the black experience, including the prejudice that he himself experienced as a young African-American man. He talked about the black community's need to acknowledge some of their internal problems and to search for solutions, not excuses. He talked about ways we could move forward on race relations. Thinking out loud, he didn't preach, he didn't propose massive new government programs. He suggested approaches, ways of rethinking, appealed to the ""better angels of our nature,"" and expressed confidence that the younger generation is ""better than we were on these issues."" Perhaps it indicates shared experiences and expectations, but I found many of my thoughts anticipated his thoughts. And now, I have to examine what I wrote, make sure, as much as I can, that my words also move us toward ""a more perfect union."" I go back to a formative event in my life -- the historic 1963 March on Washington where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his stirring ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Many of the original marchers are no longer with us. After 50 years, his words of hope, resolve and encouragement still echo with us. ""I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" Dr. King spoke not just of the future that should be, but the present that is. The Constitution and Declaration of Independence were, he said, promissory notes that had come due. Dr. King acknowledged passions, the anger and frustration fueled by a hot summer and enflamed by indifference and misapprehension. Reiterating President Obama's prayer, I would remind those rallying in support of Trayvon Martin of Dr. King's words: ""Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred...Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force."" After the Zimmerman verdict, President Obama issued a statement, saying, in part: ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this."" His remarks today put us in the right direction. Our first bi-racial president responded to calls that he ""break his silence"" and lead a ""national dialogue on race."" He said, no, because ""when politicians try to organize conversations ... they end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have."" Rather, he said, we should talk in what I would call our ""small places,"" within our families, places of worship, workplaces and community gatherings. Because in those places ""there's a possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can."" I grew up in the once segregated South. I experienced forced integration during my formative school years. I lived the sacrifices, burdens and tears. I also lived the moments of understanding, of acknowledgment, of fellowship and success. I saw my parents and grandparents coming home beaten down -- and some of my friends beaten up. But I was also forbidden by them to hate anyone, and learned from them to love, respect and be tolerant of others. Obama's groundbreaking speech about race -- his ""More Perfect Union"" speech in 2008 -- spoke about the balance and the struggle and the promise of mutuality inherent in the Constitution. He referenced it today. He sees himself, as president, a spokesman for all Americans. Both of his presidential campaigns were based on American diversity, its value and its power. Power to the people. So, where do we start? Person to person, neighborhood by neighborhood. We can start with the kind of self-examination the president suggests -- by looking at our knee-jerks, our stereotypes, our blame-game projections. We can start by acknowledging the progress we've made in the long march for equality under the law. We can start by listening better. We can start by admitting we're not always right and that ""I don't see it that way"" aren't fighting words. We can start by making opportunities for our youth a high priority, and by showing them -- by example -- how to work out differences, without ridiculing those who are different. We can start by taking action -- action is the main thing. We can start by increasing, by a little, our acts of goodness and kindness, especially toward those with whom we disagree. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","President Obama commented on the case of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman .

"SANA'A, Yemen (CNN) -- It is midday and girls are flooding out of school, but Nujood Ali is not among them. Nujood Ali today is angry and skips school but is still relieved her defiance paid off. We find her at the family's two-room house in an impoverished suburb of the city where Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose. After much arguing with family members, Nujood finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN had got permission in advance to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was shaping up. Nujood is very different from the girl we first met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was every inch a child. She was the very portrait of innocence: A shy smile, a playful nature and a whimsical giggle. That picture was very much at odds with the brutal story of abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is now still fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories » . Nujood says she remains relieved and gratified that her act of defiance -- which led to appearances at awards shows and on TV -- had paid off. The story was supposed to end with the divorce and an innocent but determined girl allowed to fully embrace the childhood she fought so hard to keep. Instead, there has been no fairytale ending for Nujood. There was, though, a stunning transformation. Nujood went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world, but at home all was not well. In the fall of 2008 Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman. There is a tell-all book which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says Nujood will receive a good portion of the royalties. Nujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform? ""There is no change at all since going on television. I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone to help us. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media,"" Nujood says bitterly. There was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case. ""I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' "" says Nasser. She believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe Nujood's fame should bring them fortune. Nujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime Nujood stews wondering out loud how everything turned out this way. ""I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,"" she said adding that she feels like an outcast even among her family and friends. Nujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, Nujood was spared nothing. ""I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me"" said Nujood. She said being married and living as a wife at such a young age was sheer torture. Nujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate. CNN tried to obtain comment from Nujood's husband and his family but they declined. Nujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife. It means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect Nujood's new husband to demand sex from his child bride. To escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- for the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge. After several hours, a judge finally went to see her. ""And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'"" says Nujood. Nujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and Nujood was put in the care of Nasser. Indeed, it seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with Nujood that she should get her divorce. But based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted.

Khadije Al Salame is working to help Nujood get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, 30 years ago she too was a child bride. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood. She said: ""It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her. ""She doesn't understand what's going on. She's a little girl and we have to understand as a media people that we should leave her alone now. If we really love Nujood then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life, because education is the most important thing for her."" To get her divorce, Nujood showed a character and strength not easily expressed by women in Yemen, let alone a 10-year-old child bride. But she will need to muster all that strength and more if she's to finally reclaim her life. Nujood told us she thought the divorce would be the end of her struggle and she's still angry that it turned out to be just the beginning.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former CIA base chief wanted by Italy and detained in Panama has been released, a State Department spokeswoman said Friday. Robert Seldon Lady, who had been convicted by an Italian court for his role in a 2003 rendition case, was flying back to the United States. ""It's my understanding that he is in fact either en route or back in the United States. Beyond that I have no further details,"" State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. In a 2009 trial, an Italian court convicted Lady and 22 others of abducting Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar, from the streets of Milan in 2003. Italian prosecutors said Abu Omar was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian officials. The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. Abu Omar, who was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency, was transferred to Egypt and tortured, Italian prosecutors said. A former senior CIA official said Lady is no longer with the CIA. In the 2009 trial, the Italian court sentenced Lady to eight years in prison, prosecutor Armando Spataro said. The other Americans were sentenced to five years. Each of the 23 Americans was ordered to pay 1 million euros (about $1.3 million) to Abu Omar, plus 500,000 euros to his wife. But at the time, it seemed unlikely that the convictions would have much effect on the Americans, as none appeared at the trial and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition. Washington has acknowledged making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do.","An ex-CIA base chief was arrested in Panama on an Italian arrest warrant .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division investigator has recommended changing the official manner of death for a soldier electrocuted while showering at his base in Iraq from ""accidental"" to ""negligent homicide,"" according to an e-mail from the investigator obtained by CNN. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in a shower at his base in Iraq on January 2, 2008. The investigator blames KBR, the largest U.S. contractor in Iraq, and two KBR supervisors for the incident, saying there is ""credible information ... they failed to ensure that work was being done by qualified electricians and plumbers, and to inspect the work that was being conducted."" The e-mail, written late last year, says the investigation report was being reviewed by CID headquarters for a legal opinion to determine probable cause before the case could be referred to the military court system or the Department of Justice for possible action. No charges have been filed. Sgt. Ryan Maseth's manner of death has not officially been changed, CID spokesman Christopher Grey told CNN. ""It may change, but not at this time,"" he said, adding that the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology would make that determination. KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne told CNN the company ""cannot comment on the report by an unidentified Army investigator because we have not seen the report."" ""KBR's investigation has produced no evidence that KBR was responsible for Sgt. Maseth's death,"" Browne said. ""We have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future."" CNN first reported the death of Maseth, a highly decorated, 24-year-old Green Beret, last spring. His January 2, 2008, death was just one of many fatalities now believed to be linked to shoddy electrical work at U.S. bases managed by U.S. contractors, according to Pentagon sources. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency last year gave KBR a ""Level III Corrective Action Request"" -- issued only when a contractor is found in ""serious non-compliance"" and just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract, Pentagon officials said. In KBR's case, it means the contractor's inspections and efforts to ensure electrical safety for troops have been unacceptable and must be significantly improved, Pentagon sources told CNN. The CID investigator's e-mail says work orders to address problems resulted in ""fixes [that] were only temporary and not done to ensure no future problems would arise."" The Pentagon and its contract agency have declined requests for an interview to answer questions about Maseth's death or the other cases. Just after Maseth's electrocution, Pentagon officials estimated that about a dozen troops had been electrocuted in Iraq. But Pentagon officials now say at least 18 troops have been electrocuted since 2003 -- many due to faulty wiring and improper grounding. The number could be higher if deaths from Afghanistan are included, said congressional sources. KBR's contract in Iraq is vast and encompasses numerous responsibilities including the upkeep of U.S. bases and providing basic services on the bases. The 18 electrocutions occurred in different places and under different circumstances. At least two lawsuits have been filed against KBR, including one by Maseth's family, and investigators are trying to determine precisely what role, if any, KBR played in the circumstances that led to those deaths.","Manner of death should be changed from ""accidental,"" Army investigator writes .

"(CNN) -- Rick Garlick couldn't get his hotel Internet to work for more than an hour on Monday night. And Garlick is well aware that he's not alone in experiencing frustration with hotel Internet service. The quality of Internet service remains the top problem experienced by hotel guests, and it has the biggest impact on customer satisfaction, according to the J.D. Power 2013 North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index Study released Wednesday. Garlick is J.D. Power's global travel and hospitality practice lead, and he needed the Internet to work on the study. ""The Internet is the modern day hotelier's biggest challenge without question,"" said Garlick. ""Lots of hotels don't offer good Internet connectivity."" Of the 20% of guests who had a problem with their hotel stay, nearly one-third reported a problem with the Internet. If a guest experienced problems connecting to the Internet -- regardless of whether they were charged separately or it was included in the price of their rooms -- that guest's hotel satisfaction dropped an average of 133 points. Despite complaints about the Internet or other issues, hotel guests are happier than they've been in years. Some 80% of guests don't complain at all, the study shows, and hotel guest satisfaction increased to the highest levels in seven years, an average of 777 on a 1,000-point scale. That's up 20 points from 2012. And the top rated airline is ... The study ranks eight hotel categories by seven factors. The Ritz-Carlton came in first place among luxury brands, while Kimpton Hotels ranked highest in the ""upper upscale"" category. Hyatt Place ranked tops in the ""upscale"" category. Holiday Inn (midscale full service), Drury Hotels (midscale), Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham (economy/budget), Homewood Suites (upper extended stay) and TownePlace Suites (extended stay) each came in first place in their categories. Airports where the architecture soars . Focus on the personal touch . A hotel's personal touch also counts, said Garlick. Guests who interact with four or more different types of staff (excluding check-in) report the highest overall satisfaction (856 on a 1,000 point scale). Satisfaction drops to 724 points -- 53 points below the industry average -- when guests didn't interact with anyone besides check-in staff. ""With self-service check in and mobile check-in, there's a presumption that if you can avoid people and the interaction, you're creating a better experience,"" said Garlick. ""Overall, we see that's not the case. The more interactions you have on property, the better you feel about the experience."" Check in: World's best airport hotels . What can guests do? Think about what you want and need in a hotel and do online research to figure out which hotels will satisfy those wants and needs. It turns out the most satisfied guests, just 7% in this study, turn out to be those who research their trips using online hotel review sites and use information to seek out hotels they like. Those folks -- categorized in the study as scrutinizers -- report guest satisfaction at 114 points above the industry average, according to the study. For guests who chose a hotel primarily because of price, satisfaction is significantly lower -- 59 points below average satisfaction. Now in its 17th year, the J.D. Power study measures overall guest satisfaction using these seven factors: reservation; check-in/check-out; guest room; food and beverage (not in the upper extended stay); hotel services; hotel facilities; and cost and fees.

"(CNN) -- The stories have been around for decades -- sometimes disquieting ones about the strict upbringing of Joe and Katherine Jackson's nine children in a high-pressure, showbiz family. Joe Jackson addressed those stories and his family's past in an interview with ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that aired Wednesday night, saying that yes, he did physically discipline his children. Why did he do it? ""I had to be like that way because during those times, it was hard, and you have a lot of gangs there, you know, in the area where we were living,"" Jackson told Piers Morgan. ""This was Gary, Indiana, and I had to make sure that they didn't get in any type of trouble, and things of that sort."" Does he have any regrets about his approach to parenting? ""I'm glad I was tough, because look what I came out with. I came out with some kids that everybody loved all over the world. And they treated everybody right. Family, fans mark Michael Jackson's death three years later . ""You know, Michael, he was a nice guy. ... The world (doesn't) know anything too much about Michael as far as how he was brought up. But he was brought up. I made sure that he respected the older people."" Morgan said that Janet Jackson -- probably the second-most-famous sibling of the six brothers and three sisters -- in particular has lamented about not being allowed to call Joe Jackson ""Dad"" and noted almost all of the children have said their father was a strict disciplinarian. ""You had all those kids running hollering around,"" Jackson said. ""They're hollering, 'Dad, Dad, Dad,' you know, and it gets to be -- it sounds kind of funny to me. But I didn't care too much about what they called me, just as long as they (were) able to listen to me and what I had to tell them, you know, in order to make their lives successful.

""Michael was the type of kid, you know, he was a good kid... and by him being that way, he was able to be Michael Jackson. ""He looked good on stage and when he performed, everybody loved the way he did it, because he was that good,"" Jackson said. Jackson recalled where he was when he found out his son had died on June 25, 2009: . ""I was in Las Vegas. I got a call ... from a fan. And he says, 'Mr. Jackson,' he says, 'Something is wrong.' He said, 'I see an ambulance there at Michael's place and the ambulance took off. And the fire department is following the ambulance. Something is wrong.'

Jackson also said there were people in Michael's life who drove a wedge between the King of Pop and his family toward the end. ""They treated him like Howard Hughes, you know?"" Jackson said. ""They couldn't -- the family couldn't get to him, you know, like they should have."" Jackson also addressed Michael's 2005 child sex abuse trial.

"(CNN) -- Last month, when Edward Snowden began leaking highly classified documents to the press, many Americans were shocked by what they read. I don't blame them. For years, the architecture of the programs designed to keep us safe have been a secret to all but a few members of the intelligence community and select legislators. The companies that were involved in these programs were under strict gag orders. And while members of Congress had the opportunity to be briefed on these programs, it would have been a crime, literally, for us to have talked about them publicly. As a result, when Snowden's leaks became public, Americans had no way of knowing the scope of these programs, their privacy protections and the legal authorities they were operating under. It was just Snowden and his documents on the one side and the government on the other, saying ""trust us."" The government must give proper weight to both keeping America safe from terrorists and protecting Americans' privacy. But when Americans lack the most basic information about our domestic surveillance programs, they have no way of knowing whether we're getting that balance right. This lack of transparency is a big problem. Ex-CIA chief: What Snowden did . Since I came to the Senate, I've been working to fix this. I've supported amendments to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that would have required greater public reporting on the use of surveillance authorities and greater disclosures about the legal opinions and safeguards that support them. When those amendments failed, I voted against renewing both of these laws. I want to be clear: I didn't vote ""no"" because I wanted to end these programs or because I thought they were unnecessary. Based on briefings, I believe these programs protect our country and have saved lives and have reasonable safeguards in place to protect Americans' privacy. I voted the way I did because I wanted to send a loud signal to my colleagues that transparency was critical and that there was too little of it in place. National security laws must protect national security. But they must also protect the public trust and preserve the ability of an informed electorate to hold its government to account. I'm working on legislation that will require the federal government to annually report how it uses key authorities under the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, including the authorities underlying the phone metadata and the PRISM electronic surveillance programs that recently came to light. For each of these authorities, the government must disclose how many Americans' information is being collected and how many Americans' information is being queried and actually seen by federal officers or agents. My legislation would also allow companies to publicly report on how many Patriot and FISA orders they're getting and how many of their customers these orders affect. There's a way to do this that protects national security. Since 2009, Google has been reporting on the number of national security letters it receives, and that hasn't hurt anyone. I frankly think that after Snowden's disclosures, an even stronger case can be made that we can achieve greater transparency without harming national security. Opinion: Supreme Court must protect our privacy from the government . As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law, a big part of my job is making sure that our privacy laws are keeping up with our technology. In 1787, there was no such thing as a phone, let alone a wiretap. And so, almost 50 years ago in a case called Katz v. U.S., the Supreme Court had to determine whether a wiretap constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. The court said that it did. Justices explained that people had come to expect and assume that their calls were private. In subsequent cases, the court formally adopted the rule that the Fourth Amendment will protect people where they have an expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable. In 2013, we're long overdue for another public conversation about what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy. It's hard to have that debate around secret programs authorized by secret legal opinions issued by a secret court. Actually, it's impossible to have that debate. Thankfully, public pressure for transparency is building. Last week, a broad coalition of 63 companies and civil society groups -- from Apple to the ACLU -- sent a letter to the president and congressional leaders calling for the reforms put forward in my bill. I think we can pass it. Ultimately, I suspect that with this information out there, many Americans will come to believe that these programs have reasonable safeguards for our civil liberties. Others will still call for their end or dramatic restructuring. I want to let Americans decide for themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Al Franken.","Al Franken: Americans don't know scope of surveillance and which authority OKs it .
Franken: We need a balance between protecting U.S. from terror and protecting privacy .
We can't know if civil liberties are safe if all about surveillance is secret, he says .
Franken: We need to know who, when and how, to judge if surveillance crosses a line ."
"Delhi (CNN) -- Appearing alongside some of Bollywood's biggest stars like Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan is a dream for many aspiring young actors in India. For the beautiful U.S.-born, UK-raised Indian actress Jiah Khan, it became a reality when she was still a teenager. Driven by ambition and discipline, Khan rose through the ranks of a notoriously cut-throat industry for 10 years, acting in blockbuster films like ""Ghajini"" and ""Housefull."" However, what seemed to be a glittering career ended in tragedy last week when Khan's mother found her body hanging in her Mumbai home. Police told journalists they are treating the 25-year-old's death as suicide. The film industry is in shock. ""She had the naturalness that does not come easy for a first timer... I am distraught that she ended her life,"" blogged Amitabh Bachchan, who starred in her debut film. ""Never ever seen a debutante actress with more spunk and more spirit than Jiah when I was directing her,"" tweeted veteran filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma. While scandal and intrigue is common in Bollywood, suicide is rare. Some in the industry are now beginning to ask what could have driven someone with so much potential to such despair. On Monday, Khan's mother gave the police what appears to be Khan's suicide note, police said at a news conference. Addressing an unnamed person -- possibly her boyfriend -- Khan wrote: ""If you are reading this I might have already left or about to leave. I am broken inside. You may not have known this but you affected me deeply to a point where I lost myself in loving you. Yet you torture me everyday."" Suraj Pancholi, the 21-year-old son of Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi, was Khan's boyfriend. He has since been arrested by Indian police on suspicion of abetting her suicide. The note added: ""Things were looking up for me here, but is it worth it when you constantly feel the pain of heartbreak, when the person you love wants to abuse you or threatens to hit you or cheats on you...throws you out of their house when you have nowhere to go?"" Khan also claims in the note she was forced to have an abortion. ""I was scared of getting pregnant but I gave myself completely. The pain you have caused me everyday had destroyed every bit of me, destroyed my soul... I aborted our baby when it hurt me deeply."" Pancholi attended Khan's funeral along with many other Bollywood stars. It is unclear if he will be prosecuted. In past rulings the Indian Supreme Court has said that to convict a person for abetting suicide, it has to be shown that they instigated it. Pancholi has not responded publicly but his mother spoke to local media denying the charges. Meanwhile, Khan's mother says she is determined to fight for justice. Speaking to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN, she said: ""He hit my daughter, he tortured her. I saw bruises on her body. I saw the pain and humiliation she must have gone through. The evidence is with the police. She did not have any emptiness in her life. I am angry, I am in pain."" Khan appeared in three films, two of them blockbusters, but she hadn't been in a movie since 2010.","Indian police are treating actress' death as suicide .

""Yes, Elizabeth did get married today and we are all thrilled,"" said Smart's father, Ed, on Saturday. Smart and Matthew Gilmour exchanged vows Saturday on Oahu's North Shore before family and friends, CNN affiliate KSL said, citing a family spokesman. They plan to honeymoon at an undisclosed location, according to Chris Thomas, the spokesman. ""Elizabeth's desire was for what most women want â€” to celebrate her nuptials in a private wedding with family and close friends,"" Thomas told the affiliate. The pair got engaged last month and planned to get married in the summer, but moved up the wedding because of the media attention, the spokesman said. Gilmour, a native of Scotland, met his bride while she was doing missionary work in France. Smart attends Brigham Young University and also works for ABC News. Smart made headlines in 2002 when she was kidnapped from her Salt Lake home at age 14 and held captive for nine months. Her kidnapping stunned the nation, and the media covered the monthslong search to find her. Her abductor, Brian David Mitchell, sexually abused her during her time in captivity, and is serving life in prison for the kidnapping and assault. Authorities rescued Smart when she, her captor and his wife were spotted wandering in Sandy, Utah, in March 2003.

"(CNN) -- Jim Foglesong, a famed Nashville music executive and producer who played a key role in launching the careers of such notables as Garth Brooks, George Strait and Suzy Bogguss, has died. He was 90. His death on Tuesday morning was confirmed by a statement from Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music, where Foglesong taught for more than 20 years. ""Jim was a grand gentleman with a marvelously generous spirit,"" said Mark Wait, dean of the school. ""He had a great ear for music of every kind, and he gave freely of his expertise to countless students and young professionals."" Foglesong's career spanned more than a half-century and included stints as a performer, producer, record company president and industry eminence. ""Jim was one of the first people I met when I came to Nashville,"" recalled George Strait in a statement to CNN. ""I would wish that for every newcomer. His kind and gentle demeanor is rare today. He signed me to my first record deal, and his support and friendship was something I treasured. We will all miss you, old friend."" The onetime vocalist -- who ""worked in a bank and sang in a Baptist church and a Jewish temple to pay for rent, food, and voice lessons,"" according to his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website -- eventually worked under Arturo Toscanini, produced recordings by Julie Andrews, oversaw a variety of labels and helped make hits of songs by Barbara Mandrell, Freddy Fender, the Oak Ridge Boys, Merle Haggard and Reba McEntire. He was one of the people who helped launch Epic Records in the 1950s, then and now one of Columbia's primary labels. After stints at Epic, RCA, Dot and MCA, Foglesong joined Capitol Records' Nashville division. It was there he helped guide Brooks, who released his first album in 1989 and became country music's best-selling artist of all time. ""Today, the music industry lost its greatest diplomat for kindness, tolerance, faith, and sincerity,"" said Brooks in an e-mailed statement. ""But do not weep for Jim, I have never met a man with a stronger faith, anyone who knew Jim knows where he is now. Instead, weep for those of us who are left here without him ... truly, a great, great man."" After leaving Capitol, Foglesong became an educator. A statement from the Blair School notes that his ""Business of Music"" course, a weekly three-hour seminar, was one of the school's most popular offerings. He also oversaw the music business program at Nashville's Trevecca Nazarene University. Foglesong chaired the boards of directors of the Country Music Association and the Country Music Foundation, and was active in a variety of other local organizations.

"Menlo Park, California (CNN) -- On Monday, Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, posted on Netflix's blog that the popular online movie rental service would not be breaking off its DVD-by-mail business from its online streaming business. This was Netflix's third major announcement relating to changes in pricing and service offering in four months. Like BlackBerry and Bank of America, both of which have recently borne the wrath of disappointed customers, Netflix has been subject to tremendous criticism over the past few months. (Full disclosure: I consulted for Netflix for about two years between 2003 and 2005.) While Netflix is taking a beating, with rapidly declining market valuation, angry customers and negative media coverage, Hastings' announcement actually signals the company's willingness to keep tinkering until it gets the service right. He is that rare public company CEO who is willing to take a risk, make mistakes in public and keep trying new things. For that, he deserves some credit. Netflix raised its prices in response to the expected increase in content pricing from major studios, which the company believed made Netflix's flagship offering, one-DVD-out-at-a-time-plus-unlimited-streamed-content for $9.99, impossible for them to continue. As a result, in July, it announced plans to split the DVD business and the streaming business, charging $7.99 for each. Netflix's goal was to convert current clients from ""DVDs and streaming"" to ""DVDs or streaming"" and charging a premium for customers wanting to stay with both. The announcement was seen as an attempt to raise the price by 60% without offering additional value, and customer response was fast and negative. Since then, Netflix has been attacked from all sides for poor communication, poor product strategy and poor pricing decisions. Indeed, its communication has been poor: first with the July announcement, because it was misleading, and then with the September and October announcements, because they focused on responding to the wrong problem, thinking customers were angry because they didn't know which of the two new options to choose. In fact, customers were angry because they were being forced to choose or to pay more. Hastings knows that he needs to transition his subscribers from old media (DVDs) to new (streaming) and has been methodically preparing for this transition for several years. The problem came in the timing and the messaging of the transition, not in the transition itself. Too many businesses have failed because they failed to focus on the benefits they provided their customers instead of the technology they used. Companies committed to trains word processors, and typewriters were forced to consolidate or go bankrupt as their technologies became obsolete and they failed to adapt. In their place, consumers spend their money on cars, PCs and tablets. Netflix tried to make that transition, and the process has been painful but may yet be successful. In subscription-based businesses, it is nearly impossible to raise the price for a service without dramatically improving the offering. Since the initial July announcement, Netflix has inked favorable streaming deals with several major studios, including Dreamworks, Epix (Lionsgate, MGM and Paramount), Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel -- a fact Hastings referred to in his most recent blog post. Had Netflix been able to time the price increase with the announcement of significant new streaming content, consumers might have accepted the change. Netflix took a big risk with its new business model and pricing structure. Hastings had a vision of where he wanted his company to go and made some mistakes trying to achieve that vision. Some of those mistakes look like they may have been avoidable, especially in hindsight. Despite my personal annoyance at the price hike and the inconsistent messages, I continue to respect Netflix and its brave CEO for their (multiple) public apologies, their speed in developing a new service (Qwikster) and their speed in canceling Qwikster when they saw the negative response. Hastings ""failed fast"" and then adjusted and adjusted again, which can be painful. His willingness to move forward, even in the face of public criticism, is all too rare among public company CEOs. Netflix is still a ""buy"" in my book. It knows how to deliver video content through multiple channels. It seems to be making headway in its studio deals, and it is willing to act fast, admit mistakes and keep moving forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robbie Kellman Baxter.","Since July, Netflix has been taking a beating, says Robbie Kellman Baxter .

"ST. POELTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- A jury in Austria has found Josef Fritzl guilty of raping and imprisoning his daughter for more than two decades and sentenced him to life in prison. Josef Fritzl arrives for sentencing at the courthouse in St. Poelten on Thursday. It was the maximum sentence for the most serious charge Fritzl faced: one count of murder, for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. The eight-member jury returned a unanimous verdict on all counts. Fritzl, dressed in a gray suit, blue shirt and dark tie, stared blankly ahead and showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict. The 73-year-old had pleaded guilty to all charges on Wednesday, but Austrian law requires a jury to return a verdict as well. Fritzl will soon be moved to a detention facility for mentally abnormal offenders, where psychiatrists will evaluate him and decide on therapy. Until then, he will remain in a two-person cell in St. Poelten. The man who kept his crimes a secret for 24 years until he was exposed last year made a final, emotional apology to the court Thursday morning. Read blog on how Austria was reacting before sentencing . ""I am deeply sorry with all my heart for what I have done, but I cannot go back and change it,"" Fritzl told the court at St. Poelten, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) east of Amstetten, where he and his family lived. The jury found Fritzl guilty of incest, rape, enslavement and false imprisonment of his daughter Elisabeth. It also found him guilty of two assault charges and murder in the death of the baby, one of twins, which died 66 hours after birth. Fritzl initially pleaded not guilty to murder, enslavement, and one of the assault charges, and partly guilty to rape. He surprised his own lawyer by changing his plea Wednesday. Prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser urged the jury Thursday to return a murder conviction. She called Fritzl's admission of guilt a ploy. ""This was not a confession by the accused. It was a change in strategy,"" she told the court. Elisabeth Fritzl also wanted her father to be convicted, said her lawyer, Eva Plaz. Both sides accepted Thursday's verdict and Josef Fritzl refused the option to appeal, court officials said. He could be considered for parole in 15 years, when he would be 88, said court spokesman Franz Cutka, but the Ministry of Justice will decide whether to allow it. Fritzl's lawyer revealed Thursday that Elisabeth had been in court Tuesday, the second day of the trial. Defense attorney Rudolf Mayer said the elder Fritzl noticed his daughter's presence in the final hour of viewing Elisabeth's videotaped testimony. Mayer said he was not disappointed with the verdict because it was a ""logical consequence"" of his client's admission of guilt. He said life in prison is a ""very just sentence."" ""In my eyes, no man is a monster, regardless of what he's done,"" Mayer told the BBC. ""He's always a human, regardless of what he's done."" A technical expert testified at the trial that the underground chamber in which Fritzl kept his daughter and their offspring had low ceilings -- about 1.7 meters (5.5 feet) high -- and, for the first couple of years, only minimal sanitation. The cellar had no daylight or fresh air. Prosecutors said Fritzl closeted Elisabeth in the specially designed cellar in 1984, when she was 18, telling other family members that she had run away to join a cult. He kept her there for 24 years, authorities believe, repeatedly sexually assaulting her and fathering her seven children. Fritzl took three of the children upstairs to live with him and his wife, telling the family that the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off. Elisabeth and the remaining children never saw daylight, prosecutors said, and Fritzl went away for long periods, leaving them without food. To punish them, prosecutors said, Fritzl sometimes turned off the power in the cellar for up to 10 days. In addition, they alleged, Elisabeth was often sexually assaulted in front of the children. One of the babies -- a boy named Michael -- died shortly after birth. Prosecutors charged Fritzl with murder in his death because he did not receive medical care. Fritzl admitted Wednesday that he was in the cellar when the baby was born. He noticed the child was breathing heavily, he said, but he did not think the baby would die and decided not to seek help. Fritzl told the court he was probably responsible for the child's death and pleaded guilty to his murder. He had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charge but said he changed his mind after hearing Elisabeth's videotaped testimony. The prosecution said Thursday that Michael struggled for 66 hours before dying of respiratory problems. They said Fritzl knew what was happening but was indifferent. Authorities have said that Elisabeth and her children now have new identities and are in a secret location. Asked at a news conference why other family members have not testified, officials said they did not wish to. The case came to light in April 2008, when Elisabeth's then-19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill and ended up in the hospital. Hospital staff became suspicious and alerted police, who then discovered the family's plight in the cellar.

"(CNN) -- A wooden ship believed to be over 200 years old was discovered during a recent exploration of the northern Gulf of Mexico, according to a press release from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Scientists were able to view the remains of ""anchors, navigational instruments, glass bottles, ceramic plates, cannons, and boxes of muskets"" aboard the ship, NOAA stated. Shipwreck found on Gulf floor while thousands watched . ""Artifacts in and around the wreck and the hull's copper sheathing may date the vessel to the early to mid-19th century,"" said Jack Irion, a maritime archaeologist with the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. ""Some of the more datable objects include what appears to be a type of ceramic plate that was popular between 1800 and 1830, and a wide variety of glass bottles. A rare ship's stove on the site is one of only a handful of surviving examples in the world and the second one found on a shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico."" Scientists aboard the NOAA ship ""Okeanos Explorer"" were able to view the wreckage using advanced multi-beam mapping sonar technology and a remotely operated underwater vehicle, named ""Little Hercules."" Little Hercules made 29 dives during the 56-day mission in March and April, according to NOAA. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management requested that NOAA investigate the site after it was originally detected as an ""unknown sonar contact"" by Shell Oil Company during a 2011 oil and gas survey of the Gulf, government officials said. The expedition also used ""telepresence"" technology that allowed scientists and citizens on shore to partake in the exploration via the Internet as it happened. According to daily logs posted on NOAA's website, others followed the exploration remotely using e-mail, on-line chat rooms, video streams, and file transfer sites to exchange information. ""Shipwrecks help to fill in some of the unwritten pages of history,"" said Frank Cantelas, a maritime archaeologist with NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research. ""We explored four shipwrecks during this expedition and I believe this wreck was by far the most interesting and historic."" The shipwreck site was located approximately 200 miles off the U.S. Gulf coast in water that was over 4,000 feet deep, according NOAA. Until now, the area has been relatively unexplored.","Scientists believe the wooden shipwreck dates back to the 19th century .

"FALLUJA, Iraq (CNN) -- ""I can still hear her screams,"" says Mohammed Rasoul, pointing to the sidewalk where he was sitting moments before a car bomb ripped through his street, killing his younger cousin and blowing off his right leg. Mohammed Rasoul stands at the grave where his cousin is buried. He lost his right leg in the attack that killed her. Mohammed, now 14, shudders as he stands on the street he grew up on in the war-torn city of Falluja. He admits he's afraid of another explosion. CNN first met Mohammed two years ago. Every day, on crutches he would make the painstaking journey to his cousin's grave to water a small tree he planted next to it. She was just 6-years-old when she was killed in the car bombing on October 13, 2006. Mohammed's story came to the attention of the Global Medical Relief Fund, a U.S.-based charity that helps children in war zones across the globe. Within months, Mohammed and his mother, Jinan Mohammed, were on their way to the United States, an experience that changed their lives and their perspectives.  Watch Iraqi amputee walk again » . ""Before I went to America, the only America I knew was the one that harmed us, destroyed our homes and our lives,"" his mother says. ""But when I went to America, I saw such kindness and humanity."" At the Shriners Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mohammed was fitted with a prosthetic and for the first time in two years, his mother saw her son stand on his own. Her eyes immediately swelled with tears. She had not realized how tall Mohammed had gotten since the attack.  Meet other children helped by the Global Medical Relief Fund » . ""My son's life changed,"" she says, back in Iraq nearly a year after her son's treatment. ""He used to be so depressed. He would watch boys playing football, and he would be balancing on one leg on the sidelines. Now, he walks tall and proud."" When they came back to Iraq, there were celebrations for days. Everyone wanted to see Mohammed walk, and everyone wanted to know what America was like. ""Everyone was so happy,"" Mohammed remembers. ""They were just staring at me because they couldn't believe that I was walking."" But having experienced life in America -- a life without fear -- coming back to Falluja, where most of the buildings still bear the scars of war, was a traumatic reality check. His overwhelming fear of another attack came back, even stronger than before. ""I am afraid,"" he says. ""I feel that people are pointing at me saying, 'Look, he was in America!' And, you know, here people get killed for that."" He adds, ""The worst day of my life was when I returned to Iraq."" Despite his fears, he still makes the daily trip to his cousin's grave. He waters the tree -- now just a twig after somebody snapped it in half -- and prays for his cousin's soul and for his own. His only wish is to leave his country and get past the painful memory of what he has endured. ""After what I suffered through here, no, I won't ever miss Iraq,""  he says. ""This country is over. Iraq will never return as it was."" Mohammed has now returned again to the United States with the help of the Global Medical Relief Fund.

"(CNN) -- Sujit Bhattacharya knew he felt sluggish and had trouble putting on his socks and shoes. One day, when he tried on a pair of size 30 shorts, his wife pointed out that they fit only under his belly. Sujit Bhattacharya says losing weight has improved his frame of mind. He is shown in 2006, left, and 2007. Yet Bhattacharya, of Coppell, Texas, never paid attention to his weight problem until his doctor told him he had high cholesterol in summer 2006. His friends also told him that he had become heavy and needed to do something about it. The feedback was upsetting, he acknowledged, but the combination of his friends' prodding and the cholesterol numbers motivated him to start trimming down his 193-pound frame. ""I needed some tough love: things I didn't want to hear but needed to hear,"" Bhattacharya said. He researched how to lose weight extensively on the Internet, including CNN.com's health section. He learned that 3,500 calories add up to one pound of weight and tried to figure out how to eat to decrease his daily caloric intake. Instead of eating a few large meals every day, he ate six small meals, keeping track of how many calories he consumed. He had been eating more than 2,500 calories a day, perhaps 3,000, so he cut this down to 1,500 calories a day. That meant losing a pound every two or three days. ""As long as you know how many calories you need and how many calories you eat, it's just math,"" he said. He also included more fruits and vegetables in his diet and ate fewer fatty meats. For exercise, he changed his routine from three days a week of limited cardio and heavy weights to six days a week with the same heavy weights but increased cardio. In six months, he lost 40 pounds. Since then, he's put on about 5 pounds of ""good"" or muscle weight but has otherwise sustained his new physique through diet and exercise.   Today, at age 39, he said he's starting to look more like when he was in high school. Losing weight has improved Bhattacharya's overall frame of mind, he said. He also noticed that he doesn't get colds or the flu and fights off infections faster than before. iReport.com: Share your success stories . Sometimes Bhattacharya wonders why he didn't start losing weight earlier and can say only that he felt ""fat, dumb and happy."" ""I didn't understand what I was doing was hurting me,"" he said. He actively encourages friends to try his weight loss method. One friend lost 20 pounds following his advice.  See more photos of weight loss success stories from iReport.com » . ""What I tell friends is: You've got to have a burning platform, something to make you start, a goal or desire,"" he said. ""For me, it was the bad cholesterol test and friends. Someone else may want to fit into a bikini in the summer."" Dietitians say they would encourage others to follow Bhattacharya's example of reducing calories and spreading them more throughout the day instead of eating big meals. If you try it, make sure you have enough energy, feel good while doing it and eat foods you enjoy so you can stick to it long-term, said Dawn Jackson Blatner, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. In fact, Bhattacharya did twice as well as the average person in a weight loss program, Blatner said. He lost 20 percent of his body weight in six months, beating the national average of 10 percent. Tara Gidus, ADA spokeswoman and team dietitian for the NBA's Orlando Magic, recommends that women never eat fewer than 1,200 calories and men no fewer than 1,500 calories per day. She typically does not recommend cutting out 1,000 calories at a time, ""but if someone is really motivated to lose weight and they eat snacks that are filling in between meals, then they can cut a significant number of calories, lose weight and not feel overly hungry,"" she said. Blatner said she would also encourage anyone who wants a drastic diet change to consult a doctor. Bhattacharya emphasizes that anyone can shed unwanted pounds as long as he or she compares the number of calories needed to maintain weight and the number of calories he or she eats. ""I firmly believe it is not hard to lose weight,"" he said.","Sujit Bhattacharya, 39, lost 40 pounds in six months .

"(CNN) -- On October 29, Ed Shevlin looked out toward the Atlantic Ocean from his third-story apartment in New York's Rockaway Park. Sand-filled rain began pelting his windows in what sounded to him like a hundred pans of frying bacon. Then, the lights went out -- and stayed out -- for three weeks. The next morning, he awoke to a scene of utter destruction. Superstorm Sandy tore the sea town's boardwalk to pieces, and filled the community pool with saltwater. It forced 27 of his New York City Department of Sanitation co-workers out of their homes. Yet they were still first on the scene, -- clearing the roads so firemen and ambulances could enter -- reporting seven days a week for 14 hours a day. They worked around the clock to clear more than 500,000 tons of debris and rid neighbors of the unsettling reminder that their entire lives were now piles of garbage in the front yard. Little more than a month later, Ed stood on the ground floor of Madison Square Garden in quite a different setting. He and seven fellow sanitation workers were given tickets to attend the 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief, the most successful fund-raising concert in history. They were heroes for their community. And now they needed help. Through stories such as Ed's, viewers around the world recognized the immediate and unprecedented need across the Northeast. Generous concert donors -- hailing from all 50 states and more than 90 countries -- gave $51 million to help organizations working on the front lines of the disaster. Robin Hood was honored to be entrusted with these funds, and we have since distributed the entire proceeds from the concert to almost 400 organizations across the tri-state area. When the storm hit, and the true depth and breadth of the devastation began to emerge, we knew that the organizations we'd traditionally funded for poverty-fighting work would already be on the ground helping victims of the storm. Rather than wait for them to come to us requesting emergency food, blankets, generators, and other time-critical supplies, we made sure they had the money right away -- providing $3 million to more than 75 organizations in just a few days. Valuable time wasn't lost, and communities such as Ed's in the Rockaways could start rebuilding. As we saw in the wake of 9/11, the need slowly transitioned from emergency assistance to longer-term rebuilding and restorative services, including counseling, benefits/legal aid (such as helping people apply for FEMA funds) and physical and mental health care. But the majority of Robin Hood funds have been devoted to housing, one of the largest and most critical areas of need across the tri-state area. In New Jersey alone, more than 72,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. And without shelter, storm victims have an even harder time getting back on their feet. Because of this, we made a $1 million grant to the Affordable Housing Alliance in Monmouth County, New Jersey, to help purchase, transport, and install 17 newly manufactured homes for low-income residents displaced by the storm. A mother of two lived in the flood evacuation zone of Sea Bright and packed up before Sandy hit. When she returned, 5 feet of water and sand filled her home. An elderly couple forced to evacuate their house had been living in a motel for months. Both families now have brand new homes and can start the process of rebuilding their lives. Once the scope of the devastation caused by Sandy became apparent, we reactivated the Robin Hood Relief Fund -- originally created to support victims of 9/11 -- to help effectively steward funds and resources. Because of the emergency nature of the situation, the Relief Fund Committee met almost every week -- 17 times in five months -- to provide guidance and review grant applications. Our goal was to allocate all of the funds from the fund, $70.5 million, as quickly and effectively as possible. In fact, we completed the process in April with a total of 494 grants to 391 different organizations. But even though our Sandy-specific resources have been spent, the need continues. Ed Shevlin's community in Rockaway Park is still not back to normal. Neighbors await much-needed federal funding. And while the state declared that storm debris collection has officially ended, Ed and his co-workers still find remnants of Sandy destruction in their daily pickups. We continue to accept donations at the Robin Hood Fund and are encouraged by the fact that dozens of other relief organizations are still on the front lines helping. Because, as Ed will tell you, the job is nowhere close to being finished.","Need for help continues seven months after Sandy .

"(CNN) -- The proposed purchase of Mexico's Modelo beer brands by the world's largest brewing conglomerate, Anheuser-Busch-InBev, is causing deep concern among America's craft brewers. Anheuser-Busch already controls about 47% of the U.S. beer market. Adding Modelo's Corona beer and other brands would give it another 6%. MillerCoors, the other big player in the United States, controls about 30%. If the Modelo deal goes through, a duopoly would control more than 80% of the U.S. beer market. The concentration of market share in two global companies means they have tremendous influence over distributors and retailers. This gives an advantage to big brewer beer brands over small brands created by America's independent craft brewers. Ultimately, with limited choices, the beer consumer loses. The Department of Justice is determining whether the sale would violate antitrust laws. As I understand it, Anheuser-Busch claims it would have no say in the marketing or sale of Modelo brands in the United States.  Those functions would be left to Crown Imports, the Chicago-based marketing and sales company that is owned by Constellation Brands, the world's largest wine company. In 10 years, Anheuser-Busch would have the right to buy Crown. It's hard to understand how a brewery could own another brewery and not have some control over sales and marketing. Doesn't the owner control the price of beer sold to the importer/marketer? Doesn't the owner contribute to the sales and marketing programs and costs of the importer/marketer? Doesn't the owner have some say over the hiring of personnel for the brewery it owns? Eatocracy: Learn how to homebrew . And isn't the owner responsible to its shareholders to ensure the brewery is maximizing shareholder value? America's small brewers have been on a roll in the past decade, claiming more than 6% of the U.S. beer market since the craft brewing revolution began in the early '80s. That 6% is divided by 2,400 small companies. The duopoly already has tremendous influence over beer distribution in America. In most markets, brewers have two choices, a so-called Blue and Silver distributor, who sells MillerCoors brands, or a Red distributor, who sells Anheuser-Busch brands. (The color codes describe the primary colors of the brewers' labels.) Through so-called ""equity contracts,"" the large brewers prescribe how much money distributors spend to sell and market their brands. In some cases, they have the right to approve or disapprove the manager of the distribution company. In some cases, they have the right to approve the succession plan of the distributor. In some cases, they have the right to approve the sale of a distributor. Craft brewers constantly struggle to get the attention of these distributors. In the mid-1990s, the CEO of Anheuser-Busch, August Busch III, declared that he wanted ""100% share of mind"" from his wholesalers. Some Red distributors ejected non-Anheuser-Busch brands from their warehouses. Distributors who gave his 100% were given more favorable terms for their purchase of beer. August III is gone, but the new owners of Anheuser-Busch have called for distributors to get ""aligned"" with the brands they control. Large brewers also have control over some retail sales of beer. Many chain supermarkets and stores appoint ""category captains"" to determine which beers are sold in refrigerated aisles and which beers go on the warm shelves. If the category captain is a Blue and Silver distributor, MillerCoors will play a key role in choosing which brands get sold where. If it is a Red distributor, Anheuser-Busch makes the calls. This results in a tug-of-war between large brewers trying to get maximum placement of their brands and small brewers trying to get a spot. Obviously, a company that controls 53% of the U.S. beer market is going to have a better shot at shelf space than my company. Both members of the duopoly have wholly owned brands like Shock Top and Goose Island that are presented as craft brands. They own large shares of some other breweries like Red Hook and Kona. There is concern that these brands would get greater attention from wholesalers than independent craft brands, like mine. This can greatly limit the beer consumer's choices. In sports venues like arenas and stadiums, the large brewers monopolize space. They typically have advertising contracts with the venues, and this results in their having a dominant share of the beer taps and other beer placements. If you want a Brooklyn Lager at Yankee Stadium or CitiField or the new Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, you'd better be prepared to spend some time searching. Brooklyn Brewery is in those venues, but in a very limited way. More beer news on Eatocracy . Those are my concerns, and the concerns of other craft brewers. Obviously, I am not an attorney. I know little about antitrust law. I recently read a couple of books about the oil industry and learned that antitrust rulings in that industry have drawn a line for defining a company with too much market share. Given this, I am baffled by the state of the U.S. brewing industry. How did we ever get to a situation where two companies control 80%? And how can we allow them to control more? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Hindy.","Steve Hindy: Anheuser Busch aims to buy Modelo, Corona beer maker; craft brewers worry .

"(CNN) -- As coach Keith Nelson studied the opposing team, he realized his players were at a big disadvantage. Their future opponents moved quickly around the court, passing the puck with strength and agility. His floor hockey team was out of shape. While in their hearts they were champions, their bodies weren't quite ready for the challenge ahead. If Team USA was going to win at the Special Olympics World Winter Games, Nelson thought, they had some conditioning to do. Nelson has been a Special Olympics coach in Riverside, California, for 11 years. His oldest son, Ryan, 29, has Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. When Ryan Nelson outgrew youth soccer, he joined the Special Olympics program. Since then, he has added basketball, floor hockey and track and field events to his athletic resume. I have Asperger's; I am just like you . Nelson decided his son would set an example for the floor hockey team. Father and son gave up soda and switched to water. They replaced sugary snacks with fruits and vegetables, focusing on eating an overall healthier diet. Over the next few months, the younger Nelson lost 25 pounds. Nelson took his plan to the rest of the team, recruiting his other son, Tyler, to design a training program.""He put the challenge out there and I accepted it,"" said Teddy Leonard, captain of Team USA. The players began working out five to six days a week. They started slow, doing low-impact exercises and lots of stretches to prevent injury. Since they didn't have a lot of equipment, they used their bodies to strength train; push-ups, sit-ups and burpees became second nature. ""It was very hard at first,"" goalie Lisa Salim said. ""I thought to myself, 'Am I going to do this?'"" With Special Olympics, Shriver leaves legacy of hope . The teammates held each other accountable for healthy eating as well. If one person was caught drinking soda or chowing down on chocolate, the whole team did extra exercises at the next practice. ""The whole team suffered because one person stepped out of line,"" Leonard said. ""It helps you learn. ... 'I don't want to do (any) more burpees so I'm going to stop this.' "" Their efforts paid off. The team blew by its goal of losing a combined 300 pounds before the Winter Games. Fourteen players dropped a total of 400 pounds in preparation for their trip to PyeongChang, South Korea.Henry Young, a Type II diabetic, got to significantly cut back on his insulin injections. Salim now shops for dresses that are six sizes smaller. Leonard, one of the team's biggest losers, dropped more than 50 pounds. ""I'm so proud of them, and I'm proud of myself,"" Leonard said. ""I feel great now. I feel good. I feel like now everything that I've been wanting is coming."" Salim used to have trouble making it through more than three minutes of a floor hockey game. ""I couldn't move as fast ... because I was always getting tired,"" she said. But working out consistently and eating healthier has upped her game. ""I'm able to be on a run all the time,"" Salim said. ""I hope I never come back to being the way I used to be."" One teen's journey to Special Olympics . The weight loss has affected more than his team's physical abilities, Nelson said. They've become more confident, working harder on and off the court. ""We have a saying in our team that we're champions, but we're champions in everything we do,"" Nelson said. ""We're champions in how we work, how we walk around and how we want to live our lives. I think the exercise and nutrition program is just part of that."" Leonard has even learned to control his anger issues, whether that's an effect of the weight loss or his team's continuous support is unclear. He plans to continue losing weight after the team returns home; he wants to drop from 350 to 280 pounds. ""This is forever,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop doing it. No matter what happens, I'm not going to quit."" Special Olympics takes on use of 'R-word'","The Team USA floor hockey team needed more endurance, agility for Winter Games .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The training wheels came off two weeks before the race. They had to, or 5-year-old Jonah Jennings couldn't compete in the triathlon. The first day without them, she cried -- big plopping tears of fear. By the second, she was ready for her new two-wheel bike. Jonah was one of more than 800 kids who participated in the first Atlanta Kids Triathlon in Norcross, Georgia, on Sunday. The juniors, ages 5 to 10, swam 100 yards, biked three miles and ran a half a mile; the seniors, ages 11 to 15, swam 200 yards, biked six miles and ran a mile. ""I think it's a big deal for anybody,"" said Blanche Payne, wellness director at Andrew & Walter Young YMCA and one of the coaches for Jonah's 30-kid triathlon team. ""When you say to someone, 'I want you to swim, bike and run in one event,' adults' eyes glass over. When you say that to a kid, they're like 'OK. ...'"" Schools given $25,000 to help kids move . Kids Triathlon Inc. started almost by mistake four years ago in Jacksonville, Florida, said event director Tom Gildersleeve. His wife is a physical therapist who saw a lot of teens getting burned out on their favorite team sport. She worried about kids becoming inactive when they didn't end up playing professionally. ""That led us to triathlon,"" Gildersleeve said. ""That's a sport that just supports lifelong activity. People who are 80 can still do triathlons."" The organization's first race was held in Jacksonville with 400 kids. In 2012, Kids Triathlon spread to five other cities. In each, the group tries to partner with an NFL team as part of NFL Play 60 -- the football league's campaign to get kids moving for 60 minutes a day. ""Today we hear constantly about kids not being active,"" said Joshua Kraft, director of strategic partnerships for the New England Patriots. ""What better way than swimming, biking and running? A kid doesn't have to be a superstar to participate."" Why it's so hard for kids to lose weight . Cheerleaders for the Atlanta Falcons and mascot Freddie revved kids up Sunday as they gathered in a sea of yellow swim caps to the sounds of singer Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe."" ""It's a bit like herding cats, isn't it?"" a harried volunteer muttered as she tried to line the kids up by race number. It was easy to identify the mini pros -- kids whose parents had obviously spent hundreds of dollars on triathlon equipment. Yet beside the fancy road bikes were ones with pink and purple streamers; Hello Kitty helmets lay next to ones shaped like dinosaur heads. Each kid on Jonah's team was the first in his or her family to complete a triathlon. But as the junior group prepared to jump into the pool, Jonah and her friend Lincoln Fletcher were more interested in their loose baby teeth than being nervous. ""See? It's ready to come out,"" Jonah said as she wiggled it with her pointed finger. The Andrew & Walter Young YMCA team spent seven weeks training. Three days a week, the group gathered to swim and either bike, run or practice transitions. Then, on Saturdays from 8 to 11 a.m., they did all three. ""Most could not complete it when we started,"" Payne said with a laugh. ""Huffing and puffing, they'd look at me like, 'You're kidding.' "" 'The Beast' races to lose 100 pounds . Scholarships were awarded to those who couldn't afford the registration fee, and some of the team's triathlon equipment was donated, including Jonah's new bike. ""I want her to be competitive in life, quite honestly -- not be afraid to compete,"" said Jonah's mother, LeRoya Jennings, as she eagerly waited for her daughter to round the last corner on the bike path. Twenty minutes later, Jonah ran across the finish line to receive her medal with a big grin. ""It was long!"" she exclaimed, gulping down water. She said she wants to do another race soon, maybe with her dad next time. Gildersleeve said he hopes the events are making a long-term impact on the communities where they're held. He said that research shows kids average an extra 19 hours of exercise a month in the lead-up to the races. ""If we can get a family to adopt that lifestyle, that's a priority for us,"" he said. ""They can learn that being active and healthy is fun."" Too much TV linked with weaker kids .","Kids Triathlon Inc. holds races in six U.S. cities and hopes to expand .

"(CNN) -- The word Friday on a homicide investigation into the death of a man whose body was found less than a mile from the home of Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was the same from authorities and from Hernandez -- no word at all. Hernandez has yet to say anything publicly. Instead, a statement from his lawyer acknowledged there was an investigation, but didn't confirm media reports that authorities had questioned his client. ""It has been widely reported in the media that the state police have searched the home of our client, Aaron Hernandez, as part of an ongoing investigation,"" attorney Michael Fee said. ""Out of respect for that process, neither we nor Aaron will have any comment about the substance of that investigation until it has come to a conclusion."" Three search warrants have been issued in the case, according to North Attleborough, Massachusetts, criminal clerk magistrate Mark Sturdy. They have not been made public yet because the files have not been returned, and Sturdy would not comment on whether they involved Hernandez's house or property. The 27-year-old Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough. Police searched the home and sifted through the nearby woods this week for clues. Two investigators wearing Massachusetts State Police jackets, at least one of them carrying paper work drove up the driveway Hernandez' house Friday, rang the front doorbell and a female let them into the home. They were in the home for a few minutes and then left. It was not clear what the investigators were doing and they made no comment when they drove away. Lloyd died of a gunshot wound, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Thursday. Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, told CNN that Lloyd and Hernandez were friends and were at a Boston nightclub together Friday night. She said her brother was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance. She did not know when or how her brother and Hernandez met. Thibou said she did not know of any problems between Hernandez and Lloyd, who worked for a landscaping company. She can't imagine why anyone would want to kill her brother, whom she described as a friendly guy who was like a father to her 7-year-old daughter. ""My son is a wonderful child,"" Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, said. ""He's a family guy. He has not done anything to hurt anyone."" Neighbors told CNN that Hernandez, 23, has been a quiet, respectful neighbor. Hernandez, who is rehabbing a shoulder injury, returned to the house Wednesday afternoon wearing a gray Patriots sweatshirt and blue sweatpants. He didn't acknowledge the presence of the media and appeared to spend the rest of the day inside or on the back deck. But the investigation has already cost him at least one endorsement deal. CytoSport says it pulled its endorsement deal with Hernandez, effective immediately, because of the investigation. On the street between the home and where Lloyd's body was found, police searched through tall grass. Nearly a dozen Massachusetts state police officers entered Hernandez's home Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Patriots spokesman Stacey James said Tuesday the team was aware of the reports but wouldn't comment during an ongoing police investigation. Hernandez has played three seasons for the Patriots, averaging 58 catches per year. He was selected for the Pro Bowl in his second season. ESPN reported he signed last year a contract extension that would pay him $40 million for the 2014-18 seasons. North Attleborough is about 15 miles from Gillette Stadium, where the Patriots play their home games. As the mystery was unfolding in Massachusetts, Hernandez and his attorneys were dealing with a lawsuit in Miami in which a man claimed Hernandez shot him after they rode in a car after an argument at a strip club. According to a court document, Alexander Bradley contends he lost his right eye because of the February incident. The case was dismissed Monday over an error in the initial paperwork, but it was refiled on Wednesday, according to court documents. CNN's Mary Snow, Lawrence Crook, and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The investigation has already cost Hernandez at least one endorsement deal .

"(CNN) -- As Asiana Airlines Flight 214 flew into San Francisco International Airport on Saturday, the Boeing 777's 291 passengers didn't know that the man at the controls had never landed this kind of plane at this airport before. Could that have contributed to the crash, which resulted in the deaths of two teenage passengers? No one knows for sure, including federal investigators who haven't ruled out pilot error in their investigation. The plane crashed while trying to land on a runway that starts at the edge of San Francisco Bay. It lumbered in too low and too slow, investigators say, and then tried to increase speed to go around for another landing. Instead, the plane hit the runway, cracked in two, spun out of control and caught fire. Does it matter that the pilot at the time -- aviation veteran Lee Kang-kuk -- has only 43 hours of flying time in the 777? South Korea's Asiana Airlines says Lee has flown the model nine times. Asiana flight attendants hailed as heroes . It's ""highly significant,"" former Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo said Monday, particularly how he came across the water and over the seawall, she said. If the pilot was going to avert danger, Schiavo said, he needed to take action well before the plane reached that seawall. Lee knew how to fly. An experienced pilot for Asiana, Lee had more than 10,000 hours in other kinds of aircraft, the airline says, although it's still unknown which types. Lee was legally qualified to fly the plane, Schiavo said. But he was also flying during a period when he was trying to build up additional hours of 777 cockpit time to ""gain comfort at the controls and experience flying the plane under certain conditions."" This new wrinkle in the mystery surrounding the crash raises questions about how pilots are trained to fly new aircraft. Training varies from country to country. In the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration requires even the most experienced pilots to undergo rigorous training to learn how to fly different types of planes. The new development calls into question the protocol of the cockpit and whether the flight crew is encouraged to question a pilot's decisions. Is Lee a greenhorn when it comes to flying the 777? Shock and survival: Crash through the eyes of children . Pilots will tell you that 43 hours of real-world experience flying a new type of aircraft is not a lot. Someone with that amount of time is still ""new to the airplane,"" said Mark Weiss, an aviation consultant and 20-year airline pilot. The widely accepted threshold for an experienced pilot in any aircraft is generally about 100 hours. Pilots generally learn how to fly new aircraft by undergoing many weeks of training at ground school classes and on plane simulators and, finally, by being shadowed by a ""check airman."" The check airman determines whether the trainee passes or will go back for more training. Among the four pilots aboard Flight 214 was a ""check pilot,"" U.S. investigators said, who was monitoring Lee. Weiss flew 777s hundreds of times. Before that, he captained 727s, 737s and DC-10s. He knows what it's like to be a veteran pilot who is learning how to fly a new kind of airliner. ""Typically in your career, you're going to be changing airplanes all the time,"" he said. ""This is a typical and normal transition."" The 777 is a pilot's aircraft, Weiss said. It's relatively easy to fly, especially if you're experienced with other airliners. Does Boeing experience matter when it comes to flying a different model? It doesn't make it easier or harder, according to Weiss, but prior routines may influence piloting decisions. The Asiana pilot ""may have been thinking, 'the last airplane I flew, I know I could get it down from here.' "" Perhaps the 777 ""had characteristics different from the plane he flew before,"" Weiss said. ""Those are things the (National Transportation Safety Board) will look at."" Did Asiana passengers ignore safety messages? In addition to the 777, Weiss knows San Francisco's airport, having landed at the crash site -- Runway 28 Left -- hundreds of times during his long airline career. For Weiss and other pilots familiar with that runway, the bottom line is: There's nothing problematic about it. ""Sometimes, the wind might be a little tricky,"" Weiss said, but that's about it. It's routine for pilots with fewer than 100 hours of flight time on an aircraft to land at Runway 28 Left, Weiss said. A pilot's general target zone is within the first third of the runway. Lee had flown into the airport before, according to Asiana, but this was his first time landing a 777 at SFO. Airline pilots who've been following the story also want to know what happened in the cockpit. Did anyone other than the pilot notice that the plane was coming in too low and slow? Did they alert the pilot that he needed to take action? If not, why? Interactive: What happened with Asiana Flight 214? This is all about the culture of the cockpit, pilots say. Airlines the U.S. and around the world have embraced the idea that officers should feel free to challenge authority if they have concerns. Decades ago, the captain's word was unquestionable, making the commander essentially God of the Cockpit. How much -- if any -- of that culture existed in the cockpit of Flight 214? NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said it's important for the two pilots in charge of an aircraft during the ""very risky"" landing phase to work closely together. Investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems, she said, but it's something they will be looking at. Hersman also downplayed the significance of the pilot's experience, saying it's typical for pilots to change aircraft types. More answers may come from crew accounts. Hersman indicated Monday that her team had not completed interviews with the flight's pilots and were waiting for South Korean investigators and interpreters. Those pilot interviews will probably form a large part of the evidence investigators use to determine what really happened in those crucial seconds before the tragic crash landing of Flight 214.

"(CNN) -- I feel incredibly lucky to have the health and the years needed to run a marathon in each of the 50 states. When I was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma nine years ago, only half of newly diagnosed patients survived more than five years. Since then, I've run 70 marathons, the most recent in Hawaii, my 50th state. Hot, exhausted, sore, bent a little to the right, and walking a lot, I finally trotted across that finish line in Honolulu. I'm sure I had a big grin on my face because it was the end of a long quest, the completion of which was never a certainty. There are more people who climb Mount Everest each year than there are runners who finish 50 states of marathons. I remember laughing a little, feeling a mixture of joy and relief, as I limped to the table where I could pick up my finisher's shirt and medal. I didn't dare sit down at first, afraid that my muscles would cramp up -- I had to keep walking for a few minutes at least. Everything was sore. But muscles recover, and I was soon off to the other events of the day: an interview, then to collect my wife and daughter (who also ran the full marathon). We checked out of the hotel and hustled to catch a plane, where I could finally relax. Sleep came easily, even on the plane. 'American Idol' favorite overcomes Tourette's, Asperger's . Since then, the 50 States Marathon Club has accepted my documentation, so I'm a certified ""50 Stater."" It's done and official. Right now I'm savoring the temporary freedom from goals and running just for the joy of it. One big reason that I can run with myeloma is a drug called pomalidomide. It's just a little red pill that I take every night. It doesn't cure the cancer but has kept it at bay for almost five years, without the severe side effects and clinic visits of regular chemotherapy. It's a miracle drug for me. A cookbook for cancer treatment . When I started taking pomalidomide, it was an investigational drug, not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. I wish that life-saving experimental drugs such as it could be much more widely available to people whose lives are threatened by illness. Happily, pomalidomide has been approved by the FDA and will be available to those who need it soon, marketed under the name Pomalyst. It has the potential to do for thousands more what it has done for me. We don't know what's next for us yet, but whatever it is we'll continue to do it as a family. My wife and daughter have 48 states, including their marathons and their half-marathons, so we'll certainly run in their remaining states, Virginia and Massachusetts. And whatever we do, it will be in support of worthy charities. Live one day at a time and make it a masterpiece.

"Washington (CNN) -- Suburban Virginia homeowner Jack Webb couldn't believe what security cameras in his yard captured earlier this week -- a group of people punching and kicking a man on his street. Webb told CNN that a party on Monday night at a nearby house in Springfield, just south of Washington, attracted roughly 50 teens and young adults. He said he was awakened by noise. Looking out his window, he said he saw what he thought was a small fight with a large group looking on. It wasn't until he viewed the security footage that he learned it was more of a group beating one person. The victim was kicked and punched multiple times by various people but eventually got up and walked off on his own. Fairfax County Master Police Officer Eddy Azcarate told CNN that police identified and spoke with the victim. But they are not releasing his name or any further details at this time. No arrests have been made. Webb installed four surveillance cameras around his house a few months ago after his vehicle was broken into. He said he was ""horrified"" at the scene on his block this week. ""We couldn't believe our eyes,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- While he's enormously concerned about what secrets self-avowed NSA leaker Edward Snowden may yet spill, President Barack Obama said Thursday he's not going to take extraordinary measures to capture him. ""I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,"" he told reporters during a news conference in Senegal, his first stop on a tour of several African nations. Obama hadn't talked to leaders of China and Russia about Snowden -- who actually turned 30 a few days ago -- in part because he didn't want to amp up the issue and have to start ""wheeling and dealing"" in order to get the fugitive in U.S. custody. In a speech Thursday, National Security Agency director Keith Alexander ceded he's worried there may be more leaks from Snowden. ""These leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation's security,"" Alexander said. ""... What is going on, in these leaks, is unconscionable in my opinion, it hurts our nation and our allies. And it's flat wrong."" Snowden has said he gave reporters information about secret surveillance out of concern these programs violate privacy rights and put too much power in the hands of government officials. As Snowden seeks asylum, U.S. bides its time . Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country would consider a formal request for political asylum from Snowden -- which it hadn't then received -- and Foreign Minister Elias Jaua reiterated that position Thursday. Another Latin American country, Ecuador, is probably Snowden's most widely rumored destination -- and subject of a growing spat with the United States because of it. Snowden has sought asylum there, the same country that has already agreed to shelter WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, albeit at its embassy in London. On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, said he would move to block Ecuador from two U.S. free-trade programs should Snowden go there. ""Our government will not reward countries for bad behavior,"" he said. 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back . Ecuadorian presidential spokesman Fernando Alvarado responded Thursday by saying his the nation would spare Menendez and his Senate colleagues the trouble. ""We will not accept any threats or pressure from anyone,"" Alvarado told reporters. ""We will not deal or trade in our principles. No matter how important the trade advantage may be."" The programs in question aren't free-trade agreements but U.S. laws that don't require Ecuadorian consent, so Alvarado's declaration may have little more than a symbolic effect. ""I'm not sure you can really withdraw from them one way or another,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said. While he didn't offer specifics, Ventrell did say he'd expect ""grave difficulties"" in relations if Ecuador granted Snowden asylum. The two countries have been at odds publicly, but remain linked economically. Ecuador, for instance, sent about $9.6 billion of goods to the United States in 2011, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The head of the Ecuadorian Business Committee said he's worried that ""very important"" commerce between the two nations could be negatively impacted as a result of this tiff. ""It's a risk to give asylum to Snowden because the United States, they could consider some economic sanction, including commercial sanctions,"" said Roberto Aspiazu. Still in Moscow . Snowden apparently remained in limbo at Moscow's airport, a free man according to Russian officials but with limited options. Why would Snowden head for Ecuador? He didn't appear to board Thursday's flight from Moscow to Havana, where he had been rumored to be heading on his way to Ecuador or some other safe haven. While he has applied to Ecuador for asylum, that request has not yet been ""dealt with"" because Snowden is not in the country, Ecuadorian Political Affairs Secretary Betty Tola told reporters. She denied the country granted Snowden refugee travel papers, as Assange told reporters this week. Opinion: Why Ecuador might shelter Snowden . Assange said Snowden traveled from Hong Kong to Moscow on Sunday using documents provided by Ecuador. Other governments have not specified what documents the former CIA employee and National Security Agency contractor used to leave the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, where he had gone to leak details of secret U.S. telephone and Internet surveillance programs. U.S. officials have accused China of deliberately letting Snowden leave. And they have expressed frustration with Russia's refusal to detain a man they portray almost as a common criminal -- on par with seven Russian fugitives U.S. officials have repeatedly said they handed over to Russia in the past two years despite the lack of an extradition treaty. Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government. But in his speech Thursday in Baltimore, the head of the National Security Agency argued -- as he's done repeatedly in recent weeks -- that the programs both protect civil liberties and help keep America and its allies safe. Alexander pointed to 54 related cases that Congress was informed about, of which 50 led to arrests or detentions. Most of these were centered overseas, with 13 exceptions such as a foiled 2009 plot to bomb New York City's subway system. Exposing the programs, he and others have said, makes it harder to spot terrorists and thus puts lives at risk. ""I believe the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long-term detrimental impact on the intelligence community's ability to detect future attacks,"" Alexander said. ""These leaks have inflamed and sensationalized, for ignoble purposes, the work that (the) intelligence community does lawfully, over strict oversight and compliance."" Possible Snowden posts . On Wednesday, the technology website Ars Technica published portions of chat logs it said show comments from 2009 by someone using a forum name Snowden was known to have used. The comments criticized people who leak national security information. Commenting on New York Times reporting based on leaks related to confidential surveillance programs involving Iran, the poster compared the newspaper to WikiLeaks -- which enraged U.S. officials by disclosing thousands of confidential diplomatic cables. ""Are they TRYING to start a war?"" the poster wrote. ""you don't put that s*** in the NEWSPAPER."" Ars Techica said it could not be certain the poster was Snowden, but information revealed in the posts matches biographical information he has since publicly revealed. CNN could not verify the posts' authenticity . If they were written by Snowden, they offer insight into his thinking at a time when he apparently was more accepting of government surveillance programs. According to Ars Technica, the poster said of the New York Times and its reporting on secret surveillance programs, ""these are the same people who blew the whole 'we could listen to osama's cell phone' thingthe same people who screwed us on wiretappingover and over and over againThank god they're going out of business."" Four years later, Snowden would provide news organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom with classified information he acknowledged copying and taking from his job as a computer contractor for the NSA in Hawaii. Where could Snowden go next? CNN's Greg Botelho, Matthew Chance, Carol Cratty, Elise Labott, Vivian Kam, Adam Levine, Catherine E. Shoichet and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: Leaks caused ""irreversible damage to our nation's security,"" NSA chief says .
