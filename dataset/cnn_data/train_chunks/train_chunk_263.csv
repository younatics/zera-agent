"(CNN) -- Fox isn't getting rid of mainstay ""American Idol,"" but the network is rethinking its approach. That was one of the highlights of Fox's unveiling of its 2014-2015 schedule on Monday, during which the network placed a spotlight on new series such as ""Gotham,"" its highly publicized Batman prequel, and ""Red Band Society,"" a sometimes comedic drama starring Oscar winner Octavia Spencer. And yet the most intriguing news didn't have to do with Fox's fall season lineup at all, but what's to come in 2015. Fox Entertainment Chairman Kevin Reilly told reporters that the network plans to ""streamline"" ""American Idol"" as the long-running singing competition heads into its 14th season. ""Next year, the format will be different. There will be less hours,"" Reilly told reporters Monday on a conference call. ""I think it will be a two-night format initially during the audition phase, and will quite likely end up as a two-hour show on one night for most of its run."" This news comes on the heels of a New York Times story about music-based shows losing viewiership. Reilly also touched on the changes coming for another one of the network's flagship series: ""Glee."" The song-driven drama/comedy will return for its final episodes in the midseason, and Reilly indicated that the network is still discussing with the show's co-creators on how best to wrap up the series. While Fox has ordered 22 episodes for ""Glee's"" last stretch, Reilly said that could change. ""We need to sit down with (co-creator) Ryan Murphy on how to end it,"" Reilly said. ""The advantage of airing it later in the season is that it doesn't have to feel the pressure of delivering."" As far as the fall 2014 season, it looks like Fox is relying heavily on ""Gotham,"" placing the series up front and center on Mondays. Here's what to look for on the network this fall; new shows are in bold and all times are Eastern. Monday . 8 to 9 p.m.: ""Gotham"": Starring Ben McKenzie as a young Jim Gordon, this drama serves as an origin story for the Caped Crusader and his friends and foes, from Gordon to Catwoman and The Penguin. Jada Pinkett Smith also stars as the gangster Fish Mooney. 9 to 10 p.m.: ""Sleepy Hollow"" Tuesday . 8 to 9 p.m.: ""Utopia"": Fifteen individuals are moved to an isolated location and told to make their own civilization in this unscripted, twice-weekly series that questions whether a perfect world can exist. 9 to 9:30 p.m.: ""New Girl"" 9:30 to 10 p.m.: ""The Mindy Project"" Wednesday . 8 to 9 p.m.: ""Hell's Kitchen"" 9 to 10 p.m.: ""Red Band Society"": A group of teenagers bonds when they meet as patients in the pediatric ward of a Los Angeles hospital. Thursday . 8 to 9 p.m.: ""Bones"" 9 to 10 p.m.: ""Gracepoint"": A 10-episode event series that follows a small beach town's investigation into the murder of a young boy. Starring David Tennant, the mystery crime drama is based on the U.K.'s successful series ""Broadchurch."" Friday . 8 to 9 p.m.: ""Masterchef Junior"" 9 to 10 p.m.: ""Utopia"" Saturday . 7 to 10:30 p.m.: ""Fox Sports Saturday: Fox College Football"" Sunday . 7 to 7:30 p.m.: ""NFL on FOX"" 7:30 to 8 p.m.: ""The OT""/""Bob's Burgers"" 8 to 8:30 p.m.: ""The Simpsons"" 8:30 to 9 p.m.: ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" 9 to 9:30 p.m.: ""Family Guy"" 9:30 to 10 p.m.: ""Mulaney"": The new comedy on Fox's block stars John Mulaney as a stand-up comic looking for his big break as his friends both support him and get in the way.

"(CNN) -- The convicted rapist arrested last week in Gorham, Maine, after 34 years on the lam was a quiet, laid-back, hardworking, sweet young man whose lurch into violent behavior in his last year of high school remains a puzzle, according to a childhood friend. In the winter of 1976, when Doris Dickson was nearly 12 years old, her family moved into a modest two-story house on Myrtle Street in Rockland, Massachusetts, a half hour south of Boston, she told CNN. The next spring, the Irving family bought the house next door, she said. Her new neighbors were Gary, who was then 16, his 11-year-old brother, Gregg, and their parents, Carl and Margaret. Soon thereafter, Gary befriended his younger neighbor, a slim redhead with bangs, braces and glasses. The blond, 6-foot Irving enrolled in Rockland High School, where he got good grades even as he held a part-time job at a supermarket, played trombone in the school band, listened to disco on a sound system he set up -- complete with strobe lights -- in his attic and made plans to go to college, said Dickson. That promising high school student became the 52-year-old fugitive arrested last week in southern Maine, accused of skipping bail after his conviction in the rapes of three women in Massachusetts in 1978. Despite the four-year age difference, ""we were very close friends -- too young to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but spent that amount of time together,"" Dickson recalled in a telephone interview. They listened to K.C. and the Sunshine Band's ""That's the Way I Like It"" and became close, she said. Although the relationship did not include sex, it did include ""probably more than should have gone on between a 13-year-old and a 17-year-old."" But the friendship ended abruptly in the spring of 1978. ""He all of a sudden got a very violent thing going,"" Dickson said. ""Gregg told me Gary had gone after his mother with a knife."" Dickson said she confronted Irving, who did not deny the account. ""He was angry,"" she said. ""All of a sudden he was one angry teenager."" That was enough for Dickson to end the friendship. ""I told him, 'Get away from me, I don't want to talk to you any more.'"" Gregg Irving did not return a call from CNN, nor did his mother, Margaret Irving. That night or the next morning, Gary Irving drove his mother's car through his family's garage door, Dickson said. ""Whether he was mad at me or her, I don't know. I didn't talk to him again."" That summer, Dickson's mother showed her an article in the local newspaper about Irving. ""Do you know what rape is?"" she asked her daughter. Irving was being tried on three separate counts of rape with force, unnatural acts and kidnapping. In one case, he was accused of knocking a victim from her bike and taking her to a secluded area, where he raped her repeatedly. In another, he was accused of raping a woman after threatening her with a knife. During the trial, Dickson saw him one last time. ""I was with my sister; he was with Gregg,"" she recalled. ""We were walking in opposite directions, and my sister and I crossed the street to avoid him."" No one said anything. Soon after, a 12-member jury in Norfolk Superior Court found Irving guilty on the counts. The judge -- new to the job -- offered him a weekend to put his affairs in order before reporting to jail. Instead, Irving, facing a possible sentence of life in prison, fled and landed on Massachusetts' most-wanted list. His parents, whose family now included a younger son with Down syndrome, were struggling, Dickson said. They moved out of the house on Myrtle Street, and it was left vacant for months, then sold. In the years since, Dickson said, she has never figured out what caused Irving to change. ""Some time in there, he lost it. Something happened. He was not like that."" Now 48 and working as a technical writer, a reporter for a local paper and the owner of a pet supply shop, Dickson said she has never forgotten her former neighbor. ""I've expected him to jump out around a corner,"" she said. In February 2012, after the arrest of alleged mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger after 16 years on the run, members of the Massachusetts state police's fugitive task force and the FBI met with Dickson to see whether Irving, too, could be located. ""They were trying to develop a picture of who this was back then in order to figure out where he would have been drawn."" It turns out he had been drawn just 129 miles north, to Gorham, Maine. That's where, on Wednesday night, police and the FBI arrested Irving as he, his wife and their grandchild were watching television. ""He requested to know how we found him,"" Maine State Police Sgt. Robert Burke told reporters. Burke would not divulge what led authorities to Irving. On the front of the house on South Street, a sign reads ""Irving."" Police said Gary Irving had been living as Gregg Irving, the name of his younger brother. Records show he had lived there since 2002 and perhaps since the mid-1980s, police said. Confirmation of his identity was made via a scar on his chest from heart surgery he underwent as a child and a fingerprint match, police said. Investigators found guns in the house, police said. As a felon, Irving was not allowed to possess the guns, and he will be charged by federal authorities on firearms offenses, Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio said. When he showed up in court on Friday, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit with his wrists cuffed in front of him, Gary Irving looked little like his Most Wanted poster, which showed 1978 a picture of him clean-shaven. In court, his hair was tied into a ponytail, his beard was bushy, and both were flecked with gray. But one thing had not changed. ""I'd know those eyes anywhere,"" Dickson said after looking at television accounts of her former friend. ""Those are the eyes."" He was taken to Cumberland County Jail in Portland as a fugitive from justice, this time without bail. ""I can tell you that his wife appeared like she was in a state of shock,"" Burke said. Neighbors in Gorham, a town of 16,000 residents, also expressed shock that the house with the swing set outside had been home for years to one of Massachusetts' most-wanted fugitives. ""Everybody's quite amazed at what took place here,"" said Keith Meggison, who has lived for 28 years on South Street, four houses down and across the street from the Irvings. ""It was kinda strange that nobody picked up on this."" The Irvings apparently did take pains to keep out of the public eye. ""Their windows were always closed; they always had sheets over their windows,"" said neighbor Alyssa Lurvey. ""They kept to themselves so much that we never saw them, we never knew who they were."" ""He was always pleasant and nice,"" neighbor Patricia Dixon said. ""You never know who's living next door, I guess."" ""We really are just starting to understand and know who this guy is,"" Maine State Police Lt. Walter Grzyb said. ""They're going to want to know everything about him that has happened since 1978."" Police said they are planning to see whether they can link Irving to any unsolved rapes in the area. His house, on a main street into town, is about a quarter-mile away from three public schools and less than a mile from the University of Southern Maine. Some 60% of the 1,200 students who live on campus are women, a school spokesman said. Dickson said she plans to visit her former friend in prison to ask him about his transformation 34 years ago: ""What happened to you? What were you thinking? How did you get so angry?"" she said she will ask.","Gary Irving and Doris Dickson ""were very close friends"" in the 1970s, she says .
Irving was a good student when ""he all of a sudden got a very violent thing going,"" she recalls .

"(CNN) -- She started her business with just Â£100, lugging her beauty bag from door to door, but some 25 years later Grace Amey-Obeng has built a multi-million dollar cosmetics empire that's helping change the perception of beauty for many. One of Ghana's top entrepreneurs, Amey-Obeng has turned her mobile therapist venture into the FC Group of Companies -- a thriving conglomerate that includes clinics, a versatile cosmetics line and a beauty school. Amey-Obeng says her mission has always been to restore and enhance the natural beauty of black women -- a passion of hers ever since she was a child visiting her mother's salon. ""Seeing how beautiful the women looked after their hairstyles and makeup really touched me and I decided that I would like to continue with this professionally,"" explains Amey-Obeng, who went to college in the UK and studied beauty therapy. Upon returning to the West African country, she initially started working from door to door as a mobile therapist but quickly managed to amass a large number of clients and decided to open her first beauty clinic. 'A concept of well-being' At the beginning, Amey-Obeng says, one of the main things she had to combat when she put her business plan into action was the practice of skin lightening, or skin bleaching as it's often called, which refers to the use of chemical products in an attempt to lighten skin tone. ""[Women] associated being light-skinned with being affluent or something and I thought that I can do something about that by going on an anti-bleaching campaign,"" says Amey-Obeng. ""We went to the markets with our vans and spoke about the dangers of bleaching, especially in this climate. When you remove the protective layer of the skin, you expose all of yourself to the sun's rays and eventually [can] develop skin cancer."" The practice of using creams and other cosmetic products to chemically lighten skin tone is a fairly common in many African countries -- but the practice is known to have detrimental health effects, says the World Health Organization. ""I discovered that women were actually formulating their own concoctions at home using perming creams and all kinds of chemicals to bleach [their skin],"" Amey-Obeng reveals. ""Bleaching is a very dangerous enterprise to embark on and we try as much as we can to educate the public on it,"" she says. ""Beauty is a total concept, it's a concept of well-being -- if you eat well, exercise well and rest well, your skin will naturally glow."" Nurturing talent . In her battle against bleaching, the determined beautician has launched an education initiative. In addition to a weekly newspaper column, where she offers advice to people about keeping their skin healthy, she also combats the prevalence of chemical options by training students at her beauty school and when selling products over the counter. ""Setting up the school was a matter of course, because I needed help, so I started with two students and trained them for free so they can give me assistance,"" says the business mogul. That was in 1998. Since then Amey-Obeng says over 5,000 students have graduated from FC Beauty College. ""On the day of graduation, I always cry because I see the joy in their faces that they have accomplished something,"" she says. ""They've been through challenges."" It's this desire to nurture young talent and help women embrace their natural beauty that seems to drive the successful entrepreneur's efforts. While she admits that she can't help every young woman who passes through the college doors, she always reminds students of her startup experience to inspire them. ""I tell them my story all the time,"" says Amey-Obeng. ""Take products and go door to door; communicate with your clients; express your knowledge and you will win their confidence,"" she adds. ""So we give them different options and entrepreneur skills so they can be able to stand on their own."" Despite a lifetime of industry experience and successful business, Amey-Obeng says it's still the small things -- like seeing a satisfied client -- that makes her smile. ""I see clients come in with horrible conditions and through therapy and guidance, they are happy. And once they're happy, I'm happy,"" she says. ""Once you are able to restore joy to people, it's very, very fulfilling. It's good to reach out to the deprived and to me that is fulfillment."" READ THIS: Why I started Black Fashion Week .

"(CNN) -- Chief Clerk Walter Dimmick was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $30,000 -- from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1901. More than 100 years later, a California couple unearthed a secret stash of coins, with a combined face value of about $28,000. Most were minted in San Francisco. Coincidence? Sure is, said Adam Stump, spokesman for the U.S. Mint. ""We do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility,"" he told CNN. The spokesman was responding to the latest wave of speculation that kicked off after The San Francisco Chronicle published a report Monday, suggesting a turn-of-the-century heist could explain the possible provenance of the coins. Separately, Stump told the newspaper: ""We've done quite a bit of research, and we've got a crack team of lawyers, and trust me, if this was U.S. government property we'd be going after it."" The coins from the 1901 heist were never found. The so-called Saddle Ridge Hoard was discovered by a husband and wife in February 2013 on their property in Northern California. Though the coins have a face value of approximately $28,000, experts believe they could fetch in excess of $10 million. The treasure is known as the Saddle Ridge Hoard because it was discovered near a hill the couple called Saddle Ridge. A golden mystery . The husband and wife were walking their dog when they spotted something metal on the ground. They dug and eventually discovered eight metal cans, containing more than 1,400 gold coins. Restoring and cleaning the coins has taken months. No one knows how they got there, or whom the coins might have belonged to. Don Kagin, of Kagin's, Inc., is assisting the owners, who wish to remain anonymous. ""The best theory is that -- and this is collaborated somewhat with doing some research, title searches, etc. from back in 1800s -- that someone in the mining business, as he got his remuneration, his bonuses, whatever, he would take the gold from the banks and put it into the ground in these cans,"" he told CNN. ""Back then, they didn't always trust the banks."" Kagin dismissed the idea that the coins could be connected to the turn-of-the-century heist. ""If you had robbed the U.S. Mint in 1901, you'd have 1901, 1900, 1899 coins. But instead what you have here are coins from 1894 and before,"" he said. ""We vetted this long time ago. We know the story of Dimmick. The only thing that is remotely similar is the amount of value."" The coins, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, date from 1847 to 1894. Many are in pristine condition, including at least 14 coins that are considered the finest known for their date and mint mark. A highlight from the hoard is an 1866-S No Motto Double Eagle, valued at close to $1 million. ""Nothing resonates like buried treasure,"" Kagin said, as a smile broke across his face. ""These are not just coins, but they are artifacts. They tell a story ... They speak to us. It's like holding history in your hands."" The couple is planning to sell most of the collection. Some will be sold on Kagin's website, but most on Amazon, probably in May. ""Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition,"" Kagin said. ""And add to that a wonderful human interest story: this family literally found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."" These coins could change history .

"(CNN) -- As a child, I thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the Philippines was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until I mingled with people from different social classes. The feeling of being unwanted tore my heart out, and I grew to feel so sorry for myself. I was looked down upon and discriminated against because of my appearance in cheap secondhand clothes and old shoes. I wore the same pair of shoes for more than 10 years, lining the sole with a plastic bag so the water wouldn't seep into my feet. Because of the way I looked, I was often bullied by gang members verbally and at times physically, with others hitting and shoving me. I felt different, powerless and socially isolated. Watch a preview of the 2010 CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute . I was then focused on one thing: revenge! I kept those feelings to myself and it consumed me little by little, until my heart grew cold and I wanted to give up everything. I almost quit school because I was afraid. I thought of joining a gang to strike back at the bullies. I was lost, troubled and crying my heart out but nobody heard, no one seemed to care. I got so lost that I couldn't even find my way back to peace and happiness until God answered the desire of my heart. I was 13 when I met a man who became my friend, mentor, teacher and somewhat like a father. He helped me pick up the broken pieces of my life, which eventually healed my broken spirit. That mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things. He taught me that the quality of life is more dependent on our perspective than our circumstances, that the value of being is more dependent on our character than on our achievements -- and that the worth of our existence is more dependent on how we live life than on how long we survive. My mentor taught me that if I struck back with revenge against those who harmed and threatened me, it would just worsen my situation. So he introduced me to several volunteer activities, from distributing sandwiches to prisoners to building houses for less fortunate families to working in youth empowerment programs. I felt good about what I did, especially when people appreciated those small efforts. During those moments, I discovered my responsibility to other people and I slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against. My mentor encouraged me to think of a positive way to get back at those who bullied and put me down, not by violence but by competition. At 16, he helped me and my friends create Dynamic Teen Company as an alternative club for students on campus and in communities, a way to stop bullies and school gangsters from victimizing and terrorizing more students. Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities. Our goal was to show that that there is strength in numbers and that goodness should triumph over wrongdoing. Our crusade against the acts of bullies and gang groups has reached the slums and depressed areas in our town, where many kids are groomed and trained as early as 9 years old to become a gangster. We were able to save children from this fate and help them become an asset to build a better community. We put an emphasis on using education and faith to help every child to have a better and decent life. This has become our mission. There are plenty of kids all over the world who are going through the same things as I did. And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence. The role of adults, parents and mentors makes a big difference in combating this issue. Children must be loved, protected and given proper guidance. Good old family values should be strengthened. Education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well. Love for learning will open new doors of opportunities to everyone. We should remember that all adults are in some ways teachers to children who watch us and copy our beliefs, acts and lifestyle. We want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving, accepting and respecting of others, so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Efren Peñaflorida.","Efren Peñaflorida: I was bullied as a child in the Philippines .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- A bore hole reached 33 trapped Chilean miners Friday, officials said, but it must be widened before the miners can squeeze through -- a process that should take a few weeks. The ""Plan B"" drill was welcomed by the jubilant workers as it reached its target in the mine's workshop, 623 meters (about 2,040 feet) down, at about 10:30 a.m. ET Friday, officials said. ""Once we got back to drilling it went very good, the rock was real tough the last few hours, but we did it,"" said Brandon Fisher of Center Rock Inc. Miners assisted the operation by offering guidance for the drilling. The workers could be rescued, if all goes well, in late October or early November. Officials already are planning how they will bring the miners to the surface once a bore hole is wide enough for the task. The daunting rescue may require an oxygen-fed cage that will haul them up one at a time. The trip, which was first thought to require two hours, may be doable in 15 minutes, officials said. Friday's development was bright news indeed for the miners, who will enjoy a feast and celebrate Chilean independence day Saturday. Plan B is one of three options for reaching the group. Drilling under Plan A will stop this weekend once the drill bit reaches 380 meters (about 1,250 feet). The drill will receive scheduled maintenance before resuming early next week, engineer Rene Aguilar said. Engineers estimated that this plan would take between three and four months to complete the hole. The assembly of the drill to be used in Plan C has been completed, an official said, adding that he hopes it will begin drilling this weekend. Meanwhile, a senator representing the region said better government regulation could have prevented the situation. ""This accident could have been avoided and we could have avoided seeing the anguish of 33 families waiting for their loved ones to come home,"" said Sen. Isabel Allende, who represents the Atacama region where the San Jose mine is located. ""This could have been avoided if we had businessmen with a sense of social responsibility. You cannot carry out a mining operation at the cost of miners' lives."" Allende -- the daughter of former Chilean President Salvador Allende -- said government regulators, who temporarily closed the mine in 2008, should have been more vigilant. ""State organizations did not fulfill their role. Instead of shutting down this mine for seven months, they should have closed it for good,"" she said. Two lawsuits filed last month alleged that the San Esteban Mining Co., which owns the mine, violated laws in failing to provide sufficient security. The mine reopened in 2008 after a yearlong closure without the proper safety measures being put in place, including measures to shore up the rock face, according to attorney Remberto Valdes, who is representing one of the miner's families. ""It has been proven, the mine did not have a second escape route and there was no ladder in the ventilation chimney,"" Allende said Thursday. At the time when the suits were filed, there was no response from the mining company. But shortly after the mine's August 5 collapse, company manager Pedro Simunovic said there was no way to know it would happen. ""This was impossible to predict,"" he said, according to CNN Chile. Asked whether new laws are needed to enforce mining codes, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne told CNN that mining laws are not to blame for the men's predicament. ""The problem was that the owners did not do what they were told to,"" he said. ""Not because it was too expensive or they were greedy, but just because they didn't care. ... We have got good regulations but maybe we need to improve auditing of those regulations."" Representatives of the San Esteban Mining Co. have said previously they will collaborate fully with Chilean authorities and the Chilean Congress in their inquiries about what went wrong at the mine. The miners' plight quickly caught the attention of officials and politicians. When the 33 first sent word that they were alive, President Sebastian Pinera triumphantly waved their written note before the media. Even though her Socialist Party opposes Pinera's government, Allende praised his handling of the situation Thursday. ""This accident has increased the popularity of President Sebastian Pinera. It is something he has earned because he took decisive action to save the miners, and that has meant he has risen in the opinion polls,"" she said. Allende's father, who died in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's 1973 military coup, completed the process of nationalizing the Chilean copper industry in 1971. Average Chilean copper prices this year are near historic highs. But even so, Allende said her father would have viewed the current situation with ""great sadness."" ""He would see that even when the price of copper is high, that does not translate into better salaries, better working conditions or better safety,"" she said. ""Businessmen have no greater social conscience and are no less voracious than before."" Earlier Thursday, Golborne expressed optimism that the 33 miners will be rescued in early November and maybe sooner. ""Everything is going a little bit better than anticipated,"" Golborne told CNN about the Plan A, Plan B and Plan C holes being dug in an effort to open a passageway to safety for the men. Two bore holes -- each about 8 centimeters in diameter -- are currently being used to supply the miners. The first carries compressed air, water, communications and a constant supply of electricity to power lights that are used to simulate daytime and nighttime. Supplies -- such as food, clothing and letters -- are sent down to the miners via metal cylinders known as ""carrier pigeons"" through the second bore hole.

"(CNN) -- Germany football star Bastian Schweinsteiger woke up to headlines of ""You Schwein"" and ""You Dirty Schwein"" on Wednesday. Football matches between German and English have always been cannon fodder for Britain's red-top tabloids and The Sun and The Daily Mirror -- which have built their reputation on the use of puns in headlines -- duly went to town after a major European game. Their banner headlines -- The Sun went for ""You Schwein"" while The Daily Mirror had ""You Dirty Schwein"" -- were a reference to the red card awarded to Schweinsteiger, who was playing for Bayern Munich in a European Champions League first-leg tie against Manchester United on Tuesday -- after he fouled England star Wayne Rooney. But the two tabloids, who rely heavily on sport coverage to attract readers, have paid a price for their puns. In German, schwein literally means pig, but in everyday language in Germany it's used as insult and Germans view it as a derogatory term. Outraged by the headlines, Bayern have banned the two newspapers from attending Wednesday's second-leg match at the club's Allianz Arena stadium. The reigning German and European champions described the headlines as ""disrespectful, discriminatory and personally insulting"" in an official statement. ""Especially in the Champions League where UEFA has organized a big campaign called 'RESPECT' where all players are required to wear that logo on their shirts,"" added the club. ""Therefore representatives of 'The Daily Mirror' and 'The Sun' will not be granted media accreditation at the Allianz Arena for the Manchester United match."" The Daily Mirror declined to comment when contacted by CNN, while The Sun said: ""We're currently talking to Bayern Munich."" It's the latest example of British tabloids aiming misguided barbs towards Germany. Ahead of a European Championships semifinal between England and Germany in 1996, The Mirror's front page declared ""Achtung! Surrender"" next to pictures of English players wearing World War II helmets. An editorial in the paper read as a mock declaration of war. While Bayern punished the two British clubs, the German club has confirmed it has accepted its own punishment handed out by European football's governing body UEFA after their fans displayed a homophobic banner during a match against Arsenal. As a result, a part of the Allianz Arena will be closed for the match on April 9. ""Due to breaching this agreement when four attendees at our game with Arsenal showed a disrespectful banner in the Allianz Arena, 700 fans will now be locked out (for the United game) and we were fined â‚¬10,000,"" added Bayern in their statement. ""We have accepted this."" Tuesday's game finished 1-1, leaving Champions League holders Bayern as favorites to reach the semifinals.","Bayern Munich ban two British tabloids from attending game against Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- It's a time-honored adage about the laws of probability: Give 1 million monkeys 1 million typewriters and they'll eventually type the entire works of William Shakespeare. Now, a software developer in Nevada is putting that saying to the test. And his digital monkeys are off to a good start. This weekend, Jesse Anderson wrote on his blog that a computerized simulation of the theoretical simian typing pool has completed ""A Lover's Complaint,"" a narrative poem that appeared in a book of The Bard's sonnets. ""This is the first time a work of Shakespeare has actually been randomly reproduced,"" Anderson wrote. ""Furthermore, this is the largest work ever randomly reproduced. It is one small step for a monkey, one giant leap for virtual primates everywhere."" Anderson's virtual monkeys began typing on August 21. Using open-source software called Hadoop, he created a huge group of ""monkeys"" that input random strings of gibberish. When a chunk of text matches a word used in Shakespeare's catalogue, it gets crossed off of a database of the plays and poems. His database comes from Project Gutenberg. So far, he said, over 5 trillion character groups have been churned out. Based on a page updating the project's progress, several more works might be checked off the list soon. The monkeys appear to need only two more words to complete the comedy ""The Tempest"" and seven more to bang out ""As You Like It."" (There's been no explanation for why the computer monkeys seem to be lagging behind on Shakespeare's tragedies.) ""The monkeys will continue typing away until every work of Shakespeare is randomly created,"" Anderson wrote. Permutations of the Infinite Monkey Theorem dates back as far as Aristotle (although he obviously didn't have a typewriter). Anderson's inspiration came from a perhaps less likely source: ""The Simpsons."" He says it harks back to a ""Simpsons"" scene in which Mr. Burns chains up 1,000 monkeys, giving them the task of writing a great novel and berating one of them for typing, ""It was the best of times. It was the blurst of times."" Anderson's approach is, if nothing else, gentler. ""No monkeys were harmed during the making of this code,"" he wrote.","Digital 'monkeys' with typewriters complete Shakespeare's ""A Lover's Complaint""

"New York (CNN) -- Rick Perry is calling for a flat tax to stop his campaign from flatlining. But it might be just what he needs to revive his presidential ambitions. Because a flat tax is not just a big idea; it could prove to be both good politics and good policy. After all, tax simplification is both needed and polls well, and the flat tax promises a simpler approach to paying taxes. And at a time when President Obama is campaigning against the fact that Warren Buffett and his secretary pay different rates, the flat tax idea might just have met its moment for broader-based appeal. Its virtue is its simplicity. The current tax code contains more words than the Bible, and Americans spend 6 billion hours each year trying to comply with the code. That's time that can be more productively spent elsewhere. In contrast, a flat tax could be calculated during the seventh-inning stretch of a ballgame. And although the idea might sound like a radical change, the reality is that the flat tax -- popularized by Alvin Rabushka and Robert Hall of the Hoover Institution -- has been implemented successfully in 37 countries, including Russia, many of the thriving Baltic States and the newest nation on Earth, the Republic of South Sudan. Perry's flat-tax plan, the details of which will be announced this week, may help him regain the enthusiasm of his initial tea party supporters who lately have flocked to Herman Cain. Dick Armey, a former congressman and chairman of FreedomWorks, has been a longtime advocate of the flat tax, and his organization has helped fund many of the tea party rallies and given shape to the movement. This policy move will, in turn, help convince many tea partiers that Perry really is their man. It might also help reignite a spark of support from center-right think tanks that have long supported such a tax-reform but had growing doubts about Perry's commitment to fiscal conservative policy ideas outside bumper-sticker bromides. Cain deserves credit for moving forward the policy debate in this presidential field. His 9-9-9 plan, a flat tax combined with a national sales tax, captured the imagination of the primary electorate and catapulted him to the top of the poll rankings. In turn, it created pressure on other candidates to propose fiscal plans of their own, providing at least some details in place of play-to-the-base bumper-sticker slogans. Ron Paul put forward a trillion-dollar deficit cut, Rick Santorum proposed eliminating corporate taxes on manufacturing companies, and now Perry has gotten into the game with plans to unveil his own bold proposal. The flat tax is certainly more tried and true than the 9-9-9 plan and avoids its most regressive elements, like the 9% national sales tax. The flat tax as proposed by one-time presidential candidate and Perry supporter Steve Forbes contains a family exemption for the first $36,000 for a family of four, effectively exempting the poorest Americans. This doesn't need to be a polarizing idea on partisan grounds; it was advocated by California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, in his 1992 presidential campaign. And while more Americans would pay taxes under this plan, by broadening the base, we would stop the potentially destabilizing dynamic under which nearly half of Americans don't pay federal income taxes. Making ideological peace with the idea of broadening the tax base could also help some conservatives move from anti-tax absolutism to a broader conversation about tax reform that could help get crippling long-term budget imbalances under control. We could lower rates to stimulate economic growth while remaining revenue neutral at a roughly 19% flat tax rate, and if it was pegged slightly higher, we could start putting a serious dent in the deficit and debt. The fact that the flat tax has been backed by a prominent presidential candidate will help shape the national debate and perhaps provide some urgency to the idea of tax reform. Obama talked about tax simplification on the '08 campaign trail, and Speaker John Boehner and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan have long advocated it as well. Even famed Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville said on ""OutFront with Erin Burnett"" on Wednesday that he'd be fine with a progressive flat tax with three rates and allowances for a few core deductions while closing most loopholes. On balance, I'd prefer a graduated flat tax along the lines Rudy Giuliani proposed when he was running for president (and I was helping run his policy team), the FAST form: an optional one-page tax form with three rates and six deductions, including charitable donations, interest on home mortgage, as well as state and local taxes. But perfect is never on the menu, and a flat tax is better than the current system we have in place. It is simple, fast and fair. Even if Perry's plan is only a base-pleasing opening bid in a larger round of tax reform, it is a step in the right direction. We need to have a serious national conversation about tax simplification that can spur economic growth. By taking the risk of putting forward a big idea, Perry just might agree: Good policy is also good politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","Rick Perry, whose poll numbers dropped sharply, is planning to propose a flat tax .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Drilling has begun as part of an effort to reach the 33 miners who have been trapped underground in Chile for more than three weeks, authorities said Tuesday. The effort to drill through more than 2,300 feet (700 meters) of rock and safely extract the workers could take three to four months, officials said. The hole under way is the excavation hole, where the drill bit will be placed. The miners have been stuck in the desert copper-and-gold mine since an August 5 cave-in and are surviving on supplies funneled to them from above ground through three bore holes, each about 4 inches in diameter. A second 25-minute video sent Tuesday by the miners held another round of greetings to their relatives, family members who had seen it told CNN. Copies were to be distributed to the news media Wednesday. Some relatives emerged from a private screening held in the tents that comprise Camp Hope at the entrance to the mine solemn-faced; others were teary; yet most appeared happy. All the family members said the miners appeared to be in much better condition, much cleaner and much better organized than they appeared during the first video, which was sent up last Thursday. Most appeared stripped to the waist and bearded in the first video; some had shaved and were modeling high-tech sportswear -- T-shirts and shorts -- that were sent down to them this week. The video showed the miners with photographs their relatives have sent down to them in recent days. Some of the miners could be heard playing music in the background. A song from Dominican merengue artist Juan Luis Guerra was one. Over the last few days, rescuers have sent the miners MP3 players and small speakers with a selection of music including Mexican rancheras, Puerto Rican reggaeton and Dominican merengue. Eighteen-year-old Scarlet Sepulveda came out of the meeting crying. ""My dad is fine, he's fine, but I miss him a lot,"" said the daughter of Mario Sepulveda, who held the camera and narrated Thursday's video. ""Of course I miss him."" Cristina Nunez, wife of Claudio Yanez, came out beaming. ""They're much better; they're cracking jokes; they have their own things; and they're good,"" she said. ""I was very happy to see them."" Jose Vega, the 70-year-old father of Richard Alex Vega, himself a veteran miner, said of his son, ""I was a little worried because I didn't see him much in the video. I think, if they have a problem, they steer clear of the video. But then again, he's a bit like me. He doesn't like cameras too much."" The camera, just two inches wide, fits easily through the 4-inch bore hole, has front and side views and can rotate 360 degrees, said Jim Lozano, a product manager with a Fresno, California-based subsidiary of Aries Industries, Inc. ""It's able to get into very small openings,"" he said. He said it was designed for use in the water-well industry. On Tuesday, the miners' menu included tea, herbal infusions, a yogurt-and-cereal shake for breakfast, chicken sandwiches for lunch, kiwi at midafternoon and jam sandwiches for the evening meal. In all, the day's meals contain 2,000 calories. In addition, each man is being urged to drink about five liters of water per day. Wednesday's menu will include rice and shredded beef or pork, the first hot meal the men will have had since they became trapped nearly a month ago, said Jorge Diaz, a medic involved in the miners' care. Though the dishes are normally served with beans in Chile, Diaz said they would not be included, so that the men -- who are living in close quarters -- can avoid getting intestinal gas. Two of the 16 smokers were to get nicotine patches. One of the men reported feeling withdrawal symptoms from not being able to smoke, the other one said he couldn't sleep without having a smoke. Reading material will include press clips about the rescue effort, copies of the ""Condorito"" cartoon books that are popular in Latin America, and a self-help book entitled ""Tactics for Public Speaking."" The book was selected after the miners said they wanted to be able to speak eloquently to the news media when they are rescued. Meanwhile, a four-person team from NASA is set to arrive in Chile this week to help provide physical and behavioral health support to the miners. A medical official, a nutritional medic, a psychologist and an engineering expert in logistics from NASA will stay at the mine from Wednesday through Friday to help, Chilean Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. A group of engineers has said it has a ""Plan B"" that could halve the time it would take to reach the miners. Walter Herrera, quality control and risk manager for the Chilean mining company GeoTech, has said his company was bringing a specialized device typically used for boring water holes to the mine. The drill would use one of the three bore holes already made as a pilot and widen the diameter to about 28 inches, which officials have said is wide enough for the miners to be hoisted through. Chile's mining minister has not ruled out the alternative plan, but has cautioned it might not work. He has also said it might not be put into operation. CNN's Karl Penhaul and Esprit Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Camera, just two inches wide, produces second video .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The first of the 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months could be hoisted to safety as early as Wednesday, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said Saturday. He spoke hours after anxious family members and exhausted rescue workers reveled in joyful relief after a drill pierced the roof of an underground mine in Chile where the men have been trapped since August 5. Sixty-five days after the mine's collapse, officials announced the drill had reached the miners as sirens blasted through the site to signal the achievement. Family members ran downhill, cheering and carrying Chilean flags. What began as a ""possible tragedy, with the help of God, is ending as a true blessing,"" said Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. ""The miners, their families, the rescue workers, the government and all the Chileans have shown unity, strength, of faith, of hope, that is recognized and admired by the whole world,"" the president said. ""This shows that when Chileans unite for great causes, regardless how grand or ambitious they may seem, we are always able to reach our goals and conquer the highest peaks."" Still, despite the day's success, rescue workers continue to face tough decisions and hard work to get the men out of the mine. ""We have not yet rescued anyone and there is much ground to cover,"" cautioned the mining minister, who also told reporters that the families of the miners ""are aware of the process still expected."" Later in the day, Golborne said he believes workers could begin to hoist the miners up by Wednesday. The rescue operation is likely to take around two days, he said, which would mean all 33 men could be pulled to safety by Friday. Also Saturday, the miners successfully set off explosives in the mine to widen the rescue shaft through which they will be brought, Golborne said. Mine engineers decided to encase just the top part of the shaft with steel tubing to prevent rockfalls and further collapses during the extraction process. Previously, they had thought they might need to encase the whole thing -- a process which would have delayed the rescue. Raul Lyon, vice president of GeoTech, the company operating the Plan B rescue drill at the scene, told CNN, ""I can't wait to see the first one to come out."" Lyon said the ordeal has been arduous and emotional for the workers, but ""we had patience"" and solved problems methodically as they came up. ""It was very exciting and also comforting that we were able to reach the tunnel after exactly 33 days of drilling,"" said Lyon, who noted that the miners are ""happy"" and ""in good shape."" Rescue crews have been drilling three separate wider holes to send down the rescue capsule and hoist the men to the surface. Those rescue attempts have been labeled Plans A, B and C. Brandon Fisher, owner of the Pennsylvania company that provided and oversaw the use of drilling bits for the Plan B team, felt a ""huge sense of relief and joy"" and noted that the success wasn't ""in the bag until we were through."" ""This project was unbelievably challenging,"" said Fisher, whose company, Center Rock Inc., aided in the rescue of nine miners who were trapped for more than four days after the 2002 collapse of the Quecreek Mine, also in Pennsylvania. After the 2,300-foot hole in Chile is secure, materials and equipment will be brought in so that the rescue capsule -- dubbed the Phoenix -- can be lowered into the mine. Then, authorities will lower a doctor and a rescuer into the chamber, Health Minister Jaime Manalich said. Medical and rescue personnel will be in place to start extracting and treating the miners. Once the men have been extracted, they will undergo about two hours of health checks at a field hospital set up at the mine. They will then be flown by helicopter to a hospital in the town of Copiapo -- approximately a 15-minute flight. ""You think we were happy, you should have seen those guys,"" said Gregory Hall, one of the rescue drill operators, after Saturday's breakthrough. ""They were just going crazy. I mean, imagine, that's a big step towards coming home. So they were just going crazy. It was wonderful."" Miners who are healthy enough will be allowed to visit briefly with family members in a reunion area before being taken to the hospital, Manalich said. Health officials have increased the miners' physical activity in recent days to gauge how they can handle the stress of being removed, the health minister added. The overall response has been good, he said, though some miners have exhibited anxiety or have had minor cardiac issues. The miners have been in contact with the outside world through a small bore hole that sends them food, water, supplies and other necessities. Pinera said September 19, during his last visit to the site, that he planned to personally hug each of the miners as they were pulled from the rescue shaft. He is due to depart on a government tour to Europe in mid-October. First lady Cecilia Morel Montes told reporters Friday night that her husband was in the south. ""He has a lot of obligations,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, he would like to be here permanently. But he also has to be permanently in a lot of other places and it's necessary to continue governing."" She said the crisis faced by the miners has brought Chileans together. ""They have become very familiar to every Chilean,"" she said. ""All Chileans are equally expectant, equally nervous; there's a lot of empathy toward the families."" She added that the men's liberation will occur ""as soon as possible,"" but only after every precaution is taken to ensure their safety.","NEW: The first of the men could be pulled above ground as early as Wednesday, official says .

"(CNN) -- Barbecued zebra anyone? How about warthog with peri-peri sauce? Along with more traditional fare, these are the kinds of things you might find on a ""braai,"" a specialized barbecue born of South Africa and over the last couple years seen around the world, thanks to a TV series. South Africa's braai (barbecue) culture is one of the few things that truly cuts across racial and economic lines -- just about every circle of friends here has its own ""braai master."" In much the way cupcakes went from being a humble, if beloved, food item to the focus of TV shows, blogs and books, so too the braai has escalated in prominence and caught the imagination of the country in a new way. ""The Ultimate Braai Master"" -- a reality/game show that's an African mash-up of ""MasterChef"" and ""The Amazing Race"" -- is gearing up for its third season in September. The Travel Channel broadcast the first season to more than 100 million people around the world, including in the UK, Australia, India and China. It's slated to be part of Vibrant TV's lineup in the United States in 2014. All you need to make your own braai is a 40-gallon steel oil drum cut in half lengthwise to hold firewood, with a piece of tight cross-mesh burglar bar to support your meat and veggies. Commercial kettle grills, gas grills and instant charcoal are often used these days, as well. Chill, braai . Like all good barbecues, a braai in South Africa is a leisurely affair. Nobody braais on time; drinks and snacks are taken for a few hours while the fire is assembled. Since 2005, Heritage Day, a national South African holiday, has been dubbed National Braai Day by Jan Scannell, aka ""Jan Braai,"" whose braai cookbooks are domestic bestsellers. Archbishop Doctor Desmond Tutu supports the initiative. Elaine Ensor-Smith, a contestant on the first season of the TV show, says the show ""heightened people's perceptions of what you can do"" at a braai. ""Fire is a leveler,"" says the show's host, Justin Bonello. ""It's not like you can turn it on to 180 [350 F] and walk away."" What can't you cook? In one challenge featured on the program, teams had to use every part of a sheep to prepare a tasty dish, including brains, snout and offal. ""It was a really interesting challenge. I would probably do it again,"" says Ensor-Smith, adding that she ""almost dry heaved when cracking the brains."" Traditionally, all parts of animals are eaten on a braai, but modern urban life has had its impact on the food chain here. Chops, chicken and boerewors (literally ""farmer's sausage,"" an incredibly long coiled sausage made of beef, lamb or pork mixed with herbs) are ubiquitous. Different regions have their own spice mixes and specialties: peanut butter and apricot jam on chicken wings; peri-peri sauce on just about anything; springbok loin with anchovy butter; and ""walkie talkies,"" or chicken feet. Non-meat staples are common -- corn on the cob, cheese-and-tomato sandwiches and homemade bread along with cold salads -- though it's generally tough going for vegetarians in this part of the world. Depending on region and culture, different meats predominate. Sheep, goat and pork are popular in some cultures but not others. Black South Africans will tell you that goat is preferable to lamb, says Bonello. What's considered a choice cut differs as well: sheep's head and tail are delicacies to some, and repugnant to others. ""A Karoo farmer will eat a tail and testicle potjie, which you can't find in the city,"" says Bonello. Potjiekos is a small pot of stew cooked over an open fire. Ostrich farms along stretches of highway are about as common as cattle farms in Kansas. Wild game such as springbok, kudu, eland and warthog are favored specialties more likely to be eaten by hunters than city dwellers. Zebra is less often seen or eaten. ""The taste is amazing,"" says Bonello. ""It has a low fat content, and it's completely organic."" Seafood is popular in coastal areas. Snoek is a cheap, popular source of protein in and around Cape Town. Restaurant braais . Restaurant-style braais are most popular in townships, places for those who have little chance to attend an authentic braai. Mzoli's, a butcher/braai restaurant in Gugulethu, one of Cape Town's largest townships, is phenomenally popular with local township residents as well as overseas tourists. On Sunday mornings, the line at Mzoli's starts at 9 a.m. People head into the butcher section to place their order -- usually a mixed platter of meat, such as chops, pork and boerewors, perhaps with some pap (a stiff cornmeal mash) on the side -- then pass through a narrow corridor to drop off their pile of meat in the kitchen. Mzoli's kitchen looks like something out of the belly of an ancient castle, with staff stoking several enormous fireplaces. Outside, in a covered area with live drummers and a cool misting spray, long picnic tables sit end-to-end, packed with what may be the most diverse crowd in Cape Town. Two-liter bottles of Twist lemon drink, potato chips and hooka pipes keep several hundred people occupied while they wait for their food. Mzoli's seasonings recipe, the secrets of which owner Mzoli Ncgawuzele won't divulge, is a spicy marinade that sits well with palates from different communities. Mzoli's also makes its own beef boerewors on site. Where to go for braai in South Africa . If you're pressed for time, don't go to a braai. Waiting for the food is part of the experience. Many people say that the best place to braai is their own backyard. As a visitor to South Africa, accepting an invitation to a braai is one of the best ways to experience a laid-back meal. Mzoli's Place, 150 NY111, Gugulethu, Cape Town; by far the most popular place of its type in Cape Town, Mzoli's is located in a township but has a regular influx of foreign visitors. About $5 per person. Blue Lagoon, 130 Lower Marine Parade, Durban; known by locals as ""Lugs,"" this DIY destination is especially popular with the local Indian community for braaiing and partying.

"(CNN) -- Cornell William Brooks, hailed as a ""pioneering lawyer and civil rights leader,"" has been selected as the new president and CEO of the NAACP, the civil rights organization announced Saturday. The human rights activist and longtime attorney, who once worked as a senior counsel for the Federal Communications Commission, said in a statement issued by the NAACP, that he was ""deeply humbled and honored to be entrusted with the opportunity to lead this historic organization."" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. ""In our fight to ensure voting rights, economic equality, health equity, and an end to racial discrimination for all people, there is much work to do.

He'll be formally introduced to the NAACP membership at the group's national convention in Las Vegas in July. ""Mr. Brooks is a pioneering lawyer and civil rights leader, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Association,"" NAACP Board Chairman Roslyn M. Brock said in a statement. ""We look forward to leveraging his legal prowess, vision and leadership as we tackle the pressing civil rights issues of the 21st century."" Wide-ranging advocacy . Brooks, a fourth-generation ordained minister, has been serving as president and CEO of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice in Newark. ""Brooks has worked to pass legislation enabling previously incarcerated men and women to rebuild their lives as productive and responsible citizens,"" the NAACP said in a statement. ""He successfully pushed for state legislation to reduce the effects of widespread foreclosures. Mr. Brooks has worked to develop social impact investing tools to employ more people in higher wage work."" He also worked as executive director of the Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington and as an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a group started at President John F. Kennedy's request in 1963. ""He has also campaigned tirelessly as an advocate for public education, affordable health care, and fiscal responsibility,"" the NAACP said. Brooks has a bachelor's degree from Jackson State University, a master of divinity from Boston University School of Theology, and a juris doctorate from Yale Law School. Last year, Benjamin Todd Jealous stepped down as president of the NAACP after five years. Jealous was a prominent voice against laws that the NAACP argued made it harder to vote, such as voter ID laws passed in numerous states in the past several years, and was outspoken over the February 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot to death by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer.

"(CNN) -- Shia LaBeouf isn't the only sorry actor in Hollywood. After the 27-year-old announced that he's performing in an art piece called ""#IAmSorry"" this week in Los Angeles, actors such as Jerry O'Connell and Emile Hirsch are turning LaBeouf's apologetic saga into a punchline. On Wednesday, O'Connell actually opened his own exhibit right next to LaBeouf's called ""#IAmSorryToo"" for Funny Or Die. . BuzzFeed stopped by both LaBeouf's performance -- during which visitors take an ""implement,"" such as a ""Transformers"" toy or bottle of cologne, into a small room where LaBeouf sits silently with a bag over his head -- and O'Connell's, and found that O'Connell could be guilty of plagiarizing LaBeouf's show. Considering that LaBeouf is facing accusations of plagiarism with his ""#IAmSorry"" show anyway, O'Connell's rip-off of LaBeouf's exhibit is ""is obviously the point,"" BuzzFeed notes. Like LaBeouf, O'Connell's set-up involves a table of items that occasionally reference his career: where LaBeouf had nods to ""Transformers,"" ""Indiana Jones"" and a copy of Daniel Clowes' book, ""The Death-Ray,"" O'Connell included a DVD of ""Stand By Me"" and a toy kangaroo (2003's ""Kangaroo Jack,"" anyone?). But unlike LaBeouf, who never clarifies exactly what he's apologizing for, O'Connell was an open book. He, too, wore a paper bag over his head -- one saying ""SUPER FAMOUS"" instead of LaBeouf's ""I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE"" -- but eagerly apologized for ""all the world's ills"" and even offered one guy a taste of his sandwich. O'Connell explained to BuzzFeed that he wasn't doing it to upset LaBeouf -- in fact, he found the actor's exhibit pretty inspiring. ""Everyone's talking about it, whether you want to call it art or a real apology, it's hilarious,"" O'Connell said. ""He's getting people talking. I'm all for this artsy gallery thing. It's fun to parody because all I have to do here is sit with a bag on my head, crying, and saying, 'I sowwy.' But I have to tell you; it's freeing to continually apologize like he does. I get it."" Emile Hirsch does too. The ""Lone Survivor"" actor went on a tweet-spree Wednesday airing all of his regrets. ""I AM NOT FAMOUS TO BEGIN WITH,"" Hirsch joked. ""I AM BEGINNING TO FEEL SLIGHTLY MORE FAMOUS. ... I TAKE IT BACK, STILL NOT FAMOUS."" And then: ""I AM...CONFUSED ABOUT HOW FAMOUS OR NOT FAMOUS I MIGHT POTENTIALLY BE...ANYMORE... I AM...ACCIDENTALLY ON CAPS."" Just in case LaBeouf thinks Hirsch is laughing at him instead of with him, the actor clarified that ""IN ALL FAMOUSNESS THOUGH, I LOVE SHIA, WHETHER OR NOT HE'S FAMOUS. ... I AM SORRY I EVEN SAID SORRY. NOT GONNA LIE, I AM ONLY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT SURE OF MY ORIGINAL (FIRST) SORRY."" In December, LaBeouf was accused of plagiarizing Daniel Clowes' ""Justin M Damiano,"" in his short film, ""HowardCantour.com."" The actor at first said that he'd been so absorbed in the creative process he neglected to give Clowes proper accreditation, but then he was also accused of plagiarizing his apologies.

"(Health.com) -- There's a food movement afoot: Eating well to look, feel, and perform our very best is hot. And as Jamie Oliver and Michelle Obama alike are showing us, this isn't a matter of choking down foods because they're good for you. It's about filling your plate with delicious fare. ""Food, if it's chosen well, can reshape our medical destinies for the better,"" says Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale Prevention Research Center. It can also improve our mood and focus. Here's how to graze your way to a supercharged you. Power up: Your stamina . Artichokes. If you've been huffing and puffing up the stairs lately, try these spiky-leafed vegetables. They're loaded with magnesium, a mineral vital for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including one of the most important -- generating energy, says Forrest Nielsen, a U.S. Department of Agriculture research nutritionist.""If you're not getting enough magnesium, your muscles have to work harder to react and you tire more quickly."" And about 68% of us aren't getting our proper share of this mighty mineral. For women, the goal is 320 milligrams (mg) per day. One medium artichoke gets you 77 mg of magnesium (a good deal for only 60 calories!). Other top sources include nuts, legumes, and whole grains. Spinach. These tasty leaves are a great source of iron (especially if you don't eat meat), which is a key component in red blood cells that fuel our muscles with oxygen for energy. But researchers in Sweden recently identified another way in which these greens might keep you charged: Compounds found in spinach actually increase the efficiency of our mitochondria, the energy-producing factories inside our cells. That means eating a cup of cooked spinach a day may give you more lasting power on the elliptical machine (or in your daily sprint to catch the bus). Health.com: The best foods for every vitamin and mineral . Power up: Your mood . Walnuts. Walnuts are packed with tryptophan, an amino acid your body needs to create the feel-great chemical serotonin. (In fact, Spanish researchers found that walnut eaters have higher levels of this natural mood-regulator.) Another perk: ""They're digested slowly,"" Katz says. ""This contributes to mood stability and can help you tolerate stress."" Asparagus. Those green spears are one of the best veggie sources of folate, a B vitamin that could help keep you out of a slump. ""Folate is important for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine,"" says Dr. David Mischoulon, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. All of these are crucial for mood. A cup of cooked asparagus has 268 micrograms (mcg) -- two-thirds of the 400 mcg RDA for women. Add a cup of enriched pasta -- which is fortified with folic acid, the synthetic form of folate -- and you'll have a feel-good meal indeed. Health.com: Healthy recipes to boost your mood .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began explosions Monday night at the Birds Point-New Madrid levee at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The explosions, near the southern border between Missouri and Illinois, marked the start of a three-stage process to intentionally breach the levee -- and, in the process, pave the way for tons of water to flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland -- to alleviate pressure caused by historically high water levels in the rivers. At 5 p.m. Monday, the water level outside Cairo, Illinois, was 61.44 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the National Weather Service. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh ordered the intentional breach. ""(The system) continues to be under enormous and unprecedented pressure,"" said Walsh, the president of the Mississippi River Commission. ""Because of that ... I've ordered the district commander to operate the project."" Walsh said that historic and still-rising flood waters made it imperative to begin the explosive operation as soon as possible. The multistage process is expected to continue through Tuesday. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office tried to block the move, challenging the Corps' authority to breach the levee. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling from Justice Samuel Alito, denied Missouri's bid. On Monday, Gov. Jay Nixon issued a statement saying he had talked with Walsh about the attempt ""to relieve pressure on other parts of the levee system and save lives."" He said Missouri authorities are ready for the blast and subsequent flood. ""I urge Missourians to continue to cooperate fully with state, county and local law enforcement, as they have at every stage of this process,"" Nixon said. ""Together, we will ensure that Missouri families stay safe in the coming days. And together, we will recover and rebuild."" Without an intentional breach, authorities had warned of massive flooding that could wipe out Cairo. Already, Cairo's mayor ordered the city's 2,800 residents to evacuate. Walsh acknowledged the human dimension of his plan, which has irked many in Missouri, where hundreds more have been evacuated. Nixon has estimated that it will take tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to recover property and rebuild lives as the water rushes through the floodway, including washing out farmland he described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" ""It's a heart-wrenching story,"" Walsh said. ""It takes a long time to recover from something like this."" He said the fate of Cairo was just one of many factors in his decision, saying he hoped the move would alleviate issues throughout the Mississippi River system. Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property. With rain continuing to fall and water levels continuing to rise, Walsh said the situation would only get worse without drastic action. ""Nobody has seen this type of water in the system,"" he said. ""This is unprecedented."" And he did not rule out similar moves elsewhere, including possibly more purposeful explosions at other levees along the Mississippi and its tributaries. The area, in Missouri's so-called ""Bootheel,"" is one of four floodways along the system that could be opened up. Walsh said he expected the Birds Point-New Madrid levee breach will cause river crests to drop three to four feet ""for a few days,"" even as he voiced concerns that water levels could very well rise again. ""This doesn't end this historic flood,"" said Walsh. ""This is not going to be over when we operate this.""","NEW: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins intentionally breaching the levee .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration's vision for the future of manned space flight will bump the United States to ""second or even third-rate"" status as a space-faring nation, the commanders of three U.S. moon missions warned Wednesday. The letter was signed by the first and last men to walk on the moon -- Neil Armstrong from Apollo 11 and Eugene Cernan from Apollo 17 -- and James Lovell, who commanded the heroic Apollo 13 flight. ""Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides, the USA is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity,"" the letter said. ""America must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space. If it does, we should institute a program which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal."" President Obama is scheduled to announce his space plans Thursday during a visit to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the White House announced. The White House said the five-year strategy involves a $6 billion increase in NASA's budget and additional support for new space technologies. What do you think of the proposed space plan? Armstrong, Lovell and Cernan praised Obama's increase in total funding for space exploration, which includes money for research, the international space station and a heavy-lift rocket. But the astronauts said the decision to cancel the Constellation program for manned space flight ""is devastating."" ""America's only path to low Earth orbit and the international space station will now be subject to an agreement with Russia to purchase space on their Soyuz (at a price of over 50 million dollars per seat with significant increases expected in the near future) until we have the capacity to provide transportation for ourselves,"" they wrote. NASA's space shuttle fleet will be retired at the end of this year, leaving the Russian Soyuz capsules as the only avenue into space until commercial ventures are ready to do the job, expected to be years away. Obama's proposal to use commercial transport to reach orbit ""cannot be predicted with any certainty, but is likely to take substantially longer and be more expensive than we would hope,"" the astronauts said. Cernan, Lovell and Armstrong said the more than $10 billion spent so far on Constellation -- including the Orion space capsule and the Ares rockets to boost it into space will be wasted by the cancellation ""and, equally importantly, we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded."" NASA's future, as outlined in the White House documents, would include a multibillion-dollar modernization of Kennedy Space Center, expansion of private-sector and commercial space industries, creation of thousands of jobs and eventually human travel to Mars. But Allard Beutel, news chief at the Kennedy Space Center, told CNN that layoffs at the center will likely reach the 7,000 range with the end of the shuttle and the cancellation of the Constellation program. The president's plans would shift some funding away from NASA's costly human space flight program to NASA's scientific programs, including robotic missions to other planets. During a briefing in early April, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden praised the new future being charted for the agency. ""This budget provides an increase to NASA at a time when funding is scarce,"" Bolden said. ""It will enable us to accomplish inspiring exploration, science and (research and development), the kinds of things the agency has been known for throughout its history."" CNN's Dan Lothian and Sarah Baker and CNN Radio's Dick Uliano contributed to this report.","Neil Armstrong, James Lovell, Eugene Cernan criticize manned space flight plans .

"(CNN) -- ""But if we know enough to be hung, we know enough to vote. If the Negro knows enough to pay taxes to support the government, he knows enough to vote; taxation and representation should go together. If he knows enough to shoulder a musket and fight for the flag, fight for the government, he knows enough to vote ... "" -- Frederick Douglass (""What the Black Man Wants,"" 1865) Yet another milestone of great American historical importance has come to pass with embarrassingly little tribute. And much like the election of President Barack Obama, many of us also thought we would never live to see this racial ceiling broken. But unlike the election and re-election of the first black president, the media has paid remarkably little notice to news that might well have more impact on the political trajectory of this country over the next decade than the election of a single president. According to a new Census Bureau report, ""In 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate (66.2%) than non-Hispanic whites (64.1%) for the first time since the Census Bureau started publishing voting rates by the eligible citizenship population in 1996."" Now, given the innumerable battles to secure this most important right of democracy -- from the blood-soaked battlefields of the Civil War to the halls of Congress and courts, to the strife-torn streets of the Civil Rights era -- few things in our collective political history has borne so heavy a toll on our democracy as the enfranchisement of the African-American. That the group for which so many hurdles have been thrown upon to block the vote has for the first time become the group most likely to vote is something like a big deal. Over a century ago, in the final days of the Civil War and of President Abraham Lincoln's administration, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. And on this past November 6, our first African American president, hailing from the state of Illinois and a Lincoln devotee, rode to victory on the power of an expanding black electorate. It is the sum of all hopes and all fears given birth by black enfranchisement. Those who feared the black vote from the very beginning -- those architects of Jim Crow -- understood that it could give birth to transcending possibilities that were once unimaginable, such as the electing of a black guy with a name like Obama as president. Unfortunately, the battle to minimize the impact of African-Americans increased participation is already underway -- and it's both typical and predictable. Demographer William Frey from the Brookings Institution, who did a study on the subject for the Associated Press, asserts Mitt Romney would be president had the 2012 turnout looked more like it did in 2004. Well duh. It was our job to make sure it didn't look like 2004. And Nate Cohn writes in the New Republic that Frey's calculations are flawed, but yet still manages to draw the erroneous conclusion that regardless of whether or not there's been an increase in the black electorate, higher turnout by African-Americans was not responsible for Obama's victory. Soooo, regardless of garnering the lowest share of the white vote in a competitive presidential race in modern history, Obama could have won without expanding the black share of the electorate ? This debate is hard to understand. Despite losing whites in Virginia by an even larger margin in 2012 than 2008, by a staggering 24 points, the black vote really doesn't make any difference? In 2008, Obama won Ohio by 4 points (51.2% to 47.2%), and the drop in Democratic support among whites from 2008 to 2012 was 5 points. Nevertheless, the president remained victorious because of an increase in support among black voters, who increased their share of the electorate from 11% to 15%, resulting in a 2-point victory (50.1% to 48.2%). Similar patterns can be seen in other battleground states. But even in many of the so-called reliable blue states such as New Jersey, for example, Obama's white share of support dropped from 2008 -- losing white voters there by 13 points in 2012. So yeah, I can see the logic in arguments against the importance of the black vote share. GOP pollsters, keep using the same turnout models that you used in 2012; it will be fine. You didn't get it wrong -- the electorate did. At a time when the black electorate is lighting the way and giving new energy to the quintessential Democratic value of participation and empowering the memory and sacrifices of our forefathers (who fought wars in the name of democracy while not being granted it here, who marched and where beaten and attacked with fire hoses and police dogs for the right to vote), the last thing we need is a media brawl over arcane statistics casting doubt on the achievements of ordinary voters as they blaze a trail that that has been in the making since 1865. Now, of course, the question is will this higher voter turnout last beyond Obama being on the ticket? To say I'm hopeful would be a lie. The obstacles are many: a Republican Party that instead of believing in competing in a free market of ideas thinks the best way to compete is by manipulating what the marketplace looks like through voter ID laws and other restrictions, and then there is the self-serving apathy of a Democratic Party consulting cabal whose ol' boy establishment class is almost as dangerously entrenched and insular as that of the Republicans. However, we are at a watershed period of political history where African-Americans have participated at higher rates than others in the presidential election and by doing so changed political reality in a country historically torn by racial strife, making the impossible possible. If the African-American community also sees the power of the ballot to overcome other historical obstacles such as entrenched poverty, widening wealth, education gaps and safer streets where it's not as easy for a criminal to get a gun as it is to buy a cigarette, then this expansion of its voting power will be a more permanent fixture on the political scene. And it will be a fixture that politicians of both parties will need to better pursue. Candidate Obama often said it wasn't about him on the campaign trail going back to 2008; let's see how well the African-American voter was listening. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cornell Belcher.","Census report confirms African-American turnout rate exceed white turnout in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Human progress requires good ideas. Consider how just two fundamental ideas have ushered in the modern world. Rewind a scant 600 years, and modern science doesn't yet exist. Men and women live and die in squalor and filth, largely ignorant of the germs that ravage their bodies and of the natural laws that govern the universe, instead imploring an alleged supernatural force to help them navigate this vale of tears. But thanks to minds such as Galileo, Sir Isaac Newton, Louis Pasteur and Charles Darwin, this is not how we face the world today. They taught us our method of knowing: careful, mathematically precise observation, step-by-step inference and generalization, and systematic, evidence-based theory building. They had the courage to challenge entrenched authority, toss aside superstition and defy popes. As others followed the trail the first scientists blazed, human knowledge advanced dramatically. Thanks to a second idea, this explosion of knowledge broke the confines of the laboratory and ivory tower. Another daring group of thinkers challenged political authoritarianism. Kings and aristocrats were swept aside to make way for the rights of man. This idea gave birth to a new nation, our beloved America, in which the individual was free to think and pursue his own happiness. A new person arose: the industrialist. Slandered as robber barons, what these individuals actually did was earn fortunes by studying the discoveries of science and commercializing them. A mind-boggling array of inventions and products ensued: automobiles, oil, radios, antibiotics, refrigeration, electricity, washing machines, air conditioning, indoor plumbing, airplanes and on and on, to our present world of personal computers and cell phones. Try to imagine life without all of this. It's not easy. But as far as we've come because of these two ideas, human progress demands implementation of a third idea to complete the scientific and political revolutions. We're still beholden to the past in ethics. Although few of us would turn to the Old Testament or the Quran to determine the age of the Earth, too many of us still turn obediently to these books (or their secular copies) as authorities about morality. We learn therein the moral superiority of faith to reason and collective sacrifice to personal profit. But the more seriously we take these old ethical ideas, the more suspect become the modern ideas responsible for human progress. The scientists in their laboratories did not demonstrate the superiority of faith. Thomas Jefferson in his Declaration did not proclaim the superiority of collective sacrifice. Why should we think these ideas are the path to moral enlightenment? Perhaps, of all the damage these antiquated moral ideas do to human progress, the most significant is how they distort our conception of moral ideals. Ask someone on the street to name a moral hero; if he isn't at a loss, he'll likely name someone like Jesus Christ or Mother Teresa. Why? Because they're regarded as people of faith who shunned personal profit for the collective good. No one would dream of naming Galileo, Darwin, Thomas Edison or John D. Rockefeller. Yet we should. It is they, not the Mother Teresas of the world, that we should strive to be like and teach our kids the same. If morality is judgment to discern the truth and courage to act on it and make something of and for your own life, then these individuals, in their capacity as great creators, are moral exemplars. Put another way, if morality is a guide in the quest to achieve your own happiness by creating the values of mind and body that make a successful life, then morality is about personal profit, not its renunciation. Monetary profit is just one of the values you have to achieve in life. But it is an eloquent representative of the whole issue, because at its most demanding, as exhibited by a Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs, making money requires a profound dedication to material production. The fact that earning money is ignored by most moralists, or condemned as the root of evil, is telling of the distance we must travel. In effect, we need to turn the Billionaire's Pledge on its head. The world grants, at best, no moral recognition to Gates and Buffett for the personal fortunes they've created, but it awards them a standing ovation for giving their profits away. But the standing ovation belongs to the act of creation, the profit they brought into their own lives and anyone who traded with them. If morality is about the pursuit of your own success and happiness, then giving money away to strangers is, in comparison, not a morally significant act. (And it's outright wrong if done on the premise that renunciation is moral.) Science, freedom and the pursuit of personal profit -- if we can learn to embrace these three ideas as ideals, an unlimited future awaits. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yaron Brook and Onkar Ghate.","Yaron Brook, Onkar Ghate: Human progress has come as result of science, democracy .
They say our view of morality hasn't been updated since the Bible and Quran .

"New York (CNN) -- The budgetary dispute that has delayed the opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been resolved, according to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, but disagreements over funding, financing and oversight of the museum between the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Foundation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have halted construction. The foundation controls the memorial and museum; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns the World Trade Center site. Late Monday, all parties entered into a ""memorandum of understanding,"" an agreement that allows them to restart construction on the stalled museum project. ""My goal during this period has been to get construction on the museum restarted,"" said Bloomberg, who is chairman of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Foundation. ""This agreement ensures that it will be restarted very soon and will not stop until the museum is completed."" 11 years after, who are the terrorists? The point of contention, $300 million that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was owed by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Foundation for additional design and construction costs, is being dropped in exchange for financial oversight of the museum and memorial, according to the memorandum. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum Foundation agreed to oversight from a committee composed of eight members: two appointed by the governor of New Jersey, two appointed by the governor of New York and four by the memorial board. The foundation has agreed to have no less than six months of operating funds on hand at all times once the museum opens, though it's not clear if the foundation can meet this requirement because it is hard to say exactly how much money the museum will bring in, and the memorandum does not outline specific ramifications if the foundation is unable to meet these financial obligations. Revisiting the mosque at Ground Zero . The memorandum outlines a review of the project with the goal of determining the earliest possible opening date once construction resumes, though no date is set for the museum to open. All parties, according to the memorandum, will work toward opening individual sections of the museum as construction progress allows, which may mean a phased opening. This will allow the foundation to start collecting a $20 admission fee from visitors. Constructed underground in the former World Trade Center's ""archaeological heart,"" the museum will feature 110,000 square feet of exhibition space, according to the website for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum foundation. It will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts, including ""photographs, videotapes, voice messages, recovered property, clothing and other personal effects, workplace memorabilia, (and) incident-specific documents,"" among other items, according to the site. Located at the site of the former World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial has two huge, square fountains that mark the footprints of the World Trade Center towers that flow into granite reflecting pools at the center of the eight-acre, tree-lined plaza. Bronze plates surround the fountains and bear the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks, as well as the six who were killed when a terrorist truck bomb exploded in the parking garage beneath the towers in 1993. 9/11 responders wait for compensation for their illnesses . Sarah Lippman, a spokeswoman for the facility said the memorial, which opened September 12, 2011, has had 4.5 million visitors in its first year. ""Over the last few years, we have made extraordinary progress at ground zero and today's agreement is yet another milestone in our work to finally complete the site as a place where people from around the world can come to work, visit and remember,"" said Cuomo, who along with New Jersey Gov.

"(CNN) -- Vacation rental site Airbnb apologized Monday in the wake of recent highly publicized rental horror stories and announced new property protections and safety measures for site users. Brian Chesky, CEO and co-founder of the site, called the days since reports of theft and damage to one host's San Francisco home surfaced ""a crash course in crisis management"" in a blog post on Airbnb. ""We felt paralyzed and over the last four weeks, we have really screwed things up,"" Chesky wrote. Last month, a San Francisco blogger identifying herself only as ""EJ"" wrote that her apartment had been ransacked by a person who rented her home via Airbnb. Police have made an arrest related to the case, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The newspaper described EJ as a corporate event planner in her late 30s who asked not to be named because she still feels victimized. ""We let her down, and for that we are very sorry,"" Chesky wrote of EJ's experience in his blog post. Chesky also announced a $50,000 Airbnb Guarantee to protect hosts' property. EJ will be eligible for the program, going into effect August 15. The suspect allegedly took EJ's passport, cash, credit card and her grandmother's jewelry hidden inside a closet, EJ wrote in her blog post. Also reportedly missing: her camera, iPod, laptop, and an external backup drive filled with photos and journals. EJ is also worried about identity theft because she suspects her birth certificate and social security card were photocopied. ""I do believe that maybe 97% of Airbnb.com's users are good and honest people. Unfortunately I got the other 3%. Someone was bound to eventually, I suppose, and there will be others,"" EJ wrote. In addition to the property guarantee, Airbnb has doubled its customer support team to 88 employees since last month and has designated a team to review suspicious activity. A 24-hour customer support line will be available starting next week, according to Airbnb. Hosts now will be able to select ""Trust Settings"" for bookings and new profiles will provide more user history online. Chesky outlined some safety improvements last week in a guest column on the blog TechCrunch, but over the weekend, another Airbnb user came forward with an alleged rental horror story. Troy Dayton told TechCrunch that a meth addict with a stolen identity rented his Oakland, California, home two months ago and did thousands of dollars worth of damage. ""At the end of the day, you are renting to a stranger. You should check ... ID's and phone numbers to make sure they match,"" Dayton told TechCrunch. Still, he said he reached an ""agreeable solution"" with Airbnb and has since both rented his place out again and stayed in others' homes through the service. In a ""Safety Tips"" section on its website, the company advises both parties to look for a user's complete profile on the site and check how others have rated the person. Meanwhile, the incident involving EJ, the San Francisco blogger, took another twist late last week when she wrote that one of the co-founders of Airbnb asked her to shut down her blog or limit its access because of the ""potentially negative impact it could have on his company's growth and current round of funding."" Airbnb has not responded to requests for comment about the blogger's claims. Airbnb was founded in 2008 with a simple concept: Connect people who have space to rent -- anything from an extra bedroom to a whole house -- with those who are looking for a place to stay. The company gets money from both parties: Hosts are charged a 3% fee when they receive a successful booking, while travelers pay an additional 6-12% on top of the rental fee. Users have booked more than 2 million nights in 190 countries through the service, the company says on its website. The startup is so hot that it has attracted actor Ashton Kutcher as one of its investors. Even before the reported horror stories, consumer advisers urged potential users to be sure they understood the process and proceeded with caution. HLN money expert Clark Howard has said Airbnb is not for everybody, calling it an option for ""extra-thrifty"" and adventurous travelers. Laurie Segall, a reporter for CNNMoney.com, recently tested the service and had a mixed experience. For less money than it would cost to stay in a hostel, she rented a charming flat in London. But she encountered a strange host and a flooded kitchen when she rented a loft in Berlin. Still, Segall said she would definitely book through Airbnb again.

"(CNN) -- I count 105 football movies on Wikipedia's ""list of sports films."" There is a 1998 one called ""The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon,"" a title I know nothing about, except that it obviously had no use for commas or hyphens. There is a silent one, 1925's ""The Freshman,"" about a milquetoast whose teammates use him in practice as a tackling dummy. There is a 1976 one called ""Gus,"" about a mule who kicks field goals. (Not a true story, I believe.) The 105th (chronologically) on this list is ""Draft Day,"" a tale of a fictional NFL executive -- he is played by Kevin Costner, king of sports cinema -- that opens Friday at a theater near you. From the trailer I have seen, it looks pretty good. Raising the question: . Has there ever been a GREAT football movie? I mean truly great, not just good. A masterpiece. A film you seriously could rank among your 100 best of all time. All right, all right, all right, as Matthew McConaughey would say, let's take a look at some of those 105 movies on this here list. (""American football"" is the category, which is just to let our CNN friends in Asia, Europe and South America know that you can go look for YOUR favorite football films under the category ""soccer."") OK, for openers, what does and doesn't qualify as a football film? For example, ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012) is not, even though its title sure does sound like one. Football gets talked about a lot, but a football movie, it is not. ""M*A*S*H"" (1970) also is not, even though it ends with a football game. The movie itself had nothing to do with football. ""Horse Feathers"" (1932) ends with a game. It makes the list, if only because Professor Wagstaff (Groucho Marx) wants to know: ""Have we got a college? Have we got a football team? Well, we can't afford both. Tomorrow we start tearing down the college!"" There are two versions of ""The Longest Yard"" (1974 and 2005), two of ""Brian's Song"" (1971 and 2001), two about legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant (1984 and 2002), one of which has Bear played by the somewhat less legendary Gary Busey. There are ""true"" stories about Knute Rockne, Tom Harmon, Frankie Albert, Elroy ""Crazylegs"" Hirsch, Rocky Bleier, Ernie Davis, Ernie Nevers and more, some of which contain scenes that are actually factual. In ""Invincible"" (2006), a bartender (played by Mark Wahlberg) named Vince (as in invincible) gets to play for the Philadelphia Eagles. It really happened. In ""Paper Lion"" (1968), the writer George Plimpton (played by Alan Alda) gets to play for the Detroit Lions. It sort of happened. It was actually in a team scrimmage, not in an NFL exhibition game, as in the film. There is 1993's ""Rudy,"" about a small dude (played by Sean Astin) who gets to play with a Notre Dame team made up mainly of big dudes. There is 1981's ""Grambling's White Tiger,"" in which a white dude (played by master thespian Bruce Jenner) gets to play with a college team made up mainly of black dudes. A couple star Dennis Quaid. A couple star the Rock. I like both these actors, although both would have been badly miscast playing Rudy. A couple star Burt Reynolds, who actually played a little football in school. Sandra Bullock, who probably did not play a lot of football in school, won an Oscar for 2009's ""The Blind Side,"" in which she demonstrates to future NFL star Michael Oher how to throw a block. Nice scene. Totally made up. Oher later wondered ""why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football."" Because that's show biz! Costner's new one, ""Draft Day,"" concerns the NFL's Cleveland Browns, with their general manager maneuvering to acquire the No. 1 pick of the college player draft. The Browns need any help they can get, never having won a Super Bowl. I appreciate that in Costner's career he has played cowboys, lawyers, naval officers, Robin Hood, Eliot Ness and guys obsessed with JFK. I am nevertheless always pleased to find him in a sport-related role. I'd watch him do anything, except maybe fight Rocky or play soccer. Has there ever been a football film classic, you ask? Hmmm, probably not the one with a team coached by John Wayne, nor the one with a team coached by Goldie Hawn. Oh, and probably not ""Against All Odds"" (1984), a remake of the film-noir mystery ""Out of the Past,"" for which instead of a private detective, the main character was changed by some Hollywood genius to -- duh -- a pro football team's injured wide receiver! Ah, but a few keepers do exist. A half-dozen, in no particular order: . -- ""All the Right Moves"" (1983) was a drama about a high school kid, good, not great, played by a young Tom Cruise, who basically finds out that if your coach feels like it, he sure can mess up the rest of your life. -- ""North Dallas Forty"" (1979) was a realistic look, with plenty of farce thrown in, at the behind-the-scenes activities of a pro football team, including a martinet of a coach and a number of players who indulge in very unsportsmanlike conduct. -- ""Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29"" (2008) is a documentary, often as witty as the headline that inspired it. It looks back on a November 23, 1968, football game unforgettable to everybody involved in it, including a Harvard lineman you might have seen in another movie or two, Tommy Lee Jones. -- ""Brian's Song"" (1971), the original, not that lame reboot of 30 years later, deals with teamwork, friendship, rivalry, race relations, terminal illness, you name it. Acted impeccably by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan, this was a fine bromance. -- ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996) has had its cute lines regurgitated for so long -- ""show me the money,"" ""you had me at hello"" -- that its memorable premise is oft forgotten, that being the value of loyalty, to a partner, to a principle, to an employer, to a client. For a romantic comedy, it's actually a pretty fair drama. -- ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004) took a book that offended some of the good folks of Odessa, Texas, exposing the lows as well as the highs of high school ball. In time, many came to accept what a significant story this is, in literature and film, the latter with a letter-perfect script and A-plus cast. Others out there in movie land might prefer the life lessons of 2000's ""Remember the Titans."" Or even a fossilized relic like 1940's ""Knute Rockne, All American,"" in which a dying 25-year-old George Gipp (played by Ronald Reagan) tells his old coach Knute to ""go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper,"" which they do. Me, I'd remake that one. Costner could do a great Knute.","A new football movie, ""Draft Day,"" is opening, starring Kevin Costner .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A month after an attack on Kenya's Westgate Mall claimed at least 67 lives, leaked video footage from inside has sparked anger amid claims that it shows soldiers looting from stores as they hunted for the gunmen. The security camera footage shows Kenyan army soldiers striding through the Nakumatt department store, close to where one victim was shot to death hours earlier. Read more: Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . One soldier, and then another, peels off to pick up objects from displays. It's impossible to see exactly what they take, but the footage -- leaked by police -- has fueled allegations by storekeepers of army looting. Atul Shah, managing director of Nakumatt Holdings, told CNN it was impossible to tell exactly what, if anything, was taken from the store -- which held stock worth more than $16 million -- because it burned in the course of the four-day siege. ""So I cannot say specifically anything was looted,"" he said, ""but from the video I have seen -- yes, I saw some soldiers coming out with shopping bags. What was inside, what was there -- no, I cannot say."" The video may be inconclusive, but it still has Shah asking questions. Source: Store in besieged Kenyan mall run by attackers or associates . One piece of footage in particular shows a soldier entering a money exchange booth where Shah said cash is usually kept. He can be seen rummaging around inside and, as he leaves, he appears to put something in his pocket, though it's not clear what that is. Shah also told CNN that a couple of cash registers that had survived the fire were found to have been forced open. No money remained inside. So far, he said, the army has told him nothing of what happened in his store. ""Let's hope allegations of looting and all that is not true, but if it is true ... we have a lot to think about our security forces,"" said Shah. 'Great care and attention' As Kenya seeks to recover from an attack that shook the nation, the claims of looting have tinged the sadness many feel with anger. More than a week before the security video was released, Kenya's Ministry of Defense issued a statement about the allegations. It said that securing the mall was an operation undertaken with other forces and that the army has a history of outstanding performance in operations inside and outside Kenya. Kenya mall attackers prayed, talked on cell phone between shootings . The army soldiers took ""great care and attention,"" as is necessary in a delicate hostage situation, it said. Some of their own were also killed in the attack. ""However, information is rife in the public domain that some of the (Kenya Defense Forces) soldiers behaved unprofessionally during the operation,"" the statement said. The ministry ""is committed to get to the bottom of this,"" it said, and urged members of the public to come forward with information and evidence. 'Unfortunate incident' Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto acknowledged public anger over the alleged looting in a CNN interview. ""I must admit that it's an unfortunate incident and the president has launched an inquiry to find out exactly what happened,"" he said. ""That inquiry is under way, and we will take corrective measures to ensure that anybody and every person who participated in this mall incident, that may have overstepped their mandate, will be brought to book."" Bergen: Al-Shabaab backed by money from U.S. It will not be possible to say whether anyone is still missing at Westgate Mall until a forensic examination of the rubble is completed, he said. ""That is when we will determine whether there are extra bodies or not,"" he said. Ruto, who is on trial in the Netherlands, accused of masterminding violence after Kenya's disputed election in 2007, also said he was confident the claims against him would be shown to be ""mere fabricated allegations."" Ruto and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is on trial alongside his deputy, have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed election. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Nairobi and Zain Verjee from London, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Video footage from inside Westgate Mall appears to show soldiers taking items from a store .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's phone hacking trial got a shot of Hollywood glamor Friday, as actress Sienna Miller was quizzed on the stand about her relationships with movie stars Daniel Craig and Jude Law. The trial has been focusing this week on the claim that she had an affair with Craig, which was exposed by a tabloid journalist hacking the James Bond actor's voice mail. The journalist, confessed phone hacker Dan Evans, testified that Miller left Craig a voice mail telling him she loved him while she was out at a swanky London club with her then-boyfriend Jude Law. ""Hi, it's me, I can't speak, I'm at the Groucho (club) with Jude. I love you,"" the voice mail said, according to Evans, who is testifying for the prosecution. Miller testified that it was the kind of message she might have left for Craig, but that it has been misconstrued by the media and the public. ""For a long period of time, he was one of my closest friends,"" she said of Craig. ""That's how I ended all my calls to my friends."" She said she had never had a ""relationship,"" with Craig, adding: ""It was a brief encounter."" Lawyer to actress: I love you . The private lives of the Hollywood stars are being exposed as part of a long-running trial into phone hacking by British tabloid journalists. A key defendant, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, became a top spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron after leaving the paper over a hacking scandal. Coulson's defense lawyer, Timothy Langdale, accidentally set up the funniest moment in the week's testimony when cross-examining Miller about the ""I love you"" voice mail. He was reading it to Miller, who testified by video link from New Orleans, when the two began talking over each other because of a delay on the line. Langdale stopped and asked Miller to go ahead. ""No, you just told me you loved me and I interrupted you,"" Miller replied, drawing laughter from everyone in court. Langdale has spent most of the week trying to punch holes in Evans' testimony, and drew out that Miller had not been in London the night she is supposed to have left the voice mail from the Groucho club. Under his cross-examination, Miller said she recognized that a journalist might find the voice mail ""titillating."" ""I think if journalists got their hands on that piece of information, they would find it titillating and it might be the basis for a story,"" she said. ""People would have thought that was a pretty exciting message to hear -- people who didn't know my nature and know that's how I communicated with people."" From paper to politics . Coulson resigned as editor of News of the World in 2007 after a journalist working for him pleaded guilty to conspiring to hack phones. He said he did not know the journalist had been doing it, but he accepted responsibility as editor of the paper and quit, and then went to work for Cameron. Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010. Coulson resigned as his spokesman in 2011 when the phone hacking scandal exploded for the second time. Coulson and the other six defendants deny the charges against them, which include conspiracy to intercept messages and related crimes. Evans, a last-minute prosecution witness, insisted Tuesday that he played the hacked Sienna Miller voice mail for Coulson in 2005. Coulson, Evans said, shouted, ""Brilliant."" The editor went on to instruct Evans to cover up the fact that Evans had obtained the voice mail illegally, Evans testified. He told Evans to make a copy of the message, put the copy in a Jiffy bag and send it to the front gate of the newspaper offices to make it appear as if it had been dropped off as an anonymous tip. News of the World ran a front-page story about the alleged affair on October 9, 2005. 'Even the office cat' knew . On Thursday, Coulson's lawyer Langdale said that Coulson was not even in London on the date Evans claimed to have played him the voice mail, according to British media reports. Evans has steadfastly insisted that Coulson knew that journalists at the paper were illegally intercepting voice mail, and that Evans was hired partly for his ability to do so. The former News of the World reporter has said that everyone at the newspaper, ""even the office cat,"" knew he was hacking phones, and that Coulson certainly did. On Tuesday, he rattled off a list of 10 names of colleagues who he said knew it, including Coulson. Langdale has pushed Evans to admit that he negotiated hard to get immunity from prosecution after he was arrested for hacking phones. Evans conceded that prosecutors had said he would not only have to admit his own guilt, but incriminate others in order to get immunity. In the end, prosecutors did not offer him the full immunity he sought, he said. Evans has also admitted to alcohol and drug abuse, but said he is clean now. The trial has touched the highest levels of British politics, media and society. In addition to the link between Coulson and the British Prime Minister, the case has put pressure on global media baron Rupert Murdoch, who owned the News of the World until he shut it down over the hacking revelations. Rebekah Brooks, a friend of Cameron and a protege of Murdoch, was editor of News of the World before Coulson, and went on to become head of Murdoch's British newspaper publishing company before resigning over the hacking scandal. She is a defendant alongside Coulson, and also denies all the charges against her.","NEW: Miller says she had never had a ""relationship,"" with Craig; ""It was a brief encounter""

"(CNN) -- Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair -- once one of the U.S. Army's top commanders in Afghanistan -- pleaded guilty Thursday to several charges related to sexual relationships with female troops, but not the most serious one against him. According to the public affairs office for Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, Sinclair pleaded guilty to committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and obstruction of justice. Col. James L. Pohl, the judge overseeing his court martial, accepted these pleas after being convinced they were factual and made voluntarily. The government's lawyers dropped two counts -- one of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and the other for cruelty and maltreatment. Sinclair still stands accused of ""sodomy ... by force and without the consent"" of his alleged victim, an Army captain. Charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government, according to Fort Bragg. The brigadier general pleaded not guilty to those charges Thursday. His court martial is expected to resume Friday morning with opening statements and the prosecution presenting its case, according to the Fort Bragg press office. Army general faces sexual conduct, other charges . His defense lawyer, Richard Scheff, expressed confidence in his client's prospects in comments to CNN affiliate WTVD. He said that the case now boils down to the brigadier general's story against that of his main accuser, suggesting that what she wrote in a diary differs markedly from the allegations against Sinclair. ""Where this case is rests on the accuser's word, which is worth nothing,"" said Scheff. Once the deputy commander of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, Sinclair was moved to the North Carolina post from Afghanistan in 2012, the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged. Prosecutors said he broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved, who had lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012, overseas in Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg and Fort Hood, Texas. The charge sheet claims Sinclair had pornographic images and videos, misled investigators and defrauded the government ""by wrongfully using his government travel charge for personal purposes."" In comments Thursday, Scheff said that his client ""has consistently admitted his shortcomings and taken responsibility for them.""

"(CNN) -- Life was good for Kenny Sparks. A handsome man with a big smile, he was well-known in his town of Little Compton, Rhode Island. He had a loving wife, two beautiful, college-age children and was the co-owner of a multimillion-dollar contracting business. At 49 he had it all. But then he began to change. At first the family thought Kenny had Alzheimer's disease; he had all the signs. But they got a diagnosis that turned out to be more devastating. Kenny has a condition known as frontotemporal dementia, or FTD. When doctors told Kenny's wife, Cheryl, she was relieved. ""I was thankful it wasn't Alzheimer's,"" she said. ""Clearly, what did I know?"" She noticed the first changes more than four years ago. ""He was stumbling over words,"" she said. ""And he would forget what he was saying -- but at almost 50, I think we all tend to do that."" Kenny's personality wasn't the same, either. He grew distant, more agitated. Cheryl thought it was stress, that the pressure of work was getting to him. But as the months went by, his condition got worse. He was put on medication for depression. Although it helped, Cheryl said, ""He just wasn't Kenny."" His children also noticed the change. During a family trip to France, he hardly spoke. His son, Graham, knew this wasn't his dad. ""He'd tell stupid jokes all the time,"" said Graham. ""And on this trip, he wasn't telling jokes. He was sitting there with a blank stare on his face."" His daughter, Alexandra, noticed that Kenny didn't care about his health any longer. ""He exercised all the time. He would swim constantly and he ate well,"" she said. ""And all of a sudden he was downing gallons of ice cream. Gallons!"" Watch more of the Sparks' family odyssey . But it was his inability to communicate that finally pushed Cheryl into action. ""We were working on a project ... and he turned to me and asked me, can you give me that screwdriver with the little cross on top,"" she recalled. ""And then I knew: This was a man who built his house from the ground up and he couldn't ask for a Phillips screwdriver?"" Cheryl got Kenny to the doctor. During the course of numerous cognitive tests, Cheryl learned details about her husband that were shocking. ""He couldn't draw a clock and put the numbers or hands on it,"" she said. Doctors told her, FTD would rob Kenny of his personality, his speech and eventually his life. ""They told me, 'If you are going to travel or do anything with your husband, you'd better do it in the next few years,'"" she said. ""And that's when I fell apart."" Frontotemporal dementia is an umbrella term for a group of degenerative disorders that damage the cells in the temporal and/or frontal lobes of the brain. Doctors believe certain proteins in the brain attack the cells. They don't know why. The disease is typically diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s, but can strike people in their 40s or younger. It affects areas of the brain responsible for reasoning, communication, social awareness and memory, causing changes in personality and judgment. Although its symptoms can vary depending on the parts of the brain affected, FTD eventually leaves a patient in a state of confusion and helplessness. It also leaves affected families feeling helpless. ""Many patients will lose their inhibitions; they'll act totally inappropriately, leaving their families to wonder what is wrong,"" said Dr. Murray Grossman, a neurologist with the University of Pennsylvania. ""Some patients will have no problem spending the family fortune, taking all their money and putting it into scams, get-rich-quick schemes, or going off and buying an expensive car or boat the family doesn't need. The patients lose their reasoning."" ""What's particularly frustrating for family members is, the patients don't seem to have much insight into the difficulties they are having or causing for others,"" Grossman said. FTD affects approximately 250,000 Americans -- about 10 percent to 20 percent of all dementia cases -- and misdiagnosis is common, according to the Association for Frontotemporal Dementias. ""There's a great lack of awareness among physicians. So on the journey to diagnosis many of our families take five or six years [before they find out], and they go through a series of misdiagnoses,"" said Susan Dickinson, director of the association. Grossman said misdiagnoses can cause trouble. ""Many patients take on symptoms of a stroke and, of course, Alzheimer's or even severe depression and are misdiagnosed, which can be dangerous because many of the medications used for these conditions can make FTD worse,"" said Grossman. ""So correct diagnosis is critical."" ""And when they do get the news, it's very difficult,"" said Dickinson. ""They are told, 'Your loved one has FTD. It's a neurological degenerative disease. It's fatal, and there is no cure. Now go home and deal with it.'"" And that's what Dickinson wants to change. The association is trying to get the word out by offering resources for physicians and information on support groups for families through its organization and on its Web site. Dickinson says 40 support groups have been formed so far, ""most of them started by families and volunteers."" ""Because many of our patients are diagnosed in the prime of their lives, families are faced with financial problems. Where do they go for help? How can they better deal with this disease?"" said Dickinson. ""That's what we are here for: to help them find resources and ways of coping."" The association also wants to raise money for more research. Although at this point there are few treatments and no cure, Dr. Grossman says there is hope. ""The good news is that as we learn more about the condition we are developing treatments that are specific, that we hope can change the natural history of the condition,"" he said. ""So there are medications in development that go after the proteins that accumulate in the brain cells that cause this condition."" In the four years since his FTD was diagnosed, Kenny has taken trips with his family. Until recently he was able to ride a bike and get around, although he can't drive a car. He has become progressively more dependent on Cheryl, who quit her job to be with him 24/7. ""His need to be with me is constant, because he feels safe,"" she said. Although Kenny goes with a caretaker several times a week to give Cheryl a break, keeping up with him can be exhausting. ""He can't read a clock. So he'll get up at 3 a.m., and that's when we start our day,"" said Cheryl. Right after the diagnosis he had good days and bad days, Cheryl said. ""And when he had bad days, they were very bad."" she said. ""Now, he's more like a child, most times."" When Kenny's children visit, it can be hard for them to see him slip away. ""When he has his bad days and he lashes out it makes it hurt more, and that's when you have to blame the disease,"" said daughter Alexandra. Son Graham agreed. ""You've got to understand your dad is actually gone, and it's the disease."" Cheryl looks at it differently. ""Our doctor says if we don't take this on with a sense of humor our family will be destroyed,"" she said. ""In so many ways we've been blessed. So we've got to keep going with a good heart."" ""A lot of our friends and family don't understand this illness. But we do,"" she said indicating her children. ""And we have to deal with it."" ""There is no one hardest part,"" Cheryl said. ""Well, for me, knowing that the man I thought I was going to grow old with -- I'm not, I guess."" Cheryl stopped, and with tears in her eyes, realized, ""Yes, that's the hardest part.""","Frontotemporal dementia affects part of brain responsible for personality, memory, reasoning .

"(CNN) -- It is the case that seems to have no end. U.S. student Amanda Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are waiting -- once again -- for a verdict from an Italian court. Knox has been back home in Seattle ever since an appeal court acquitted her and Sollecito in 2011 of the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher. The 21-year old was found partially naked in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Knox in the picturesque town of Perugia, where both women were exchange students. Knox says she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. ""I will become ... a fugitive,"" she told Italian daily La Repubblica this month, when asked what she would do if she was found guilty. Italy's Supreme Court in March overturned the pair's acquittals, saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. The case was sent to a retrial in Florence, where a verdict is expected Thursday. Sollecito made it to the tribunal. Dressed in a purple jumper, sunglasses nestled on his collar, he waited for the start of a session that was going to be beamed around the world. Ruling unclear . The retrial began last September, refocusing international attention on the case that grabbed headlines in Italy, Britain and the United States -- but neither Knox or Sollecito were present in court. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini has said both Knox and Sollecito should be convicted and handed a 26-year sentence for homicide, with an additional four years for Knox for slander. Both have maintained their innocence. With little change in the case details over the years, it is not clear how presiding judge Alessandro Nencini will rule. Regardless of the decision... both sides will have the opportunity to appeal that verdict to Italy's Supreme Court. That process could take months. If Knox is ultimately found guilty, Italy could request her extradition from the United States . 'Fugitive' Knox, 26, and Sollecito, 29, were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, who was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat. Knox has always denied murdering Kercher and again maintained her innocence in a written statement to the Florence court. ""I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,"" Knox said a lengthy e-mail, which was presented by her lawyer. Sollecito was in the Dominican Republic at the start of the retrial but returned to Italy. In November he took to the stand to make a spontaneous declaration, saying the charges against him were ""absurd."" ""For me, it's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination,"" he said of what he's been through. 'No one remembers Meredith' A lawyer for the Kercher family said the victim's brother and sister, Lyle and Stephanie, would attend court to hear the decision. The Kercher family welcomed the retrial ruling, their lawyer, Francesco Maresca said in March, adding they believed the ruling that acquitted Knox and Sollecito was ""superficial and unbalanced."" The Kercher family believes more than one person was in the room when Kercher was killed, he said. ""No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,"" Maresca told the court in closing remarks last month. Ferguson advocates for Knox . One person who has been advocating for Knox is Ryan Ferguson -- the Missouri man who walked free last November after being imprisoned for nearly a decade for murdering a newspaper editor. A state appeals court overturned his conviction. ""We kind of had this connection in the sense that we've been through this justice system ... It's relatively the same. We've been through this, and there's not a whole lot of people"" who've had the same experience, he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""So it's cool and we can kind of just talk to each other. She wanted to reach out and say if you need to talk to anybody, if you need any help, I'm here for you. If not, I completely understand. So that's how we began communicating."" Asked about Knox' current state of mind, he said she's staying positive. ""She seems to be doing very well. I'm impressed with her. It's so daunting at this time,"" he said. ""Within 48 hours she should know her fate. You can't start living life until they actually clear you and until you're free essentially. So I'm amazed how she's doing. She's working hard on school and continuing life the best she can. She believes the courts are going to do the right thing based on the facts. I agree.""

"(EW.com) -- The thing I find most surprising about Pompeii is that there aren't two rival Pompeii movies. The Paul W.S. Anderson movie has the look and feel of Deep Impact/Armageddon and Volcano/Dante's Peak (though, believe it or not, Roman Polanski was once attached to direct). Alas, Pompeii has the field to itself, a big-budget 3-D disaster epic that lands smack in the box-office dead zone of February. It's just crazy enough to work! Game of Thrones' Kit Harington plays Milo, a Roman slave-turned-gladiator who catches the eye of an upper-class beauty (Emily Browning) who in turn is promised to the corrupt Roman politician (Kiefer Sutherland) who butchered his family. Conflict! Harrington sculpted his body to look the part of a gladiator, but EW's Owen Gleiberman thinks Russell Crowe's Maximus from Gladiator isn't in danger of being surpassed anytime soon, writing, ""Harington knows how to handle a broadsword, but mostly he comes off as the British Taylor Kitsch, a glorified fashion model striking Blue Steel poses that smolder, boringly."" There also happens to be the looming destruction bubbling up from Mount Vesuvius, the Italian volcano that annihilated Pompeii in 79 A.D. The critics are mixed on whether the volcano is the film's villain or hero. Read below to see what they're saying about Pompeii before heading to the theaters this weekend. Owen Gleiberman (Entertainment Weekly) ▼ . ""The volcano spews an endless shower of fiery asteroids trailed by smoky plumes — an apocalyptic fireworks show that takes down the city. ... Bodies get frozen into sculptures of ash that will last forever. It's supposed to make this love story timeless, but by the end of Pompeii, you'll be grateful that the movie only lasts 104 minutes."" Peter Debruge (Variety) ""Taking a page from Titanic, the film invents a rich-girl/poor-boy romance, puts a powerful suitor in their way and then besets their star-crossed love story with CG lava showers, rendered all the more spectacular in stereoscopic 3-D. In short, Pompeii is a blast, at least by guilty-pleasure standards..."" Mick LaSalle (San Francisco Chronicle) ▼ . ""As for the fact that there's no reason to care whom the fireballs hit, or who gets covered in lava, or whose house caves, or whose ship blows up -- well, that's unfortunate. Although, if you think of Pompeii as a ride, a conveyance for special effects, and not anything resembling an emotional experience, indifference can almost be a good thing."" Jordan Mintzer (Hollywood Reporter) ▼ . ""The lava flows by the ton, as does the cheese, in Pompeii, a kitschy apocalyptic peplum whose visual epiphanies — of which there are definitely a few — cannot outdo a B- (or C- or D-) grade scenario that will have lots of eyes rolling by the time the big stack finally blows."" Claudia Puig (USA Today) ""Besides Gladiator and Titanic, the film borrows from 300, Troy, Spartacus, Clash of the Titans, and even The Princess Bride. The result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one-dimensional characters."" Gary Goldstein (Los Angeles Times) ""Sure, it's not the brainiest of outings, but director Paul W.S. Anderson (the man behind four of the Resident Evil films) keeps the action apace and the lava a-flowing with workmanlike energy and sufficient visual dazzle."" Miriam Bale (New York Times) ""Anderson displays his mastery as a director in the sword-fighting scenes. The camera glides and tilts in exact counterpoint to the thrusts of the knives, as if a bloody ballet. These scenes recall the elegance and deftness of great car chases from films like Bullitt."" Liam Lacey (Toronto Globe and Mail) ""No doubt the audiences in the Coliseum would offer a thumbs-up to the scale of the destruction, though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects, which, too often, resemble a very large pile of melting crayons."" Rene Rodriguez (Miami Herald) ""The dialogue is often pleasantly leaden (""I've never seen you look at any man the way you looked at that slave!"" one of Cassia's friends says as she ogles the buff Milo), but the sound effects are way cool, and the 3-D is spectacular, with glowing ashes that seem to float off the screen and onto your lap."" Stephanie Merry (Washington Post) ▼ . ""Harington's star is on the rise. ... Yet his first starring role doesn't showcase what he can do from an acting standpoint. Harington transformed his body for the role, but here's the real disaster: His startlingly defined six-pack abs are the most memorable part of his character."" Wesley Morris (Grantland) ▼ . ""Browning often looks like a woman on the brink of an orgasm. It's as if she's trying to out-act the volcano. The eruption starts early and lasts most of the movie. (It's tantric that way.)""

"(CNN) -- While President Barack Obama has made promoting rights for gays and lesbians worldwide a key foreign policy goal, that is little comfort to Ali Asseri, a former Saudi diplomat who is gay. Asseri is fighting a years-long battle for asylum in the United States, convinced his life will be in danger if he is forced to return home. The case presents a dilemma for the Obama administration as the President travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Abdullah amid a time of strained relations between the close allies. Saudi Arabia's radical form of Islam mandates the death penalty for same-sex relations. ""I come from the darkest place on earth,"" Asseri said in a phone interview from his home in West Hollywood. ""We are brainwashed that we have the best system and sharia law comes from god. But they teach us to hate others. I came to America to clear my mind."" Asseri grew up in a middle class conservative Saudi family, the middle child with three brothers and three sisters. His parents had little education and raised him and his brothers and sisters true to Saudi culture and religion. There was no music or TV. He didn't know for years that he was gay. By age 13, he realized he was different than other boys his age, he just had no idea what that difference was. ""We don't have any education about sex. You don't know what gay means. You just know that you have feelings. You can't talk about it with anyone. According to the Koran they are a sin. I thought it would just go away. I just had feelings but you can't talk about it with any person."" As a law student, he considered a career as an attorney and took a job as a clerk for a judge in the Saudi court. After a few months, he quit. In a petition seeking asylum to the United States obtained by CNN, he wrote that ""unfair bias"" in the treatment of cases in Saudi Arabia made it ""morally impossible for me to continue."" ""I was frequently upset and saddened by the system in general and the punishments given to the accused,"" he wrote. Investigates sexuality . For another year he worked as a trainee in the Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution, where he would check on the prisoners to see whether they were receiving proper treatment. He was forced by his managers to witness prisoners being lashed, which gave him bad dreams. He quit his job once again, frustrated with the harsh punishments and his inability to do anything to stop them. At that time he started to investigate his faith, religion and sexuality. ""Without these jobs I wouldn't be the same person now,"" he said. ""I began to understand something isn't right about the way we practice religion. Something didn't feel good. I said to myself the only way you can have freedom is to be a diplomat and travel out of the country."" He joined the Foreign Ministry as a diplomat and got married to a Saudi woman, all the time hiding his feelings and dreaming of the day he could leave the country and live his life as an openly gay man. When his wife gave birth to his son, Fahad, Asseri tried one last time to give his arrangement a chance. But he found he could not keep up the charade and they divorced in 2004. Asseri was transferred to the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles the next year. A double life . Here, he writes in his asylum petition, ""I discovered the gay community, the gay culture and that I was in fact gay."" For four years he led a double life. By day, he was a traditional diplomat. By night, he visited gay bars and told friends he was from Italy or any other country than his own. Asseri's two worlds collided in 2009 when he fell in love and moved into a West Hollywood apartment with his boyfriend. Finding happiness for the first time, he enjoyed an open social life in West Hollywood with his new friends. Soon his colleagues began to ask him about his life outside of work and started following him. When his passport expired and he submitted it for renewal, he received no reply. After several months, his office told him his time in the United States was up and he would have to return to Saudi Arabia. He began to fear he was found out. He called a friend in the foreign ministry in Riyadh, who told him indeed the Consul General sent a letter to the ministry stating he was gay and had information about his lifestyle. ""This is when I became really scared and paranoid,"" he writes in his asylum petition. ""I was so scared they would do something to me physically. I was even afraid to go to my car thinking there could be a bomb in it. When I came home I had to check every closet."" He sent a letter to various news organizations saying he was being harassed by colleagues and he feared for his life. Fearing persecution . He applied for asylum as a gay person who would face persecution if sent home. In more than eight hours of questioning, immigration officers focused on his jobs in the Saudi courts and Bureau of investigation. His bid for asylum was no common occurrence. The last Saudi diplomat to seek asylum was in 1994, when Mohammed al-Khilewi, then first secretary for the Saudi mission to the United Nations, was granted asylum for publicly criticizing his country's human rights record and alleged support for terrorism. Fourteen months later in October 2011, the Department of Homeland Security denied Asseri's application. In the rejection letter, obtained by CNN, the government says ""evidence indicates that you ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion."" The case went to automatic appeal. ""They interviewed him once and it took 14 months and it showed they were going for denial,"" says Ali Ahmed, a Saudi dissident and activist that has been helping Asseri with his case. ""They used the reason that he worked for the courts to call him a human rights violator which is really bogus."" Obama on gay rights . Two months later, Obama signed a Memorandum on International Initiatives to Advance the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. It included a program to protect gay refugees and asylum seekers, including ""ensuring the federal government has the ability to identify and expedite resettlement of highly vulnerable persons with urgent protection needs."" In the memo, Obama writes that the fight to end discrimination against LGBT people is ""a global challenge"" and ""central to the United States' commitment to promoting human rights."" ""I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting LGBT persons around the world â€” whether it is passing laws that criminalize LGBT status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful LGBT pride celebrations, or killing men, women, and children for their perceived sexual orientation,"" Obama said. In its most recent human rights report, the State Department said under sharia law in the Saudi Arabia, ""consensual same-sex conduct is punishable by death or flogging."" Ongoing case . It wasn't until this past February that Asseri was finally granted a hearing date for his appeal. At the court, the immigration officer offered him a deal to remain in the country permanently without possibility of asylum or a green card. Additionally, he could never leave the country. When he rejected the offer, the immigration officer applied for another continuance, saying she needed to submit more documents in the two-year case. He is now looking at a new hearing date in 2015. Today, Asseri barely makes ends meet as a part-time security guard. He lives on couches at friends' apartments in West Hollywood. His family has shunned him and his ex-wife won't allow him to talk to his son. As unbearable as his life in limbo is, he says returning to Saudi Arabia would be a death sentence. ""There is no question,"" he says. ""If you go back and say I am gay and proud and I don't believe in religion anymore. Under sharia law this is death. You will be happy if they kill you right away. "" Ahmed, the Saudi activist, says Asseri is a victim of U.S. desires not to upset the Saudi monarchy. Asseri had been convinced that Obama's stated commitment to gay rights would trump politics and keep him safe in the United States. ""When President Obama ran in 2008 I supported him. I cried for him, I encouraged my American friends to vote for him. Now I can't stand to watch him on TV,"" he says. ""I'm angry. He said he supports the rights of gay people, so why is this happening to me?"" The Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles did not return phone calls. The Department of Homeland Security declined comment, saying asylum cases were confidential.","Former Saudi diplomat fighting battle for asylum in the United States, fears return home .

"(CNN) -- Word on the cobblestone street is Istria is the ""new Tuscany."" I disagree. The landscape of this northern part of Croatia is less cultivated. It's less wealthy. And, last I checked, the Renaissance didn't happen here. Plus, ""Istria"" is still a little-known proper noun and ""Tuscany"" has moved into adjective territory. Show me an American suburb and I'll show you a ""Tuscan"" kitchen, if not an entire foreclosed development named ""Tuscan Hills."" Earlier this year when Olive Garden -- the strip mall home of endless breadsticks -- wanted to make itself more appealing, it announced it was making over its restaurants in the style of Tuscan farmhouses. Now, I don't know if they serve shark in Tuscany, but the region has certainly jumped it. That's not going to happen to Istria anytime soon. No, it will continue to hide in plain sight. Right in the middle of Europe. A small peninsula the shape of a crudely drawn heart tucked behind the boot of Italy. Capped by the Alps, bottom dangling in the cartoon blue of the Adriatic sea. Eventually the tour buses and cookbook authors will arrive en masse, but for now the region is so sparsely populated that sometimes with its raw grandeur and new highways it can feel like an imaginary world in a video game where you build your own civilization. Turns out civilization has existed in Istria since at least the Bronze Age, when people lived in ""gradines,"" fortified castles built on the tops of hills. Houses and walls from that time are still visible as are the many structures left behind by all those who have ruled this region: The Illyrians, the Romans, the Venetians, the Austro-Hungarians. You name them, and they probably killed people and built churches here. The Italians controlled the area until 1947 when it was ceded to then-Yugoslavia after the World War II. Now it is part of Croatia. For the modern invader, Istria comes in two flavors: coastal paradise and rustic hilltop hamlet. Because the region is only about 50 miles wide and 60 miles north to south you can have both in the same day. The coast is necklaced with tourist towns and fishing villages. From glamorous Opatija, a 19th century playground for Austro-Hungarian nobility, to Pula, a gritty port town with an ace up its sleeve: a stunning Roman amphitheater built between 27 B.C. and 68 A.D. (Once used for gladiator fights, the arena is still used for, depending on your point of view, less menacing entertainment from the likes of Norah Jones and Sting.) But the most beautiful coastal town in Istria, and possibly all of Croatia, is Rovinj. A perennial contender for the best-place-to-watch-a-sunset, Rovinj is a stunner of pastel homes, polished stones and blue water. The town flag could very well be one of the bathing suits or dish towels that charmingly flap along the laundry lines strung throughout this picturesque but lived-in little peninsula off a peninsula. Rovinj feels very Italian (it has been described as ""a bit of Venice spilled on a hill"") right down to the fashionably dressed women accompanied by tidy men in leather loafers and colorful sweaters hugging their necks. The town's narrow alleyways and courtyards house several great restaurants and numerous places to have a drink while the sun disappears. Day and night it's the ideal venue to run the Croatian triathlon: swim, eat and lounge at a cafe. But that's not my favorite part of Istria. And it's not the part that people are thinking of when they label this area the ""new Tuscany."" They are referring to the heart of the heart-shaped peninsula. The verdant interior filled with surprises like mistletoe brandy, hilltop hamlets and Hum, the smallest town in the world. Although the air is perfumed by the nearby sea, inland Istria is a world away from the coast's busy beaches and ice cream stands. Take any exit off the highway and you'll find one tiny village after another, each with its own shambolic charm and unique architectural legacy. Ever since the Romans ripped out cypresses and replaced them with olive groves, this area has been renowned for its cuisine. Pliny the Elder called Istrian olive oil the second best in the world (after Italian olive oil, of course) and contemporary foodies geek out over the area's distinguished grape varietals and artisanal hams and cheeses. Istria's forests are filled with game, but the most hunted creature in the region is the truffle -- a noble fungus immune to cultivation that fetches up to $2,000 a pound. They come in black and white (the latter is more prized) and they come on top of steak, shaved on pasta, drowned in olive oil and blended with rice. A well-prepared local lunch here rivals any meal in Europe. Recently I was enjoying one of those meals in the mesmerizing town of Groznjan, a medieval hamlet on a hill that's home to 30 galleries and a summer jazz school that bestows an intermittent bebop soundtrack to the ancient landscape. As I sat in the shaded stone courtyard taking in the soft breeze and lazily scraping up the last bits of lunch from my plate, it occurred to me that this must have been what Tuscany was like before the Hollywood movies, the cookbooks and the hordes of tourists: Tuscany when it was still under-the-radar and affordable. Before the Olive Garden had ever laid eyes on it. ""No, Istria is not the new Tuscany,"" I thought. ""It's the old Tuscany.""","Croatia's Istrian peninsula inspires comparisons with Italy's Tuscany region .
While there are similarities, this pocket of Croatia hasn't suffered a tourism crush .
Its villages are less cultivated, less wealthy and delightfully unspoiled ."
"Islamabad (CNN) -- A Special Court in Pakistan has charged former military ruler Pervez Musharraf with high treason -- a crime that carries the death penalty or life imprisonment. Musharraf, who ruled the country following a 1999 coup until 2008, faced a total of five charges during the hearing at the court in Islamabad Monday, including three counts of subverting, suspending and changing the country's constitution, sacking Pakistan's chief justice and imposing emergency rule. He pleaded ""not guilty"" to each of the charges. In an address to the court, the former president denied he was a traitor, and instead claimed Pakistan ""prospered and grew"" under his tenure. Monday's hearing took place amid tight security, with thousands of police and security forces lining the route to the court. In an unexpected twist, the retired army general was represented by a new lawyer, with no reason yet given for the change. Web of court cases . Musharraf went into self-imposed exile in 2008, in London and more recently in Dubai, after standing down as president. He returned to Pakistan last year with the aim of running in the country's national elections. But his plans unraveled as he became entangled in a web of court cases relating to his time in power. In 2007, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamist extremism. The action drew sharp criticism from the United States and democracy advocates. Pakistanis openly called for his removal. Under pressure from the West, Musharraf later lifted the state of emergency and called elections in which his party fared badly. Musharraf stepped down in August 2008 after the governing coalition began taking steps to impeach him. Prosecutors say Musharraf violated Pakistan's constitution by imposing the state of emergency. In January, Musharraf was unable to attend another court hearing after being hospitalized. Asiya Ishaq, a supporter and leader of the All Pakistan Muslim League, said the former president had been feeling pressure in his chest and was not well. Pakistan media has reported he has been receiving treatment for high blood pressure. Musharraf is also on an ""exit control list"" in Pakistan, which prevents him leaving the country, although Akram Shaikh, the prosecutor in the case, said Monday that if the court allows the 70-year old to travel abroad then he has no objection. Pakistan media has reported that Musharraf's mother is currently in critical condition in a hospital in the UAE, and that he has requested permission to visit her.","Pervez Musharraf faces five treason charges, including imposing emergency rule in 2007 .

"Columbia, Missouri (CNN) -- She went to the University of Missouri to fulfill her childhood dream of becoming a competitive swimmer. Sasha Menu Courey made the team there, on scholarship, in 2009. But the following year, something happened that changed the course of her promising college career -- something her parents didn't learn about until after she died. ""People were telling us that she had been raped and she wrote it in her journal,"" said Lynn Courey, Courey's mother. Courey committed suicide in 2011. In light of a 16-month investigation by ESPN's ""Outside the Lines"" program, new questions are being raised about what the university knew about the alleged assault, and when officials knew it. The president of the university sent a letter to school officials late Sunday, saying that he is asking to hire independent counsel to conduct an investigation of the school's handing of the case. The investigation has now also been referred to the Columbia Police Department from the University of Missouri Police Department. ""Our detectives will do the best they can with the investigation. It was not reported to us until now and we are almost four years behind,"" Sgt. Joe Bernhard, a Columbia police spokesman, told CNN. ""We can make a difference for others"" According to the ESPN report, in February 2010, after a night out drinking with friends, Courey said she went home with a former university football player -- off-campus -- and had consensual sex. Months later, she told a rape crisis counselor and wrote in her journal that after the former football player left, another football player entered the room, locked the door and raped her. Courey's parents say their daughter also talked about the alleged assault with a campus nurse and a campus doctor, 11 months after the attack. The school never launched an investigation. School officials say they weren't told about the suspected attack by either the nurse or the doctor because of a policy of not reporting sexual assaults without a victim's consent. Courey's parents say their daughter had a long history of depression, and in the months after the alleged rape, she grew more and more despondent. In 2011, Courey took her own life. ""We lost our daughter and we cannot bring her back, but we can make a difference for others,"" her mother said. ""The University did the right thing"" School officials say they later discovered and turned over to Courey's parents a transcript of Courey's conversation with the rape counselor. They also sent her parents a letter asking if they wanted the matter investigated. Officials say they got no response. Courey's father, Mike Menu, said, ""We did not feel supported in this letter. This letter was a check-the-boxes letter and, really to be honest, it did not deserve a response."" In its defense, the university is raising the issue of privacy. ""Victims of sexual assault need to know that they can seek medical care without the concern that reports will be made to police or campus officials without their consent. Otherwise some victims will be deterred from seeking medical care,"" it said in a statement. ""We continue to believe that the University did the right thing in trying to be respectful of Sasha's parents and determine their wishes. We think it is strange and inappropriate for the University to be criticized for not undertaking an investigation when Sasha's parents chose not to respond to our request for their input. If they wanted an investigation, they simply could have responded or made a report to law enforcement,"" it continued. According to Title IX, a federal law that guarantees college men and women are protected equally on campus, universities are legally required to investigate allegations of rape -- even if the alleged victim is no longer alive. Brett Sokolow, executive director of the Association of Title IX Administrators, said he doesn't get the sense there is any clear evidence of a coverup at this point. However, he added: ""I certainly feel that the university should have been a little more proactive at trying to bring in information and find out more.""

"(CNN) -- Virtually every online service requires users set up an account protected by a password, and the conventional wisdom is that you shouldn't use the same password for multiple accounts. This makes services that help users generate and store strong passwords very appealing. LastPass, one of the most popular password-storing services, announced Wednesday that it may have been hacked. The company is now asking many of its users to change what its marketing has been touting as ""the last password you'll ever need."" LastPass, which manages passwords and reproduces users' personal info for online forms by integrating with their computer or mobile Web browser, doesn't know for certain whether its database of master passwords for user accounts was compromised. The company noticed some anomalies in data traffic to and from its servers that it couldn't explain. But one possible explanation was a data breach. ""We're going to be paranoid and assume the worst: that the data we stored in the database was somehow accessed,"" wrote CEO Joe Siegrist. Not all LastPass users are equally at risk. According to the company: ""If you have a strong, nondictionary-based password or pass phrase, this shouldn't impact you. The potential threat here is brute-forcing your master password using dictionary words, then going to LastPass with that password to get your data. Unfortunately not everyone picks a master password that's immune to brute forcing."" Initially, as a security measure, LastPass tried forcing all users to change their master passwords. But this slowed down their system too much. So now they've implemented a system to verify user e-mail addresses. Once you verify your e-mail, most LastPass users can wait a few days to change the master password. What to do: If you use LastPass and your master password was a simple dictionary word, you should verify your e-mail with LastPass and then change to a stronger password sometime in the next few days. Security expert Bruce Schneier offers advice on choosing strong passwords. This LastPass incident indicates the importance of consumer-friendly communications about data security, especially for services that are actively marketed to, and popular with, nontech-savvy consumers. Many consumers are intimidated by online security. They keep hearing they face dire risks online and need to protect themselves -- but doing so on their own seems cumbersome and uncertain. The whole point of using a service like LastPass (or its competitors, such as RoboForm or 1Password) is to make an average person's online experience simpler and safer. The catch is that the field of data security is highly complex and technical. Often, the people who are skilled enough at it to create reliable services that become popular with consumers aren't very good at communicating in ways that consumers understand. This can inadvertently create fear, uncertainty and doubt, which can backfire on data security vendors and consumers alike. For example, Siegert's LastPass blog post announcing the possible breach included passages like this: ""We know roughly the amount of data transferred and that it's big enough to have transferred people's e-mail addresses, the server salt and their salted password hashes from the database. We also know that the amount of data taken isn't remotely enough to have pulled many users' encrypted data blobs."" Similarly, the last line in that post as of this writing (further updates might be possible) instructs users: ""You can access your data via LastPass in offline mode (pull the cable out of the wall, then login) or by downloading LastPass Pocket: https://lastpass.com/misc_download.php (choose your OS).""

"London (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered an investigation of the Muslim Brotherhood over concerns about its alleged links to violent extremism, his Downing Street office said Tuesday. Cameron has commissioned an internal government review of the ""philosophy, activities and impact"" on British national interests at home and abroad and the UK's policy toward the movement. ""The Muslim Brotherhood has risen in prominence in recent years but our understanding of the organization -- its philosophy and values -- has not kept pace with this,"" a Downing Street spokesman said in a written statement. ""Given the concerns now being expressed about the group and its alleged links to violent extremism, it's absolutely right and prudent that we get a better handle of what the Brotherhood stands for, how they intend to achieve their aims and what that means for Britain."" The review will be led by Britain's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Sir John Jenkins. The Brotherhood has long had a presence in London, but there have been reports that a significant number of prominent members have fled to the British capital from Egypt. On its official English Twitter account, the Muslim Brotherhood said it ""welcomes any investigations by the British government into its UK activities, past & present, which are all within the law."" Egypt crackdown . Cairo's military-installed government has declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group. Saudi Arabia has followed suit. The Brotherhood was founded in Egypt in 1928 and, despite years of repression, remains the largest Islamist movement in the Middle East. It returned to prominence during the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011. There has been a crackdown on the movement, and ensuing political turmoil, since the army ousted Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, in July. Egyptian authorities have blamed the Brotherhood for a campaign of violence since. The group insists it remains an entirely peaceful organization, but is accused of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on the police and military. A separate militant group, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been blamed for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It claimed responsibility in January for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo. Morsy and many other senior figures are imprisoned, facing charges that could lead to the death penalty. Mass trials of his supporters, which have already resulted in an unprecedented number of death sentences, have drawn widespread criticism from international human rights groups.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had luck on their side Friday at the Miami Masters. The fans there were less fortunate. The top two in the world will meet in a dream Sunday final -- after both of their semifinal opponents pulled out pre match. For the second time during the tournament, world No. 2 Djokovic didn't need to hit a ball to advance in the draw. His third-round opponent, Florian Mayer, was a walkover because of a groin injury and the Serb progressed Friday after Kei Nishikori withdrew -- with a groin injury. Former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych was then unable to take on Nadal in the second semifinal due to a stomach illness, leaving spectators with no singles action to watch. Nishikori had upset 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals Wednesday and 2013 Miami finalist David Ferrer in a three-hour battle a day earlier. The hard-hitting Japanese baseliner, who trains in Florida, was bidding to reach his maiden Masters final. ""Very sorry to say that I have to pull out today,"" the 21st-ranked Nishikori said on his Facebook page. ""Very disappointed and I am obviously very sorry for any fans that wanted to come out for this match. ""This tournament is very special to me and (I) look forward to coming back in the years to come. I will work with my medical team to be back healthy as soon as possible."" Berdych, in comments posted by the tournament on Twitter, said he woke up at 7:30 a.m. Miami time Friday with pain in his stomach. ""I am disappointed about not getting a chance to play,"" said Berdych. Djokovic is one win away from doing the Indian Wells and Miami double, which would replicate his 2011 feat. Nadal, meanwhile, is aiming to capture the tournament for the first time. Saturday's women's final features the top two in the rankings, too. World No. 1 Serena Williams -- trying for a seventh title in Miami -- plays Australian Open champion Li Na.","Novak Djokovic advances to the final of the Miami Masters without playing .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways said Tuesday it was in talks with Australian rival Qantas that could see a merger of two of the world's most prestigious airlines. BA says it is in talks with Australian rival Qantas. London-based BA said the exploratory talks would look at creating a dual-listed company but offered no other details. ""There is no guarantee that any transaction will be forthcoming and a further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate,"" BA said in a statement. BA said the talks would not affect its negotiations in Spanish airline Iberia, with which it is already discussing a revenue deal with American Airlines. Shares in BA leapt more than 10 percent on the news, soaring 154 pence ($2.32) within an hour. Both Qantas -- known as the ""Flying Kangaroo"" airline -- and BA are partners in the Oneworld Global Alliance, an umbrella which links 10 of the world's carriers, including American Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Tuesday's announcement comes after the Australian government revealed that it plans to increase the level of foreign ownership permitted in Qantas, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. BA sold a remaining 18.25 percent stake in Qantas in 2004, according to the Herald. The deal, which will not permit a takeover, revises current Australian law that currently limits a single foreign holding to 25 percent and a group maximum of 35 percent. BA, American Airways and Iberia in August opened negotiations over a revenue deal, filing for antitrust immunity for the tie-up. The deal has been bitterly opposed by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways. CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said BA's twin merger situation was unprecedented in the aviation industry. BA and Qantas have for many years co-operated on the so-called ""Kangaroo Route"" including sharing revenues on UK-Australia routes, Quest said. A merger would make a powerful airline that would literally span the globe, he said . The merger moves come during troubled times for BA, which saw its pretax profits fall by 92 percent in the first half of this year, a loss it blamed on high oil prices and troubled financial markets. Qantas has also faced its own troubles this year after one of its jetliners was damaged by a midair explosion over the South China Sea in July, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The airline also announced it was slashing its work force by 1,500 people worldwide, abandoning plans to hire 1,200 more as high fuel costs squeezed profits.","British Airways confirms it is in merger talks with Australian rival Qantas .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal has banned women under the age of 30 from working in Persian Gulf nations amid increasing concerns over abuse and exploitation. Nepalese women are among thousands of Asians who travel to the Middle East in search of employment. They often arrive willingly, but subsequently face conditions that the U.S. State Department says is indicative of forced labor -- the withholding of passports, restrictions on movement, nonpayment of wages for work up to 20 hours a day, threats, deprivation of food and sleep, and physical or sexual abuse. The age bar is aimed at preventing some of the abuse, Raj Kishore Yadav, Nepal's minister of information and communication, said Thursday. He said the hope is that the risks are lower with more mature women. The Nepalese government says 58,000 Nepalese women are working in these Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman. However, human rights agencies estimate that number at about 200,000, saying that the official figure does not take into account all those who have traveled illegally, many through India. Nepal had imposed a complete ban on women working in the Gulf states after the suicide of a domestic worker, but lifted those restrictions in 2010. Read more: Burmese migrant workers dream of returning home . Recently, CNN spoke with a Nepalese woman who was beaten and raped by her employer in Kuwait and managed to escape to the Nepalese embassy. Kumari, who is not fully identified because she is a victim of sexual abuse, returned home pregnant. ""My landlord would beat me, they (he and his wife) both would beat me,"" she said. ""My body would ache."" One day, she said, the landlord came home when the rest of the family was out, and called her into the bathroom. When she refused he came to her. ""He beat me up,"" she said. ""First he covered my mouth so I could not scream."" After he raped her, Kumari said, she asked for her passport. ""He wouldn't give it to me,"" she said. Human Rights Watch, which has documented abuse of Asian women workers in Middle Eastern nations, says Nepal's age limit policy does not go far enough to address the gravity of the problem. ""Imposing a ban on women under 30 from migrating to the Gulf fails to solve the underlying problem of how desperate women are for decent work,"" said Nisha Varia, senior researcher for the rights group's Women's Rights Division. Varia said she once visited a hospital in Kuwait that had an entire ward devoted to domestic workers who had spinal cord and back injuries from botched escape attempts or attempted suicide from high-rise residential buildings. Read more: Booming Brazil lures immigrant workers . She said the priority should be not to set limits but to work to improve working conditions and local justice systems. ""Instead of a blanket ban on its own women that denies them important employment opportunities, Nepal's government should work with other labor-sending governments to demand stronger protections for migrant workers in the Gulf,"" Varia said. Migrant worker advocate Manju Gurung agreed. ""We are not happy with the decision,"" said Gurung, who heads Pourakhi, a Nepalese agency that promotes the welfare of women migrant workers. ""This is a protectionist approach,"" she said. ""The government should negotiate with destination countries and have bilateral agreements. There is a demand for women workers."" About 2.5 million Nepalese who work abroad, other than in India, contribute 21.4% of the Nepal's GDP, according to the government. Remittances from the Gulf play a huge role in the Himalayan nation, where about 30% of the people are unemployed. ""The government is right to be concerned about abuse against migrant women, but the correct response is not to stop them from going, but to ensure they can migrate with guarantees for their safety,"" Varia said. Journalist Manesh Shrestha reported from Kathmandu and CNN's Moni Basu, from Atlanta. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","Nepal's government hopes the risks of abuse will be lower with more mature women .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Major wireless carriers have fixed a bug that could have allowed criminals to hack into hundreds of millions of cell phones, says a security expert who exposed the flaw. Cryptographer Karsten Nohl of Security Research Labs in Germany says he discovered the bug after spending three years figuring out how to hack SIM cards, those tiny removable plastic cards found in cell phones and other mobile devices. Nohl accessed the SIM cards by exploiting flaws in the encryption keys and sending a hidden SMS text message. SIM cards can identify the phone's owner and store some sensitive personal data, such as payment information. Nohl's findings sent ripples through the wireless industry when they were first revealed July 21. While phones are known to be susceptible to a range of security issues and attacks, the old dependable SIM card was considered safe. Nohl was scheduled to demonstrate his SIM card hack Wednesday at Black Hat, a computer-security conference in Las Vegas. Instead, he announced that five wireless carriers had rushed to push out updates that patched the problem. Because of the fix, he was only able to demonstrate parts of the hack. Nohl declined to name the carriers involved. Physically replacing millions of compromised SIM cards around the world would have been a huge and costly undertaking for carriers -- and a security concern for phone owners. Instead, the companies came up with a more creative solution: They took advantage of the same Java vulnerability Nohl found and used it to hack into their own cards and rewrite parts of their operating systems. Nohl praised the carriers' quick action. ""They're adopting hacking methods to make it more secure,"" he said at a press conference ahead of his talk. ""Abusing the Java vulnerabilities to update the card is the neatest outcome of this."" With access to a phone's SIM card, criminals could carry out a range of attacks. They could run up charges on a phone bill, intercept phone calls, remotely control phones, track the location of devices and even access financial information. The bug could be especially damaging in places such as Africa, where many people use their phones not just for communication but as mobile banking systems. A quick fix from a company is the ideal outcome for so-called ""white hat"" hackers such as Nohl, who spend their time finding possible weaknesses in computer systems before criminals can exploit them. Every year at Black Hat, researchers present their latest findings and hacks. The hackers typically receive varying reactions from companies after exposing their vulnerabilities. While some companies do acknowledge issues and respond with a quick fix, others wait until criminals exploit a flaw before taking action. Nohl said Wednesday that companies still have not fixed most of his other computer-bug findings from the past four years.","Expert: Wireless carriers fix a bug that could have allowed criminals to hack into cell phones .

"(CNN) -- Republican kingmaker or entertainer? Truth teller or ""big fat idiot""? How about ""lightning rod""? Once again, Rush Limbaugh -- the conservative provocateur with the self-described ""talent on loan from God"" -- is in hot water. Limbaugh, who has been the leading talk-radio host for more than two decades, ignited this most recent controversy when he made comments about Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, who had testified as an advocate for contraception at a Capitol Hill hearing. ""What does it say about the college co-ed Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says she must be paid to have sex?"" Limbaugh asked on his show last Wednesday. ""What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex, she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex."" His remarks set off a major outcry, prompting top Republicans and Democrats alike to denounce the famed talk show host. Limbaugh apologized Saturday, saying his ""choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir."" He added, ""I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."" The damage, however, has been done. Eight companies, including AOL, Quicken Loans and ProFlowers, have announced they will pull ads from Limbaugh's show, the No. 1 radio show in America. What effect this will have on Limbaugh -- and the 600-plus radio stations his show airs on -- is anyone's guess. Limbaugh's situation is complicated by the politics of his show, said Michael Harrison, founder and publisher of Talkers magazine, which covers the talk industry. Talk radio ""has such a high profile and so much buzz factor, people tend to give these big-time talk-show hosts"" far more sway than they actually have, Harrison said. ""People who see things through the political lens only see things politically."" But politics is only part of the story, he said. ""The fact is, he's primarily an entertainer."" Glory in fury . The Fluke controversy is far from the first time Rush Hudson Limbaugh III has made controversial statements -- or backtracked. In 2006, Limbaugh mocked Parkinson's-afflicted actor Michael J. Fox after Fox appeared in a political commercial for Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill. He later offered a conditional apology: ""I will bigly, hugely admit that I was wrong, and I will apologize to Michael J. Fox, if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act."" Three years earlier, Limbaugh resigned from ESPN's ""Sunday NFL Countdown"" after igniting a controversy with statements about African-American quarterback Donovan McNabb. ""My comments this past Sunday were directed at the media and were not racially motivated. I offered an opinion,"" Limbaugh said. ""This opinion has caused discomfort to the crew, which I regret."" Limbaugh has also mocked presidential children Amy Carter (""the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country"") and Chelsea Clinton (comparing her to a dog). Both times, he apologized, though some critics questioned the spirit of his regret. His words still carry weight within the Republican Party, and just as often raise the hackles of his ideological opponents. Limbaugh often glories in their fury, letting fly with such terms as ""feminazis"" (""Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society,"" he once said), ""caller abortions"" (disconnecting unwanted callers), ""banking queen"" (for the openly gay congressman and House Financial Services Committee member Barney Frank) and ""state-run media"" (mainstream media). Indeed, before a number of advertisers had announced their intent, Limbaugh doubled down on the Fluke controversy. After President Obama called the student, Limbaugh mocked the story on his show. ""The president called her to make sure she's OK,"" Limbaugh said. ""What is she, 30 years old? Thirty years old, a student at Georgetown Law, who admits to having so much sex that she can't afford it anymore."" Limbaugh has been stoking passions since he first went on the air as a talk-show host in 1984, replacing the equally outrageous Morton Downey Jr. in Sacramento, California. Previously, Limbaugh -- part of a noted southeast Missouri Republican family -- had worked as a music DJ under the name Jeff Christie and as director of promotions for the Kansas City Royals. In Sacramento, he found his exaggerated ""El Rushbo"" persona and set about raising ratings and emotion in equal measure. By 1988, he had moved to New York and his show went national. He quickly became a star, reaching more than 5 million listeners for his ""EIB Network"" by 1991. (Current numbers are difficult to determine, says Harrison, but Talkers believes Limbaugh reaches 15 million people a week. Others question the figures.) ""EIB"" stood for ""Excellence In Broadcasting"" -- a typical mock-heroic Limbaugh touch befitting his golden voice. Even those who disagree with him acknowledge his radio talent. ""Rush is just an amazing radio performer,"" ""This American Life"" host Ira Glass told The New York Times Magazine in a 2008 Limbaugh profile by Zev Chafets, who later wrote a Limbaugh biography. ""Years ago, I used to listen in the car on my way to reporting gigs, and I'd notice that I disagreed with everything he was saying, yet I not only wanted to keep listening, I actually liked him. That is some chops. You can count on two hands the number of public figures in America who can pull that trick off."" The power of the bully pulpit . Limbaugh also became a power within the Republican Party, using his bully pulpit to promote conservative views and denigrate Democrats and their fellow travelers. The GOP appreciated the boost, naming him an honorary member of the 1994 ""Contract With America"" congressional freshman class. He branched out, writing best-selling books -- the first two were titled ""The Way Things Ought to Be"" and ""See, I Told You So"" -- and starting a syndicated TV talk show, which was produced by future Fox News head Roger Ailes. Limbaugh's popularity naturally led to detractors. Perhaps the most publicly outspoken was comedian Al Franken, who ripped Limbaugh's books with his own, titled ""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations."" That book, along with regular Comedy Central appearances opposite such political personalities as Arianna Huffington, helped establish Franken as a left-wing force. The Democrat is now one of Minnesota's U.S. senators. Given the mockery Limbaugh dishes out, his personal life has left him open to jokes. He's been divorced three times; he married his fourth wife, Kathryn Rogers, in 2010. He's struggled with weight problems. He suffered from addiction to pain medication and was named during a 2003 investigation into a black market drug ring in Palm Beach County, Florida. He also was detained by drug enforcement agents in 2006 after returning from the Dominican Republic. The agents confiscated a supply of Viagra; the prescription was not in Limbaugh's name. Democratic Party leaders have also found Limbaugh a useful target, making him the center of a 2009 advertising campaign. Over the years, several Republicans have backed off positions on issues after being taken to task by Limbaugh. In 2009, Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Georgia, criticized Limbaugh and fellow conservative talk-show host Sean Hannity for their attacks on the congressional GOP leadership; he apologized within 24 hours. Other Republicans have spoken out against handling Limbaugh with kid gloves. ""The problem I'm having with the party right now is when he says things that I consider to be completely outrageous, I would like to see other members of the party do likewise, and they don't,"" former Secretary of State Colin Powell told CNN in 2009. Powell had been a subject of Limbaugh's gibes. Talkers publisher Harrison -- who describes Limbaugh personally as ""basically a shy man,"" sensitive to slights but ""intelligent enough to have overcome his emotions and stay out of the public profile"" -- believes that Limbaugh will weather this storm, as he has so many others. ""I suspect he will come through this, because Limbaugh is not an elected official, he's not a clergyman, he's not a member of the government, he's just basically in the same business Ryan Seacrest is in,"" he said. ""In the end, all of this talk helps keep him out there as one of the big controversial talk-show hosts of our time."" That doesn't mean, however, that Limbaugh is done dodging bullets. In our passionate times, a person who rouses of any sort of emotion is bound to stay a target. (On Monday, attorney Gloria Allred jumped into the fracas with an open letter calling Limbaugh's apology ""meaningless."") Don Imus was suspended after racially insensitive remarks in 2007. Shock jock Howard Stern had several run-ins while broadcasting in local New York radio and in syndication. Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the moralistic commentator and author, left broadcast radio in 2010, telling CNN's Larry King: ""The reason is, I want to regain my First Amendment rights."" Stern and Schlesinger now ply their trades for the subscription-based satellite radio company Sirius XM. ""Anybody in talk radio who states a political opinion gets as many enemies as they get supporters,"" Harrison said. ""Being a celebrity today is dangerous, and being a controversial talk-show host is a very dangerous profession."" CNN's Political Unit contributed to this report.","Rush Limbaugh's words about student land him in hot water .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesians are heading to the polls Wednesday to elect its lawmakers in a crucial vote that will set the stage for the upcoming presidential elections. Grappling with questions over the country's economy and corruption, voters will choose among 19,669 candidates for 532 legislature seats, at the national and sub-national level. Leading the presidential polls is a charismatic Jakarta governor, who is drawing comparisons to the 2008 version of Barack Obama. There are also smaller parties and colorful candidates including an Elvis impersonator, a former beauty queen and a singer. In this election, the political parties must win 25% of the popular vote or 20% of the legislative seats in order to officially nominate their candidates for president and vice president. The presidential election is slated for July 9. Wednesday's vote will shape the presidency as current President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will end his 10-year tenure this year. Indonesian law prohibits third terms. Leading the polls . Recent surveys in Indonesia show a clear frontrunner for his successor. Joko Widodo, a 52-year-old former furniture exporter, built a reputation during his tenure as the mayor of Surakarta in Central Java. The candidate known as Jokowi draws similarities with Obama, because it's a case of a relatively unknown candidate captivating national attention, says Douglas Ramage, an analyst with Bower Group Asia, based in Jakarta. ""Anyone who was disenchanted with the current government pours their hopes and dreams on him,"" he told CNN. Widodo's supporters cheered on March 14, when his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle or PDI-P announced him as its presidential candidate. Described as ""folksy and self-effacing,"" Widodo's leadership style has endeared him to supporters. He rose to national prominence in 2012, when he became governor of the capital, Jakarta. For many, his victory signaled a clamor for a new breed of political leaders. ""If he becomes president in July, he would be the first Indonesian president who doesn't come from a military, bureaucratic or elite background,"" Ramage said. ""We could be looking at a real generational shift in Indonesian politics."" The Jokowi effect, as many call it now, is expected to change the political landscape. It may even spur apathetic voters, particularly among first-timers, to exercise their right to vote. ""I'm too lazy to line up and vote but I'll decide on the day itself,"" said Karin, a 28-year-old who voted for Yudhoyono in the last two elections. ""But I do want Jokowi to be president."" But skeptics question whether Widodo has enough experience for the top post. One opinion piece in the Jakara Post asked: ""Can Indonesia afford untested leadership in this age?"" For now, Widodo has had a ""Teflon aura"" because criticisms haven't stuck to the candidate, Ramage said. Another contender is Prabowo Subianto, a former general and son-in-law of Suharto, the former strongman who ruled Indonesia for 32 years. Prabowo, the presidential candidate for the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) party, trails Widodo in most surveys by double digits. A complex election . Over the years, the number of national political parties has whittled down to 12, but the established ones, like the PDI-P and Golkar, which Suharto founded, still dominate legislative elections. On Wednesday, each voter will be handed four ballots at the polling station, two for the upper and lower house, one each for the provincial and district legislatures. It can be daunting, even for seasoned voters. Fitri, a 32-year-old working mother, is still unsure whom to vote for. ""I don't even know the candidates' names,"" she said. Yudhoyono won the country's first direct Presidential vote in 2004, by a landslide, but his popularity has waned since then because of high-profile corruption cases involving members of his Democratic Party. He ran explicitly on a platform of anti-corruption in 2004 and 2009, said Ramage. ""When voters are asked why they're not supporting Yudhoyono's party, there's a sense of betrayal of promise."" Indonesia is the world's third's largest democracy, after the United States and India, which is also currently holding elections. The Indonesian poll will span across 17,000 islands. Final results are not expected until late April or early May.","Indonesians will vote on its lawmakers Wednesday, an election seen as a bellwether for July's presidential poll .

"(CNN) -- Could the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have been the result of human intervention, as many have speculated? For argument's sake, let's begin with an act of terrorism originating from the cabin of the airplane. Making the assumption that an individual, or group of individuals, gained access to the cockpit through a keypad-coded, Kevlar door, how was it done? Perhaps entry was gained shortly after the now-famous, ""All right, good night,"" message from the co-pilot 40 minutes into the flight . Theoretically, one of the pilots stepped out for a lavatory break ... or stepped back in from a lavatory break. Terrorists rushed into the cockpit at the very moment the door was opened, an action that had to be well-orchestrated. Such an action would require at least two people positioned in the first class cabin to observe the open door. One terrorist would have to disable the pilot and another terrorist would have to rush into the cockpit. With the terrorists in control of the cockpit, they would direct the remaining pilot to steer the airplane on a new course. Or the terrorists themselves had enough piloting skills to fly the airplane. In addition, inside knowledge beyond that of even experienced 777 pilots would have been necessary to locate the ACARS unit from within the depths of the electronics and engineering (E&E) compartment in order to disable it such that the system no longer was capable of sending automatic data; notwithstanding the logistics of pulling up a portion of the first class galley carpet to gain access to the E&E hatch while using some type of threat to prevent passengers from impeding their progress. Why pick that moment? Where are they going exactly? Surely, aiming for the middle of the Indian Ocean doesn't accomplish their task to make some type of statement. And if one considers a botched hijacking attempt, how would a group of terrorists fail that badly? For that matter, how could one or a number of crazed terrorists disable a whole 777 to the point it runs out of fuel? A 9/11 scenario with the passengers attempting to disable the terrorists likely wouldn't continue for seven hours. And oh, by the way, information disseminated publicly seems to indicate that none of the passengers had suspicious backgrounds. Next, consider the theories that cast one or both of the pilots as the villain. If both pilots participated, a carefully crafted plot between the two would have been constructed. No evidence of such a plot has been forthcoming. Besides, this would have required some type of connection between the captain and the co-pilot beyond their airline employment. No extracurricular connection between the two pilots has been publicly established. Eliminating the two-pilot conspiracy, then only one would have commandeered the airplane. But how would that pilot have disabled the other? A struggle? Would the commandeering pilot have prevented the other pilot from reentering the cockpit after a lavatory break? Then what? Both the captain and co-pilot were equally qualified to fly the 777. If the erratic climbs and descents reported concerning the plane are credible, why the gyrations? Although transport category airplanes are sensitive to hand flying at high altitudes, only an amateur would demonstrate that lack of skill. And to what end would one of the pilots want to seize a 777? Once again, would the purpose really be to run the airplane out of fuel in the middle of the Indian Ocean? How about suicide? Death by airplane seems farfetched in this case. Why wait till the middle of the ocean to make a statement? Why not attempt suicide immediately after takeoff ... or just prior to landing in Bejing? Was human intervention involved? Absolutely. But my gut theory as a 30-year airline veteran is that human intervention was involved to save an airplane and its passengers in crisis, not to commit foul play.","Pilot Les Abend doubts theories that hijackers or pilots brought down Flight 370 .
He says if human intervention occurred, it was likely to try to save the plane, not to doom it .
Abend: There's no clue of a plot involving both pilots, and it would likely take both .
He says hijackers would have had touble getting into cockpit and disabling equipment ."
"(CNN) -- After years of being more hype than highlight, Cyber Monday appears on its way to its biggest outing ever. Last year, the Monday after Thanksgiving saw an estimated $1 billion spent online in the United States, making it the biggest e-sales day ever. And analysts said Monday that this year's ""holiday"" -- the online answer to the annual Black Friday bargain rush on stores -- is on pace to be bigger still. As of 3 p.m. ET, online sales were up 15% from last year, according to IBM Benchmark (formerly Coremetrics). The analytics group, which monitors sales on more than 500 online retail sites, has been reporting Cyber Monday sales for the past four years. As a marketing term, ""Cyber Monday"" was coined in 2005. But, according to IBM and others, it wasn't until 2009 when the Internet saw more sales that day than on Black Friday. And last November was the first in which Black Friday actually ended up being the biggest online shopping day of the year. ""We at comScore have spent a lot of time in past holiday seasons dispelling the notion that Cyber Monday was the heaviest online spending day of the year,"" said Andrew Lipsman of the Web analytics firm on its blog. ""And just when it seemed that message finally began to sink in, Cyber Monday has a banner year and jumps to the top of the ranking. "" A growing push by retailers has helped morph perception into reality, said IBM's John Squire. ""Now that we're starting to see some retailers promote Cyber Monday in their stores, I think we're really starting to ingrain this as the 'next big shopping day,' "" said Squire, chief strategy officer for IBM Smarter Commerce. From Amazon to Best Buy to Macy's to Walmart, virtually every major online retailer was touting Cyber Monday deals. Even nontraditional businesses such as airlines and hotels were getting in on the act with Monday travel discounts. About half of all online shopping on Cyber Monday happens on consumers' work computers, according to comScore. Another significant trend is how many people are now shopping with their phones or other mobile devices. More than 12% of the people surfing retailer sites were using mobile devices, according to IBM Benchmark, and more than 7% of the purchases made were on mobile. That's up from 3.2% last year. ""When you look at the numbers ... you can really see how fast the mobile experience and the mobile user is impacting online sales,"" Squire said. Retailers were making their marketing push with gusto on Monday, with promotions for online sales popping up almost every time you clicked. On Twitter, the hashtag #CyberMonday appeared to be used more often by vendors promoting deals than by shoppers talking about their experiences. In fact, a wireless company paid to make #CyberMonday a ""sponsored tweet,"" guaranteeing that its own deals appeared prominently when someone searched for that term. Rank-and-file Twitter users were taking notice of the sales blitz. ""I live every Monday like it's #CyberMonday,"" wrote Twitter user Ryan Chapman. ""I.e., under a constant barrage of email, tweets, & Facebook posts.""","'Cyber Monday' on track to be the biggest ever .

"(CNN) -- Add this to our list of fun ways to celebrate Shakespeare's 450th birthday this week. Passengers on board an easyJet flight from Gatwick, England, to Verona, Italy, on April 23 became the surprise audience for an inflight performance of Shakespeare's plays. Verona is a principal setting for Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" The hour-long performance -- hosted by the airline as part of a campaign to have April 23 officially recognized as National Shakespeare Day -- was put on by actors from the Reduced Shakespeare Company. (Shakespeare fans argue over April 23 or April 26 as his exact birthday.) See a short video of the performance here. The plane had also been emblazoned with a portrait of the playwright. Armed with props and costumes, three actors paraded the aisle while running through abridged versions of every comedy and tragedy penned by the Bard. ""We hope to set a new Guinness World Record ... for the highest ever theatrical performance,"" said easyJet communications director Paul Moore in a statement. As a testament to the troupe's entertaining performance, no crotchety complaints seem to have appeared (yet) on social media about lost sleep. ""Certainly, this was the most entertaining flight I have ever taken. It was a fabulous performance and great for the children,"" passenger Simon Cureton told Portsmouth News. While the airline has taken its Shakespeare Day campaign seriously, throwing free performances at airports, emblazoning the playwright on plane livery and promoting the best Shakespearean destinations in its inflight magazine, the campaign has a long way to go. The petition had 729 signatures at the time of writing. If it hits 100,000, it will be considered by the House of Commons Backbench Business Committee.","A comedy troupe performed Shakespeare on an easyJet flight to Verona .

"(CNN) -- How stressed out do you need to be to spend $1 million on a 111-day holiday? Rhetorical questions come and go, but the latest super-luxe vacation is here to stay, as long as its ""attractions"" remain -- species close to extinction. ""That money serves to assist the endangered species that potential clients would see,"" says Will Bolsover, managing director at UK-based Natural World Safaris, which is offering what it's calling a ""Journey to Nature's Edge."" Prospective safari-goers (so far no one has booked) will get to gawk at 18 endangered species in 12 countries over 111 days, all from the Hermès-catered splendor of luxury lodgings. Guests will fly to each destination in first class, meet local conservation experts and have fiddly things like park entrance fees, transport and excursions arranged and paid for. The $1 million price tag covers two people and Bolsover himself, who'll accompany guests ""to ensure everything runs smoothly."" He says his own costs are greatly reduced by partners in the locales. Ten percent of the fee goes to the conservation projects involved and conservation administration CITES. ""We want to highlight the plight of endangered species on our planet and bring this to the attention of individuals at the same time as them truly experiencing the natural world and the conservation efforts that are ongoing to protect it,"" Bolsover says. Super-luxe holiday trend . It's not the most expensive vacation to have been conceived recently. A $1.5 million trip to all 962 UNESCO World Heritage Sites was created, and reportedly booked, last year. Just a few weeks ago a company launched its ""Lovers Deep"" concept -- converting a submarine into a private love hotel. A week on that, at nearly $290,000 per night, would cost more than $2 million. But at an average of $83,333 per destination -- an example of which is a five-day stay to see mountain gorillas in Rwanda -- this Journey to Nature's Edge falls into the just-think-what-else-you-could-do-with-that-kind-of-money category. ""The $1 million price tag does grab people's attention, however this was the cost when we finalized pulling the trip details together,"" says Bolsover. He adds that, despite the high-end price, guests may not be pampered every moment. ""People are prepared to pay a premium to get out and experience something entirely different and this may be staying at the most luxurious property in Botswana seeing some breathtaking game. ""Equally it could be staying at a very basic camp in Hemis National Park in India at minus 30 degrees Celsius with no shower facilities in the hope of catching a glimpse of the elusive snow leopard!""

"(CNN) -- NASA has clamped a tight lid on its choice of a name for the international space station's new wing, but it's sending an astronaut to break the news to comedian Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night. Stephen Colbert has threatened to become ""space's evil tyrant overlord"" if he doesn't get his way. The name ""Colbert"" received the most votes in an online poll soliciting names for Node 3, a connecting module and its cupola. The comedian has warned NASA he would ""seize power as space's evil tyrant overlord"" if the results are not honored. Astronaut Sunita ""Suni"" Williams will reveal the decision on the comedian's show, ""The Colbert Report,"" which will be taped in New York on Tuesday afternoon and broadcast later at 11:30 p.m. ET on Comedy Central. ""I certainly hope NASA does the right thing,"" Colbert said in a news release from the space agency. ""Just kidding, I hope they name it after me."" Colbert's campaign generated welcome attention for the oft-forgotten space station, but it also presented a dilemma for NASA. The contest rules spelled out that NASA reserves the right to ""select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency. ... Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names."" The runner-up was Serenity, which was more in line with the names of other nodes. In 2007, a poll of kindergartners chose the name of Harmony for Node 2. Colbert demanded NASA allow ""democracy in orbit"" on his show two weeks ago. ""Either name that node after me or I, too, will reject democracy and seize power as space's evil tyrant overlord,"" he said. NASA has welcomed the publicity from Colbert's interest. ""This spread overall awareness of the international space station,"" said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, who has appeared on Colbert's show. NASA changed plans to announce the name in late April at Kennedy Space Center in Florida when Colbert's producers invited officials to do the show, the space agency said. Node 3 -- whatever it's called -- will house many of the space station's life support systems. A space shuttle mission is set for later this year to deliver the module to the space station, NASA said. Colbert's loyal fans, known as the ""Colbert Nation,"" have in the past bombarded polls to have things named after their idol. The comedian outpolled every other name in a bridge-naming contest in Hungary. The country's government later said it couldn't name the bridge after him because he didn't speak Hungarian and wasn't deceased. Colbert also tried to get himself on Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his home state of South Carolina in 2007. The Democratic Party's executive council voted against his inclusion, and he did not qualify for the Republican primary because he missed the deadline. But ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's named a flavor in honor of him, calling it Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. And Virgin America airline named one of its planes Air Colbert.","Stephen Colbert has won NASA poll for name of space station's new wing .

"(Mental Floss) -- Golf's U.S. Open teed off Thursday at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego. We dug through the championship's history to find some crucial details (and trivial moments, too . How old is the tournament? The Newport Country Club of Rhode Island hosted the first U.S. Open in 1895 with far less fanfare than the modern tournament receives. Instead of a mad scramble to make the elite field, the competition only had 11 entrants, each of whom played a nine-hole course four times in a single day. The U.S. Open wasn't even the main draw on the course that week; spectators and golfers were much more preoccupied with the first playing of U.S. Amateur Championship at the club, which made the Open something of an afterthought. At the end of play, Englishman Horace Rawlins claimed the title and pocketed $150 and a gold medal for his stellar performance. (He also made a compelling case for home-course advantage in golf; by day the young champ was the assistant pro at...you guessed it, the Newport Country Club.) The Open's been played ever since with two exceptions: a two-year break for World War I and a four-year gap during World War II. So Americans dominated right off the bat, right? Hardly. Although the tournament was called the U.S. Open, winning was strictly a British affair in its early days. From 1895 to 1910, British golfers won every year, including four wins by Scottish immigrant Willie Anderson. Americans didn't claim their own Open until 1911 when Philadelphia's John J. McDermott bested the field by three strokes. McDermott, who was only 19 years old at the time of his victory, still holds the record for youngest Open champ. Just as impressively, he successfully defended his title the following year at the Country Club of Buffalo. Mental Floss: Music's greatest golfers . Why is it called the U.S. Open? Technically, the tournament is open to all comers rather than restricted to a certain group of golfers. Both amateurs and professionals can compete in the event, so in theory, any golfer in the world is eligible for the field. Thus, it's an ""open"" tournament. Of course, you can't just show up with your bag and shoes on Thursday morning and expect to tee off with Tiger. Golfers have to either qualify for the championship or gain an invitation through a qualifying exemption, which are given to past champions, recent champions of other major championships, top-ranked professionals, and other elite groups. Amateurs with handicaps of 1.4 or less can play in the U.S. Open if they make it through the qualifying process, which includes a local qualifying round and a sectional qualifying round. Golfers who manage to qualify in this way had better behave themselves, though. The United States Golf Association's Web site ominously warns that golfers are ""subject to rejection at any time (including during the Championship) by the USGA. The reason for rejection may include unbecoming conduct."" If John Daly's been sliding by, though, it's probably tough to get the boot. What's the roughest time anyone's had at the Open? It would be hard to beat J.D. Tucker in the futility department. He took the course for the 1898 Open at the Myopia Hunt Club in S. Hamilton, Massachusetts, and proceeded to shoot a 157 in his opening round. During his second round the same day, he carved 57 strokes off of his score, but that only got him to a not-so-competitive 100. He then withdrew from the tournament. For a single hole, though, Ray Ainsley gave Tucker a run for his money. At the 1938 Open at Cherry Hills in Englewood, Colorado, Ainsley hit into a creek on the 16th hole of his second round. Rather than take a penalty, Ainsley thought he'd try to hit the ball out of the water. When his first attempt was unsuccessful, he tried again. And again. And again. When the ball finally found its way onto dry land and into the cup, Ainsley had racked up a 19-stroke hole, a record that still stands. That should make you feel better the next time you have to suck it up and take a drop. Who was the unlikeliest champion? That honor probably belongs to Francis Ouimet, the former caddy who took the 1913 U.S. Open at the course he used to patrol, the Country Club of Brookline, Massachusetts. Although he was an amateur facing stiff competition from celebrated British pros like Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, Ouimet managed to squeak out a victory following an 18-hole playoff. Fittingly, Ouimet's caddy made him look old; 10-year-old friend Eddie Lowery skipped school to man the bag for Ouimet throughout the tournament. The national press hung on young Ouimet's gutsy performance against his British rivals, and the stunning win is credited with helping to popularize golf in the U.S. Sounds like a Disney movie, doesn't it? It is; the story was adapted in 2005 as The Greatest Game Ever Played starring Shia LeBeouf as Ouimet. Mental Floss: Champion's nickname or San Diego bar? Why doesn't Bobby Jones have five U.S. Open titles? Amateur golfer Bobby Jones was undoubtedly one of the best golfers of all time, and he had the hardware to back it up: four U.S. Open wins, another three wins in the British Open, and six more wins between the U.S. Amateur and the British Amateur. He might have had a fifth U.S. Open title if he hadn't been so honest, though. At the 1925 U.S. Open, he was getting set to hit an iron shot out of the rough when he felt his club move the ball ever so slightly. No one else seemed to have seen this movement, but Jones called a penalty on himself. After officials were unable to confirm that the ball had actually moved, they allowed Jones to make his own ruling on whether or not he should be penalized. Jones said he was certain the ball had moved and penalized himself. The decision cost him the outright title, and he then lost a playoff to Willie Macfarlane. Spectators praised Jones for being so conscientious, but he would have none of it. He flatly replied, ""You might as well praise me for not robbing banks."" Who was the unhealthiest champ? Anyone who watched Angel Cabrera win last year's U.S. Open while chain-smoking between shots might be surprised to learn the tobacco-loving Argentine doesn't hold this distinction. Olin Dutra's win at the 1934 U.S. Open was as much a medical marvel as it was an athletic achievement after Dutra got sick on his way to the tournament. He wasn't just a little ill; he was suffering from a case of amoebic dysentery that caused him to lose 15 pounds before the tournament began. For the first two rounds, Dutra played well enough to lurk just eight strokes back on the leaderboard. The third round was disastrous, though. The dysentery acted up, and Dutra dropped to 18th place. In the final round, though, he roared back despite feeling ill and being forced to subsist on sugar cubes. By shooting a final-round 72, Dutra passed Bobby Cruickshank and Gene Sarazen to win his only U.S. Open crown by just one stroke. Honorable mention in this category has to go to Ken Venturi, who won the 1964 U.S Open at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland. The sweltering sun got to Venturi in his final round, and he nearly collapsed from heat exhaustion. He eventually completed his victory under the watchful eye of a doctor.

"(CNN) -- Chase Ballew had miscalculated a little bit. He was bringing home some furniture from Ikea in his electric-powered truck, and there wasn't enough charge to get him all the way to the house. About a mile from his Portland, Oregon, home he decided to pull into the parking lot of an auto parts store to see if it would let him borrow an outlet. He reasoned that the store would have no problem with him recharging, hoping he'd come back in the future. So he charged for a few minutes, getting enough juice to make it the rest of the way. That, said Ballew, was the only time in his 18 months as a Zap Xebra owner that he was ever close to being stranded. ""I think the added weight cost me a little bit in range,"" Ballew said by phone recently. ""I probably could have kept going, but I was worried I would damage the batteries."" Most of Ballew's trips are short, and this was only one of a few times he has dealt with ""range anxiety,"" a new phrase popular with electric car drivers and potential buyers. Electric vehicles generally get between 25 to 100 miles on a full ""tank"" whereas a gas-powered car can go 300 miles or more. And gas stations are everywhere; there are more than 160,000 in the country. There are only a few hundred working electric charging stations. In Portland there are less than 30, Ballew said. To prevent range anxiety, Ballew said he often will plan trips based on where he can charge the car. For instance, there are two nearby grocery stores. He goes to the one with the eight charging stations and powers up for free while shopping. But still he must keep his trips short. The good news is the city of Portland is on a mission to install the infrastructure to support the next coming of the mass-produced electric car. Within the next year, Portland will install 500 public-use charging stations, with surrounding communities also putting in similar numbers. The money comes in part from the U.S. Department of Energy, which has allocated $400 million to electric vehicle infrastructure. Several companies are working with cities to put in charging stations in the next year -- about 12,000 of them. Most of them are going in Western state cities where power is primarily from renewable resources and cheaper than other areas. For instance, in Oregon, 69 percent of electricity is generated by hydropower. Portland Mayor Sam Adams said his city has learned from its experience with building one of the biggest bike networks in the country. ""We built a system that made people comfortable with going from Point A to Point B,"" he said, adding that bike ridership has doubled in the past 15 years. ""The thing we know having introduced large-scale strategic changes in our transportation system here ... is you do your homework upfront, you figure out what it is, in this case that will address people's range anxiety, and then you watch it very, very closely in the first six to 12 months, and you make the necessary changes."" Therein lies the question or questions: How many charging stations do you need? For how many electric cars? Do you put in thousands of public charging points, and then watch as just a few cars use them? Will people even buy electric cars if they don't see places to get power around town? At your house, plugging the car in overnight is not an issue. When you are out running errands during the day, it can become a concern, as Ballew found out when he headed home from Ikea that day. Early buyers of electric vehicles are more likely to put up with the inconvenience of locating public charging, but large-scale sales will depend on the public's comfort with always being able to get fuel. ""The charge infrastructure is going to be something that people adapt to,"" said Ted Bohn, an electrical engineer at the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, Illinois. ""It's like you get used to charging your cell phone battery or your laptop battery, you know when you need to plug in."" Bohn added, ""The key is whether you have time."" He said it makes sense to put chargers in where people will spend a lot of time -- offices, coffee shops, shopping centers, movie theaters. On the street, charging will be a different story, similar to hunting for a public bathroom. It depends on how badly you need it. Home chargers should be able to fill a car's batteries in a few hours. A fast charger outside a grocery store might be able to do the job in 30 minutes. But if all you can find is a 110-volt outlet, getting anything more than a few miles' worth of power will take more than half a day. ""If the public infrastructure is out there, it makes people feel more comfortable, particularly the people who aren't very familiar with electric cars,"" said Paul Scott, vice president of Plug In America, a coalition of electric car advocates and drivers. Scott lives in California and has driven an electric car for eight years. He said he trades with hybrid-owning friends when he goes on a long trip. The long-trip predicament is one of the reasons Chevrolet chose to make an extended-range electric vehicle. The Volt can go 40 miles on a single charge (about a average day's miles for the typical American), and it also has a gas-powered generator that gives it the ability to drive 300 more miles, Chevrolet says. Volt drivers will still use charging stations, but it'll be a convenience (electricity costs less per mile) more than a necessity. ""That said, we feel there is going to be an awful lot of organic growth in public places,"" said Britta Gross, General Motors' director of global energy systems and infrastructure commercialization. ""[Consumer demand] for public charging is the right way to do it because then it says you are going to do it in just the right spots [where people show they want to charge]."" Chevy's Volt: When the juice runs out . Determining the right spots is falling into the hands of companies that have tapped into the Department of Energy millions. One of those is ECOtality, which manages the EV Project, an initiative to get the electric car movement reborn. Jonathan Read, chief executive officer of ECOtality, said that besides helping local governments, utilities and consumer groups set up charging networks, the primary goals are charging station projects that connect cities such as one planned for Interstate 5 along the West Coast. ""The objective is to show what's necessary to build these major corridors,"" he said. ""What we're doing is rolling out the largest infrastructure program for electric cars in history, but we're also doing is, under the auspices of the DOE program, is we're collecting data -- where people charge, how often they charge, so that we can have hard data to share with other communities of what the consumer is looking for and what we need to do as an industry."" Nissan, makers of the Leaf, which is scheduled to hit the roads in a few months, said the data collected from the initial rollout will be hugely beneficial to other parts of the country that will be a part of the second phase. ""Of course we're not going to be 100 percent perfect with every decision, every location,"" said Mark Perry, director of product planning at Nissan. ""So the deliverable is how do people use it? What is the impact on the grid? What kind of support did drivers need? All that information will be important."" A closer look at Nissan's Leaf . Lessons learned from the rollout of charging stations to support the General Motors EV1 more than a decade ago are helpful but ""somewhat irrelevant,"" he said because the new charging stations are much more sophisticated as are the electronics in the car. One of the people working on Ford's electric vehicles said it is vital not to repeat earlier mistakes of putting recharging spots where they weren't needed. ""Some of the most premium parking spaces were used for EV charging, and there weren't the vehicles to support them, and you can imagine what the impact was for non-EV drives,"" said Mike Tinskey, manager of global electrification at Ford Motor Co. ""The answer is not only putting them in the right spot but at the right time."" Another issue was the technology. Mike McQuary, chief executive of Wheego electric vehicles in Atlanta, Georgia, said those charge points were built to varying standards and that one of the huge ""breakthroughs"" recently was an agreement reached between car companies and makers of recharging stations over international equipment standards. ""There's going to be one type of socket and one type of plug,"" McQuary said. ""Before that I thought we were going to see a Beta vs. VHS sort of thing."" The standard was the last big hurdle before the new electric vehicles hit the road, he said. General Electric is probably the biggest player now getting involved in the manufacture of charging stations. TV ads for its WattStation are already running during network primetime. ""When someone as large as GE comes into the space, you know they have done their research and they see a very big future,"" said Perry of Nissan, which is partnering with a company called AeroVironment for home charging stations. While the general public may still look at the electric car as a novelty, its advocates see the coming wave of new models and stations as a big step toward eliminating this country's use of oil, especially foreign oil, and helping the planet. Stopping to get a charge away from home is a small price to pay, said Scott, the Plug In America vice president. ""If you care about the environment, if it bothers you that you are polluting everybody's air, if it bothers you that you are sending lots of money out of the country,"" he said, ""then it's worth it to you to spend 20 minutes"" recharging.","""Range anxiety"" reflects concern about recharging electric cars during long drives .

"(CNN) -- Less than three months ago, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down eagerly awaited rulings on same-sex marriage, voting rights and affirmative action. Next month, the court will begin its new term and likely deal with controversial issues such as abortion, campaign finance reform and the separation of church and state. When the court is in the middle of a term, it is easy to focus on hard legal questions, the legal views of individual justices and the consequences of landmark decisions. Now is a good time, when the court is in recess, to take a step back and look at the institution itself. A lifetime is too long . First, our Supreme Court justices are the only judges in the world who sit on a country's highest court and have life tenure. Because the president nominates the justices and the Senate confirms them, the American people do not elect the justices and cannot vote them out of office. In light of the crucial role the court plays across the spectrum of social, legal and political issues, the question of how long our justices serve should be re-examined. Supreme Court justices often serve more than 25 years and beyond the time they are still fit to perform their duties. For example, according to renown author David Garrow, both Justices William O. Douglas and Thurgood Marshall remained on the bench well after their skills had significantly diminished beyond the point of competence. The usual justification for life tenure is that the justices need to be independent of the other branches of the government to adequately perform their duties. This need for independence is real and compelling, but there are other ways to achieve that goal. Other countries use fixed terms, retirement ages or a combination of the two to achieve the necessary independence. There simply is no persuasive reason to allow governmental officials who have virtually unreviewable power to hold their offices for life. Few witnesses to history . The second aspect of our Supreme Court that needs to be changed is the lack of television coverage of oral arguments and decision announcements. What a shame that during the last week of June when the court handed down and read from the bench numerous important decisions -- including the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act and the formula in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- the American people had to hear the news indirectly from media personalities instead of the justices. Similarly in 2012, when the court held three days of oral arguments on the president's most important piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act, the public should have been able to witness those arguments just like the lucky few who happened to be in the courtroom. Moreover, it is close to a tragedy that future generations will have absolutely no video record of the court's arguments or decisions in these landmark cases. It would be an invaluable learning tool if young Americans today could see the oral arguments in Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade. More than 30 state supreme courts allow cameras in the courtroom with great success. Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy have suggested that the presence of television would lead to grandstanding by lawyers and maybe even the justices themselves, but the experiences in state courts demonstrate such concerns are greatly exaggerated. When Arkansas was considering placing cameras in the courtroom, Justice Robert L. Brown conducted a survey and found that ""state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail. ... The public's response, according to those state supreme courts that provide those video broadcasts, border[ed] on the exuberant. . . [N]o state that currently provides video of its oral arguments cites grandstanding as a problem."" Arkansas has joined the majority of states that allow cameras in their courtrooms. There is simply no good reason for the Supreme Court not to do exactly the same thing. A joke of a job interview . Finally, we have to do something about the national farce that is our Supreme Court nomination process. The sad spectacle of senators asking questions drafted by their staffs and then allowing the nominees to duck them should give way to serious conversations about the nominees' views so that the American people can participate more fully in the confirmation process. As almost everyone now knows, the justices have enormous discretion to decide cases in accordance with their personal and political value systems. The differences between Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg on most constitutional questions have nothing to do with legal interpretation and everything to do with their different backgrounds, experiences and values. The Senate should do a much better job requiring nominees to answer hard questions about those values and experiences before the nominees are allowed to sit on the highest court in the land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Segall.","Eric Segall: Life tenure allows justices to serve past the point of competence .

"(CNN) -- A 54-year-old Michigan tree trimmer -- beaten nearly to death after going to the aid of a child he accidentally struck with his vehicle -- is home after spending more than six weeks in a hospital and rehabilitation center. The ""Help Steven Utash"" Facebook page posted the news Saturday night. Cheryl Angelelli, a spokeswoman for DMC Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, confirmed Utash was discharged on Thursday. Steven Utash was set upon by about a dozen people April 4 after his truck struck a 10-year-old boy, police said. After Utash stopped his vehicle to help the boy, he was ""severely beaten"" with ""fists and feet,"" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement. Jennifer Moreno, a police spokeswoman, told CNN that all of the alleged assailants were African-American and that none are known to be related to the boy or his family. She said the beating was ""a spontaneous response."" The prosecutor's office said the boy who was struck by Utash's truck was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated for a leg injury and released. Five suspects ranging in age from 16 to 30 have been charged so far for their roles in the attack. The four adult suspects are charged with attempted murder while the fifth, a juvenile, is charged with assault and ethnic intimidation. Michigan's penal code says a person is guilty of ethnic intimidation ""if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, causes physical contact with another person (or) damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person."" It can carry a prison sentence of up to two years. Worthy spokeswoman Maria Miller said the adults are scheduled to go to trial in August and the juvenile in June. She said that there was not sufficient evidence to charge the other suspects with ethnic intimidation, but that the case remains open and the investigation ongoing. A Change.org petition demanding that Moreno charge Utash's assailants with a hate crime had 124 signatures Sunday morning. Daughter Felicia Utash told CNN affiliate WXYZ that she doesn't want to believe the assault on her father was a hate crime, but she is pleased that suspects have been apprehended. Utash's other daughter, Mandi Marie Utash, set up a GoFundMe.com page for her father -- who she says does not have health insurance -- with the goal of raising $50,000. By Sunday morning, more than 4500 donors had contributed $186,298. Fifth suspect charged in beating of Detroit driver . 'Race is being looked at' as a possible motive in attack .

"Editor's note: Abby Houck is a 2011 Cancer for College scholarship recipient who received $3,000 toward her senior year. She was diagnosed with Leukemia in 2001 and graduated in 2012 from the University of Washington with a degree in communications. Houck now works for Cancer for College as director of special projects. (Special to CNN) -- The nonprofit Cancer for College not only provided me with a college scholarship, but it also showed me that goals can be accomplished regardless of adversity. Going to a good college was always high on my agenda. I was in the third grade when I received my first all A's report card. Little did I know receiving grades like this was about to get a whole lot harder, in fact nearly impossible. That summer I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For the next two years my brain would be pummeled with doses of chemotherapy, which would forever change my memory and cognitive ability. Completing my education was one of the hardest and most tumultuous experiences of my life. Between missing two of the most crucial years of school as well as having my brain fried with chemo, just remembering my locker number became a challenge. Yet even though my ability to learn had changed, I always believed that if I worked hard enough I would overcome these setbacks and reach my goal of a college education. In winter 2009 I was officially accepted to the University of Washington. This was not only a monumental moment for me, but for my parents as well, for every time I had a setback in the classroom they had to watch me struggle through it. My acceptance letter could have been bittersweet. Having a child with cancer not only took a toll on my family mentally, but also financially. Over the course of my life my parents had been saving money for me to attend college, yet because of the unexpected costs of treatment, much of that money was used to simply keep me alive. That is where Cancer for College made a difference for my entire family: No longer did my parents have to be stressed about how they were going to afford my tuition, they instead could focus on my happiness in moving forward to a new adventure. Providing college scholarships to cancer survivors is not just about helping a child who has battled a deadly disease; it's also about giving an opportunity to someone who, each time they were faced with hardship, had the courage and determination to prevail. Cancer for College understands the multiple obstacles cancer survivors face, and promotes the fundamental need to give survivors the education they deserve in order to make an impact in this world. Having Cancer for College believe in my college dreams made a vast impact on my life and on the lives of countless other cancer survivors.","Abby Houck is a 2009 Cancer for College Scholarship Recipient .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Brothers at the helm of a company that helped build Hong Kong's skyline and the man who once was the city's number two official were arrested in an investigation of a bribery case has shocked the former British colony. Thomas Kwok, 60, and Raymond Kwok, 58, and their families control Sun Hung Kai Properties, which built the city's three tallest skyscrapers. The billionaires were taken into custody by the city's Independent Commission Against Corruption. Share price Sun Hung Kai, the world's second largest property developer by market capitalization, was down as much as 15% in the first four hours of trading Friday, losing nearly $6 billion in market value. Kwok brothers arrested in raid . According to local media, the ICAC also arrested Rafael Hui, 64, who was Hong Kong's Chief Secretary from 2005 to 2007, and a former advisor to Sun Hung Kai. The trio was held for questioning, but has not been charged. The ICAC hasn't released details of the case. Sun Hung Kai confirmed that the Kwok brothers were taken into custody. In a city where property is king, the sight of local royalty being taken into the ICAC headquarters riveted Hong Kong media, and comes at a time where the city's reputation for transparency has been tainted by a number of scandals, most recently accusations against Chief Executive Donald Tsang that he got a sweetheart deal on an apartment and accepted private jet and yacht trips from businessmen. The arrest also comes on the heels of Hong Kong's selection of a new Chief Executive last Sunday and protests about process, in which only 1,200 people representing the city's elite -- including the two Kwoks-- are allowed to vote. The arrests ""strengthen the perception that government and business is too close, especially now it involves a former number two Hong Kong (politician),"" said David Webb, a corporate governance activist. ""It's part of an overall pattern of increasingly suspicious behavior that is deeply upsetting to residents."" Who are the Kwoks? The Kwok brothers and their family are the 27th richest in the world, with an estimated wealth of $18.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The family has controlling interest of Sun Hung Kai Properties, the world's second largest property developer by market capitalization. The family wealth has grown as Hong Kong property values, fed by increased investment from mainland China, have skyrocketed. The company has developed properties in Mainland China and Singapore, and interests in telecommunications and bus companies in Hong Kong . The Kwoks have been embroiled in a family dispute since 2008, when they led a fight to oust brother Walter Kwok as chairman and chief executive. Thomas and Raymond became chairman and chief executive, respectively, while Walter Kwok remained a non-voting member of the board. ""I thought (the arrest) is probably a follow-on from the family split in 2008 ... it's notable that Walter has not been arrested,"" said Webb. According to court documents filed in 2008 during the family's legal battle, Walter Kwok questioned contracts awarded ""to a select number of contractors,"" as well as a land deal in the city's New Territories. The Kwoks couldn't be reached for comment. Noah's Ark and a kidnapping . The Kwoks developments include the International Commerce Center, International Finance Center and Central Plaza, which are the tallest buildings in Hong Kong and among the highest skyscrapers in the world. Besides their property empire, Thomas is known for his evangelical Christian views. The family was instrumental in the building of a theme park with a life-sized replica of Noah's Ark -- a $103 million project funded by the Hong Kong government but run by Sun Hung Kai. The 450-foot long Ark was built to the specifications listed in the Bible, the architect told CNN in 2009, and includes a restaurant, hotel and a coffin -- in which visitors are encouraged to lay down and think upon their life. Sun Hung Kai property Central Plaza also has a church in its 75th floor atrium. The Kwok family first became Hong Kong tabloid fodder in 1997, when older brother Walter was kidnapped for a week before his family gave a ransom of more than $77 million. Hong Kong and corruption . This latest scandal comes just weeks after Hong Kong newspapers reported that outgoing Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, allegedly received a sweetheart deal on a Shenzhen apartment from a mainland businessman, as well as taking private jet and yacht trips with other Chinese tycoons. Tsang has admitted taking some trips, but said he had paid his own way, and he received no break on the Shenzhen apartment. The arrests of the Tsang's former second in command and the Kwok brothers is ""an earthquake"" for Hong Kong's business community, said Steve Vickers, a security expert and former head of the Hong Kong police Criminal Intelligence Bureau. ""Hong Kong is undoubtedly far less corrupt than any other city in Asia. It does have a very powerful anti-corruption legislation and it is regularly enforced,"" Vickers said. ""But this particular case is so high profile ... the issue will be whether charges follow."" According to Transparency International's 2011 Corruptions Perceptions Index, Hong Kong is the 12th least corrupt countries in the world -- the U.S., by comparison, ranked 24th. The Kwoks will continue to run daily operation of Sun Hung Kai, according to the company board.","The arrest of two of the city's leading tycoons has shocked Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- To mark Nelson Mandela's birthday, we asked what the former South African president means to you. The response on social media has been overwhelming. Leader, courage, hero, inspiration, freedom and hope were among the most often mentioned attributes in the thousands of responses we got on Twitter and Facebook. Tweets and comments poured in from all around the world - those from Africa celebrated what ""Madiba,"" (as he's commonly known) meant for their continent, while those from elsewhere said other leaders should try to emulate his example. ""Madiba reminds us what leaders of today are lacking (purpose). Gandi (sic) and Martin Luther lived, but Mandela is still living the struggles. Long live the people's hero. Long live Madiba 46664,"" Chinoye Emmanuel Ani wrote on Facebook. ""A legend, one who makes me truly proud to be African. Africa should be one nation with Mandela as president at any age. I'll take a 1000-year-old bedridden Mandela as my president any day,"" Facebook user Udoinyang SplyffVeron Itata said. Other tweets and posts talked about how inspirational Mandela is to all generations. Susan Krischan Musial also wrote on Facebook: ""I teach 3rd graders about South Africa through our Children's Museum in NY. ""They never fail to understand the connection of two great men - Mandela and King - making sacrifices for equality for their people and all people. Inspirational in the highest sense of the word."" His birthday also coincides with Mandela Day celebrations, a U.N.-led initiative started on his birthday in 2009. This year, the U.N. launched a campaign asking people to mark the day by devoting 67 minutes of their time to helping others -- one minute for each year Mandela spent fighting for his cause. ""Nelson Mandela gave 67 years of his life to bring change to the people of South Africa,"" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a special message. ""Our gift to him can -- and must -- be to change our world for the better. Today, I join the Nelson Mandela Foundation in urging each and every one of us to perform 67 minutes of public service on Nelson Mandela International Day,"" Ban Ki-moon said. In a testament to his worldwide popularity, tributes and happy birthday messages were being sent all around the web all Wednesday, with people creating video notes, blogging and flooding social media with Mandela Day comments. ""Happy Birthday Nelson Mandela"" was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter for most of the day. A YouTube video called Mandela Story also imagined the former South African leader's life through social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. Created by South Africa-based Prezence Digital, the video asks if Mandela would have spent 27 years imprisoned if he had access to the ""same technology, social media platforms and global monitoring tools as we do today?"" The Nobel Peace prize laureate spent 27 years in South African prison and further 40 years in politics - first as an activist and leader of the opposition movement, and later as the President of South Africa and international symbol he became for his role in bringing down the South Africa's apartheid regime .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A Hezbollah commander suspected in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks of the last 25 years and a reputed role model for Osama bin Laden has been killed in Syria, Hezbollah TV said Wednesday. Hezbollah released this undated photograph of Imad Mughniyeh. Imad Mughniyeh died in an explosion in a residential section of the Syrian capital, Damascus, said Hezbollah's television station, Al-Manar. Hezbollah blamed Israel for the killing, but Israeli officials denied involvement. ""Israel rejects the attempt by terrorist elements to ascribe to it any involvement whatsoever in this incident,"" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in a statement. The FBI said it was awaiting official confirmation of Mughniyeh's death and the details. ""If this information proves true, it would be good news in the ongoing fight against terrorism as one major terrorist will no longer be around to commit additional acts of terror against Americans and others in the world,"" FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko said. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack called Mughniyeh ""a cold-blooded killer, a mass murderer and a terrorist who was responsible for [ending] countless lives.""  Watch the possible repercussions of Mughniyeh's death » . ""The world is a better place"" without the Hezbollah commander, McCormack said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in a statement: ""We welcome the news that Imad Mughniyeh's life of terror has finally come to an end. From Beirut to Dhahran, he orchestrated bombings, kidnappings and hijackings in which hundreds of American service members were killed. Hopefully, his demise will bring some measure of comfort to the families of all those military men he murdered."" Intelligence sources described Mughniyeh as one of the craftiest and deadliest terrorists in the world who managed to elude capture for decades by changing his appearance and covering his footsteps. Western intelligence agencies long suspected Mughniyeh in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 63 people. He also is suspected in the truck bombing that year of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, an attack that killed 241 people and preceded the U.S. military withdrawal from Lebanon. Before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. officials blamed Mughniyeh for the deaths of more Americans around the world than any other terror suspect, CNN reported in 2001. A month after the attacks in the United States, the FBI debuted its Most Wanted Terrorists list with Mughniyeh on it. Mughniyeh was not suspected of involvement in 9/11, but he was a role model for bin Laden, who used the 1983 Marine barracks bombing as a standard, CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said. ""Because if you think about the attack, pretty much immediately afterwards President Reagan ordered the United States out of Lebanon, and so that's the model bin Laden wanted to implement everywhere, attack the United States in places like Yemen or in Kenya, or in Tanzania, or even the United States itself and it will pull out of the Middle East."" Mughniyeh had been involved in training both terrorists in Iraq and some of the Shiite militia there, including elements of Moqtada al Sadr's army, two U.S. intelligence officials told CNN. The officials were not authorized to speak for attribution. Mughniyeh also had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers just prior to the outbreak of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon, one of the officials said, and was involved in planning Hezbollah's military operations during that conflict. Mughniyeh was involved in providing 50 tons of weapons to Palestinian terrorists in 2002, that official said. Authorities blame Mughniyeh for the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA Flight 847, which gripped the attention of TV viewers around the world for more than two weeks. Hijackers seized the plane as it traveled from Athens, Greece, to Rome, Italy, forcing it to land at the Beirut airport. U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem was shot and killed during the 17-day ordeal. Kurt Carlson, a TWA 847 passenger who was badly beaten, recalled that Mughniyeh ""looked like really a fanatic."" ""As he talked about Israel, the tone of his voice kept rising, until finally he was just screaming and his eyes were glassy, and we didn't know what he was going to do,"" Carlson said. ""I mean, I thought he was just going to pull out a gun and start shooting."" Flight 847 may have been the one careless move that the man in the shadows made. Mughniyeh reportedly left a fingerprint on the plane, gaining him a place on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list with a $5 million bounty on his head. Western intelligence agencies also suspect Mughniyeh in the early '90s bombings of the Israeli Embassy and a Jewish cultural center in Argentina that killed 119 people; and the kidnapping of Western hostages -- two of whom were killed -- in Lebanon in the 1980s. Israel had come close to finding Mughniyeh before and killing him, said Yossi Melman, an intelligence reporter for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. In 1992, intelligence agents tracked him and his brother to a Beirut garage. ""They shadowed his brother and planted the bomb in the garage, knowing that Imad Mughniyeh would arrive there, but he was late and the bomb exploded and the brother was killed. Probably they missed him by a few minutes,"" Melman said. A former head of Israel's intelligence agency said Mughniyeh's unseen hand apparently struck the first blow in the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon that seeks to establish a fundamentalist Muslim state. Former Mossad chief Danny Yaton said Mughniyeh appeared to be responsible for the attack that killed eight Israeli soldiers and the abduction of two others, triggering Israel Defense Forces operations in Lebanon. U.S. authorities tried to seize Mughniyeh on at least two occasions -- in France in 1986 and in Saudi Arabia in 1995, CNN reported. Former CIA officer Robert Baer said Mughniyeh was ""head and shoulders above any other terrorist in the world."" Mughniyeh reportedly destroyed all records and documents describing his past. He was believed to have been born in 1962, growing up in the Shiite neighborhoods of Beirut. Palestinian militants recruited him as a teenager, and he eventually was in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's elite guard. The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon apparently further inflamed Mughniyeh's hatred for the Jewish state.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper, wanted in New Orleans in connection with the alleged rapes of two women, has turned himself in to Los Angeles authorities. A source told CNN that Sharper made arrangements to surrender to Los Angeles police and did so without incident Thursday evening. Los Angeles police confirmed the arrest but did not provide details. Earlier Thursday, the Orleans Parish district attorney's office in Louisiana had said Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, each face two counts of aggravated rape. If convicted, the two men face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole. The New Orleans charges are in addition to charges Sharper already faces in California. Nunez turned himself in to the Orleans Parish district attorney's office shortly after 9 a.m. Friday. Last week, Sharper pleaded not guilty to the California charges, which included two counts of rape by use of drugs. CNN reached out to an attorney for Sharper and to Nunez Thursday, but neither returned messages seeking comment. Prosecutors in Louisiana said the two alleged rapes occurred on September 23 in a New Orleans apartment. The alleged rapes in California occurred in October and last month, authorities said. Prosecutors there said the five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is also under investigation in Arizona and Nevada. Police in Tempe, Arizona, say they expect to file charges against Sharper soon. ""We have nothing yet. We anticipate filing charges very shortly and we are still waiting on a couple of results from the crime lab,"" Sgt. Mike Pooley said Thursday. Las Vegas police said Friday that ""an active and ongoing investigation surrounding Darren Sharper"" was being conducted by the department's sexual assault unit. Police provided no other details. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. According to the report, the woman was with two friends at a Miami Beach club in September or October 2012 when she met Sharper. The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week. One of Sharper's lawyers disputed all the rape allegations last week at his hearing. ""It was all consensual contact with women who wanted to be in his company,"" Leonard Levine said. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. CNN's Paul Vercammen reported from Los Angeles, and Saeed Ahmed wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Steve Almasy, Dave Alsup, Suzanne Presto and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Darren Sharper now faces rape charges in two states .

"LIJIANG, China (CNN) -- In the northwest of China's mountainous Yunnan province, among the world's most biodiverse areas, a green revolution is under way among rural residents. Zhang Chengui was the first to adopt alternative energy in Yunnan's Meiquan Village. In Meiquan Village near Lashi Lake, Zhang Chengui says he has been able to maximize profits by spending more time growing crops since installing a biogas digester-greenhouse, solar water heater, energy-efficient stove and rain-collecting cistern. He installed them with loans from the bank and grants from The Nature Conservancy, becoming in 2003 the first in his village to adopt alternative energy. Since then, his income has tripled to 40,000-50,000 yuan ($5,800-$7,300), he said. The region, which sees the crossing of three of Asia's great rivers -- the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween -- is a poor one, with firewood traditionally being the source for cooking, heating and housing for half a million households. However, despite a decade-long ban on commercial logging, such a firewood-dependent lifestyle poses a threat to Yunnan's forests and its more than 17,000 plants and wildlife, including the endangered golden monkey. Zhang's status as Meiquan's village leader made him a natural choice to launch the alternative energy project there. By enlisting him as an ally, The Nature Conservancy was able to slowly persuade other villagers, who would otherwise be hesitant to invest their limited money. Hundreds of households in the area have followed his lead. Under the Nature Conservancy's alternative energy project, 820 households adopted biogas digesters, and 600 adopted solar water heaters, many of them choosing both, according to Zhu Li, communications manager at the nongovernmental organization's Kunming office. The Nature Conservancy says it and partners have taken the alternative energy project to 420 villages in Yunnan, installing more than 14,000 biogas units, energy efficient stoves and solar water heating systems. Most of those villages are remote and had relied on nearby forests as opposed to a power grid. To tap money for such devices, villagers can receive small loans under the GreenVillage Credit program. Part of the United Nations Environment Programme's China Rural Energy Enterprises Development (CREED) initiative, the program has successful precedents in five African nations -- Senegal, Mali, Ghana, Zambia and Tanzania -- and northeast Brazil. The approach, developed by clean energy investor E+Co, helps entrepreneurs take risks in an otherwise emerging sector in order to gain public trust and attract commercial investment. The goal is to overcome the hurdles generally posed by limited money and training in such remote areas -- and reduce fuel wood consumption by 75 percent. The initiative -- which links the government with nongovernmental organizations and financial institutions -- harnesses financing, alternative energy sources, entrepreneurship and training into income-generating activities. In addition, the CREED initiative aims to provide alternatives for rural areas where women and children shoulder the burden of collecting firewood and wood burning. The number of hours spent daily, as well as the detrimental health effects of wood burning and indoor pollution -- such as eye and respiratory ailments -- risk contributing to the persistence of the area's poverty. In a report last year (""Investing in a Climate for Change""), the U.N. Environment Programme said that finance is ""essential"" in addressing climate change. ""Without substantial and sustained investment in clean energy and other measures now, the reality of a global economy free of climate change impacts will remain a distant dream,"" the report noted. For most Yunnan households, whose average yearly income is a few hundred dollars, a biogas digester ($150-$300), a solar water heater ($400), or an efficiency stove ($40-80) is too costly, The Nature Conservancy points out. Under GreenVillage Credit, households can apply for loans up to 10,000 yuan ($1460) after mapping out their income-generating activity from such devices. To offset any default, 5 percent of the loan is deposited at a bank as a guarantee, and a solidarity group of five to eight households is formed to share responsibility for the member's loan repayments. In return, participants get technical support and have about 18 months to pay the loan off. Nearly 600 households have been able to tap more than $300,000 in loans to purchase such energy-efficient systems and generate income, thanks to GreenVillage Credit. Whereas Zhang's family used to spend hours seeking, chopping and carrying firewood, the switch to alternative energy has enabled them to save the equivalent of 100 working days, he estimated. Thanks to the solar heater, a shower is a daily possibility, and the biogas digester -- which converts human and pig waste to a clean gas that can be pressurized -- has enabled cooking and lighting. More time is then left to devote to his income-generating greenhouse, which uses waste slurry left over from the biogas digester as fertilizer for his grapes, strawberries, apples, plums, cherries, peaches, eggplant, cucumber, tomatoes and squash. Thanks to increased income, his children were freed up to attend the university, said the 53-year-old Zhang, whose own education ended with high school. Zhang's children have since graduated; his son became a magazine editor, while his daughter became a government official, Zhang said. ""What we have today cannot be separated from alternative energy,"" Zhang told journalists visiting his home last year. His life's goal, he said, was to educate the next generation well and see an improvement in his grandchildren's lives. Elsewhere in China, biogas projects have proven more popular than in Yunnan, where colder temperatures generally require a greenhouse to cover the units. As of the end of 2007, more than 26.5 million rural households were using household biodigesters, saving the equivalent of 44 million tons of CO2 emissions, according to China's State Council Information Office. The number is notable for a country criticized for its environmental record while trying to bridge a wide income gap between urban dwellers and rural residents who lack access to modern energy services.","Half a million households have traditionally used wood for cooking, heating, housing .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)  -- Police have arrested a South Korean couple whose toddler starved to death while they were raising a virtual child online, authorities said. The couple fed their 3-month-old daughter once a day between marathon stretches in a local Internet cafe, where they were raising a virtual child in the fantasy role-playing game Prius Online, police told local reporters Friday. Prius Online is a 3-D game in which players nurture an online companion, Anima, a young girl with mysterious powers who grows and increases her skills as the game progresses. Police have not identified the 41-year-old father and 25-year-old mother, who lived in Suwon, a suburb south of Seoul. But the father apologized, speaking to reporters. ""I wish that she hadn't got sick and that she will live well in heaven forever. And as the father, I am sorry,"" he said. The baby reportedly died five months ago. South Korea has one of the world's fastest broadband networks. Seoul has won international awards for e-governance. Online gaming teams are sponsored by major conglomerates and 24-hour, high-speed Internet cafes, known as PC Bangs, dot every urban neighborhood. Police said the couple had lost their jobs and used the game as an escape from reality, especially after the birth of their premature baby. ""They instead played an online game in which they raised a virtual character so as to escape from reality, which led to the death of their real baby,"" Chung Jin-won, a police officer in Suwon, told Yonhap News Agency. ""South Korea remains a very conservative society so people who fall outside the norm can come under severe stress and pressure,"" said Michael Breen, the Seoul-based author of ""The Koreans.""

"RIVNE, Ukraine (CNN) -- Camouflage-clad militiamen hoist AK-47 assault rifles to their shoulders and blast off a 21-shot salute. As the muzzles flash, another squad of ultra-nationalist fighters chants, ""Our hero is not dead. Glory to him."" A few yards away, a Ukrainian Orthodox priest swings an incense burner. A mother and father weep over the coffin of their dead son. The killing of radical nationalist leader Oleksandr Muzychko, also known by his nickname ""Sasha the White"" was enough to make shaven-headed, hardened paramilitary men cry. ""He was like a brother to me and my comrades. But that bastard Putin murdered him,"" said Anatoly Valsyuk, as he choked back tears. Valsyuk served under Muzychko, who was commander in western Ukraine for the ""Right Sector,"" a recently formed alliance of right-wing and nationalist political parties and militia forces. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said its special agents killed Muzychko Monday night here in the western city of Rivne as he resisted arrest. The Interior Ministry says he was a gangster. But Right Sector leaders are calling for the Interior Minister Arsen Avakov to resign and face murder charges over Muzychko's death. They say the Avakov is one of Ukraine's corrupt old-guard politicians and that he and his men may even have been taking orders from Moscow. Whatever the true details of his Muzychko's death, it is a sign that political partners in the new Ukraine may have old scores to settle -- divisions that Moscow may be poised to exploit. Muzychko and the Right Sector are credited with playing a lead role in this winter's protests that toppled Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovitch. The nationalist paramilitary militias won admiration from many ordinary Ukrainians for their stiff discipline and determined street-fighting tactics. Mourner Svetlana Bilyus, an English-speaking interpreter, had made the three-and-a-half hour drive from the capital to Rivne to be at the funeral Wednesday. She said she met Muzychko only once, at the barricades around Kiev's emblematic Independence Square or ""Maidan,"" the scene of the deadliest clashes between anti-government protestors and Yanukovitch's security forces in January and February. ""He was a national hero. He's an inspiration for millions of Ukrainian people, especially young people. He's a local Robin Hood,"" Bilyus said . Muzychko, 52, reveled in his tough-guy image. His Facebook page is plastered with images of him, crop-haired in combat fatigues giving a raised-arm, clenched fist salute. Others show him relaxing in his favorite Oakland Raiders cap and jacket. According to his comrades, he led a small unit of Ukrainian nationalists to fight alongside Muslim Chechen rebels against the Russians. In contrast, elderly women on the sidelines of his funeral attested to Muzychko's ""Robin Hood"" character. They said he and his men had campaigned heavily for better pension rights for old people across the region. Paramilitary units under the umbrella of the Right Sector have sparked the alarm of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin says he fears that these nationalist groups, which he refers to as ""fascists,"" will hunt down and attack ethnic-Russians living in Ukraine. Is Russia done after Crimea? In the wake of the overthrow of the Yanukovitch regime, no such widespread incidents have been reported. But Putin used this as a pretext to forcibly annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Now, according to the Pentagon, there are an estimated 30,000 Russian troops, armed with heavy artillery and tanks, massing along Ukraine's eastern border. The Ukrainian government puts the figure even higher. U.S. and NATO officials say the Russians could roll into Ukraine any time, without warning in a bid to annex Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine or even push into Trans-Nistria, a disputed enclave in the former Soviet republic of Moldova. Ukrainian troops in Crimea opted not to defend their bases in the face of advancing Russian forces. Instead they surrendered naval, air and army facilities one by one or waited until they were overrun. Ukraine's Defense Ministry estimates up to 75% of the approximately 15,000 troops based there may have defected to the Russians. But in an interview with CNN, the top national leader of Right Sector, Dmitry Yarosh said fighters under his command would not stand by if Putin ordered the Russian army into other parts of Ukraine. ""The Right Sector will do its best to launch a partisan, guerrilla war. The land will literally burn under the feet of the invaders. We will not be lambs to the slaughter. We will defend our independence by any means necessary,"" he said. Despite fears Ukrainian government security forces could target other Right Sector leaders, Yarosh made the trip to Rivne to march alongside Muzychko's coffin. He was flanked by black-clad bodyguards, one brandishing a Russian-made machine-pistol, the other a high-powered sniper rifle. Yarosh, too, blamed Russian sympathizers within the Interior Ministry for killing Muzychko. Ukraine's Parliament ousts minister; military upgrade wanted . The popularity of Right Sector and Ukraine's radical nationalist groups was bolstered so significantly in the anti-government protests that Yarosh thinks he has a real chance at winning the presidency in elections in May. But he stresses personal power is not his main ambition. ""The presidential post is not the goal in itself. We understand we may win or we may lose. This post offers the possibility to bring quality and systematic changes to the country as well as the possibility to 'reload' the power structure so there is the change of elites not just a change of faces,"" Yarosh said. But the rise of Right Sector is not only worrying Moscow but also some Western government officials. Some believe Right Sector is a safe haven for right-wing extremists and even Ukrainian neo-Nazis. Such charges stem back partly to the legacy of Ukraine's nationalist, partisan forces before and during World War II. While it is true that Ukrainian nationalists sought the help of Nazi Germany to drive the Soviets out of Ukrainian territory, some later fell afoul of the Nazis and ended up in German concentration camps. These days, Yarosh spends a lot of his time trying to dispel such fears. He has even appointed a Ukrainian Jew as one of his most trusted media and communications advisers. ""Right Sector is a nationalistic organization. But Ukrainian nationalism has nothing to do with the German Nazis or the Italian fascists,"" Yarosh said. ""We have always been and will always be against xenophobia, anti-Semitism and for Ukraine to have an independent nation where the rights of all the minorities will be guaranteed,"" he explained. It's hard to argue with Yarosh as you meet the stare of his ice-green eyes. But it's also easy to worry about Right Sector's true ideological leanings when you see the red-and-black flags, stylized insignia and other paraphernalia of its militiamen. As an afternoon drizzle came down on Muzychko's funeral, tears snaked along the wrinkles of his father Ivan's face. His mother Olena lowered a loaf of wholemeal bread into the grave -- a local tradition to ensure her son would not go hungry in the afterlife. And dozens of men who once marched to Muzychko's command now filed past his grave, tossing handfuls of damp earth onto his coffin. In unison they vowed -- no surrender to the Russians.

"(CNN) -- The legacy of the Hatfields vs. the McCoys looms large in Mingo County, West Virginia. Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and ""punishment"" that in one case allegedly amounted to denying the accused an ice-cream break. The case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013. The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her ""breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks."" Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped. Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday. She would not divulge what those charges were. Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges. Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an ""extreme"" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied. As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said ""the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest."" That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement. Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption. In the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case. Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that ""a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders."" That investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was ""ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims."" When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official ""'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,"" the attorney general's court filing said. The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators ""threatened (the girls) with discipline"" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims were retaliated against when they did. The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the ""bullying"" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school. The next day she was written up again, this time for ""insubordination,"" according to the filing. The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official ""retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level."" When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal ""went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.'"" CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned. Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said ""the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County.""

"(CNN) -- Imagine if every time you went to the pharmacy, shopping for medications was a complete guessing game. What if drug makers weren't required to disclose ingredients in their products or prove their safety, leaving you without a way to determine whether what you're buying is safe for you and your family? You would live in fear that the medicine you purchased to make your child feel better could actually harm them. It's a frightening scenario, and one that we would never accept. Yet, because of our outdated and broken toxic chemicals law, that is precisely the situation with the consumer products we use every day. These products -- from baby bottles and shampoo to car seats and sofas -- contain tens of thousands of untested chemicals. Last week, I joined with hundreds of moms from across the country to sound the alarm and call on Congress to fix this broken law. These parents came to Washington because they're worried that the chemicals found in these ordinary products are putting their families' health at risk. They're right to worry, because in recent studies, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 212 industrial chemicals -- including six cancer-causing chemicals -- coursing through Americans' bodies. In essence, the American public has become a living, breathing repository for toxic chemical substances. These chemicals have been linked to numerous diseases. Studies show as much as 5% of childhood cancers, 10% of neurobehavioral disorders and 30% of childhood asthma cases are associated with hazardous chemicals. The existing law that regulates chemical safety, the Toxic Substances Control Act, was written in the 1970s and is ineffective and outdated. In nearly 35 years, it has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to require testing of only 200 of the more than 80,000 chemicals in its inventory. What's more, EPA has been able to ban only five substances. The law is so broken that when EPA tried to ban uses of asbestos, a known cancer-causing chemical, its rules were overturned in court. This status quo is dangerous and unacceptable. That's why I've introduced a bill called the Safe Chemicals Act, which simply requires that chemical makers prove their chemicals are safe before they end up in our products and bodies. It would ensure that chemicals are tested and that those deemed dangerous are taken off the market. But sadly, some chemical companies and their lobbyists are fighting reform at every turn. Just recently, the Chicago Tribune exposed a concerted effort by some chemical companies to use dirty tricks and junk science to mislead the public about the dangers of their products. The report detailed how industry bankrolled experts who testified with fake stories, all in an effort to protect the health of their profits instead of the health of our families and children. They've specifically fought to protect flame retardant chemicals such as chlorinated Tris, which is so dangerous that companies voluntarily stopped using it in children's pajamas more than 30 years ago. But while scientists have warned us about chemicals such as chlorinated Tris since the 1970s, they continue to be used in products all around us, including furniture, cribs, mattresses and high-chair cushions. Now, let's be clear: The Safe Chemicals Act is not an attack on chemicals. Chemicals are used in hundreds of useful products, and most of the thousands of chemicals we use everyday are safe. But we need to be able to separate the safe from the dangerous. Under our current law, we can't do that. That's what this bill fixes. The chemical industry's lobbyists argue that the cost of testing all these chemicals would be too high. But what is the cost of our children's health? For three years, I've invited input from all sides of this issue, including the chemical industry. But despite claims of interest in reform, industry lobbyists are refusing to offer concrete suggestions and trying to run out the clock on our efforts. We cannot accept inaction any longer. It is time to come together to finally fix this law and protect our families from toxic chemicals once and for all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank R. Lautenberg.","Sen. Frank Lautenberg: Congress needs to fix our outdated toxic chemicals law .

"(CNN) -- An al Qaeda group claimed responsibility Tuesday for coordinated attacks on two Iraqi prisons that a lawmaker said freed more than 500 inmates, including some senior members of the militant group. Militants supported by suicide bombers and armed with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns attacked two Iraqi prisons Sunday and Monday as inmates inside rioted and set fires, ending in a massive jailbreak, authorities said. The attacks occurred Sunday night at Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, and al-Taji prison, north of the capital. At least 21 inmates and at least eight prison guards were killed, the Iraqi Justice Ministry said, while 25 inmates and 14 guards were wounded. Blast during sermon in Iraq mosque kills at least 18 . The Justice Ministry did not say how many inmates had escaped, but lawmaker Hakim al-Zamili said Monday that more than 500 fighters had gotten away. A statement posted on radical Islamist websites and purporting to be from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for the attacks and said that ""more than 500 of the best jihadi fighters"" were among the freed inmates. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of the statement, which was signed by the group's Information Ministry instead of the more usual official media wing. State-run TV Al Iraqiya reported that guards at Abu Ghraib, also known as Baghdad Central Prison, facilitated the prison break. Al Iraqiya ran part of an interview with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said ""the guards who were present inside the prison were part of this militia, they were complicit, and they are the ones who opened the prison gates."" Al Iraqiya TV also reported that the Ministry of Interior had arrested a number of the escapees, but the report did not specify a number or from which prison they had escaped. Ramzy Mardini, adjunct fellow at the Beirut-based Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies, compared the attacks to a previous prison break in Yemen. Many of those who escaped then belonged to al Qaeda. ""Like in Yemen in 2006, this could be al Qaeda's so-called great escape moment in Iraq, whereby a prison break is large and significant enough to exhibit noticeable impact on the insurgency and the group's effectiveness for the foreseeable future,"" Mardini wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Al Qaeda has certainly proven its reach over the past year to still exhibit a capacity to pull off high-profile and coordinated attacks. But this takes the cake, especially given the scale of the operation, its potential impact and the fortified nature of the target,"" he said. Mardini described the attacks as al Qaeda's ""best advertisement"" in terms of propaganda since 2009 bombings in Baghdad. Bombers strike in Iraq; more than 20 dead . Meanwhile, at least 16 people were killed and dozens wounded in a new wave of explosions and shooting in Baghdad and Mosul on Tuesday, according to police officials. Three roadside bombs exploded in rapid succession near a popular restaurant in southern Baghdad, killing seven people and wounding 28 others. A car bomb and two roadside bombs outside a Sunni mosque, also in southern Baghdad, killed four people and wounded 15 more, officials said. In western Mosul, the northern Iraq metropolis, gunmen at a livestock market killed three Shiite people, who police said were visiting from Baghdad. Two prison guards were shot dead in eastern Mosul. Attacks on Monday also rocked Mosul. A suicide bomber blew himself up at an Iraqi army post in northern Mosul's Kokjili district in the morning, police said. At least 16 people were killed and 21 were wounded. Both civilians and soldiers were among the victims. Later, at least four people were killed and two were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near a Sunni mosque in the al-Muthana neighborhood of central Mosul, police said. The deadly fighting is the latest in a string of violence in recent months, much of it stemming from discord between Sunnis and Shiites. Sunnis have long felt politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam Hussein era. They enjoyed more political clout during Hussein's rule before his ouster after the U.S.-led 2003 invasion.

"(CNN) -- The killings of three people at Jewish sites in Kansas are a stark reminder that even as hate groups are on the decline in the United States, some among them are still deadly dangerous. A leader of the Anti-Defamation League called Monday for institutions across the country to ""use this horrible tragedy as a learning experience"" and tighten their own security systems so that if ""God forbid, this does happen, that the least ... harm can come to their people."" The ADL warned last week that violent attacks against Jewish targets could spike as the Passover holiday -- which begins Monday night and lasts eight days -- coincides with Hitler's birthday on April 20. Woman lost her son and father . ""Unfortunately throughout history, Jews have been a target around the holidays. We always feel it's necessary for Jewish organizations to try to ramp up security,"" the ADL's Evan Bernstein told CNN. While anti-Semitic incidents in the United States declined last year, the number of violent incidents went up, according to an ADL study. Thirty-one reported assaults in 2013 included four men in Brooklyn attacking a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke; a group of girls throwing a bottle at a 12-year-old girl, with one of them calling her ""dirty Jew""; and an attack on a man in Los Angeles by five men who yelled ""Heil Hitler"" before striking him, the ADL says. The suspect in the Kansas shootings -- identified by police as Frazier Glenn Cross, who has also used the name Frazier Glenn Miller -- has long spoken openly about his hatred for Jews and called for ""exterminating"" them, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The SPLC once sued him ""for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and using intimidation tactics against African Americans,"" the center says. The SPLC tracks groups that ""have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristic."" ""After four years of spectacular growth driven by the 2008 election of President Obama and the nearly simultaneous collapse of the economy, the radical right in America saw its first significant decrease in 2013,"" the SPLC says. The number of hate groups shrank last year for the second year in a row, down to 939, according to the center's calculations. These groups were demoralized by Obama's re-election, have been losing battles on issues such as same-sex marriage, and lost support when the ""litany of disasters"" they predicted -- such as the United Nations invading the United States -- didn't happen, the SPLC says. ""None of this is to suggest that the radical right in America does not remain highly dangerous,"" the SPLC warned in its report earlier this year. ""The weakening of groups often has the effect of fostering, rather than retarding, followers' decisions to finally act out violently."" ""Despite the decline, there are still enormous numbers of radical groups operating -- more than 2,000 of them, including hate and Patriot organizations. The single most important factor that has driven the growth of the radical right over the last five years, the ongoing demographic change to a non-white majority over the course of the next three decades, is still a source of enormous angst and rage for many."" Many of the hate groups the SPLC cites are anti-Semitic as well as racist. They include Christian Identity Groups, which espouse ""a racist reading of the Bible that describes non-white people as lacking souls and Jews as the biological descendants of Satan,"" and neo-Nazi groups, among others. The SPLC also cites the New Black Panther Party, whose ""white- and Jew-bashing lawyer Malik Zulu Shabazz relinquished his post,"" and was replaced by Hashim Nzinga, also ""known for his anti-Semitism and anti-white racism."" The existence of these groups does not automatically suggest threats of violence. But the tragedy in Kansas ""shows that one person with the mindset of that kind of hate can really damage a community in the deepest way,"" Bernstein said. The SPLC's criteria for designating hate groups are a source of controversy. In 2012, the Family Research Council lashed back at the SPLC for designating it as a hate group.

"(CNN) -- Police cars and fire trucks surrounded Jefferson County Open School in Colorado Monday, as hazmat crews decontaminated students outside -- spraying them down, fully clothed, in cordoned-off sections under a blue tent. Students coming in after recess had reported eye and skin irritations. Thirty kids and a teacher's aide were eventually treated for symptoms similar to an allergic reaction, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. A handful were taken to the hospital. The rest were evacuated to a church down the street. The K-12 Colorado school remained closed on Tuesday as investigators tried to figure out what ""toxic irritant"" had been released on the playground. They quickly figured out that it wasn't fertilizer or pepper spray, KUSA reports. Six habanero chili peppers caused this hot mess. Investigators found the spicy fruits scattered in the wood chips near the playground, school district communications director Lyyn Setzler told CNN. It isn't known how the peppers got there, she said. Habaneros generally score between 100,000 and 350,000 units on the Scoville scale, which measures chili pepper hotness. ""The scale is actually a measure of the concentration of the chemical compound capsaicin, which is the active component that produces the heat sensation for humans,"" according to ChiliWorld.com. For comparison, jalepeno peppers usually score 2,500 to 5,000 units. When you grind (or step on) habanero peppers, capsaicin particles can be released into the air. Breathing them in or getting them in your eyes can cause a burning sensation. ""As a person who grows some painful peppers, I have learned the hard way to take heed when handling them,"" says CNN Eatocracy editor Kat Kinsman. ""It's all fun and games until you get some pepper juice in your eye, and then it's as if the sun is exploding."" The spiciest dish I ever ate . The school is washing down the playground equipment and surfaces that may have been exposed to the pepper oil, KUSA reports. The wood chips are also being replaced. All the students who were brought to hospital for evaluation were released the same day, and all are fine, according to the local fire department. Setzler says the school expects to re-open tomorrow morning. CNN's Stefan Simons contributed to this story.","Jefferson County Open School was evacuated on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Pressure is mounting on Ukraine to clean up its human rights record ahead of the Euro 2012 finals next month, with the EU Commission's president the latest high-profile leader to boycott the football championships. Just weeks before the tournament kicks off, president Jose Manuel Barroso has rejected an invitation to attend the final in Kiev -- citing concerns over the treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. ""The president has decided that for the time being and in the present circumstances he doesn't want to travel to or attend any events in Ukraine,"" his spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. She confirmed this was due to concerns over the treatment of former prime minister Tymoshenko, and added: ""The EU and president Barroso have sent strong signals of their serious concerns over what is happening in Ukraine."" Photos emerged on Friday of Tymoshenko covered in bruises which the 51-year-old claims that prison guards inflicted. Officials have denied the allegations. Tymoshenko, a fierce rival of president Victor Yanukovych, is serving a seven-year jail sentence for abuse of office and faces another trial on tax evasion charges. Daughter Yevgenia said her mother's life is now in danger since starting a hunger strike more than a week ago, in a statement on the website of British newspaper the Guardian. European leaders have continued to turn their backs on the June 8-July 1 event, which will be co-hosted by Poland, with the EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding also refusing to travel to the Ukraine. German chancellor Angela Merkel is reportedly considering missing the tournament, with any such visit depending on Tymoshenko's release. Her environment minister Nobert Rottgen has already urged Berlin government ministers to boycott matches. Neither Ukraine nor Poland have previously hosted such a top-level sports event, which is run by European football's governing body UEFA. UEFA president Michael Platini last month complained of ""crooks and bandits"" hiking hotel rates in Ukraine, while last Friday bombings in the city of Dnipropetrovsk raised security fears ahead of the tournament. At least 30 people were injured, but the Ukraine government has assured UEFA it was taking ""all necessary steps"" to ensure the safety of around 1.3 million fans expected to watch 16 national teams go head-to-head. No-one has claimed responsibility for the bombs, which were placed in four rubbish bins and exploded at short intervals, but some reports linked them to protests against Tymonshenko's treatment. The attacks cast further doubt over Ukraine's's ability to stage such an event, and UEFA has taken the unprecedented step of raising political concerns with the East European nation. ""Even though UEFA, as a sports organization, never interferes in political matters, it has asked the Ukrainian delegation to convey these concerns to the competent authorities,"" it said.","EU Commission's president Jose Manuel Barroso snubs invitation to Euro 2012 final .

"(CNN) -- Russia will not cede control of the Crimea any time soon. Western saber-rattling would prove hollow: NATO has insufficient forces in the region to challenge Russian control and economic sanctions are not likely to work. Paranoia about Western threats to its security incline Russians to endure great costs to assert the ""sphere of privileged interest"" Vladimir Putin claims regarding former Soviet Republics now outside the Russian Federation. Near term, Russia holds the cards. It supplies Europe with about 30% of its natural gas, or 8% of its energy overall. While that gas can be replaced, Europe can't change course overnight. Europe has substantial shale deposits that France, Germany and several others have chosen not to develop. Exploiting shale deposits, building more nuclear plants and solar facilities, importing more oil and gas from North America and the Middle East, and building infrastructure to effectively deploy those resources would take several years. Longer term, Russia has much more to lose. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia has become acutely dependent on Western markets to drive its economy, but it has not fundamentally modernized its industries or its geopolitical thinking about the West. Oil and gas account for roughly 70% of Russian exports, and it sends the West significant amounts of aluminum and other metals. But Russia's manufacturing sector as a whole remains profoundly inefficient and uncompetitive, and the country relies on the West for sophisticated financial services and a broad range of technology and consumer products. Crony capitalism and the dominance of billionaire oligarchs squeeze out small entrepreneurs that drive so much innovation and progress in the West. The Russian Federation depends on the petroleum industry for 50% of its revenue. If Europe finds substitutes for its oil and gas, Russia simply would not be able to pay for the Western products it has become accustomed to buying. Moscow won't be able to finance its military and foreign adventures, or pay for the extensive patronage system that has kept Vladimir Putin in power since 1999. The oligarchs would be a lot poorer and much less able to enjoy penthouses in New York and ski retreats in Colorado. However, most Russians would rather risk becoming much poorer than relent to U.S. and European pressures, because of their ingrained fears about Western threats to their security. With or without Putin at the helm, the West should not anchor policy on false notions it can change Moscow's thinking about the Ukraine or other former Soviet states by reasoning with its leaders or with threats to freeze assets, cut off trade and the like. Unless the West can impose significant costs on Russia for its aggressive policies, reduce Europe's vulnerability to a natural gas embargo and curtail Moscow's financial resources, it can count on Russia asserting military power when its leaders perceive threats to Russian interests in neighboring states. Joint efforts with the Europeans are essential. An across-the-board U.S.-European freeze on assets would be foolhardy. Russia could easily retaliate against U.S. and European investments in petroleum, autos, banking, and other sectors. However, targeted visa restrictions on travel to the United States and Europe, and limited freezes on access to the bank accounts and real estate assets, for the Russian political and military leaders responsible for the Crimean invasion would send a clear and poignant message. Europeans should move quickly and decisively to develop their own natural gas and other alternatives. Eliminating dependence on Russian gas might not end Russia's paranoia -- in fact it could feed it -- but it would at least deprive Moscow of its ability to threaten Europeans with embargoes and neighboring states with military actions. Russians could try to sell more natural gas in Asia, but those prospects are limited. Already, Russian oil producers simply burn off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in Europe. The United States should not quickly volunteer to send Europe liquefied natural gas. France, Germany and several other European countries have shunned the environmental risks of developing shale gas and nuclear power. The United States should insist Europeans share the environmental risks . The high cost of liquefying and shipping U.S. gas to Europe requires that Europe also develop its own resources to fully unyoke itself from dependence on Russia and limit their strategic vulnerability. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Morici.","Peter Morici: Russia will not cede control of the Crimea any time soon .

"(CNN) -- It could be the spartan living environment, or perhaps growing up in the thin air nearly 3,000 meters above sea level -- or maybe it's the influence of a legendary local coach.

Her elder sister Ejegayehu was an Olympic silver medalist in 2004, while younger sister Genzebe was the 2009 world junior cross country champion and a younger brother Dejene is a promising 800m runner. Sporting excellence flows through the family genes: Dibaba is the cousin of double Olympic 10,000m champion Derartu Tulu, while she was also inspired by another cousin -- Bekelu, who she often calls her sister, and was an international distance runner. They all hail from Bekoji, a town of fewer than 20,000 people set high in the mountains of the Arsi province, but with a freakish record for track and field success. ""Bekoji has produced so many great athletes starting from Derartu. In Beijing, Kenenisa (Bekele) and I brought home two gold medals each,"" Dibaba said. ""Bekoji has strong runners. Bekoji is great and can produce even greater athletes."" It has echoes of Jamaica's Trelawny district, another rugged rural setting which has produced a string of sprint champions, including six-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt. Before Dibaba, the great Kenenisa Bekele -- a three-time Olympic champion and double world record-holder in the 5,000 and 10,000m -- was the most famous product of the area. Both were coached by Sentayehu Eshetu in their important formative years. Inspiring coach . ""Sentayehu knew that my cousin Derartu Tulu ran, he knows that my sisters ran too. That's why he encouraged me to start running and used to tell me that I would be a great runner, he knew I would be a fast runner,"" Dibaba said. Success clearly breeds success -- the peak of which came at the 2008 Beijing Olympics as Dibaba and Bekele both won distance doubles -- and she believes the conveyor belt of talent will keep going. Bekele has suffered injury problems since 2010, and he had to settle for fourth in the 10,000m at London 2012 as his younger brother Tariku chased home Britain's Mo Farah and Galen Rupp of the United States to claim a bronze medal. Dibaba was unable to repeat her Beijing double, but became the first woman to retain an Olympic 10,000m title and took bronze in the 5,000m as Addis Ababa-born arch rival Meseret Defar won back the gold she first held in 2004. In addition, Dibaba has won four world championship golds and has also claimed the coveted world cross country title on four occasions, beating the best that Ethiopia's great rivals Kenya could produce. Early struggles . But despite her faultless pedigree, Dibaba's route to the top was not without its difficulties. She hoped to further both her education and her fledgling running career by moving to the capital of Addis Ababa, a grueling 276-kilometer trip from Bekoji. She was to live with her Bekelu and sister Ejegayehu, but missed the school registration deadline by six days. Bekelu, recognizing her cousin's talent, instead enrolled the teenager into the sport club run by the Prison Police in Ethiopia. Her early promise blossomed, and it was not long before Dibaba announced herself on the global stage by taking a surprise 5,000m gold at the 2003 world championships in Paris, still only 18 years of age. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Dibaba was beaten into the bronze medal position in the 5000m by the more experienced Defar and Isabella Ochichi of Kenya, a defeat which rankled despite her young years. ""Our country is not like other countries. Silver and bronze in our country is no better than finishing fifth or sixth,"" she said. Winning gold at the Olympics became the overriding goal for Dibaba, who underlined her dominance by winning the 5,000/10,000 double at the 2005 world championships and becoming the first woman to defend a 10,000m world title in Osaka two years later. Inspiring husband . Going into Beijing, she was further inspired by Sileshi Sihine, whom she was to marry after the Games. Sihine was twice a silver medal winner in the 10,000m, at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, and wanted his fiancee to go one better. ""My husband Sileshi used to tell me that in order to become a great runner, you have to win the Olympic gold,"" she said. ""When I said that I was tired and won't go to training, he would say work hard just for this one. ""I did not believe then that I won my first Olympic gold (in the 10,000m). It was a hard race, a tough race, I broke the Olympic record, I broke the African record. I was very happy. "" Going into the 5,000m as the world record-holder, Dibaba sprinted to a golden Beijing double, while Defar was third. With her main goal achieved, Dibaba concentrated on her wedding that November, when celebrations lasted over a week as the couple was feted in Ethiopia. She took a four-month break from intensive training and suffered as a consequence, sustaining injuries which she believed threatened her career. Serious injury . ""I never thought I would return back to running again. I thought I had would never return to competition. I was under treatment, I spent a lot of time going back and forth to Germany for treatment,"" Dibaba said. She was seeing renowned specialist Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt, who had to keep assuring Dibaba she would recover. ""He told me that I would return, but I still did not believe I would return back to running. It was really hard for me,"" she said. The doctor's confidence was well placed, but it took until 2012 for Dibaba to rediscover her best form, just in time for the London Games. A blistering command performance in the 10,000 saw her claim her third Olympic gold, but her double attempt was thwarted in the 5,000 by Defar and Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya as she was relegated to the bronze medal position. Dibaba shows no sign of winding down her career, but she is involved in several commercial projects, which include building a hotel. Having earned her own wealth, she takes pride in providing employment in a developing country such as Ethiopia. ""We create jobs for those who don't have any. We create opportunities,"" she said. The next goal . Dibaba has never forgotten the help of her family and the sacrifices she has had to make to achieve her success. ""I remember there were days where I felt could not complete my training program. But because I had to finish it, because my coach (Hussein Shebo) would advise me that it's a must to complete the program, I would finish the program,"" she said. ""There were times I got so tired that I would go to bed without eating food, only drinking water. To run well and be a good sportsperson, you have to work hard."" Rising around 6 a.m., she will do two sessions per day, preparing for the track season with intensive speed sessions as part of a specially devised schedule. Dibaba is usually in bed by 9 p.m. and restricts herself to a mostly pasta and rice diet. She will eventually move up to the 42 kilometers which make up the longest race on the track and field program -- the marathon being her ultimate goal for the 2016 Games in Rio. ""I want to do something special, that is historic and unforgettable. Especially in the Olympic marathon, I want to compete there. I believe that is what is left for me to achieve.""","Tirunesh Dibaba is a three-time Olympic gold medalist .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Two North Korean sailors are dead and 11 missing after a Mongolia-flagged cargo ship sank off the southeastern coast of South Korea. Three sailors were rescued by the South Korean Coast Guard after the distressed ship, Grand Fortune 1 sank early Friday. ""The sunken ship sent the rescue signal at around 1:19 a.m. from some 130 kilometers away and took two hours to reach,"" said Kang Byung Moon, the director of public affairs at the Yeosu Coast Guard. South Korean officials deployed a search plane and a patrol ship to find survivors and rescued the first sailor around 5 a.m. ""Because he suffered from hypothermia, we could not get any information until he came around to find out that he was from North Korea and that there were 15 others on board,"" Kang said. The other two survivors were rescued at 5:55 a.m. and 7:12 a.m. respectively. The three survivors are being treated on Jeju island, according to South Korean government officials. It remains unclear why the cargo ship sank. The ship was believed to have be coming from Chongjin in North Korea, headed to China, reported Yonhap, South Korea's semi-official news agency. It carried a Mongolian flag, but had an all-North Korean crew. The two countries are traditional allies and North Korea has been known to sail rented ships.","11 North Koreans are missing after Mongolian-flagged cargo ship sinks .

"London (CNN) -- Clad in brown trench coats, dark glasses and trilby hats, what appear to be three secret agents huddle around a payphone box with listening equipment. It's not a 1950s film scene but the latest street art attributed to Britain's famously anonymous graffiti artist Banksy. The image -- apparently a comment on the issue of government surveillance -- appeared early Sunday, local media said, on a house wall in the provincial English spa town of Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire. The location may be a reference to the town's role as host to Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ -- the UK equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency. The NSA has been at the center of the spying row sparked by revelations by its former contractor Edward Snowden about the extent of government surveillance. Some leaked documents also make a reference to GCHQ, although the UK government says the listening agency operates only within a strict framework of controls. Asked about the image, a spokeswoman for GCHQ said, ""This is the first time we have ever been asked to comment on art. Although we are not qualified critics, we are as intrigued as the rest of the residents of Cheltenham about the appearance of the mysterious artwork. ""For those who are interested, our website gives a glimpse of what modern day intelligence operatives are really like, although some may be disappointed by the lack of trench coats and dark glasses."" Karen Smith, who reportedly lives in the house, told the Gloucestershire Echo newspaper, ""It's pretty good. It livens the street up a bit. There have been a lot of people about today looking at it."" The artwork emerged a day before The Washington Post and United States arm of The Guardian were awarded a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on the NSA revelations, described as ""marked by authoritative and insightful reports that helped the public understand how the disclosures fit into the larger framework of national security."" Banksy's own website makes no reference to the artwork. It instead features what appears to be a new artwork showing a man and a woman apparently embracing but each looking over the other's shoulder at a smartphone -- perhaps a comment on our modern-day addiction to technological devices. Banksy's last high-profile project was a month-long street art ""residency"" in New York City. Each day of October, Banksy unveiled new works of art around New York. The works were then announced on his website and posted to Instagram. Many of the surprise exhibits followed his signature street-art style: stencils spray-painted on streets, walls of buildings and under bridges.

"(CNN) -- A charity single made by legendary music producer Quincy Jones featuring some of the Arab world's top recording artists has become an internet hit. The official video for ""Tomorrow/Bokra,"" (Bokra is the Arabic word for tomorrow) has been watched more than two million times on YouTube since it was released earlier this month. The album released last week. ""People gave their soul to this project,"" said Jones. ""This is not about records and money. This is about the young kids."" The star-studded international collaboration features 24 artists from across the Arab world and proceeds will go to fund musical, artistic and cultural projects for children in the Middle East. More: Inside the 'Tomorrow/Bokra' studio . ""Tomorrow/Bokra"" was adapted from Jones' melody of the same name by Iraqi singer and composer Kadim Al Saher, who himself has been heavily involved in charitable music project since the 1990s. It's not the first time Jones and Al Saher have worked together, Al Saher told CNN's Inside the Middle East during a Morocco recording session in May. He said: ""He called me personally to ask for my help in doing the song in Arabic with an eastern melody and I was very happy."" ""Tomorrow-Bokra"" includes contributions from artists as varied as legendary Lebanese singer Majida Al Roumi, who wrote the Arabic lyrics, Senegalese R&B artist Akon, Tunisian singer Latifa, and Grammy Award-winning Moroccan-born producer RedOne. Columbian-Lebanese pop princess Shakira recorded an intro to the song. None of the artists, managers or producers were paid for their contributions and many of the recording and production needs were donated by associate producers like the Mawazine Music Festival and the Doha Film Institute. CNN is a media partner of the ""Tomorrow-Bokra"" project. Jones and Emirati social entrepreneur Badr Jafar produced the song through their joint venture Global Gumbo Group, created a year ago to initiate the project, which they've discussed as a concept for years. More: Badr Jafar and Quincy Jones on 'Tomorrow/Bokra' Better known for his business ventures in heavy industry like oil and gas, Jafar refers to his social projects (which also include the Middle East Theater Company set up with the help of actor Kevin Spacey) as the ""triple bottom line"" -- profit, people and planet. ""I sensed that the entertainment business has a phenomenal ability change people's minds beyond any other business,"" he said. YouTube ad revenues, donations and pledges from corporate sponsors, individual donations through the website, and proceeds from album sales and iTunes downloads will be donated for distribution by the Beirut-based Arab Fund for Arts and Culture and to cultural projects of the U.N. World Food Programme that are specifically aimed at children. ""My dream is for these kids to be free to dream for themselves,"" said Jones. In his six decades in the music and entertainment industry, Jones has worked with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Michael Jackson among many others. Jones says he always feels ""like a family guest"" when he comes to the Middle East. The first time he visited the region was in the 1950s on tour with Dizzie Gillespie. With 27 Grammy Awards to his name, Jones is probably one of the few producers who could get away with a sign outside the recording studio reading ""Check Your Ego at the Door."" It worked in 1985 with his iconic charity hit ""We Are the World"" to help famine in Africa, and it seems to have worked again. Jaafar says donations and support has already exceeded $3 million, not including profits from YouTube ad revenues and iTunes downloads which are posted monthly. ""The Haiti version of 'We Are the World' raised $5 million,"" he said. ""We'll beat that."" Jafar and Jones both say this is only the first step, and they have plans to record new versions of the song with a host of new artists -- Jones says Paul McCartney has already expressed interest. There are also plans for a concert tour some time next year. The ""Tomorrow-Bokra"" project, described by Jafar as ""a beacon of solidarity and unity"" was planned before the Arab Spring uprisings began almost a year ago. Reflecting on this historic year, Jafar told me ""as much as there have been exciting changes, there has been a lot of hardship, grief, loss of life, a lot of pain. So this project is not at all trying to overshadow that but to try to express a spirit of solidarity."" For his part, Jones thinks that the project coinciding with the Arab Spring is something divine: ""I believe in divinity and they say coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous. tomorrowbokra.org .","Quincy Jones' charity song ""Bokra,"" has gone viral after launching in Dubai earlier this month .

"(CNN) -- Like a fine Italian wine, it seems Andrea Pirlo just keeps getting better with age. At 34, Pirlo is most certainly in the twilight of his long and illustrious career, which has seen him snare four Italian league titles, two European Champions League crowns and one World Cup. But in a tense round of 16 clash with fellow Italians Fiorentina he proved he can still be the difference at the top level after his glorious free kick sent Juventus into the Europa League quarterfinals. Locked at 1-1 after the first leg in Florence, Pirlo sent a perfectly flighted set piece into the net with less than 20 minutes remaining to seal a 2-1 aggregate victory. Though a full 27 points separates the sides in Serie A, with Juve poised to win their third straight Italian title, Fiorentina are the only team to have beaten them in the league this campaign. But after the home side squandered several chances, Juve came back into the game, Pirlo's 71st minute goal coming shortly after Gonzalo Rodriguez had been sent off for La Viola. Now Juventus have a real chance to banish the disappointment of going out of the Champions League in the group stages by winning Europe's second-tier tournament. Portuguese giants Benfica are also through to the last eight after they held firm in the face of a late fightback from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg in London last week, Spurs then conceded the opener as Ezequiel Garay nodded home from close range. But Spurs burst into life in the second half and after Nacer Chadli scored twice in the space of two minutes, they needed just one more goal to level the tie and force extra time. But as they poured forward in search of their third goal of the night they were caught on the break, Lima scoring from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the area by Sandro. Spurs manager Tim Sherwood told ITV: ""It's such a shame we haven't gone through tonight. They were sweating near the end and the momentum was with us. ""We thought if we stayed in the game we had the quality to hurt them. We wore them down, we countered time and time again with quality players."" Elsewhere, Spanish outfit Valencia cruised into the quarterfinals after a 1-0 victory over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets Razgrad confirmed a 4-0 aggregate success. An early goal from Bafetimbi Gomis helped Lyon, from France, to a 5-3 aggregate win over Viktoria Plzen, though the Czech side fought back to win 2-1 on the night. Dutch side AZ Alkmaar held on in Russia for a 0-0 draw against Anzhi Makhachkala to secure a 1-0 win on aggregate. A 2-2 draw with Portuguese champions Porto wasn't enough to see Italian side Napoli into the last eight, as they lost 3-2 on aggregate. Goals from Nabil Ghilas and Ricardo Quaresma did the damage for Porto, who won the competition in 2011. Swiss side FC Basel progressed to the next round despite having Marek Suchy sent off after just eight minutes and going behind to against SV Salzburg in Austria. But they fought back in the second half and goals from Marco Streller and Gaston Sauro sent them through 2-1 on aggregate.","Italian champions Juventus beat Fiorentina to make Europa League quarterfinals .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The two-day ritual slaughter of tens of thousands of animals -- among the world's largest sacrifice of animals -- began Tuesday in southern Nepal, officials said. About 200,000 animals, including male water buffalo, goats and roosters will be slaughtered, despite protests from animal rights activists, according to the chief priest of the festival. People from Nepal and India sacrifice animals to the goddess Gadhimai in the Bara district, about 150 kilometers (about one mile) south of Kathmandu, in thanks for wishes granted. ""This is a divine power center,"" Mangal Chaudhary, the head priest of the Gadhimai temple, said by phone. ""When people wish for a son, a job, good health or anything else come true, they make an offering to the Gadhimai goddess."" He expects more than 5 million people -- 60 percent from India, which shares an open border with Nepal -- to attend the festival. About 15,000 male water buffalo will be slaughtered, up from 12,000 five years ago, said Chaudhary, who is the 10th generation of his family to serve as chief priest. Water buffalo are slaughtered on the first day, and other animals on the second day. Government officials say they cannot stop the centuries-old tradition, despite opposition from animal-rights activists from Nepal and India. ""This is a matter of people's religion and belief,"" said chief district officer Tara Nath Gautam, the highest-ranking government official in Bara. Animal rights activists say they aren't looking for a sea change. ""We do not expect this practice to stop overnight. A sustained effort is needed so that, sometime, the practice will end,"" said Nepali animal rights activist Pramada Shah. Though meat from the sacrificed animals is given to devotees, the hides of water buffalo are taken by the festival management committee to sell. The heads are buried on the temple premises, which spread over three square kilometers, Chaudhary said. Buffalo is eaten by low castes in Nepal and India, but goat meat is eaten by a wider population. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 goats are sacrificed, Chaudhary said. Journalist Manesh Shrestha contributed to this report.","About 200,000 animals, including male water buffalo, goats and roosters will be slaughtered over two days .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber settled a legal dispute with a former bodyguard who had accused the pop star of attacking him backstage at a concert. Moshe Benabou filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in January 2013 accusing Bieber of hitting him during a ""tirade"" in October 2012. ""The tirade was apparently triggered by what Justin Bieber perceived as an attempt by Moshe Benabou to keep one member of Mr. Bieber's entourage physically away from Justin Bieber,"" the lawsuit said. ""As part of this tirade, Justin Bieber repeatedly punched Moshe Benabou in the chest and upper body area. Mr. Benabou did not retaliate or attempt to protect himself out of his concerns for Justin Bieber's physical well-being."" The lawsuit could have gone to trial in Los Angeles later this month if it had not been settled. ""The matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties, and the case has been dismissed,"" Bieber lawyer Howard Weitzman told CNN Monday. Bieber, 19, was arrested last week in Toronto, accused of assaulting his limousine driver in December. He also faces charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving on an expired license after being stopped by police in Miami Beach, Florida, last month.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to on-screen chemistry, ""Hunger Games"" co-stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are naturals. ""We're great together,"" Lawrence, 23, told CNN in a recent interview. ""We can really kiss."" To be sure, the two have had plenty of practice. As ""Hunger Games"" characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, Lawrence and Hutcherson are asked to do some lip-locking on camera in both 2012's ""The Hunger Games"" and its November 22 follow-up, ""Catching Fire."" If you're not familiar with the book trilogy from Suzanne Collins that the movies are based on, know that part of the central plot revolves around Katniss and Peeta's relationship -- it's mostly a survival strategy as the two impoverished District 12 citizens are sent to fight to the death in the sadistic Hunger Games, but there's also an undercurrent of something more. There's the additional complication of Katniss' relationship with childhood friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who's a likely lover as well. So as Katniss, Lawrence isn't wanting for love scenes. Yet in her typical casual manner, the Oscar-winning actress can shrug it off. ""You just kiss,"" she said to CNN, admitting, ""I've had a couple bad ones."" Hutcherson, though, isn't disappointing, although the 21-year-old actor isn't quite as experienced as his counterpart. ""I haven't had any bad ones,"" Hutcherson said, telling Lawrence, ""You're my first real big kiss in a movie."" ""Really?"" Lawrence responded. ""Oh my God, was I gentle?"" To be frank, ""no,"" Hutcherson replied. ""It was a little abrasive, if I'm being honest. A little shocking."" ""It was very slobbery,"" Lawrence agreed. That sort of honest, spontaneous exchange is what makes the duo, but especially Lawrence, so in demand. Just three years ago, Lawrence was best known for an indie film called ""Winter's Bone,"" which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. But then came an onslaught of films that permanently changed the tide, as Lawrence starred in one high-profile project after another: 2011's ""The Beaver"" and ""X-Men: First Class,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" and 2012's acclaimed ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which earned the young star an Oscar. Born in Kentucky with two older brothers, Lawrence presents herself with an unguarded irreverence that both Hollywood and the public eat up with spoons. Even as she transformed into one of the biggest stars in the industry, Lawrence remains grounded and outspoken in her interviews, seemingly unaware of her celebrity status. When she won the best actress Oscar for ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" nothing changed on set, Hutcherson told CNN. ""I don't even think we had a conversation about it,"" Lawrence said. ""You guys were like, 'Congratulations, that's great.' And then it was like, 'Cool.' Then we started talking about farts."" And yet, as the public face of a franchise that has thus far made $691 million worldwide, Lawrence isn't completely oblivious to her new place in the world. When the first ""Hunger Games"" movie came out, the actress tried to stop by Whole Foods, and was quickly reminded of just how famous she's become. ""Literally the day the movie was released, I had no idea I was famous yet or that anybody had seen the movie,"" she said. ""I don't think actually I knew the movie came out that day."" Whole Foods ""had to call the police and I had to go down the cargo elevator and I was crying. And I saw my ex-boyfriend there and he's like, 'How's your life?' And I was like, 'Really bad.' It was the worst."" Her popularity began to make her nervous about appearing in public, and she would skirt dinner plans to avoid the inevitable requests for a photograph. But she's learned that one has to face fame the way you would face anything else. ""Sometimes I'm nice, sometimes I'm in a bad mood,"" Lawrence said. ""Like if I'm at dinner and I'm eating and somebody wants me to stand up and take a picture -- that's actually helped with my anxiety, knowing that I don't have to say yes and I can say no. ... It is hard because you don't want to feel rude, but at the same time, I have to defend my life and my mental wellness.""

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler in 2010 was arrested in Nicaragua one day after making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. On Friday, authorities said, he was returned to the United States. Juan Elias Garcia, whom the FBI calls an ""enthusiastic murderer,"" had a $100,000 reward on his head. ""The pressure generated by this publicity was too much for Garcia to bear, resulting in his surrender and return to the United States,"" George Venizelos, FBI assistant director in charge of the New York field office, said in a statement. Garcia surrendered Thursday to authorities at the U.S. Embassy in Managua, Nicaragua, authorities said. Garcia voluntarily agreed to return to the United States and was arrested in New York Friday after the FBI sent a plane to transport him, the statement said. He is to appear in federal court on March 31. ""Garcia's callous disregard for human life resulted in the senseless murder of a young mother and her helpless 2-year-old son,"" Venizelos said on the agency's website on Wednesday. Garcia is alleged to be a member of the violent MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, gang. He was thought to be hiding in El Salvador. The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings. Alleged victim Vanessa Argueta, 19, is said to have had a romantic relationship with Garcia, and she's also believed to have had ties to two rival gangs: the 18th Street gang and the Latin Kings. ""They were going to kill her for disrespecting the gang,"" Special Agent James Lopez said in the FBI release. ""It is unacceptable for MS-13 members to have girls they associate with be involved with rival gang members."" The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods. There, they were met by two co-conspirators -- members of Mara Salvatrucha -- and Argueta was murdered execution-style in front of her son.

The sole survivor in Tuesday's tragic incident was 10-year-old Lashaun Armstrong, who escaped the sinking vehicle where his mother Lashonda Armstrong, 25, as well as his siblings -- an 11-month-old girl, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy -- all died. Police say an investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the Hudson in Newburgh, New York, some 60 miles north of New York City. The woman who came to the aid of the Lashaun said that the boy was both courageous and terrified. ""He kept saying, 'It's my fault,' "" Meave Ryan recalled. The boy, hoisted himself out of the van's driver-side window Tuesday night, swam to shore and then flagged down Ryan by the side of a road. Lashaun was waving his arms and calling out ""Help me, help me, help me,"" Ryan said. ""He said, 'Mom just drove the car into the water,' "" she added. Ryan said she and the boy drove to the scene, wading into the water to look for survivors. Lashaun said his mother ""just went crazy,"" according to Ryan. ""She just speeded up and went into the water,"" Ryan added, recounting what Lashaun had told her. The boy eventually recalled to Ryan that, as the car was moving, his mother climbed into the back seat and ""had all her children cradled in her arms."" According to Ryan's recollection of her conversation with Lashaun, he quoted his mother as saying, ""If I'm going to die... you're all going to die with me."" Lashaun told Ryan that he resisted and broke free, yelling out the window for help. Ryan said the boy told her that as he was trying to escape, ""maybe (his mother) had a break of reality,"" and she then cried out, ""Oh, my God, I made a mistake."" She then climbed back into the front seat, the boy told Ryan. But it was too late. It took responders an hour of searching, using dive teams and a circling helicopter, to find the four bodies and the van submerged in eight feet of water, according to Fire Chief Michael Vatter. Ryan said the boy told her that his mother had been frantic, packing her children into her minivan and racing off, because she thought she was being cheated on. And before the incident, a relative called police reporting a ""domestic disturbance"" that police say may have involved the father of Armstrong's children. That belief is based both on a phone call the relative received in which the relative reported hearing ""tussling in the background,"" and a history of domestic problems in the family, police said in a statement released Wednesday. Authorities declined to identify the relative. Police said Thursday that they have ruled out potential criminal charges against the father of the dead children, Jean Pierre. Police say they had previously arrested Pierre on charges of endangering the welfare of a minor, which stemmed from a February incident in which his 2-year-old son was found wandering the streets shortly after 1 a.m. The boy was found in cold temperatures, only partially clothed in wet clothing, police said in a statement Friday. Pierre was arrested three days later on February 10 alongside a woman named Shannel Baez, who police say gave conflicting accounts of being both the boy's babysitter and his mother. Meanwhile, Newburgh Mayor Nicholas Valentine said Tuesday's incident is certain to have ""a lasting effect on this city."" A neighbor, Christine Santos, said she ""would never have imagined (Armstrong) to do this to her kids."" ""To them little babies. I would have never have imagined. I'm in shock,"" Santos added. Ryan said Lashaun -- the lone survivor -- is wracked with guilt that he wasn't able to unbuckle his baby sister or teach his two brothers to swim. ""He blames himself,"" Ryan said of Lashaun, who told her he only learned to swim last year. ""That's the sad part."" CNN's Sheila Steffen and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: Prosecutors are treating the incident as a triple murder-suicide .

"(CNN) -- At Romotive, we are obsessed with robots. We're a team of nerds, and we grew up watching science fiction that prominently featured robots doing extraordinary things to help or protect their human counterparts. We figured that as adults, our lives would be better because of robots. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet, and robots remain one of the great unfulfilled promises of science fiction. We think that's going to change over the next decade. First, the barriers to entry in robotics that have typically precluded individuals or small teams from building robots are falling away. The rise of cheap rapid-prototyping tools like 3-D printers is making it possible for just about anyone to design and print physical products from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, open-source electronics platforms like Arduino mean that hobbyists can now create custom electronic systems without having to go through the expensive process of manufacturing custom circuit boards. Also, crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter are making it possible for companies to test the traction of new robots and secure initial orders before choosing to scale production. Even more importantly, the ubiquity of smart devices is changing the way that people are thinking about robotic controllers and robots themselves. Smart phones today have powerful processors, an array of sensors, and a user interface that everyone already understands. These are crucial assets for a robot, and many startups are now exploring the possibilities of using smart devices as controllers or even brains for a wide variety of robotic creatures. Finally, the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and data networks means that robots can be designed with the Web in mind. This will ultimately allow teams to build much lighter, more affordable hardware platforms on the assumption that any computationally intensive tasks can be offloaded to the cloud. Instead of needing to load every possible routine onto a robot before it ships, designers will be able to build robots that will download new ""apps"" on a situation-by-situation basis. Basically, the cloud will make it possible to build cheaper robots that learn new things over time. But there's still a lot of work to do. In the Web and mobile ecosystems, a lot of the most incredible innovations over the last decade have been design innovations. Companies like Twitter, Pinterest, and Airbnb aren't revolutionary because they pushed human technology forward; they are revolutionary because they made technology more usable. Surprisingly, the exact opposite trend has occurred in robotics. At a research level, there have been incredible technological innovations over the last 10 years. See this striking example, or this one. But these systems are too expensive and complicated for nontechnical people to buy and use. As we think about how robots will begin helping us in all different aspects of our lives over the next decade, we believe that design innovation in robotics will be at least as important as tech innovation in finally making robots available to a majority of people in the world. And we think that it won't be until robots are truly accessible -- 14-year-olds hacking on Wi-Fi-connected, computer-vision-capable robots in their garages on the weekends -- that innovation in robotics will really take off in earnest. My company, Romotive, builds a small, affordable robot that uses an iPhone as his brain. Romo can learn new things over time and can stream two-way video with any iOS device, anywhere in the world. In order to become part of our daily lives, robots will need to be friendly, simple, and robust. Romo is a small step in that direction. Roy Amara, longtime president of the Institute for the Future, said that people tend to overestimate the effect of a new technology in the short run and underestimate the effect over the long term. That's absolutely the case in robotics, where it's easy to dismiss early attempts as toys but hard to imagine how robots will fundamentally change our lives over the next few decades. Robots will be able to guard your house while you're away, babysit your kids, or keep you company when you're alone. Drones could tend to gardens and farms while people control telepresence robots on the other side of the world via heads-up displays like Google Glass. Corporations aren't going to build these robots, but hackers will. That's why making robotics accessible and affordable is so important, and why I believe we're finally poised to build the robots that we fell in love with in sci-fi movies decades ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Keller Rinaudo.","Keller Rinaudo: His company is a team of nerds with sci-fi dreams of robots that enhance lives .

"(CNN) -- I am a geomorphologist: a scientist fascinated by the interactions of storms, floods, fires and landslides. We humans may feel a bit above that fray -- we refer to the ""natural environment"" as though it were a separate thing. Yet, as a landslide near Oso, Washington, tragically highlighted on Saturday, we remain subject to the forces of nature like all the rest of Earth's creatures. At the latest count, 27 people are confirmed dead and 22 are still missing. A painful part of the natural order of things. Unlike those other inhabitants of Earth, however, we know something of how things work. This, too, was highlighted last week, when the Seattle Times reported on a study I did 15 years ago, one of many for the Hazel site, which had experienced recurring landslides. In that study, conducted for the Army Corps of Engineers, I had written of the possibility of a ""large catastrophic failure"" based on numerical analyses that indicated potential instability of a huge mass of material above the zone of previous landslides. As a scientist, I knew that material would someday be on the valley floor. As intended, that report guided further work. Tracy Drury, an engineer who reported on the site for the Army Corps of Engineers, was also clear that ""catastrophic failure potential places human lives and property at risk."" He came up with designs to shore up the slope. Those designs were put in place; everything was done that could be done to minimize the potential of a future landslide. A pleasant rural neighborhood, Steelhead Haven, sat directly across the river from the site. Drury's most relevant design to protect lives was to try to buy up the properties and move people away. There were meetings to discuss these ideas, but nothing came of them. I wasn't involved in the discussions, but I did attend a community meeting to discuss my analyses -- after a landslide in 2006 felled trees and crashed into the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River across the valley into the edge of Steelhead Haven. One response to my presentation, I was told, was that I was there to take their land. Construction of new homes continued, even after 2006. In some cases, people were informed of the risk, but didn't trust the messenger, or decided it was an acceptable risk. I learned that some people were unaware that they lived across the river from an active landslide. I've been asked, ""Where does responsibility lie?"" The cast is large. Homeowners choose to live in beautiful, but dangerous, places. Contractors and developers then build those homes, Realtors sell them, bankers finance them, local officials grant permits, governments set zoning rules, and voters elect the officials who make those rules. At every step, those decisions need to be made from positions of knowledge and understanding of the potential consequences. Then who is responsible to ensure that scientific findings are disseminated and clearly understood? The scientists? The government? The media? We cannot help those lost at Oso, but we can look to do better in the future. This is not the last landslide, flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, drought, tornado, or any of a long list of threatening events that we face. Scientists work hard to understand these processes; we need to ensure that everyone makes decisions fully aware of the potential consequences of their actions. We have work to do. I'm getting calls from concerned homeowners wanting to know where to get information. It's not easy to find. Landslide hazards have not been systematically mapped across the state, much less the country. Where work has been done, maps are hard to find. If found, they are difficult to interpret. Many local, state and federal agencies are working to improve this situation, but progress is slow and funding is tight. Mapping hazards is not a national priority. Yet it seems that, if my smartphone can tell me how to drive to the nearest coffee shop, it should be able to tell me what's known about the hazards where I'm standing. We have the technology; we need the public interest to drive the required investment. Like most scientists, I toil in obscurity to make my small contribution. Maybe we scientists are missing the point. The problem with toiling in obscurity is that no one hears us. We need better special effects. Getting our messages across can save lives, although it will involve getting houses off flood plains, coastal bluffs and debris-flow fans. In general, folks don't appreciate having a scientist, or government official, suggest they move. Perhaps there is another approach. It took a massive information campaign to dramatically cut consumption of cancer-causing cigarettes, surely we can motivate people to examine the facts in this case and do things that are ultimately good for all of us. In 1997, a colleague and I co-founded a small not-for-profit institute seeking to provide land managers with the data and tools they need to make informed decisions. We both had young children; we saw it as a way to help ensure their generation would have something worth managing. That's gone well, but our targeted audience is too small and public funding too limited. To really change things, everyone should have the tools and data to make informed decisions, and use them. For that to happen, these tools need to be as cool and easy to use as the latest smartphone app; lives depend on it.","Daniel Miller predicted possible catastrophic mudslide in Washington 15 years ago .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russian military aircraft flew just 500 feet over two U.S. Navy ships this week as the ships participated in a joint military exercise with South Korea in the Sea of Japan, according to U.S. military officials. Two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew only 500 feet above a U.S. aircraft carrier. On Monday, two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft, known as ""Mays,"" overflew the U.S. aircraft carrier Stennis while it was in international waters in the Sea of Japan. The Russian aircraft flew about 500 feet over the ship, lower than other flights the Russians have made over U.S. ships in the past year. The USS Stennis was about 80 miles east of Pohang, South Korea, participating in the joint military exercise when the flyover occurred. On Tuesday, the USS Blue Ridge, a lead command and control ship, and the Stennis were overflown by two Russian ""Bear"" long-range bombers multiple times, according to U.S. military officials. The Bears overflew the ships at about 2,000 feet, officials said. U.S. military officials said that in both cases, U.S. Navy F/A-18 fighters met up with the Russian aircraft about 70 nautical miles from the U.S. ships and flew alongside them until they left the area. On both days, U.S. aircraft tried contacting the Russian planes on international air frequency radio channels, but the Russian pilots did not respond, officials said. The last time Russian planes flew over a U.S. Navy ship was February 2008, when two Bears flew 2,000 feet over the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz south of Japan. Russian long-range flights skirting U.S. or other nations' boundaries have also been common over the last year. Although the Pentagon does not often talk about the overflights, there is nothing illegal about the actions, and they are generally seen by the United States as nothing more than muscle-flexing by the Russian military.","Two Russian planes flew within 500 feet of U.S. Navy aircraft carrier .

"(CNN) -- Nick Charles, who started off as a taxi driver and later became the first sports anchor at CNN, died Saturday after battling bladder cancer since 2009. He was 64. Charles died peacefully, looking out at the spectacular land that drew him to Santa Fe, New Mexico, his wife, Cory, said. Charles began at CNN on the network's first day, June 1, 1980, and covered nearly every sporting event over the years. He was paired with Fred Hickman for most of the next two decades on ""Sports Tonight,"" a show that beat ESPN in ratings when the upstarts were battling for viewers. To this day, he and Hickman remain one of the longest-lasting anchor duos in television. Topps, the trading-card company, put Charles' million-dollar smile on a bubble gum card, a rarity for a television personality. People magazine once dubbed him one of the most handsome men in America. ""Nick was your friend from the moment you met him -- and he stayed your friend forever,"" said Rick Davis, one of Charles' producers at CNN in the 1980s. ""All of us who had the very good fortune to have been his friend have so much to remember about how he touched our lives in his own special way,"" said Davis, who is CNN's executive vice president of News Standards and Practices. At his home in Santa Fe recently, Charles pointed to his signature mop of curly black hair as he scrolled through photographs of his on-air days. ""Look at that thing,"" he said with a laugh. ""It's my Billy Ray Cyrus mullet."" Facing death, Charles embraced life . While the world knew Charles for his sportscaster days, it was his battle with cancer that inspired tens of thousands of people. In a recent CNN.com article, he talked openly about the dying process and preparing his family for when he was gone. He made birthday video diaries for his 5-year-old daughter, Giovanna, in the years to come. ""This is a gift from God where I need to build these memories for her, so that I'm not a blur,"" he said. ""I feel that when I go, that I'm going to prepare a place for my daughter and my wife. I'm going to be in their heart and soul. I tell them that every day."" Gupta: The friend I can't fix . His message, he said, is to ""never give up on life."" ""It's an imperfect world, but, boy, it's still beautiful."" ""What is life?"" he said. ""It's 20 percent what happens to you and 80 percent how you react to it."" ""Find that little kernel every day that brings you pleasure and joy -- and fasten onto that. That's what's going to make life worth living. Always look for the best."" ""When you're contemplating your mortality and your life,"" he said, ""those are the things I reflect on."" The son of a taxi driver who was mostly absent from his life, Nicholas Charles Nickeas grew up poor in inner-city Chicago. In grade school, during the frigid winters when his dad didn't pay the heat bills, Charles would curl up in bed with his mother and brother to stay warm. He struggled in high school. He had no mentors. He was too busy working late-night jobs at produce docks in desolate Chicago neighborhoods. Once, his boss pointed to mounds of rat feces, threw lye all over the floor and handed the 17-year-old Charles a pair of gloves, rubber boots and a hoe. He scrubbed away, but thought to himself: ""I'll never be trapped again in life. Never. Never."" ""That was a watershed, life-changing moment for me. It really drove me to the point where I had focus in my life."" He eventually went to Columbia College Chicago, where he studied communications and journalism. He drove a taxi to help pay for college. Even in the driver's seat, he was practicing for his broadcast career. ""I wasn't nosey, but just curious about people's life. I'd ask, 'How'd you get to this country? What was the spark that motivated you in life?' ... I don't know what it was, but people would open up."" Charles was still driving taxis in the fall of 1970 when he auditioned for his first television job, at WICS in Springfield, Illinois. Two days later, he got the job. He took a pay cut to enter the television business: $130 a week as a sports anchor, compared with $200 driving a taxi. He was told by his news director that his Greek name was too ethnic and to change it to something more ""vanilla."" ""Nick Nickeas, sounds like you got a stutter, too,"" the news director added. At the age of 24, Nick Charles was born. He covered sports for WICS, before the job rolled into just about anything, from farm reports to fluff. A wolf once urinated on his leg: ""The mother wolf was a little mad. We got a little too close to her cubs."" From Springfield, he worked at local stations in Baltimore and Washington before joining CNN. And it's at CNN where he shined. In his prime, he and Hickman had chemistry, charisma and dynamism -- a duo of boundless energy. The two were revolutionary for their time, a white and black man sitting side-by-side live every night in studios from the once-segregated South. ""We just clicked from the very beginning,"" Hickman said in an interview before Charles' death. ""In television, you always have personality conflicts. Nick and I never had one. Nick and I have always had a tremendous relationship."" Hickman's favorite memory with his long-time friend came in the 1980s when they arrived in Los Angeles for the Cable Ace Awards. Stretch limousines and other luxurious cars were parked everywhere. ""We pulled up in a red Ford Tempo,"" Hickman said with a laugh. His favorite line ever uttered by Charles came after Mike Tyson demolished an opponent: ""Tyson tore his meat house down."" ""I still don't know what it means,"" Hickman said, ""but I love it."" Charles covered everything from the Olympics to the Super Bowl to the Kentucky Derby. But boxing was his passion. He covered some of the most classic boxing matches -- when Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear, when Roberto Duran quit and told Sugar Ray Leonard, ""No mas."" Seeing an undefeated Tyson get knocked out by Buster Douglas in Tokyo in 1990 was epic. ""That night was magical,"" Charles said. ""It speaks to the uncertainty, that anybody's cloak of invincibility can be ripped away."" Charles would cry when he talked about the strength of boxers, because when he looked at the ring, he saw young men like him from the inner city who had to rely on themselves to reach success. ""You have to walk down that alley way to the ring,"" he said. ""You're going to get hit. You have to take pain to get it. You have to fight through fear."" ""There's just such an empathy I have for these guys. They want it so badly."" Tyson on Saturday sent a message on Twitter: ""Mourning the loss of a true warrior. My friend & brother, Nick Charles."" In an interview in March, Charles had said he hoped to make it to one more Easter, to see his dream home completed in May, to see his daughter play the piano, to reach his 65th birthday on June 30. He made three of those four goals. ""If I don't make it,"" he said, ""there's no need for any pity parties."" ""People won't remember who you are or what you said,"" he said. ""It's really about: Are you going to be remembered as a good person?"" ""That's victory to me. That's success."" Charles is survived by his wife, Cory, of 13 years and their daughter, Giovanna. He has three children from two previous marriages: Jason, 39; Melissa, 36; and Katie, 24. ""His passing is a loss to CNN, to the sports world and to the fans and friends everywhere who were with him to the end of his extraordinary life,"" said Jim Walton, Charles' field producer in his early days and current president of CNN Worldwide. Nick Charles and his family formed the ""Embrace Life"" project to help stop child trafficking and abuse, increase access to education and allow children to embrace life. Working with the humanitarian organization World Vision and the TEACH NOW: Preventing Child Labor in the Philippines project, the family welcomes support here: www.worldvision.org/EmbraceLife.","Charles began at CNN on the network's first day, June 1, 1980 .

"(CNN) -- A new virus in the same family as SARS -- found for the first time in humans in the past year -- has infected 49 people, most of them in the Middle East. Of those, 27 people have died, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. The virus previously was called the novel coronavirus, or nCoV. However, the WHO this week gave it a new name: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV. Should I be concerned about new virus? Your questions answered . It's part of a family called coronaviruses, which cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, as well as a variety of animal diseases. However, the new virus is not SARS. The virus acts like a cold and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen, according to the WHO. MERS-CoV has been detected in humans in eight countries, the WHO said last week -- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Tunisia and the United Kingdom. Earlier this month, the WHO reported two health care workers in Saudi Arabia became ill while treating patients. Here are five things you need to know about MERS-CoV: . Widespread transmission hasn't been seen . All the clusters of cases seen so far have been transmitted between family members or in a health care setting, the WHO said in a May 17 update. ""Human-to-human transmission occurred in at least some of these clusters; however, the exact mode of transmission is unknown."" That means it's not yet known how humans contract MERS-CoV. But experts said there has been no evidence of cases beyond the clusters into communities. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, has said the infection is ""very serious"" but appears ""very difficult to acquire."" According to the WHO, ""The recent increase in cases may in part be related to increased awareness among the medical community; however, the demonstrated ability of this virus to transmit between humans and to cause large outbreaks has increased concerns about the possibility of sustained transmission."" Cases are connected to the Middle East . ""All of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East,"" the WHO said in the May 17 statement. ""However, in France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveler recently returned from the Middle East."" New SARS-like virus poses medical mystery . Most of the cases so far are seen in older men with other medical conditions, experts have said. Precise numbers are difficult to ascertain as officials don't know how many people might contract a mild form of MERS-CoV. Saudi Arabia leads the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, with 32 as of Tuesday, the CDC said. No cases have been reported in the United States, but infectious disease experts have said they would not be surprised if it happens. Underlying health conditions may make you more susceptible . A large number of patients have another condition, the WHO said, suggesting ""increased susceptibility from underlying medical conditions may play a role in transmission."" In addition, the infection has shown up ""atypically"" and without respiratory symptoms in people whose immune systems are compromised. No travel warnings have been issued . The WHO and CDC have not issued travel health warnings for any country related to the novel coronavirus. But, in a travel notice, the CDC said it recommends that ""U.S. travelers to countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula monitor their health and see a doctor right away if they develop fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath. They should tell the doctor about their recent travel."" In addition, those who traveled to the Middle East should see their health care provider if they develop a fever and respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath within 10 days of returning from the Arabian Peninsula or surrounding nations, according to the CDC. There are no treatments and no vaccine . So far, those with MERS-CoV have received supportive treatments to relieve their symptoms.","MERS-CoV has sickened 49 people and killed 27, World Health Organization says .
The cases have a link to the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia .
Experts say the virus could show up in the United States ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats know the history: 2014 is all but certain to be a tough year. But there is a sense among some top Democratic strategists that the political climate is shifting in ways that could keep the midterm climate from turning from bad to disastrous. Perhaps it is wishful thinking, and it is important -- very important -- to note how things look in April is often not how they turn out come November. But Democrats just in the past week have received a few nuggets of potentially helpful news: . * Friday's Labor Department report showing the economy added 192,000 jobs in March. * Enrollment in the President's health care plan crossed the 7 million mark at the first big deadline to sign up. * A slight but potentially important uptick in President Barack Obama's approval rating. Gallup's daily tracking poll had this key midterm barometer at 45 percent on Friday, a near 2014 high and up from 39 percent in early February. (President George W. Bush had a 38 percent approval rating in November 2006 -- his second term midterm election -- and Democrats gained 30 House seats). Plus, Democratic-leaning SuperPACS are beginning to spend more money, and in a few notable cases testing a new strategy of punching directly back at the source of millions of dollars in conservative spending that helped turn the early 2014 climate decidedly in favor of the GOP. Not that Democrats should be popping -- or even ordering -- champagne. To be clear, top party strategists still expect to lose seats in both the House and the Senate. The goal, though, is to keep the House losses to single digits and to deny Republicans the net gain of six seats the GOP needs to take control of the Senate. The principal driver of midterm election seasons is the President's approval rating; the closer the incumbent gets to 50 percent, the better Democrats feel about avoiding a November bloodbath. And any President benefits when people feel better about the economy, which is where the new jobs report, and the immediate debate about its meaning, comes in. The 192,000 new jobs was a bit below the consensus estimates, so Republicans were quick to label it not good enough. ""Our economy still isn't creating jobs for the American people at the rate they were promised,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. Too early to run Obamacare victory lap . Democrats, however, focused on the trend line. The economy added 533,000 jobs in the first three months of 2014. By contrast, job growth in all of 2010 -- a disastrous midterm election year for Democrats -- was barely above 1 million. Back then, it was a punishing summer slump that shaped the fall election mood -- so given recent history, it would be a mistake for Democrats to invest too much hope in this year's first quarter. But the early betting is that the job market in this midterm year will be stronger, and less volatile, than in 2010. Turning the health care political tide is tougher, but one Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg argues must become a strategic imperative. As noted recently in an analysis produced by the GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, opponents of the health care law are more likely to cite it as a major factor in their 2014 voting decisions. That ""intensity gap"" is the major source of GOP midterm optimism. Greenberg, in a memo released Thursday, argues that Democrats need to reshape the health care terrain. ""When the debate is between implementing or repealing the (Affordable Care Act), the intensity shifts towards implementing the law,"" the veteran Democratic pollster says. ""So it is possible that Democrats will be able to turn the debate."" Inside Politics: GOP responds to Obamacare enrollment with new repeal plan . Also worth watching is a growing Democratic effort to create a 2014 political bogeyman out of the Koch brothers. It wasn't all that long ago that veteran Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall was contemplating retirement. Now, though, the West Virginia congressman is in the middle of an experiment Democrats hope helps them minimize their midterm losses. Evan Jenkins is Rahall's Republican opponent. But turn on a TV in the 3rd Congressional District and you can't miss a rugged coal miner warning ""New York billionaires"" are trying to defeat Rahall. Translation: the Koch brothers, the conservative megadonors whose spending spree has Democratic candidates across the country on their heels. Now, Democratic leaning groups are fighting back by making the Koch's an issue -- labeling them a rich special interest group trying to get the best Congress money can buy. In addition to West Virginia, the House Majority PAC is running ads attacking the Koch brothers in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, where Democratic Rep. Ron Barber faces a tough reelection climate. Already the Koch brothers were an issue in several Senate campaigns, again as Democratic-leaning groups try to improve an election climate in which the early spending by the Koch's, primarily through an organization called Americans for Prosperity, has improved GOP prospects. The pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC is attacking the Koch brothers in five states with key Senate races: Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, North Carolina and Michigan. Americans For Prosperity has spent millions in those states and elsewhere attacking Democrats for supporting Obama's health care law. The version running in Colorado urges voters to consider, ""those behind the attacks -- insurance companies and out of state billionaires."" Koch Brothers target another Democratic senator . It's a somewhat risky strategy -- using precious advertising resources to attack someone not on the ballot. But more and more Democrats think it is worth the effort. Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the Koch's heavy spending and the frequent national media attention it receives makes them a legitimate target. ""The Koch brothers are becoming their own brand,"" Israel said in a conversation this week. Democratic strategist Paul Begala concurs -- and drew a parallel to his 2012 work for a pro-Obama SuperPAC. ""Nobody had heard of Bain Capital either, until we told them about it,"" Begala said. ""Of course the Democrats are wise to tell voters about the controversial billionaires. ... What did Mama say to you when someone said something hateful? 'Consider the source,'"" he said. But veteran GOP ad guru Alex Castellanos isn't so sure. Years ago, Castellanos says one of his favorite ad targets was George Meany, then the AFL-CIO leader. ""Beat the hell out of him,"" Castellanos said. ""Problem is, he wasn't on the ballot. Democrats won."" To Castellanos, the direct aim at the Koch brothers proves ""the Democrat Party today is exhausted. It's a tactical party, trying to eke out victories on Demographics and negative assaults."" Democrats, not surprisingly, disagree. They argue the Koch ""bogeyman"" strategy is helping their candidates and with fund-raising. More broadly, the Democratic bottom line can be summed up this way: the year is still likely to be rough, but that the terrain in early April looks a bit less treacherous than it did in early March.","Democrats are banking on a boost from good Obamacare and jobs report figures .

"(ELLE) -- ""I took all my Ted Cruz posters down before you came over,"" declares Carrie Brownstein, leaning against the arched doorframe of her Portland dining room. ELLE: 21 imaginary tv couples we wish were real . Brownstein's delivery is thoroughly deadpan, but anyone even mildly familiar with the 39-year-old would know the claim couldn't be dripping with more sarcasm. After all, along with co-star Fred Armisen, Brownstein -- founding member of riot grrrl cult band Sleater-Kinney and, more recently, Wild Flag -- has made a second career out of portraying a constituent of the kale-eating, craft-beer-drinking, lumberjack-shirt-wearing, jewelry-making crowd on ""Portlandia."" ELLE: What's behind Portlandia's comedy chemistry? While the locally filmed show, which returned for a fourth season on IFC in February, has made the Washington state native something of a hometown hero in her adopted city, she's quick to point out that Portland was merely a convenient backdrop for the series. ""Portlandia isn't as much about a place as it is about a state of mind,"" says Brownstein. ""It's about people who like to feel special, who like to believe that this certain thing has been tailor-made just for them, of which I'm definitely guilty too, at times."" ELLE: 9 TV actresses who deserve a raise . Given the show's penchant for incredibly nuanced observations of hipster culture -- municipal recycling guidelines are enough fodder for an entire sketch -- it should come as no surprise that Brownstein was equally committed to detail when it came to decorating the 1912 bungalow she bought in the trendy Grant Park neighborhood 10 years ago after touring extensively. ELLE: A different way of thinking about lena dunham's nudity in 'Girls' Brownstein filled the place with sentimental, one-of-a-kind finds: A taxidermied weasel once owned by Amy Sedaris sits on the mantel; '50s-era coastal landscapes by various local artists fill the walls; and a record collectionâ€”which, in Brownstein's case, is several thousand vinyls strong and meticulously alphabetized by artistâ€”testifies that yes, this is a hipster home. ELLE: 21 vintage photos of hollywood couples on the red carpet . All in all, the spread is not unlike the one Carrie's Portlandia alter ego inhabits. Hard-core fans may recognize Brownstein's real-life mutts from the now infamous episode about dog parks. Armisen, whom she met in 2003 at a ""Saturday Night Live"" after-party, is clearly her partner in crime in real life, too: The comedian, who rents a house nearby during filming, texts Brownstein in the middle of her ELLE shoot to let her know that Lou Reed has died. (A fellow musician, Armisen is also a frequent guest in Brownstein's basement -- a soundproof practice space tricked out with a loungy Chesterfield sofa and no fewer than five guitars.) ELLE: 11 items every fashionable woman should have by 30 . Of course, inhabiting the blurred line between reality and fiction can have its downsides. A particular source of consternation for Brownstein is one of the show's most famous skits -- ""Put a Bird on It"" -- which depicts an artisan couple with a compulsive knack for putting a cutesy bird on virtually everything they make. ""Now I go into stores and see things I want to buy with birds on it, and I can't, because I'm too self-conscious,"" Brownstein says. ""The other day, I was in a store and saw a cute dress with birds on it and I was like, 'No, I just can't.'""

"(CNN) -- When climate scientist Rosina Bierbaum speaks, her central theme is the ""roasted world"" -- a bleak picture of what the planet will probably look like if carbon pollution continues unchecked, leading to 4 degrees Celsius of warming by mid-century. Four degrees may not sound like a lot -- but it would change our lives drastically. Mega-heat waves in 2010 in Europe and Russia were estimated to have caused up to 50,000 heat-related deaths, according to some reports. This ""will become the normal,"" said Bierbaum, a review editor of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, speaking at the U.N. in January. Food production in key regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia could drop by as much as 50%, she added. Accelerated melting of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets will cause sea levels to rise by 1 to 2 feet, putting Miami and Mumbai, India, as well as many other low-lying cities, at enormous risk. It's a bone-chilling scenario. We don't always have control of our destiny, but in the case of climate change we know exactly what it will take to protect our planet and economy from disaster. Companies, investors and policymakers must scale up clean energy investments and scale down fossil fuel investments. Recently, we saw compelling evidence that big business is getting more serious about climate change. And it came from none other than the world's largest fossil fuel company, Exxon Mobil. Nearly 25 years to the day after the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Alaska, spewing 260,000 barrels of crude oil, Exxon has agreed to report to investors on how climate change will affect its core business model, including the prospect that major portions of its oil reserves may need to be left in the ground as carbon-reducing policies and expanded use of renewable energy take hold globally. U.S. oil production since Exxon Valdez . I remain guarded about how major oil companies will ultimately transition to being energy companies rather than fossil fuel companies, boosting our economy sustainably rather than pushing it closer to a breaking point. But Exxon's commitment reflects a growing consensus among business leaders and investors that climate change is a core economic risk that must be tackled now. This is in stark contrast to just a few years ago, when climate change was seen as a tree-hugger issue relevant more to polar bears than financial bottom lines. After years of foot-dragging, businesses are recognizing the scientific certainty and economic effects of climate change -- from higher food costs to broken supply chains to costlier weather-related disasters. They see the powerful dollars-and-cents argument for mitigating carbon pollution today rather than waiting until it is too late and too expensive. Companies such as General Motors, Apple and Starbucks are now calling for strong climate and clean-energy policies in Congress. They are among more than 750 companies that have signed Ceres' Climate Declaration, which brings together companies and individuals to demonstrate support for national action on climate change. The world's largest institutional investors -- including many of the 500 that attended the U.N. Investor Summit on Climate Risk -- are actively integrating climate risks and opportunities into their investment decisions. Some are already pulling out of riskier carbon-intensive investments such as coal companies and are setting specific targets for elevating clean energy investments. Major stock exchanges are also beginning to require listed companies to disclose climate and other sustainability risks to investors. And securities regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and state insurance regulators, have taken strong steps, at Ceres and investors' urging, to require similar climate risk disclosure. These actions are profoundly important if we are to have any hope of thwarting, or limiting, the impact of this colossal global threat, which requires a massive shift in our economy to clean energy and away from fossil fuels. Solving climate change and building a sustainable global economy cannot happen unless companies and investors realize their role in the problem and become part of the solution. We are making progress. Yet even as the biggest companies in the world change their business practices and come out in support of strong climate action, it remains a deeply controversial issue in Washington, which has led to policy paralysis. It is unfathomable. We must demand a vigorous debate over how best to meet the climate challenge, casting climate deniers out to the fringe where they now belong. Unless we act now, the threat that climate change poses to the planet will be exponentially greater. And the solutions will be increasingly harder to implement down the road. The ""roasted world"" warning is a real threat, but it doesn't need to become our reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mindy Lubber.","25 years ago, the Exxon Valdez supertanker created a gigantic oil spill in Alaska waters .

"(CNN) -- At least 49 people were killed and 247 wounded in violence marking the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution that brought down longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian state media said. Dozens more people were wounded in clashes throughout the country between anti-government protesters and security forces. The casualty figures came from the Ministry of Health, the state media said. The Anti-Coup Alliance, which supports deposed President Mohamed Morsy, claimed nine people were dead in one neighborhood alone after fierce confrontations. Those deaths were in the Alfa Maskan neighborhood in East Cairo, the alliance said. Meanwhile, pro-Morsy protesters have been issuing warnings on social media against using public ambulances. That could complicate tallying a death toll because the health ministry reports only deaths in public hospitals. East Cairo residents reported intense violence. ""There has been ongoing gunfire for more than three hours,"" Karim Ennarah, who lives near to the fighting, told CNN. He reported hearing automatic and semi-automatic gunfire. ""It's like a war."" The neighborhood is part of the Ain Shams area, where a bomb caused at least one reported injury. The neighborhood is also known for its strong Islamist presence and has featured numerous anti-coup protests and clashes throughout the past months. The health ministry reported two people were killed in the southern province of Minya, one in Cairo and one in Giza, state media said. Four people were wounded when unknown gunmen attacked a security camp in Suez with a rocket-propelled grendade, state media are reporting, quoting security officials. Another was wounded in an explosion in the Cairo suburb of Ain Shams, Egyptian state news outlet Al Ahram online said Saturday. In the Sinai, a military helicopter crashed and a search is ongoing for its crew, the country's state news agency, EgyNews, said Saturday, citing a military spokesman. There were no immediate details available about the cause of the crash. The Sinai region, which has a strong presence of militants, has been plagued by sporadic violence. A day of demonstrations . Demonstrators filled the streets amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Police dispersed a march that retraced the route protesters took to Tahrir Square three years ago. They fired tear gas and bird shots at protesters as soon as they started moving from the meeting point at Mostafa Mahmoud Mosque in Giza, activist Wael Khalil said. A small number of protesters regrouped outside the Press Syndicate, marking a similar protest in the same spot three years ago. ""We were also small in number back then, but our number got bigger,"" said a protester Om Ali who came with her teenage daughter and son. They chanted against the military government and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Revolutionary Front, a pro-democracy coalition critical of the Muslim Brotherhood and the government, called for all its members and participants to withdraw from demonstrations, citing police violence. ""Excessive use of force by the police today at the anniversary of the revolution against anyone who attempts to express their opinion is considered a major crime added to the list of crimes by the current authorities,"" the Front said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page. ""At the same time, the authorities protect their supporters in Tahrir Square in which the martyrs' blood had been shed."" The iconic square was filled with banners featuring the picture of army chief and Defense Minister Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, with citizens gathering signatures urging him to run for president. A police march band played to the crowds as military helicopters hovered above it. El-Sisi said recently that he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported. Claim of responsibility for Friday blasts . A terrorist group claimed responsibility Saturday for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo on Friday. The organization Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, said in a statement that it was targeting Cairo's security headquarters and security forces. A powerful explosion hit the capital's police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding more than 50 others, Egyptian authorities said. The blast struck a key symbol of authority in a country that has been shaken by political turmoil and violent unrest in recent years. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. And later, a fourth explosion outside a movie theater in Giza city, near Cairo, killed one person and injured seven others, state television said. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has been blamed for carrying out attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula as well as on a security forces headquarters in the town of Mansoura last year. Islamist extremist groups have threatened to avenge the military coup that removed democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy from power last year. Opinion: Egypt's revolution on the margins .

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made his case Thursday to the American people and the world for ""a constructive approach"" to contentious issues including his nation's nuclear program, arguing that failing to engage ""leads to everyone's loss."" ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,"" Rouhani said in an op-ed published Thursday evening on the Washington Post's website. It's not the first time a leader from a country often at odds with the United States has used its newspapers to convey his or her views. Just last week, for instance, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued against international military intervention in Syria and jabbed his U.S. counterpart for saying Americans should consider themselves ""exceptional"" -- a remark that quickly elicited derision from across the U.S. political spectrum. But Rouhani's tone differed from Putin's, echoing the theme of ""prudence and hope"" and the promise of more positive engagement with the rest of the world that helped propel him to an election win in June. ""To move beyond impasses, ... we need to aim higher,"" he said. ""Rather than focusing on how to prevent things from getting worse, we need to think -- and talk -- about how to make things better."" Contending ""the age of blood feuds"" and the idea of diplomacy as a ""zero-sum game"" no longer apply in a ""changed"" world, Rouhani said leaders should engage each other ""on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect."" ""My approach to foreign policy seeks to resolve ... issues by addressing their underlying causes,"" he said. ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart."" Chief among those issues, for Iran, is its nuclear program. Iranian officials have insisted its aim is peaceful and for energy purposes only, but skeptical U.S., Israeli and other officials accuse Tehran of working to develop nuclear weapons. Iran's lack of openness on the issue and its perceived lack of cooperation with international nuclear authorities, have led to stringent international sanctions and increased tensions in the region. In his opinion column Thursday, Rouhani sought to frame the debate over what he called ""our peaceful nuclear energy program."" This program, he said, is tied into not only addressing Iran's energy needs but also into establishing its place in the world. ""To us, mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who Iranians are as a nation, our demand for dignity and respect, and our consequent place in the world,"" he said. The Washington Post column appears to be part of a U.S.-targeted public relations initiative by Rouhani, coming a day after he talked with NBC News. In that interview, Rouhani said, ""We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb and we are not going to do so."" Iran's Rouhani: Diplomat's touch, no pushover . There's little dispute Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is Iran's most powerful figure. Still, Rouhani said Thursday that he and his delegation will head to New York with the ""full power and has complete authority"" to make a deal with others on nuclear matters. The Iranian president also talked about trading letters with Obama this summer, an exchange he called ""positive and constructive."" ""It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,"" Rouhani told NBC, according to video on the network's website. ""I believe the leaders in all countries could think in their national interests and that they should not be under the influence of (interest) groups."" Rouhani's Washington Post op-ed published a few hours after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry -- also speaking in Washington -- characterized some of the new Iranian president's remarks as ""very positive."" Yet he offered his compliment with a caveat: ""Everything needs to be put to the test, and we'll see where we go."" Iranian human rights activist freed . Kerry punted on a question of whether Rouhani and U.S. President Barack Obama will meet next week when both attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Asked the same question Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said ""there are currently no plans"" for such a face-to-face meeting though he also didn't rule it out. And Carney did hint the United States is open to talks with Iran -- with whom it has feuded regarding Iran's nuclear program, a dispute that's led to harsh international sanctions and raised the specter of war in the region -- to ""test"" whether Tehran is sincere in its hope to improve its international standing. ""I think it's fair to say that (Obama) believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran,"" Carney said. ""And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity."" In fact, there were high-level talks Thursday -- involving Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Zarif called the meeting ""constructive,"" saying it involved ""satisfactory negotiations"" on various issues such as Iran's nuclear program, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Ban's office also issued a positive statement on the meeting, saying the two ""discussed Iran's growing cooperation with the international community on a host of issues, including the nuclear file, as well the role Iran could play in promoting a political solution to the conflict in Syria."" This cooperation has been spearheaded by Rouhani, himself a former nuclear negotiator who vowed during his campaign to try to reduce tensions between Iran and the outside world. That includes expressing openness in talks on its nuclear program. The 64-year-old cleric, who is considered a moderate, said last month that as long as there are ""negotiations without threats, the way for interaction is open.""

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese national was killed and 17 others injured in the Saudi capital during ongoing clashes over a visa crackdown, the Saudi Press Agency reported. The death Wednesday came after two people were killed and 68 others injured Saturday in clashes between police and foreign workers, the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi authorities began rounding up thousands of illegal foreign workers last week after the expiration of an amnesty to formalize their status. The crackdown is mainly concentrated in Manfouha, a district of the capital city, Riyadh. In light of Saturday's clashes, a police spokesman urged workers without proper documents to surrender at a shelter in Riyadh until they could be deported. Most of the workers impacted by recent police raids are African migrants. Reports circulated last week of the death of an Ethiopian man, prompting the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement that it ""condemned the killing of an Ethiopian and mistreatment of its citizens residing in Saudi Arabia."" Saudi Arabia launched a ""security campaign"" this month to crack down on workers violating visa rules. Khaled Al Maeena, editor-in-chief of the Saudi Gazette, said police are focusing on two types of undocumented immigrants. ""One is the over-stayers and who came illegally, smuggled themselves through the borders, or were smuggled in,"" he said. ""But as far as the others who have documents and have shifted from one job to another without informing the authorities, I think their position is being rectified."" The Saudi Census Bureau does not break down the exact demographics of Manfouha. There are no official numbers yet on how many migrants are affected by the government crackdown. Images from Manfouha show dozens of migrants waiting for buses and taxis as they prepare to leave the neighborhood. Al Maeena said many Saudis welcome a crackdown on illegal immigrants, but there are questions about who will fill their jobs. ""Most of the jobs that are being done are menial jobs,"" he said. ""They are drivers. They drive septic tanks, they do work in farms. They do many jobs that the Saudis don't.""","A Sudanese national was killed and 17 injured Wednesday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh .

"PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Just 10 years ago, you couldn't mention the words ""posh"" and ""Pittsburgh"" in the same sentence without a collective laugh. Not anymore. Pittsburgh is home to vibrant neighborhoods filled with distinctive shops and restaurants. The Pennsylvanian city is not the soot-filled place that many people think it is. Closed mills and clear skies have yielded beautiful neighborhoods that feature great shopping and even better dining. Once the security details from this week's G-20 Summit clear out of the city, visit Pittsburgh and make sure to stop in some of these trendy neighborhoods. Lawrenceville . Formerly one of the city's seediest neighborhoods, Lawrenceville is quickly transforming into a hotspot for fledgling artists. Dotted along Butler Street are independent galleries, swanky boutiques and locally owned cafes serving gourmet food (you won't find a Starbucks here).  Watch how the city turned itself around » . Thanks to several revitalization projects, the neighborhood is now cleaner and a cool place to hang out, which is a stark contrast to its industrial past. Indulge in authentic Italian food at Piccolo Forno (try the lasagna), then stroll on down to the Who Knew? furniture gallery, which showcases retro furniture from the 1950s and '60s.

"(CNN) -- The waters of the Blue Nile have for millennia flowed down from the Ethiopian highlands enriching the countries on its banks. The rocks that make up its riverbed have been eroded by Ethiopia's past and now that the construction of Africa's largest hydro-electric dam has begun, these same rocks are helping to build the country's future. The Grand Renaissance Dam project was announced last year by the Ethiopian government, in a unilateral move that is not sitting very well with its downstream neighbors. Egypt and Sudan say Ethiopia is threatening their greatest natural resource. What's undisputed though is the sheer size of this undertaking close to Ethiopia's border with Sudan. ""It's not very easy to build a project of this magnitude in a remote area,"" explains Francesco Verdi, who oversees this project for Salini, the Italian construction firm that has been contracted by the Ethiopians to build the dam. According to Verdi, 10% of the dam has been completed so far and teams are working day and night to stay on schedule. ""This is one of the largest dams in the world,"" Verdi says. ""The effort of this country is really, really impressive. They will produce clean energy using natural resources."" More from MPA: Kenya PM: Sudan conflict threatens world oil prices . If construction stays on schedule the dam will be complete in six years. Ethiopia says the dam will generate 6,000 mega watts of electricity and it will sell a proportion of that to its neighbors and use the rest to fuel its own growth. Semegnew Bekele is the Ethiopian engineer in charge of overseeing this mammoth project. He has worked on three other dams in Ethiopia, but this will be his and his country's first attempt at damming the Blue Nile. ""This Nile river originates from our country and flows without giving any benefit to us so now we are able to utilize this river,"" he explains. Meeting Bekele, it becomes obvious that this project is a source of immense personal and national pride and in Ethiopia at least he has become a bit of a celebrity -- he regularly gets stopped in the street by people congratulation him on the dam and asking how it is progressing. It might be a source of pride for Bekele and Ethiopia, but for Egypt and Sudan this project is deeply contentious. Egypt with its population time bomb is particularly worried -- nearly 85% of its water originates in Ethiopia. Egyptians say they will not be held hostage over water, explains Yarcob Arsarno, who is an expert on hydro-politics at Addis Ababa University. ""Sudan and Egypt have got their concerns. Building a huge project on the water that goes down to Sudan, they would think that water would be controlled by Ethiopia and Ethiopia would be much more powerful in terms of influence in the Nile basin."" The Nile Treaty that is meant to govern the use of the Blue Nile between the three nations was in fact signed by colonial powers in the region. Ethiopia says it never signed the agreement and the so-called Nile Basin Initiative only provides a framework for the use of the Nile waters. More from MPA: Using the web to fight corruption . Egypt and Sudan are particularly worried that this dam will allow Ethiopia to control the flow of water. Ethiopia denies this and says it will use machines to monitor and ensure the flow remains stable. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has dismissed these concerns and warned against what he called ""dam extremists."" Zenawi and his government stress that this dam project could potentially transform Ethiopia's economy. It is a view shared by some of the diplomatic community in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. One diplomat told Marketplace Africa that this dam will be ""like an ATM of hard currency for Ethiopia"". Many economists also agree on the dam's economic potential. See also: Old car tires fuel green shoe revolution . ""Hydropower is the cheapest electricity you can generate anywhere so Ethiopia has huge advantages for that and Ethiopia will export enough power to make a difference in the economy,"" says Henock Assefa, an economist and managing partner of Precise Consult International based in Addis Ababa. ""This is a signal of self-reliance. This is a signal of Ethiopia moving from an aid dependent economy to a can-do economy. We're going to do this with or without you. The Ethiopian government is issuing bonds and the population, all 85 million of us, are buying bonds in order to chip in to this huge Nile project."" But will Ethiopia be able to raise enough money to continue to build this dam? Some economists believe the country has only raised 10% of the project's total cost. There are also reports that civil servants have been forced to contribute one month's salary towards the project. These are accusations the government denies. International Rivers, an organization working against destructive riverside projects, says that the Ethiopian government has not allowed an open discussion about the funding and merits of this dam. International Rivers points to the case of an Ethiopian journalist Reeyot Alemu who has been jailed for daring to criticize the government's centerpiece project. Ethiopian authorities say Alemu is on trial over terror charges. What is not up for debate is how determined Ethiopia is to fulfill its aspiration as the ""battery of East Africa."" All over Addis Ababa, new buildings are rising. According the African Development Bank, Ethiopia's economy last year grew by 7.5% and although inflation also rose to 31.5% the country has successful grown its average income by 50% over the past decade. The International Monetary Fund, though, is ringing alarm bells. Given this region's history of drought, the IMF is recommending that governments avoid dependency on hydropower as an engine of growth. As they dig into ancient bedrock for their futuristic dam, it seems the Ethiopians believe this is a risk worth taking.","Ethiopia is building the largest hydro-electric dam in Africa .

"(CNN) -- This week's United Nations meeting could mark a turning point in the acidic relationship between Iran and the United States. Will U.S. President Barack Obama shake the hand of newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani? Will the two presidents even hold a meeting? Those are key questions after Rouhani's ""we must work together"" opinion piece published by the Washington Post's website last week. His comments have sparked optimism on the streets of Iran's capital, where residents are hopeful as they take note of their new president's unprecedented charm offensive pushing for better relations with Washington. But the Iranian president's new approach hasn't played as well in Israel. The New York Times reported Sunday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is stepping up an effort to blunt Iran's diplomatic offensive, and plans to warn the United Nations that overtures toward a nuclear deal could be a trap. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful energy, but the United States and others suspect it's for atomic bombs. The dispute about why Iran is seeking nuclear capability has prompted international sanctions and escalated concerns about additional warfare in the Middle East. In his op-ed, Rouhani wrote that he wants ""a constructive approach"" between his country and the world, including about Iran's nuclear program. ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,"" Rouhani said. Analysts are divided about Rouhani and his sincerity in addressing his country's nuclear program. But there's one thing all analysts agree on: the op-ed was a jumping off point for a very high-profile public relations push. And this week, Rouhani could take things a step further. Analyst: Rouhani needs to strike a deal quickly . In many ways, Rouhani's recent election is like Obama's in 2008: Rouhani enjoys enormous political capital, offering an opportunity to renew U.S.-Iran relations. Rouhani overcame hard-line conservatives by campaigning as a centrist and a reformer, using a ""hope and prudence"" slogan. To keep hard-liners at bay, Rouhani now must deliver something -- namely, economic relief as Iran strains under global sanctions -- or his critics will prevail as they did against Obama in 2009 when his own venture on U.S.-Iran diplomacy foundered, one analyst said. ""Now the roles are reversed: Rouhani needs to strike a deal quickly,"" said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, who authored ""A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran."" This week's U.N. General Assembly meeting ""could be quite decisive,"" Parsi said. ""That's going to be the moment where the two sides have to invest the political capital needed. Otherwise it will go nowhere. It's going to be costly politically to strike a deal. There's going to be critics on both sides,"" Parsi said. ""There is a need for a huge dose of political will to be injected into the process."" Will the two presidents meet? Obama delivered a speech Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly, and Rouhani is scheduled to as well. But it's unclear whether the two presidents will meet. Ben Rhodes, a White House deputy national security adviser, said Monday that no meeting has been scheduled with Rouhani for this week, but the White House remains open to diplomacy that serves American interests. Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Obama shouldn't meet with Rouhani during the U.N. gathering, though shaking hands in a corridor would be appropriate. Abrams says that's because while Rouhani is Iran's president, he is not the country's leader. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the supreme leader of Iran. ""They are not counterparts, they are not equal,"" said Abrams, who also supervised U.S. policy in the Middle East under former President George W. Bush. ""So for the president to meet with him, I think confers too great a recognition on him."" Abrams said Rouhani was a skilled political tactician when he was the country's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005. ""Remember this is the guy -- Rouhani -- who wrote several years ago with pride how he tied us up in negotiations while the nuclear program (of Iran) was going forward,"" Abrams said. ""So we should approach this with skepticism."" Asked Monday whether the two presidents may just shake hands, Rhodes replied, ""I don't think anything will happen by happenstance on a relationship this important."" White House weighs in . The Obama administration has welcomed Rouhani's published column. ""But the fact of the matter is actions are what are going to be determinative here,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. ""The Iranians, for a number of years now, have been unwilling to live up to their obligations to the international community as it relates to their nuclear program."" The international community's economic sanctions against Iran has ""taken a significant toll on their economy and put pressure on them to come back to the bargaining table,"" Earnest said. He did acknowledge that Rouhani now enjoys a window of opportunity against his hard-line adversaries at home, but Iran must ""demonstrate their seriousness of purpose"" and show ""their nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful means."" For now, Obama's schedule this week doesn't contain any meetings with Rouhani. Asked if the United States is willing to ease sanctions against Iran, Earnest said such economic pressure ""is what has brought the Iranians to the table."" Optimism in Tehran . On the streets of Iran's capital, many appear to be hopeful that their president's overtures toward the United States are a good sign. But they're also realistic that 34 years of mistrust will not disappear overnight. ""I am 99% sure things will be better,"" said Tehran resident Syed Ali Akbar. ""I can just feel it."" Barber Hassan Ahmadi said he wants sanctions to end. ""I want to see better relations,"" he said, ""so we can live a little easier."" Ali Hayati wasn't even born the last time Iran and the United States had diplomatic relations. But now, he feels like there's a chance for change. ""I want to see Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Obama sit in front of each other and speak about life,"" he said. At the House of Persian Carpets in the famous Tehran Bazaar, merchant Sadegh Kiyaei said he's optimistic. ""We believe that two nations -- Iran and America -- they realize that they need each other. They like each other,"" he said. ""And they feel that it's the right time to get together and to start talking at least."" CNN's Reza Sayah in Tehran, Kevin Liptak in Washington and Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta contributed to this report.","White House official: Obama still has no meeting scheduled with Rouhani .

"(CNN) -- The restive North African nation of Tunisia has issued an international arrest warrant for its ousted president, his wife, and several members of their families, Tunisian media reported. Tunisian Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi on Wednesday announced that the warrant had been brought against Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, according to Tunis Afrique Presse, or TAP, the country's official news agency. Chebbi said the warrant is based on several charges, including carrying weapons and ammunition in Tunisia without licenses, maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally, and inciting armed violence between Tunisians. Chebbi said some family members have been arrested and others are still at large, and that others could be arrested as the investigation continues. Interpol, the international police agency, confirmed that its National Central Bureau in Tunis has issued a global alert ""to seek the location and arrest Ben Ali and six of his relatives."" Citing media reports, it said Ben Ali and some of his family members are wanted ""on charges of alleged property theft and the illegal transfer of foreign currency."" The National Central Bureau is asking its ""member countries to search, locate and provisionally arrest"" Ali and the relatives with a view to their extradition to Tunis."" ""If and when the individuals are located, Tunisian authorities will forward any formal request for extradition via diplomatic channels,"" Interpol said. Ben Ali, who ruled Tunisia since 1987, fled to Saudi Arabia earlier this month amid mass public protests against the government for corruption, poor living conditions, high unemployment and repression. The grass-roots protest has emboldened people in Egypt and Algeria to take their complaints to the streets. It also has generated admiration across the world. For example, in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, President Barack Obama made reference to Ben Ali's rule, saying ""the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator."" An interim government was formed after Ben Ali's departure, and protesters are demanding that none of the people in the government should have links to the ousted president's regime. Changes in the government makeup were expected on Wednesday, TAP reported. Within the ruling circles, there is empathy for the protesters. TAP reported that Noureddine Hached, Tunisia's ambassador to Japan, resigned from his post ""in solidarity with the Tunisian people and their martyrs."" He is preparing to return to Tunisia. The government will provide compensation to the families of people who died in the recent unrest and others who were injured. It will also pass along aid for jobless higher education graduates, TAP reported. More than 100 people were killed in protests in recent weeks, the United Nations has said. There have been protests regularly in Tunisia, which gained its independence from France in 1956 and has many links to the country. France's Agence France Presse reported on Wednesday that one of its journalists saw about 200 protesters throwing stones at police. Tunisians have expressed outrage over the actions of the president and his family. But Tunis Afrique Presse reports that the curfew there has been narrowed to 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. starting Wednesday ""as part of alleviating the state of emergency measures and in view of the improvement in the country's security situation."" Last week, Tunisia's new government interrogated more than 30 people from Ben Ali's entourage, a top official said Friday, while 1,200 others who have ""spread terror among the population carried out unacceptable acts"" have been arrested, TAP reported. Tunisia's Interior Minister Ahmed Friaa announced the arrests in a news conference, saying that ""33 members of families close to the former president have been brought to justice and are now being interrogated."" ""These people's jewels and huge sums of money in their possession have been seized,"" the TAP news agency reported, citing Friaa, a holdover from the previous government. Some of the 1,200 people arrested by the new government have been released, Friaa said, while 382 others face charges such as carrying illegal firearms, looting and committing violence. Meanwhile, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay announced  Wednesday that ""a team of top-level specialists"" from her office is assembling in Tunisia, and they will officially start a week-long assessment of human rights priorities on Thursday. ""Human rights abuses were at the heart of the problems faced by the people of Tunisia. Therefore, human rights must be at the forefront of the solutions to those problems,"" Pillay said. It ""will explore possibilities for the advancement of human rights in Tunisia and seek to gain a first-hand understanding of the human rights challenges,"" Pillay said. ""Its observations and recommendations will enable me to put together a set of concrete proposals for immediate and future action to improve the human rights situation in the country. It is important that we maintain the positive momentum established by the recent dramatic transformation of the political situation.""","NEW: The curfew has been narrowed in Tunisia .

"(CNN) -- Iran's centrist president-elect expressed a willingness to open dialogue with the United States, which it hasn't had diplomatic relations with in decades, but only if the United States recognizes Iran's right to a nuclear program. Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency over the weekend, said in his first news conference Monday, however, that the Islamic republic has no intention of ending its uranium-enrichment program. The program is a major impetus for the international sanctions against Iran. Calling relations between the U.S. and Iran an ""old wound"" and ""complicated,"" Rouhani said that before there are talks, the U.S. must first promise to never interfere with Iranian domestic affairs and scrap its ""unilateral"" and ""bullying policies."" ""Wisdom tells us both countries, both nations need to think more about the future and try to sit down and find solutions to past issues and rectify things,"" he said. ""The rights of the Iranian nation, including nuclear rights, need to be recognized."" ""We are prepared to see tensions alleviated,"" he added, noting that any talks ""should be based on mutual respect and interest and equal footing."" In opening his news conference, Rouhani, 65, said repairing Iran's economy and engaging in more dialogue -- both at home and abroad -- will be his administration's top priorities. Dialogue and the economy are related, as Iran faces sharp international sanctions over its nuclear program, but Rouhani said he foresees a ""fresh opportunity for interaction at the global level."" Mutual trust and transparency are key to the international community lifting sanctions, which he called ""brutal, and the people of Iran have done nothing wrong to deserve sanctions."" ""Making use of the lever of sanctions, this is not the right time for that. ... Even in the West, they are facing economic problems and dilemmas, and they themselves know the sanctions are to the detriment of the West,"" Rouhani said, adding that Israel was the only country benefiting from them. ""We can make it clear to the whole world that the measures and activities of the Islamic republic are totally within international regulations and mechanisms."" Rouhani did not elaborate on how he would make the country's nuclear program more transparent, but he insisted that the Iranian nuclear program was lawful. He also voiced opposition to international ""meddling"" in domestic affairs. While Rouhani encouraged Iran to act with ""unity and solidarity"" as it transitions to his promised moderate rule in coming weeks, he said his primary goals will be ""acting in line with salvaging the country's economy, reviving morality and constructive interaction with the world."" He said he could not yet provide time lines but said he would first like to ensure that Iranians had basic commodities before his government pursues ""the tranquility and stability of the economy."" This will require embracing ""moderation and justice, and not extremism and egoism,"" he said. ""Electoral promises, I will not forget them, so I beseech the almighty God to give me the opportunity to materialize all those promises."" Rouhani said he would convene groups to discuss the best ways to improve the country's social, cultural and economic affairs. ""As far as practice, that job will be delegated to the people themselves,"" he said. After his victory was announced over the weekend, Rouhani spoke of reforms without threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or the country's institutions -- of which he is a product. The former national security council chief promised greater personal freedoms and said he would free political prisoners and jailed journalists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already cautioned the world against easing such sanctions in the face of Rouhani's promises. ""Regarding the results of the elections in Iran, let us not delude ourselves. The international community must not become caught up in wishes and be tempted to relax the pressure on Iran to stop its nuclear program,"" Netanyahu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting. The prime minister also said Iran's supreme leader ""disqualified candidates who did not fit his extremist outlook."" In his campaigning, Rouhani pledged to improve the economy and unemployment. As a former nuclear negotiator, he said, he would reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing the sanctions. In a message through the semiofficial Fars News Agency, Rouhani said the win ""is the victory of wisdom, moderation, growth and awareness, the victory of commitment and religiosity over extremism and ill tempers."" Reaction from the West -- including that of Britain, the United States and United Nations -- revolved around calls for Rouhani to keep his promises to steer Iran in a new direction. The United States ""remains ready to engage the Iranian government directly in order to reach a diplomatic solution that will fully address the international community's concerns about Iran's nuclear program,"" the White House said. While the White House respected the vote, it said the election occurred ""against the backdrop of a lack of transparency, censorship of the media, Internet, and text messages, and an intimidating security environment that limited freedom of expression and assembly."" Rouhani succeeds outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was term-limited and could not run in the election. But Rouhani won't be Iran's most powerful man. That distinction belongs to Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989. He's got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard. On his website, the supreme leader said Rouhani is the president of all Iranians and told supporters of various candidates to set aside their differences and unify. Rouhani has all-round credentials in Iran's institutions, including as a senior cleric and former commander of Iranian air defenses, and he is an intellectual with three law degrees, including from a university in Scotland. He has a reputation for shunning extreme positions and bridging differences. While he has represented Khamenei on Iran's security council since 1989, he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community, according to an Iranian scholar at Stanford University. He has also accused state-run media of censorship and publishing lies. Prior to Rouhani's election, Iran's Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered. Eight candidates were approved, two of whom subsequently dropped out. The final six contenders didn't include any women. Nor did they include Ahmadinejad's aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Michael Martinez, Holly Yan, Michael Schwartz, Laura Smith-Spark, Reza Sayah, Azadeh Ansari and Sara Mazloumsaki contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. must respect Iran's nuclear rights before talks can begin, Hassan Rouhani says .

"CHARLESTON, South Carolina (CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidates faced questions directly from voters on Monday in the first CNN/YouTube debate. Democratic candidates answered questions ranging from Iraq to taxes to Al Gore. The lights and cameras were focused on the eight candidates, but it was the personal, heartfelt and, at times, comical nature of the user questions that stole the spotlight. Questions included one from a father who lost a son in Iraq and wondered if he would lose another, a gay couple asking why they shouldn't be allowed to marry and a woman stricken with breast cancer who asked if her chance of survival would be better if she had health insurance. In all, 39 questions were asked from the 3,000 submissions YouTube said it received. Most observers agreed that none of the candidates debating at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, particularly outshone their rivals, doing nothing to challenge Sen. Hillary Clinton's position as the Democratic race's front-runner.  Watch the candidates judge the strengths and weaknesses of each other » . An average of 11 national polls taken in June put Clinton in the lead at 40 percent to Sen. Barack Obama's 25 percent and 14 percent for former Sen. John Edwards. The rest of the field was in single digits. The video questions came in all forms -- people facing the camera straight-on, people in makeup, people with flash cards. There were the two men from Tennessee and their ""Red State Update"" asking if the candidates were hurt by all the attention given non-runner Al Gore as well as a man who sang about how much tax he paid. And then there was the talking snowman with a question about global warming. Interspersed with the questions and answers were videos the campaigns had produced themselves. Edwards' video took a swipe at Republicans, who had raised the issue of his spending $400 for haircuts, with a video that showed the haircuts of President Bush and embattled U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales morph into images from Iraq and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to the tune of the song ""Hair"" from the musical of the same name. One of the highlights came when a YouTuber asked the candidates to look to their left and say one thing about that person they liked and one thing they disliked. Edwards said he liked Clinton's service to the country, as well as her husband's. But Edwards looked at the salmon-colored jacket Clinton wore and said jokingly, ""But I don't know about that jacket.""  See telling quotes from each candidate » . New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson noted that each one would make an excellent contribution to his future administration. The debate continued online after the lights went down on the set as Web users weighed in on the candidates' performances and on the groundbreaking format. Some said that the questions from YouTubers were as good or better than those of the media and phrased that the candidates had a tough time ducking them. Others, though, said that the candidates dodged questions from YouTubers like they did those of the media. Jordan Williams, a student at the University of Kansas, asked Clinton and Obama how they would address critics who charge that ""either one is not authentically black enough, or the other is not satisfactorily feminine."" ""Well, I couldn't run as anything other than a woman,"" Clinton replied, drawing laughs. ""But, obviously, I'm not running because I'm a woman."" Obama, who is biracial, said, ""You know, when I'm catching a cab in Manhattan -- in the past, I think I've given my credentials."" Rep. Dennis Kucinich narrowed the focus to Iraq, saying he voted against the war in Iraq -- which sets him apart from other candidates on the stage. He said he would never send Americans to fight in a war based on ""a lie."" And he faulted his colleagues in Congress for allowing the war to continue, saying voters didn't vote Republicans out of control of Congress last fall just to get a Democratic version of the war. Sen. Chris Dodd expressed frustration at how the Iraq war has colored opinions of the U.S. around the world. ""We've lost our moral leadership in the world,"" Dodd said. ""No one listens to us when it comes to foreign policy."" Richardson tried to put distance between himself and his senatorial rivals on the stage, saying that all U.S. troops should be brought home from Iraq by the end of 2007 ""with no residual forces."" ""The time has come to bring the troops home. No politics. Get it done,"" he said. That brought a retort from Sen. Joe Biden, who said a pullout of U.S. combat troops would take at least a year to complete and that, unless some U.S. forces remained in Iraq, all of the American civilians there would have to be evacuated as well. ""You better have helicopters ready to take those 3,000 civilians inside the Green Zone [in Baghdad],"" he said. ""You better make sure you have protection for them, or let them die."" Another question asked if the candidates would scrap or revise ""No Child Left Behind."" Richardson and Biden said they would do away with it. A gay female couple appeared on the screen next, asking if the candidates would allow them to be married. Kucinich said yes; Dodd and Edwards said no but that they support civil unions for gay couples. ""The honest answer is I don't [support gay marriage],"" said Edwards. ""But I think it's wrong for me as the president of the United States to use my faith to deny anyone their rights."" Asked whether he would work for the minimum wage, which goes from $5.15 per hour to $5.85 on Tuesday, former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel responded: ""Oh, yes, I would, but I would say that we don't need a minimum wage; we need a living wage. We don't have that in this country because of what they passed."" The debate kicked off with a series of questions from voters that moderator Anderson Cooper described as ""not making the cut."" They included a questioner dressed in a Viking outfit, a 5-year-old posing a question about Social Security and a man in a chicken costume. Though CNN vetted the questions, it was the first time that a journalist or a professional has not dictated what is asked of the candidates. The debate was considered crucial for candidates wishing to stand out among their Democratic challengers, especially to distinguish themselves from Clinton. South Carolina will hold one of the first primaries early next year, following on the heels of the Iowa precinct caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. For Democrats, the contest in the Palmetto State will be a key early test of strength among black voters. In 2004, exit polls showed about 47 percent of primary voters were black, in a race Edwards, a South Carolina native, won. Republican presidential candidates will face questions from YouTube users in a debate scheduled November 28 in Florida.

"(CNN) -- A leading opposition figure in Bahrain has been jailed after being charged with ""inciting and advocating terrorism,"" Bahrain's Public Prosecution Office said. Activists in the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom, however, insist the charges against Khalil Al Marzooq are politically motivated and accuse the country's leadership of attempting to stifle dissent. Al Marzooq, secretary general of Al-Wefaq, the main Shia opposition party, was arrested Tuesday after being interrogated about a speech he delivered last week. According to BNA, Bahrain's official news agency, he was summoned to a police station, questioned and then referred to the Public Prosecution Office. In a statement, the office accused Al Marzooq of being ""affiliated with the terrorist organization"" and added that he had been ""speaking at many forums, inciting and promoting terrorist acts, advocating principles which incite such acts, supporting violence committed by the terrorist coalition, and legally justifying criminal activities."" Taher Al-Mosawi, the head of Al-Wefaq's media center, says that Al Marzooq did not incite violence and that Bahrain opposition parties are suspending participation in national dialogue. Al-Wefaq called the government's actions in regard to Al Marzooq ""reckless"" and ""a clear targeting of political action in Bahrain."" The party added in a statement that it believes his detention is, in part, a reaction to a European Parliament resolution passed last week regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain. On a mission: Oppression in Bahrain . That resolution called for ""the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Bahrain"" and urged Bahraini authorities ""to immediately end all acts of repression, release all prisoners of conscience, and respect the rights of juveniles."" European Parliament member Marietje Schaake told CNN that ""the lack of progress in terms of dialogue and reforms towards the rule of law and respect for human rights in Bahrain continue to be of great concern to the European Parliament."" Schaake spearheaded the effort to get the resolution passed. ""For the sake of the well-being of all people in Bahrain,"" she said, ""and for the future of the country, the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations must end. The blanket ban on assembly in Manama is not helping reconciliation, either."" Bahraini opposition activists say that Al Marzooq's arrest is just the latest in a country where many prominent dissidents have been jailed in the past two years and that it only underscores how tense the situation remains in Bahrain. Bahrain's government responds to activist's claims . In February 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, Bahraini citizens, spurred by successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demanded democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run. Anger from the majority Shiite population was directed at the ruling Sunni minority. But Bahrain's uprising failed to gain the traction of other regional revolutions after a crackdown by authorities in the tiny island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of people and arrested, tortured and imprisoned hundreds of others. Opposition leaders have tried to keep the protest movement alive.","NEW: Opposition suspending participation in national dialogue, party official says .

"(CNN) -- Dubai police Monday identified 11 people suspected in the killing of a top Hamas official last month and vowed ""to hunt them down."" At the same time, police offered a chilling scenario of how Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing who had survived at least three other previous attempts on his life, was killed in his hotel room January 19 just hours after arriving in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The 11 suspects identified Monday include one woman and 10 men. All of them hold valid European passports -- one from France, three from Ireland, six from Britain, and one from Germany. None of the suspects has been arrested or charged in the killing. According to police, the suspects arrived in Dubai the day before the killing. Five of them carried out the crime while the remaining six served as lookouts, police said. Police identified a man from France as the logistical mastermind. Police allege the man stayed at a luxury hotel in Dubai, but also booked a room at the al Bustan Rotana hotel where al-Mabhouh was killed. The French suspect requested room 237 -- directly across from where al-Mabhouh was staying in room 230, police say, but the suspect apparently never stayed there. Instead, police say the rest of the group used the room to plot the killing and the alleged mastermind left the country before it was carried out. Footage on security cameras at Dubai International Airport show one of the suspects following al-Mabhouh after he landed, police said. Two others followed him once he arrived at the hotel, police said, taking the same elevator and ensuring al-Mabhouh was staying in room 230. Police said they believe the suspects entered al-Mabhouh's room about 8 p.m. after the hotel cleaning crew finished their rotation on the floor, using an electronic device to gain entry. Al-Mabhouh entered his room at 8:25 p.m., hotel security cameras and an electronic readout of his room key show. Police say the killing took no more than 10 minutes before the suspects left the room and headed immediately to the airport where they boarded flights to various cities in Europe and Asia, police said. Before leaving, police said, the group took great care to make sure the room looked orderly, removing anything that might indicate that al-Mabhouh resisted. The suspects also deliberately turned the safety lock on the room door from the inside in order to suggest the death was normal, police said. Police did not provide details about the nature of the killing in its statement Monday, but authorities have told al-Mabhouh's family that there were signs of five or six electric shocks on his legs, behind his ears, on his genitals and heart. Blood on a pillow led police to believe he was suffocated. Dubai police chief Dahi Khalfan said in a statement Monday that ""The United Arab Emirates does not accept the notion that its land can be used as a battlefield for settling scores no matter what the causes or affiliations of these involved perpetrators can be."" He warned that anyone who tries to ""tamper with the country's security or the safety of any resident or visitor of its community will be subject to prosecution and accountability."" At al-Mabhouh's funeral in January in Damascus, Syria, where he spent the last years of his life, mourners speculated that Israel's intelligence unit, Mossad, was behind the assassination. Al-Mabhouh was behind the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers in 1989, according to Hamas. Israeli security sources have told CNN that al-Mabhouh was a key link between Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas and he was involved in smuggling arms to Gaza. The same sources also point out an arms dealer could have many enemies, not just Israel. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement.","Senior Hamas official, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was killed in Dubai January 19 .

"(CNN) -- Rutgers quarterback Philip Nelson has been dismissed from the football team, the school's coach said Tuesday. Nelson had been arrested Sunday and charged in connection with an assault that apparently left Isaac Kolstad -- a former linebacker for Minnesota State University, Mankato -- in critical condition. ""The Rutgers football family's thoughts and prayers are with Isaac Kolstad and his family,"" football coach Kyle Flood said, referring to the young man whom Nelson is accused of assaulting. Nelson, 20, faces one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault. Authorities in Minnesota also arrested a second person in connection with the assault, a Mankato, Minnesota, city spokeswoman said. Trevor Stenner Shelley, 21, was arrested Monday afternoon. He is charged with first- and third-degree assault. Officers found Kolstad, who graduated in December, near a downtown intersection. He was transported by ambulance to a local hospital. Kolstad, 24, was in critical condition after suffering a severe head injury, his family said. Nelson was a recent transfer to Rutgers. A native of Mankato, Minnesota, he played at the University of Minnesota, according to Rutgers' website. Nelson never played a down for Rutgers before his dismissal.

"(CNN) -- A new report from the American Lung Association lists the cities that have the worst air pollution in the U.S. Places in Southern California and the Central Valley, including Los Angeles, Fresno, Visalia and Modesto, top the list. But Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and even Fairbanks are also offenders. Part of the problem stems from policy failures in Washington. Of course, local governments are at fault as well. In California, cars and trucks contribute heavily to the problem, as is also true in cities like Dallas. LA pioneered urban sprawl and the car culture and is now paying the price. But it's not alone: Atlanta, Charlotte, and others are also sprawled across the countryside. American cities have not done enough to get people out of cars and onto mass transit. LA exemplifies the problems. As detailed in ""Railtown,"" a recent book by Ethan Elkind, LA focused too much on subways and not enough on trolleys and dedicated bus lanes. To make matters worse, the routes were often in the wrong places due to political interference from the city council through the state capital to Congress. It's not realistic to expect that something as major as transportation infrastructure will be immune from politics, but rational planning needs to play a bigger role than it has in the past. LA's specific problems were its own, but mass transit is in need of more support and better implementation across the nation. All too often, support for mass transit is portrayed as a wasteful subsidy because its benefits to the public are misunderstood. The federal government has sometimes failed to do enough to fight air pollution. Under the Bush administration, especially, industry succeeded in using federal laws as a shield against state regulation. For instance, cities have been blocked from addressing pollution from older, dirtier trucks. When one port authority tried to prohibit dirtier trucks from using its facilities, the Supreme Court held this effort violated a federal law deregulating prices and routes in the trucking industry. It was probably a surprise to Congress that the effort to allow markets to control this industry gave the industry special immunity from the kinds of pollution regulations that apply to every other industry. Obviously, other cities also have their own high-polluting trucks, and they are similarly stymied. Lawsuits have also prevented cities from modernizing fleet vehicles such as cabs. When one West Coast air quality district tried to make fleet vehicles such as cab companies buy only the cleaner vehicles on the market. Although this would have been a significant step toward improving air quality in a heavily polluted area, the Supreme Court ruled that the air district was violating federal law. This ruling has had ripple effects elsewhere in the country, like New York City, where federal courts have blocked efforts to upgrade its cab fleet. Some say electric cars are the future. But when electric cars were first introduced, the Bush administration took the very unusual step of getting involved and siding with industry. It wasn't until Bush left office that California was able to make a bigger push for electric cars. The delayed introduction of electric vehicles is bad for the U.S. State regulators, even with the best intentions, can't go it alone. They need local governments to help combat sprawl and support mass transit. The Environmental Protection Agency has an obvious role to play in addressing pollution, and it needs to be more effective. New federal regulations on pollution from electric power plants are a long-overdue step in the right direction. Hopefully, EPA will also tighten ozone standards during its next review. But at the same time that the federal government is trying to do more, it is ironic to see federal law used to block state pollution controls. Air pollution these days is a deceptive problem. People know that some days are hazy and leave their eyes irritated. What they don't realize is that these problems are only the tip of the iceberg. Air pollution results in more respiratory illness, more trips to the ER, and more deaths. According to EPA estimates, its program to reduce cross-state pollution (which the Supreme Court upheld recently) will save 14,000-34,000 lives per year. We've made real progress should not become complacent over this major public health issue. We need to redouble our efforts.","A new report lists the cities that have the worst air quality in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- It was a monumental challenge, a logistical effort Boeing had never faced before: simultaneously moving a small army of technicians to 13 international locations, transporting 15 tons of tools per repair kit, and installing newly designed equipment in the field, taking five days per airplane working around the clock in two 12-hour shifts. The goal: get 50 new 787 Dreamliners back in service as quickly as possible following a three-month grounding. Boeing's pride had been stomped on by the first ever grounding of one of its airliners. Pride and a commitment for customer service meant going all out for five disappointed, sometimes cantankerous customers. The task fell to Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services, or CAS, to complete a task unprecedented in its scale. Elements have been revealed by Boeing's chief 787 program engineer, Mike Sinnett, in various press conferences. Below is the inside story of the planning process, the first time CAS has granted an interview about its planning and implementation process. Outlining how CAS reacted to the two now famous lithium-ion battery incidents is the head of CAS, Louis J. Mancini, senior vice president, and James Testin, managing director of AOG (Aircraft On Ground) Aircraft Services. I spoke with them at the company's Commercial Airplane headquarters in Renton, Washington. Single 'meltdown' to worldwide grounding . The first incident involved Japan Air Lines on the ground at Boston Logan Airport on January 7. There was a battery meltdown, a ""propagation"" of eight cells, followed by a fire, which was confined to the electronics bay where the battery was housed. CAS was already planning to repair the JAL 787 when another battery incident occurred January 15 on an airborne ANA flight shortly after takeoff in Japan. An emergency landing and evacuation followed. Inspection revealed another propagation incident, but this time no fire. What began as a typical repair reaction by CAS to the JAL incident became an international crisis a day later on January 16 when the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded the six U.S.-registered 787s operated by United Airlines. Regulatory authorities worldwide followed suit. CAS's AOG unit knew immediately after the ANA incident it would be facing a monumental task, driven by the sheer scope and scale of the impending logistics. ""I would call this not a simple job, but a straightforward job,"" Mancini says. ""Jimmy's (James Testin's) team thought a lot about laying it out so we could get as efficient as possible. Compared with ripping a landing gear off or part of a wing off or replacing a rear pressure bulkhead, I would call that very serious work. This is more the large-scale logistics of it all."" Within days of the ANA event, Testin's AOG team realized they would need to construct a mockup of the 787's electronic bay on the ground. They also would construct a mockup in a 787 on the flight line at Everett (WA), where planes were waiting delivery and where more were coming off the production line. This work began in parallel to the research, development and design that ultimately involved thousands of employees across the Boeing ""enterprise"" and from battery experts outside the company. ""It wasn't serial,"" Mancini says. ""During that process it was becoming pretty clear there would be a series of steps: changes to the battery, changes to the charger, changes to the vent tube, the enclosure. Jimmy's team started engaging about halfway through as certain details got more refined. There was more clarity and preciseness to the event. We started bringing in Jimmy's team early on so he could start formulating his plans and actions. ""The worst thing would have been to wait for everything to be done and say, 'here, Jim.'"" Multiple skill sets . ""Within CAS we had enough personnel to do what we needed to do [to install the fix],"" says Testin. ""However, because of the way the teams were going to have to be built, there were some very specific skills that were needed. A good example would be engine run. Within AOG we have two engine run folks but obviously we were going to need more, so we did reach across the enterprise. ""We reached out to our BDS (Boeing Defense, Space and Security) counterparts. We reached out to our factory. We reached out to our avionics functional test guys and the Everett flight line people really helped. A vast majority of it came from the Everett flight line. They are as close to the same skill set as we would require."" BDS employees are military specialists but a large group worked on the difficult birthing of the 787 during the four-year program delay. ""It's not like we had to train them,"" Testin says. ""They had already been trained and they were current on a lot of their training."" Engine run is starting up the engines for a short time in order to complete tests and take readings. It is also important when ""waking up"" an airplane that hasn't been operational for some time -- such as the case of the Dreamliners that had been grounded for several months. ""We were treating Logan as a one-off event,"" Testin says. ""[We] were trying to understand the damage. As the other events began to unfold, then we stepped back and said we need to take what we are doing right now and figure out how we do that on an expanded level. ""Once the grounding occurred, then we said we need to take this to the next step, to build the mockups, we need to go out on the flight line and figure out how this is going to go."" ""We immediately began working with the 787 program to understand where they were headed, what they were thinking and to go out on the flight line and to understand some of the scenarios. The engineers would say this is what we think it is going to look like, this is what we believe are the areas we're going to affect. ""Space was a huge deal. I would say that within two weeks we began to assemble that [mockup] room. We also had a live mockup out on the flight line."" Boeing designed a ""robust"" fix that includes separating battery cells, a new charging system, venting and a containment box. 'Tedious' fix . The fix itself is far from the most complex job CAS has done in the field. Boeing has in the past changed pressure bulkheads, grafted an entire nose onto an airplane and repaired badly damaged aircraft in the field. It's not unique to Boeing: all aircraft manufacturers have to support their customers. Airbus had to undertake difficult and lengthy aircraft repairs for the A380 involved in an engine explosion over Singapore that badly damaged the wing, structures and components. Airbus also had to replace the entire tail of an A340 damaged in a takeoff accident in Australia. Testin said the installation of the fix wasn't onerous, but tedious. ""We were worried about the logistics. Three hundred people around the world when you have 10 teams out, that's a pretty large package for us to do. The traveling behind it, moving the equipment. We had to go out and purchase the equipment to get multiple units."" The parts easily go into a lower cargo hold but the tools and logistics to do the work are more suitable for a freighter, Testin says. The equipment weighs close to 28,000-30,000 lbs. ""We have to take everything that we need with us, kitted by crew size. Once we determined what a crew size would be, we matched that up with kit. Hand tools, power tools. One kit would take up a good portion of a lower lobe on a 777."" ""This was on such as large scale, this is probably the single largest thing we had to focus on, the logistics behind being able to accommodate the movement. We moved equipment sometimes several times to satisfy the customers."" CAS's 10 teams fanned out to Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States while awaiting the FAA review of the design and fix. Approval came April 26. The first 787 returned to service within days. The last of the aircraft are expected to return to service next month.

"(CNN) -- The technology industry often finds itself pontificating about the future, but the busy news cycle this year gave us plenty to discuss. Very influential tech pioneers died; cyber-security cost companies billions of dollars; and trends in electronics and on the Web provided new tools and created new challenges. Smartphones and tablets each grew so immensely this year that we decided to give them their own mobile year-in-review list. As for future talk, there were plenty of bold, futuristic initiatives that did not quite bear fruit this year. The seeds of Hewlett-Packard's mobile strategy, Google's plans for Motorola post-acquisition, Intel's 3-D silicon transistors and mobile payment systems like Google Wallet were planted this year. But those stories were left off of this list because their products did not reach a mass market in 2011. Look for those to make big splashes in 2012. These 10 stories in 2011 had a huge impact that could resonate for many years: . 1. Steve Jobs dies . From humble middle-class roots to running the most valuable tech company in the world, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was powerful and revered. His death on October 5 after a long battle with cancer made waves around the world. Public grieving could be seen outside Apple's hundreds of stores, where fans left flowers, candles and written notes of tribute. His authorized biography by Walter Isaacson, which came out in November, instantly became a bestseller. At Apple, Jobs helped create the personal computer industry, and built a team that worked with him to design mega hits like the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad. He also found time to lead Pixar Animation Studios, the ""Toy Story"" creator that the Walt Disney Co. paid $7.4 billion to acquire in 2006. The fast-paced tech industry halted for a moment after Jobs' death this year, prompting business and world leaders to speak publicly about his impact. It may never be the same after. 2. Social media's role as a tool for protestors . Much praise was heaped on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube after they played a role in the Arab Spring, a series of protests in the Middle East that started late in 2010. Use of social networks to spread the word about demonstrations persisted this year, especially in the Egyptian uprising that toppled longtime President Hosni Mubarak. In London, participants in riots used BlackBerry Messenger. Micro reports from Occupy Wall Street and other U.S. protests frequently popped up on Twitter. Perhaps in a nod to those events, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said onstage at his conference this year, ""We exist at the intersection of technology and social issues."" 3. Hackers . The Guy Fawkes mask, a stark white symbol of political upheaval, can be seen at many Occupy protests, but the accessory from the movie ""V for Vendetta"" was adopted earlier by an online group called Anonymous. Members of the loosely organized group emerged from the Internet underground this year with a series of politically fueled computer attacks on churches, e-commerce and banks. A sister group called Lulz Security staged its own hacks before quickly vanishing. After Sony's online networks had been hacked, researchers discovered a file planted on one of its servers containing the Anonymous chant, ""We are legion."" The word ""hack"" was so ingrained in people's vernacular after all of these incidents that it became a catchphrase anytime a site was down or an account password had been stolen. 4. Tablet market gets dozens of new entrants . The decade-old tablet PC market received a jolt with new products this year, sparked by the massive success of Apple's iPad. Electronics makers tried to figure out whether consumers were looking for tablets or just iPads. Google, with its Android tablets, and Research in Motion, with the BlackBerry PlayBook, were not pleased with the answer. Amazon.com may have cracked the formula with its $199 Kindle Fire. It has been selling about a million devices each week since it debuted in November. Hewlett-Packard only managed to attract meaningful sales to its TouchPad when it ran a $99 fire sale to clear inventory. 5. Facebook and partners add 'frictionless' sharing . What do you call it when someone you know finds out something about you without you telling them? Facebook calls it ""frictionless,"" and companies that have implemented the feature, including some music-streaming services and news publishers, have found a great promotional vehicle. Still, many are opposed to their private reading habits being broadcast instantly to their Facebook pages. Zuckerberg is convinced people will continue publishing more about themselves online each year -- now, whether they actively choose to or not. 6. Patent wars . The biggest names in mobile, including Apple, Google, HTC, Microsoft, RIM and Samsung, have engaged in a giant game of patent Risk. These companies have filed lawsuits and countersuits in countries around the world to seek licensing agreements or block the sale of rivals' products. Google has said that its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility was to gain the phone maker's stockpile of patents. Check with your local government about whether you can legally buy a Galaxy Tab in stores this week. 7. Google+ . People are spending more of their time on social networks than searching the Web. In other words, more Facebook and less Google. So Google created its own Facebook-like environment in Google+. Users can share photos and browse friends' updates. Google+ got off to a promising start, but Facebook has had a long lead. Google asserts that its social network is key to the future of the company. That's a big bet. 8. Apple becomes the most valuable company in the world . When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he said the company was weeks away from bankruptcy. Over the next decade, he orchestrated a masterful turnaround that culminated in Apple briefly becoming the world's most valuable company by market capitalization. Exxon Mobil has reclaimed a sizable lead, but that shouldn't undermine how effective Apple has been in creating a lust for gizmos. The ultra-thin iPad 2 has done gangbusters, and the iPhone 4S, with Siri, has introduced voice-command services to a wider audience this year. 9. IBM's Watson beats human champs on 'Jeopardy!' At times, the Watson computer, built by IBM, failed to understand some nuances of the English language, prompting mocking laughter. However, as the world had learned when IBM's Deep Blue defeated chess champion Gary Kasparov, computers aren't clueless. Watson proved that two smart men, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, were no match for banks of servers running artificial-intelligence software. 10. Spotify and Facebook take on digital music . With iTunes and iPod, Apple had a strong formula for dominating the digital music industry. Amazon and Google haven't made a dent. But Spotify has proved itself as a worthy opponent in Europe, and after years of negotiations with the record labels, it finally hit U.S. shores this year. Facebook Music, a page that shows what friends are listening to, has helped introduce wider audiences to on-demand streaming services like Spotify, MOG, Rdio and Rhapsody.","In 2011, perhaps no news story was bigger than the death of Steve Jobs .
Social media was used heavily to organize protest around the world .
Mysterious hacker groups rose to prominence in 2011 ."
"(OPRAH.com) -- I'm on the hunt for a new best friend. Not that I'm replacing my old ones, mind you. BFFs aren't like cell phones, traded in for an upgrade every two years. Best Friends Forever are, well, forever. They send you flowers for your professional successes. They spend $160 on a dress they may not even like (but, of course, say they love) so they can perfectly match the flowers as you walk down the aisle. They drive uptown at 1 a.m. to bring you a clean T-shirt when your father is dying and you've spent 48 hours in the same tank top you were wearing when you learned you had to fly home from vacation to say goodbye. But one of the best things about best friends is that they aren't romantic partners. I don't have to pick only one for as long as we both shall live. So now that I've moved 800 miles away from my be-there-whenever-I-need-them friends -- which makes it a lot harder for them to physically be here whenever I need them -- I'm in the market for a new addition to the list. A new old friend. So how do I do that? What does it mean to not dive but rather cannonball into a sea of best friend prospects? In the few months I've been on the prowl, I've learned it means doing exactly what I would do to find a husband or a job. It's about putting myself out there. Easier said than done? Perhaps. But if it were simple, I'd be out drinking coffee with my very own Monica and Phoebe instead of watching them in reruns from my couch. Oprah.com: Why sitcoms can teach us something about friendship . My first foray into the girl-dating market starts with the woman behind the counter at a boutique downtown. I met her six months ago, and she was the perfect mix of friendly and sarcastic (we shared great banter about the tragedy of Chicago weather making it hard for girls to dress up as candy-stripers and Superwoman on Halloween). My husband tried to convince me to ask for her number, just to see if she wanted to have lunch sometime. I was too shy at first, but now I'm in my I'll-find-a-best-friend-or-die-trying phase. I've returned to her store five times, and she's never again been behind the register. I guess she's the one that got away. Now I've got my eye on another sales clerk. She works at the shop around the corner, my pop-in store when I need a wardrobe fix. After two years of dispensing fashion advice, she knows just the type of sweater I like. Definitely promising. But every time I build up the nerve to actually say some variation of ""I need a best friend. You seem nice and might be able to get me a discount. Want to get a drink sometime?"" there's another salesgirl with her, and I'm just not ready to deliver my first pickup line in front of an audience. Oprah.com: Are you a good friend? Take the quiz! Approaching an unsuspecting salesclerk might be advanced friend-dating anyway, and I'm still in Friendship 101. But in just the first couple months of my quest, I've developed some hard-and-fast rules. 1. Facebook is your friend. The funny thing about social networks is that people you've met only once, people whose last names you may not even know, will request your friendship or accept your request. If you took a look at my list of ""friends"" in Chicago, you wouldn't believe I ever spent a moment alone. I'm Facebook friends with the friend of a friend of a friend I met at a birthday party last year, and the woman who sold me my wedding dress, and the girl I randomly made paella with in a cooking class nine months ago. In each case, we liked each other enough to become virtual friends, but had yet to take our relationship offline. My rule of thumb, which I offer to you, is this: If we can be Facebook friends, we can be face-to-face friends. To that end, the ""Facebook message"" system is a good one. If you hardly know this person, messaging via Facebook is less intrusive or -- I'll just say it -- less stalker-ish. When you've established a bit of banter, then you can start emailing directly. But to start, let whatever network connected you -- be it Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, what have you -- be the medium through which you establish communication. Oprah.com: How to change your Google reputation . 2. Make the first move. Here's where finding a best friend isn't like dating. I know it's the 21st century and plenty of women are asking men out, but let's be honest, most of us are waiting for him to call. Men know this and usually take the initiative. But when two potential female BFFs are hoping to connect, then what? Who makes the first move? The answer: You. If you think she's the one, just call. Or email. Or Facebook message. Whatever. Just do something. Because we're all busy, and we all say ""we should get together!"" and we all forget to reach out, however much we really, truly, intended to. So stop sitting around waiting for her invitation. Shoot her an email. Five bucks says her response starts with ""So good to hear from you!"" 3. Tell your friends that you're in the market for new ones. People love playing matchmaker, but romantic setups can often blow up in your face. He didn't call, she thought they hit it off, they're both calling to see what happened and blame you for what went wrong. Setting up two potential friends, however, is much less of a minefield. If it works out, great. If it doesn't, there's generally no harm done. The setter-upper feels much less pressure, and if her two buddies can be friends themselves, even better! But here's the catch -- you need to tell people you're on the hunt. When I announced to my entire world that I was looking to make some new friends, suddenly my mother-in-law's mother-in-law's neighbor's daughter knew someone I just had to meet. When I finally said to an old friend, ""I've lived here for two and a half years, why am I just hearing about these girls now?"" She said, ""I figured you already had your own group."" Lesson learned. Your friendship search might be one of the central focuses of your life, but it's not really something anyone else thinks about. People are busy focusing on their own lives, their own friendship quests or romance quests or peace-and-quiet quests. That doesn't mean they don't want to help you -- it just means you need to ask. 4. Make the second move too. Two months into my hunt, I've been on my fair share of friend-dates. They go swimmingly, and then we say goodbye and ""We should do it again!"" and go on our merry ways. And then a few weeks or a month passes and I think, ""Whatever happened to Sarah? Or Jane? Or Hillary?"" Because one fun dinner does not a BFF make. So I've accepted that not only do I have to set up the first outing, but quite often the second one too. Maybe even the third. At that point, if she's still not reaching out, it's time to reevaluate the situation. But until then, swallow your pride and push the issue. Yes, the rules of friendship call for reciprocation -- both parties should equally reach out to the other -- but until you've established a true relationship, rules don't apply. 5. Join, join, join. A book club, a quilting group, a poker game, a dance class. Figure out what you're interested in, then sign up for whatever recurring event is offered. It's not just that organized gatherings are surefire places to meet new people, it's also that Cardio Hip-Hop is held every Thursday night, so the woman who looks like BFF material will be there next week and the week after that. Consistent face time is key to building relationships, and if that comes with a side of booty blasting, all the better. Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

"(CNN) -- Ty Warner, the billionaire creator of Beanie Babies plush toys, won't serve prison time for hiding millions of dollars in secret Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes. A judge sentenced Warner to two years' probation Tuesday, ordering him to perform 500 hours of community service at three Chicago high schools and pay a $100,000 fine. ""Society will be best served to allow (Warner) to continue his good works,"" U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras said at a sentencing hearing Tuesday, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. Warner had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and already paid a $53 million civil penalty and about $27 million in back taxes, prosecutors said. When he pleaded guilty, Warner admitted that he had maintained Swiss bank accounts with an unreported gross income of more than $24 million. Warner is the owner and founder of TY Inc., which hit it big in the 1990s when Beanie Babies became some of the nation's hottest toys and collector's items. The plush animals sell for as little as $5, though rare models can fetch thousands of dollars at auction. While Beanie Babies have largely faded from the public consciousness, they've made a fortune for Warner. Forbes Magazine estimates his net worth as of September at $2.6 billion. The tax evasion charge carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. CNNMoney's James O'Toole and CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","A judge sentences Ty Warner to two years' probation and community service .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Gunmen shot dead a Swedish journalist in broad daylight in the Afghan capital Tuesday, underscoring a growing insecurity threatening the country's elections next month. The Swedish embassy identified the victim as radio correspondent Nils Horner. Swedish Radio said Horner was shot on a street near a Lebanese restaurant in Kabul, the same site where a bomb went off in January. He was doing interviews at the time ahead of elections scheduled for next month. He was shot in the back of the head, and pronounced dead at a Kabul hospital. An Afghan police statement said the journalist, who had been traveling in a car with his interpreter and driver, had arrived in the city just days before. It said police were questioning his driver and interpreter. ""Nils was one of our absolute best and most experienced correspondents and what has happened to him today is terrible. We are now trying to get as many details as we can,"" Swedish Radio's Director-General Cilla BenkÃ¶ said in a statement, describing this as one of the worst days in the corporation's history. ""We know there are high-risk areas. Kabul isn't an area Swedish Radio should not cover."" Horner, 51, had traveled across Asia for his work, covering the 2001 fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the 2004 tsunami in Asia and the Iraq war. ""Among Swedish journalists, Nils was a legend. He was famous for always being on the road, going from country to country, from hotel to hotel. For many years he didn't even have an apartment,"" said Johan Nylander, a Swedish journalist based in Hong Kong. ""For him, interviewing people from the Indian slum was as interesting and important as visiting the Japanese parliament. He gave a voice to the people that didn't have one, and brought life to the forgotten corners of Asia,"" Nylander said. ""In a way, he died as he lived - in the middle of a news story."" ""Everyone in Sweden will remember him as the voice coming out of Asia,"" said fellow journalist Per Liljas, who was with Horner just before he departed for Kabul. He was known for always being in the right place at the right time, he said. ""Sometimes it felt like he was there before things happened,"" Liljas said. He described his friend as humble, kind and considerate, saying he was ""a huge role model"" for younger journalists. The attack comes as Afghanistan prepares for the withdrawal of NATO forces and landmark presidential elections scheduled for April 5. The Taliban have threatened to attack anyone who takes part. Afghan troops, supported by NATO, are helping secure the elections.","NEW: Colleague describes killed journalist Nils Horner as ""a legend""

"(CNN) -- In her debut film, ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" Freida Pinto won plaudits for her portrayal of a girl from the slums groomed for a life of prostitution. Off screen the Hollywood actress is now lending her voice to save other girls from that very same fate. Pinto, 28, is an ambassador for Plan USA's Because I Am A Girl campaign, a narrator on the ground-breaking documentary film Girl Rising, which debuted on CNN, and shared a stage with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon at the launch of the World Bank's campaign to empower girls and women around the world. The focus of all these campaigns is making sure girls receive an education, no matter where they live or what their background. Pinto's passion for education stems from her mother and grandmother, who were both teachers in India. ""My mum still follows her dreams,"" she told CNN. ""She just retired as a schoolteacher, but she always had a dream of continuing teaching children, but this time more underprivileged children. And she's living out her dream. It's really inspirational."" She added: ""My grandma was also a teacher, so I guess education, and the importance of education and how it really shapes and transforms lives, was something that was engrained in my system from the very beginning."" Pinto, raised in a middle class family in Mumbai, broke into acting at the age of 22 when director Danny Boyle picked her for the role of Latika in the film ""Slumdog Millionaire"", released in 2008. The film won best film in the Oscars, Golden Globes and BAFTAs. Pinto was nominated for a BAFTA as best supporting actress. She now lives in Los Angeles with her Slumdog co-star Dev Patel, and has since starred in films including Woody Allen's ""You will meet a tall dark stranger,"" ""Rise of the planet of the apes,"" alongside Antonios Banderos in ""Day of the Falcon"" and Michael Winterbottom's ""Trishna,"" an interpretation of Tess of the D'Urbervilles, set in modern-day India. Originally from Mumbai, some have criticized Pinto for neglecting Bollywood, but she argues that her two films set in India portray her native country as well as any. ""They are just hardcore Indian stories and there's no denying it,"" she said. ""It's kind of silly to just make this whole Hollywood/Bollywood such a big debate when actually it should be about the stories that are coming from that part of the world. ""My two Indian films for many don't count as Bollywood, which is fine. But at least they're Indian international films and I'm proud of that."" Pinto has criticized the ""male-dominated"" world of film, calling for more female writers and directors to help bring more strong female characters for women of all ages. ""The only way to cure that problem is to have more female writers and more female directors,"" she said. ""There will be a different perspective when you have women writers and women directors. There is sometimes a misconception that a female director can't really tackle manly issues and definitely Kathryn Bigelow proves them wrong."" So would she get behind the camera herself? ""I believe that I'm on my way to becoming a producer because there are so many stories that I read that I'm so inspired by,"" says Pinto. ""I don't necessarily see myself in them as an actor, but I'd like them to see the light of day.

"Nanjing, China (CNN) -- Limited investment options in China means real estate has been a popular choice for consumers looking to expand their portfolios. This, in turn, has helped push China's housing prices through the roof but many argue that it's unstoppable, unstable, overpriced and in some cases, even corrupt. Those hoping to buy should expect to pay a hefty price. In the final months of 2013, home prices in major cities were running about 10% higher than the previous year. To cool the housing market, the Chinese government has initiated a campaign to build 36 million affordable homes by 2015. I traveled to Nanjing recently on a program organized by London-based think tank, Institute for Strategic Dialogue, to find out whether this policy has room to succeed. The city was the scene of an unusual protest in September last year. A Chinese man walked into a housing exposition with six crabs tied to a string, each one bearing a sticker. It wasn't done for laughs. The Nanjing resident was voicing his anger at developers whom he called ""crawling crabs."" Pictures shared online on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, showed the writing on the stickers -- each one read ""high housing prices"" and ""high land prices."" This wasn't a protest you would normally associate with China but it's a complaint that is gaining more and more traction in Nanjing and one I heard many times during this trip to the capital of Jiangsu province in eastern China. Demand for homes . Driving through this city of eight million people, I found it hard to believe that housing is an issue here. On every street there is a protected wall of construction -- and that's at street level. Look up and towering above is skyscraper after skyscraper. Despite the speed of urbanization, there are not enough homes for everyone. It's easy to understand why: Workers are leaving the suburbs and rural areas to seek a new life in the bright lights of the city. As a consequence, demand has pushed house prices to rise as high as the expanding skyline. According to China's National Statistics Bureau, prices for homes in the largest cities have seen an even steeper rise. In December, home prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen increased by 16% to 20% over the previous year. In Nanjing, prices have increased by 15.6%. Some economists say runaway growth in this sector is the biggest threat to China's economic stability. Many, like the crab protester, ""have lost their faith or their trust of the government in controlling the real estate price,"" Shen Zhushi, a senior partner at Zhejiang Oversees Investment said. To boost the supply to middle-income families, and in many ways calm discontent over lack of affordable property in cities like Beijing, the government has implemented measures it argues will help to curb house prices. Among the measures: Higher stamp duties and restrictions on the number of homes individuals can own. Beijing also promised penalties for local governments that do not curb prices, saying officials ""will be held accountable"" in the event of failure. During my visit, I saw little sign of a cooling market. Those I met felt it was practically impossible to buy a house in the city. I talked with a small group of the four million recent graduates who are struggling to get on the property ladder. Out of the ten I met, only one has been able to buy a home. Another, who wants me to call him Liang, tells me he desperately wants to buy. But for an average worker, it will take five to ten years of savings for a deposit. For a farmer, perhaps even 20 years, Liang added. To help correct the imbalance between supply and demand and ease the burden on the big cities and more importantly the financial burden on its people, the Chinese government finished building four million units of affordable housing by the end of September, according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. Visiting an affordable housing complex . In Nanjing, since 2002 more than 90 affordable housing projects have been allocated. And on the ground, it's full power ahead with construction. Yong Xu, the chief engineer of the Nanjing Affordable Housing Construction Group, told me the municipal government of Nanjing has built 9.66 million square meters of new affordable homes. I traveled some 45 minutes from the city center to see one of the projects for myself. From far away, the government's commitment looks good. A closer inspection gave me a somewhat different view. The place I visited is called Maigaoqiao venture park project in the Qixia district. High rise buildings practically touch shoulders -- it's a clinical, even soulless environment. The only bit of color seems to pop from the nurseries surrounding it; their faÃ§ade still being painted during my visit. I took an elevator to the fourth floor to see one of the apartments. As I entered, a flat-screen TV blasted a Chinese war movie, and adorning one of the shelves was a tiny statue of Chairman Mao. The owner, identified as Mr. Feng, told me he received compensation for moving out of his home in the city center. Despite his forced move, and with officials listening to his every word, he told me he's happy here. He doesn't even flinch when he's asked by another journalist whether his hour-long commute to work is worth the relocation. Back outside in the communal area, I bumped into a retired worker called Mao and his grandson. Mao told me through a translator that he's been living here for a month because the house where he lived in the center of Nanjing was torn down to make way for commercial buildings. In return, he was given an apartment, some cash and was told where he would be living. No one asked him where he wished to reside. Despite the picture officials want to portray here of community and generosity, there was definitely a feeling of abandonment and isolation. Not surprising really, there are few buses here, it takes an hour to get to the city center and just the same to get to a hospital. Risk of corruption . The campaign to build 36 million affordable homes by 2015 is seen as a centerpiece of Beijing's strategy to cool its red-hot property market. But from my visit and interactions it seems to have been quite a long way from being a success. Not only has it, and other measures, failed to stem rising property prices -- some have linked the scheme to corruption, with many arguing that only those with connections can obtain affordable homes at a fair price. In January last year, it was reported in China that Zhai Zhenfeng, the director of a municipal housing bureau in the city of Zhengzhou was detained and accused of illegally owning some 29 properties, 11 of which were affordable houses owned by his daughter. This is just one case. China's National Audit Office says it has discovered local governments mismanaging around $465 million set aside for these buildings last year. I put a question about corruption to Nanjing's Party Secretary Yang Weize. ""Would you agree your policy in curbing property prices has not succeeded and that instead become a hotbed for corruption?"" I asked. The party secretary admitted they face many challenges. ""I do not deny that the real estate industry has corruption especially where there's an imbalance between supply and demand. But I do not think corruption is the root cause of high house prices,"" Yang said. Instead, he looked at the infancy of China's real estate market. ""Its uniqueness is that our market only began 30 years ago, when we started reforms. That means that it hasn't matured enough,"" he said. Beijing-based economist Xu Gao from Everbright Securities told me the government urgently needed to implement stronger property control measures. One of the challenges is at a local level -- some district authorities have been accused of auctioning off land, and in many cases resisting or circumventing Beijing's efforts to cool down the market. By selling land at such a high price, the government risks facing a higher cost of living, construction and labor, and that, Xu argued, will undermine competitiveness, leading to a property bubble. Zhou Yinggang, director for the Center for Hospitality and Research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong also pointed to this controlled supply. ""Land supply is strictly controlled by government and land cost is an important driving force of house bubble,"" he said. The central government can argue that it's doing its part to control high inflation, skyrocketing prices and is in the midst of a nationwide clamp down on corruption. It can even proudly state that it's being socially just in providing affordable homes for many. Right now that will do little to soothe the concerns faced by the Nanjing crab protester and many others like him whose home ownership dream remains a far-off fantasy.

"(CNN) -- This is the tale of Peter Rabbit, but not the classic version that Beatrix Potter created. Instead, this particular Peter Rabbit is one of 65 tattered, matted but, most importantly, cherished stuffed toys and teddy bears that photographer Mark Nixon features in ""Much Loved"" (Abrams Image), a book that comes out October 29. Nixon said the inspiration for the photo series came from his son, Calum, who was very attached to the plush rabbit since birth. When the Dublin, Ireland-based photographer put out the initial inquiry for ""loved to bits"" teddies, he said he expected most of the submissions to come from children, but adults soon wanted to take part as well. ""It was as though they had been keeping a long-held secret and could finally tell someone what their teddies really meant to them,"" he writes in the book's foreword.

"New York (CNN) -- New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez, who received a 162-game doping suspension, Friday withdrew his lawsuits against Major League Baseball, Commissioner Bud Selig and the players' union. In the lawsuits, Rodriguez had sought to get a Manhattan federal court to throw out the record-setting penalty. Notices of dismissal in the lawsuits were filed Friday in Manhattan, meaning the player will accept the suspension and sit out the 2014 season. There was no immediate comment from Rodriguez's attorneys or his spokesman, Ron Berkowitz. In a statement, Major League Baseball said: ""We have been informed that Alex Rodriguez has reached the prudent decision to end all of the litigation related to the Biogenesis matter. We believe that Mr. Rodriguez's actions show his desire to return the focus to the play of our great game on the field and to all of the positive attributes and actions of his fellow Major League Players. We share that desire."" The Major League Baseball Players Association said in a statement: ""Alex Rodriguez has done the right thing by withdrawing his lawsuit. His decision to move forward is in everyone's best interest."" In one of the lawsuits, filed in October, Rodriguez had alleged that MLB and Selig ""engaged in tortious and egregious conduct with one and only one goal ... to destroy the reputation and career of Alex Rodriguez."" The lawsuit had claimed that in its investigation of Anthony Bosch and his Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami, MLB engaged in vigilante justice to prove that Rodriguez was using performance enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has said that the investigation, which was supposed to stay private, has permanently harmed his reputation and ensured that he will never again secure any endorsement contracts. Did Rodriguez expose doping secrets? The lawsuit included had claimed that MLB went around collective bargain agreements to make an example of Rodriguez and to ""gloss over Selig's past inaction and tacit approval of the use of performance enhancing substances in baseball and to secure his legacy as the savior of America's pastime."" Major League Baseball arbitrator Fredric Horowitz last month upheld most of Rodriguez's 211-game doping suspension, keeping him out of the 2014 regular season and the postseason. It was the most severe punishment in baseball history for doping and a highlight of baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's recent high-profile crackdown on performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension will not only cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary, but it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who'll turn 40 in the 2015 season. Rodriguez, one of 14 players suspended in the Biogenesis scandal, was the only one who appealed his suspension. Though he was suspended in August, Rodriguez played out the 2013 season because of the appeal. CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Alex Rodriguez withdraws federal lawsuits seeking to overturn doping suspension .

"(CNN) -- Women spend every day juggling bosses and birthday parties, dates and diapers, but when was the last time you had a day to do what you want to do, obligation-free? How about four? Enter Campowerment, a retreat for women to, as they put it, ""escape, unwind and reignite your flame; to renew and re-energize, however you choose to do it."" Translation: Me time. Big-time. It was founded by Tammi Fuller, an Emmy award-winning TV producer, who calls camp her ""happy place"" and dreams of being a camp director full time. Campowerment offers a variety of activities for body, mind and spirit. ""We go out of our way not to make it spiritual,"" Fuller says, ""because there are so many retreats like that. It's all there, but it happens naturally. We say it's a life-changing weekend for some people, but what that is is different for everyone. Some people don't even know what they need when they get there. ""That's what we hear, 'I didn't even know how badly I needed it.'"" The camps are held in Malibu, California, and Ocala, Florida, with an upcoming session being planned in New York next year. The four-day weekend costs $975 for all lodging, meals, snacks, alcohol and activities. Let me get a few things out of the way: I didn't pay to attend. I was at camp as reporter invited by the organizer. Although I loved summer camp as a kid, these days I'm not what you'd call a joiner. My emotions run deep, but I don't typically share them with just anybody. And I fantasize about chucking my life and living like a hippie, but for now I enjoy both privacy and luxury of all varieties. My approach to the weekend was to think of it as a very cool work assignment, and the limited cell reception would give me an excuse not to check e-mail. I didn't expect to love it and I certainly didn't expect to be changed by it. But then the alchemy of being in nature with a group of amazing women kicks in. I met women who loved summer camp as a kid, and wanted to relive the days of youth; moms who celebrated a milestone birthday away from the stress of daily life and others who just wanted a getaway. Our days were filled with yoga and fitness, parenting and relationship workshops, life coaching, healthy cooking demonstrations, energy healing, journaling, astrology and palm reading, fashion and style advice, as well as sing-alongs, s'more roasting, a sex toy party and happy hour featuring vodka-soaked gummy worms. You're participating in activities (or not -- everything is optional) that push you out of your comfort zone physically and emotionally, and supporting one another in the process. Before I knew it, all of my defenses melted and gave way to deep bonding. In fact, I was so present that, with apologies to my editor, I kinda forgot I was there to write. ""It was so nice to just be with other women and share our stories,"" says Selena Long, 40, a stay-at-home mother of two from of Scottsdale, Arizona. ""It made me a happier person. I felt renewed and like I am not alone."" ""It was amazing to see strong friendships form after only three days,"" says Jill Brody Sundahl, 45, an entertainment marketing consultant from Studio City, California. ""I was more open with sharing feelings than I thought I might be with complete strangers."" The idea for Campowerment started in 2001 when Fuller's friend invited her over for wine and chocolate with four other women, none of whom knew anyone but the hostess. ""Apparently we were all bitching and moaning to her about the same things,"" Fuller recalls. ""We were working too hard, we were not working out enough, we were all making more money than our men, we were giving our kids too much and not taking anything for ourselves, we were taking care of our aging parents, we were trying to figure out 'What's this spiritual thing?' and if there's really a god and everything happens for a reason, why the hell am I so miserable? ""Because we didn't know each other, it was the theory of sitting next to the stranger on an airplane: We started to talk about things like guilt and relationships and sex and stuff that is normally off-limits in your world. It was a place to share common experiences; to go and dump in a safe space. There was unconditional acceptance and no judgment at all."" The group's meetings eventually grew longer, and their lives more intertwined. The gatherings were so therapeutic, the women decided to share their stories in the hope that it would have the same effect on others. They also organized retreats, originally dubbed Camp Bombshell. Fuller refined the program over the years. The April Campowerment session I attended was the 19th camp she's produced, and every camp lineup is different. At ours, a reading led by Mary Ann Zoellner, co-author of ""Sh*tty Mom: The Parenting Guide for the Rest of Us,"" found a roomful of mothers laughing for an hour straight in both recognition and relief as they shared stories of their own so-called s--tty parenting. One woman sometimes keeps her kids up past their bedtime so she can sleep late, one lies about dead batteries -- even on toys that don't run on them -- when she doesn't feel like dealing. Another accidentally left her sleeping infant upstairs when she and her husband went to a movie for the first time after the baby was born. ""It made me realize there are so many moms out there like me and we aren't s--tty, but truly great moms who aren't perfect,"" Sundahl says. ""It was highly amusing and it felt good to laugh from the belly,"" says Tina Ryder, 42, a daycare business owner, from Scottsdale, Arizona. The centerpiece of the Campowerment experience is the ropes course, which involves traversing an elevated balance beam and swinging off Tarzan-style when you reach the other side, or climbing a 35-foot telephone poll and jumping off onto a trapeze, AKA the ""leap of faith."" ""I loved the 'leap of faith,'"" Long says. ""It was scary, emotional and invigorating. So freeing."" ""We've got these hot coaches offering encouragement,"" Fuller says. ""You don't realize you're about to be transformed because you just think, I just have to get across that beam or to the top of that pole. But when you get to the top, all of a sudden, you're raw. You're standing looking at the ocean. You're so proud of yourself and can't believe you did it."" That's when the coaches start asking you questions: What do you love about your life? What do you want to leave behind? What's not working for you? What are you afraid of? ""Who thinks about that?!"" Fuller says. ""Now you're standing on the top of the world with people on the ground cheering for you. There's something magical that happens from the unconditional support you're getting from people that 48 hours before you never even knew that bonds everybody instantly. Everybody is so happy for each other."" Before Campowerment, I was perfectly content for my thrills with poles to take place at sea level. See, I mistook the ""leap of faith"" for a physical adventure that I wasn't particularly interested in, but would be mad at myself for skipping. Instead, it was an unexpected confrontation with -- and then triumph over -- my limiting beliefs. My brain tried every excuse to keep me from reaching the top, all of which basically boiled down to: What if you try and you fail? It's a recurring negative thought that has prevented me from taking other risks in my life. Through sheer force of will that this time be different, and the encouragement from the women below, I reached the top with a new outlook on life: The view is breathtaking, and you're supported even if you fail. ""I did the swing and it was fun and all, but the ladies who did the pole brought me to tears every time,"" Ryder says. ""I felt like I was going through all their emotions with them -- with my feet firmly on the ground -- and fighting for them to overcome whatever challenge they were struggling through."" ""The leap of faith was a game changer for me,"" says Alison Manzardo, a 40-year-old mother of two. ""I have never done anything like that before. It was a raw fear that I pushed through. I felt supported and found a courage that I didn't know existed."" Of course, Fuller did. ""We didn't just pull the experts off the street,"" she says. ""I spent months building this team. They're well-heeled in what they do, but more importantly, I've been helped personally by them and I just want to share with people the stuff that's helped me. ""I'm a 53-year-old single mother, workaholic, camp-obsessed person,"" she says. ""I'm every woman. I'm 10 pounds overweight, I'm struggling to juggle my life, I want more in the way of money, I want more love, I want to be able to share and have joy every day, I want to have children who contribute to the planet, I want more out of my life."" Now, at least for one weekend at a time, we can.","Campowerment retreat draws women to a grown-up version of summer camp .

"(CNN) -- Between 200 and 300 women and children who were fleeing fighting in South Sudan drowned when an overloaded ferry overturned on a river, a South Sudanese army spokesman said Tuesday. The accident happened Saturday on the White Nile River near Malakal in the northeast of the country, said Col. Philip Aguer of the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Aguer said he was aware of only two survivors, both crew members. The passengers were all civilians. South Sudan erupted into violence December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Since then, militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces. Talks begin in hopes of halting descent 'into collapse' Representatives of South Sudan's government and rebels have been meeting for talks in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, but there has been no cease-fire reached. The violence has displaced more than 350,000 people, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, and sparked a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. agency appealed Monday for $61 million to help it provide food assistance to those in need. Even before the violence broke out last month, some 4.4 million people were expected to face food insecurity this year, an agency news release said. Now many more are at risk of hunger. ""It is essential that security and stability return to South Sudan immediately so that displaced people can return to their homes, fields, herds and fishing grounds,"" said Sue Lautze, the U.N. agency's representative in South Sudan. ""Timing is everything; there are fish in the rivers now, pastoralists are trying to protect their herds and the planting season for maize, groundnut and sorghum starts in March."" South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.

"(CNN) -- If you've packed your warmest hat and coziest jacket for the Winter Olympics, it would be a bit disconcerting to look out your hotel window and see a palm tree, swaying in a gentle spring-like breeze. That, however, is exactly what many patrons of the Sochi Winter Games are experiencing. Most people think of Russia in winter and picture the snow-covered cathedrals of Moscow, where average temperatures in February range between minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) and minus 4 C (24.8 F) and all but require the wearing of those iconic fur hats. Sochi, however, is one of the southernmost cities in Russia. It's located over 1,000 km south of Moscow and has a completely different climate. Indeed, on most winter days, Sochi (and the nearby town of Adler, where many of the events are being held) are the warmest locations in the country. This was the case on Monday, when Sochi reached a balmy 15.9 C (61 F) -- warmer than any other Russian city by more than 1 C. Compare that to the coldest location in Russia -- Siberia's Jikimda, which hit -50 C (-58 F). The International Olympic Committee cannot say Sochi's temperatures this month come as a surprise, as the city has the warmest climate of any Winter Games host city. In February, temperatures range between 3 C (37 F) and 10 C (50 F) on average, but as we are seeing they can climb even higher. These numbers mean that it edges out the previous warmest location. Vancouver, Canada, host of the Games in 2010, averages highs of about 8 C (46 F) and lows around 1 C (34 F). Like Vancouver, Sochi is a coastal town and has a much warmer climate than the surrounding areas, including the ""Mountain Cluster"" venues where the skiing, snowboarding, and sliding events -- bobsled, skeleton and luge -- are taking place. These mountain peaks rise over 2,300 meters, and since air temperatures generally cool with height, it means these venues stay 5 - 10 C (41 F - 50 F) degrees cooler. Even with this mitigating factor, the full sun and above-average temperatures this week have led to less than ideal conditions for skiing. Ultimately, however, between the snow-making machines and the millions of pounds (kilos) of snow that were saved from last winter, Sochi will avoid snowless ski and snowboard events. And since the events held in Sochi and Adler -- the ""Coastal Cluster"" -- are all indoors, they could be theoretically be held in Dubai in July and it wouldn't make much of a difference -- but let's not give the IOC any ideas! But those who prefer their Winter Olympics to be held in places that actually feel like winter, and require the wearing of hats and jackets, can look forward to the 2018 games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, where daytime highs rarely go above 0 C (32 F) and night-time lows average -11 C (12 F).","Sochi is the warmest Winter Games location .

"(CNN) -- Let me tell you 'bout Wayne and his deals of . Cocaine . A little more every day . Holding for a friend till the band do well . Then the D.E.A. locked him away . -- The Clash, ""Jail Guitar Doors"" The first thing you notice about the Travis County Correctional Complex is the door. A thick steel door painted the color of the ocean on a cold day automatically slides open for visitors authorized to enter the jail. It makes a noise that fills the room when it closes. And then suddenly, it's severely quiet. As if the door was designed to warn you it can't be easily opened. On the other side, past beige hallway after beige hallway and an outside walkway bathed in barbed wire, I arrived at Room 7 on the programs floor, where eight women were learning to play guitar and write songs. ""Let's practice the G chord again and strum four times,"" instructed Jean Synodinos, an Austin-based singer-songwriter who teaches the weekly music class at the county jail in Texas. The students each focus on wrapping their fingers around the frets of acoustic guitars, each one with ""Jail Guitar Doors"" spray-painted on the wood. Jail Guitar Doors is the name of an organization started by musician Billy Bragg in the United Kingdom. Inspired by a song by The Clash, Bragg wanted to bring instruments and music education into prisons to support the rehabilitation process behind bars. It was only later that Bragg learned the ""Wayne"" in The Clash song was his friend Wayne Kramer, co-founder of the punk band MC5. Kramer was one of the most influential political musicians of a generation. But in 1975, Kramer was caught selling cocaine to undercover agents and served two years in the federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky. Over three decades later, it was Bragg who prompted Kramer to start a U.S. branch of the organization that Kramer had inspired. This is how there came to be eight women in the Travis County Correctional Complex learning to play G chords and write songs. Just a few miles away, the annual South by Southwest music festival was getting underway, a massive event in which hundreds of thousands of music industry professionals and fans from around the world converge on Austin to hear their favorite bands or find new ones waiting to be discovered. From what I can tell, people mostly just spend a lot of time waiting in line and partying, throngs of music fans spilling over into the street in search of entertainment. But the class at the Travis County jail reminds us that music is more than just entertainment. It's power. The power to transform someone's life, the power to transform a system. Almost all of the women at the Travis County jail have been behind bars before. They're facing trial for a range of offenses, from drug possession to parole violations to larceny. These aren't major crimes. One of the women in the class is on trial for shoplifting $15 in merchandise from a department store. But since it's her fourth offense, she's facing up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Our criminal justice system is broken, as these women not only say but clearly show with such stories. Yet the women also talk about how they are broken too, how they can't seem to turn their lives around. And they don't want society to give up on them. They crave the services that have largely been slashed as the United States has focused less on rehabilitation and more on simply warehousing people who commit crimes, contributing to our country having the highest incarceration rate in the world. ""This class isn't just about music,"" says Raul Garcia, a program coordinator on staff at the jail. The women are learning to channel their feelings into constructive outlets and to stop and think before acting. ""It's that impulsivity that can get you in trouble,"" Garcia says connecting the class to its real world implications. ""You have to learn to use your breaks."" ""What did you eat today for breakfast?"" asks Synodinos. ""Oh, we had this awful meat patty thing that's brown on the outside and pink on the inside,"" one woman says. The seven other women erupt in agreement, the gray stripes of their uniforms bouncing with the energetic discussion. Synodinos interrupts, ""OK, but what does that symbolize for you? Maybe you really don't like it because it makes you miss your mom's cooking.""

"(CNN) -- The 3D space disaster movie ""Gravity"" and the drama ""12 Years a Slave"" scooped the awards at the 2014 BAFTA awards, with the harrowing portrayal of 19th century American slavery taking out best film and best actor awards. Accepting the best film award, ""12 Years a Slave"" director Steve McQueen said: ""There are 21 million people in slavery now as we sit here. I just hope that 150 years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film."" British-born actor Chiwetel Ejiofor beat shortlisted actors Christian Bale, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks to win the best actor award, thanking McQueen for his ""work, artistry and passion in this project."" Addressing his director he said: ""This is yours, I know that ... you know that. I'm going to keep it, that's the kind of guy I am, but it's yours."" Ejiofor is also in the frame to win an Oscar and may take the stage again at next month's Academy Awards ceremony. CNN Oscar ballot: Make your choices, share your picks . The deep space thriller ""Gravity,"" meanwhile, won an impressive six awards -- just one award shy of ""The Artist"" in 2012 and ""The King's Speech"" in 2011 -- including best director and best British film. Alfonso Cuaron accepted the best director award for the film, which also triumphed in the special effects category against stiff competition from a shortlist that included ""Iron Man 3,"" ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"" ""Pacific Rim"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" The record of nine British Academy Film Awards is still held by the 1969 American Western ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" The biggest applause of the evening was reserved for newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who was named best supporting actor for his portrayal of a Somali pirate in ""Captain Phillips."" Winning in a strong category against Bradley Cooper, Matt Damon and Michael Fassbender, he thanked co-star Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass for ""believing in me before I believed in myself."" Abdi, previously a limousine driver in Minneapolis, was cast after turning up to the audition on a whim. Other winners included ""The Act of Killing"" -- a film examining the Indonesian death squads of the mid-1960s - which won in the documentary section. Its director Joshua Oppenheimer accused Britain and the US of actively supporting the 1965 genocide in Indonesia and the regime which followed. The best animated film award went to Disney's ""Frozen"" -- a blockbuster that has grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide - which beat ""Despicable Me 2"" and ""Monsters University"" to the BAFTA. Special coverage: Awards season 2014 . The winner in the best short film category was ""Room 8"" and ""Sleeping with the Fishes"" won in the best short animation section. Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope won in the best adapted screenplay section for ""Philomena"" -- a movie about a woman's 50-year-long search for her son, beating John Ridley's screenplay for ""12 Years a Slave."" Coogan said there were still another 60,000 women who had not traced their children, taken from them by nuns and put up for adoption, and ""their story isn't yet over"". Dame Helen Mirren was given BAFTA's highest award, a fellowship. Having played the British Queen in film, she was given the award, somewhat appropriately, by the Queen's grandson Prince William.

"Oxford, England (CNN) -- WikiLeaks.org, the website that released secret video of a U.S. airstrike in Iraq that killed a dozen civilians, is ""getting an enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures of high caliber,"" the site's founder, Julian Assange, said Friday in a rare public appearance here. Speaking at the TED Global conference, Assange said that ""we are overwhelmed by our growth"" and the site can't keep up with the volume of the new material because it doesn't have enough people to verify it. He later told reporters that ""there are many things which are very explosive."" Assange said the organization gets material from whistle-blowers in a variety of ways -- including via postal mail -- vets it, releases it to the public and then defends itself against ""the regular political or legal attack."" He said the organization rarely knows the identity of the source of the leak. ""If we find out at some stage, we destroy that information as soon as possible,"" he said. Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, 22, of Potomac, Maryland, has been charged with eight violations of the U.S. Criminal Code for allegedly illegally transferring classified data, including the video that wound up on WikiLeaks. He has been accused of ""wrongfully introducing a classified video of a military operation filmed at or near Baghdad, Iraq"" around July 12, 2007, ""onto his personal computer, a non-secure information system."" Assange said at a news conference that Manning ""is a political prisoner being held in the nation of Kuwait, effectively keeping him away from the press and effective legal representation."" He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying if he was the source of the video. ""Obviously, we cannot pick and choose,"" said Assange, adding that the site has to defend everyone who faces serious charges as a result of material posted on WikiLeaks. The video shows aerial footage of an attack by a U.S. Apache helicopter that killed civilians, including two journalists from the Reuters news service. WikiLeaks posted it in April. The site said the video ""clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."" Asked to respond to Assange's assertion that Manning is a ""political prisoner,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan told CNN that Manning is ""accused of committing serious offenses. He has been charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and will be processed by normal procedures through the military justice system."" U.S. military authorities have warned that the publication of classified documents on WikiLeaks could aid in the planning of terrorist attacks and harm national security. At the Oxford event, Assange said, ""Remember the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan, they don't need to see the video. They see it every day."" He said the site's hope is that such video ""will change the perception of the people who are paying"" for the war. Assange denied reports that WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. cables in addition to the Iraq video. He said the site would have released the cables if it had received them. Assange said some information, including a patient's medical records, should legitimately be kept secret. But he said WikiLeaks's practice of revealing information from whistle-blowers follows the traditions of journalism. The fact that governments and organizations spend money to keep this information secret, Assange said, is a good indication that releasing the information can achieve reform. The 39-year-old Assange, who has gray hair swept back behind his ears, noted that WikiLeaks operates in several countries, including Iceland and Sweden, where, he said, laws give protection to the disclosures made on the site. He said he had to cancel three public appearances in the United States, including one at the June conference of Investigative Reporters and Editors in Las Vegas, Nevada, because of ""unreasonable"" statements by U.S. officials in private that they ""may not follow the rule of law"" in dealing with him. ""I received advice from figures like [investigative reporter] Sy Hersh to exercise caution,"" Assange said, adding that U.S. officials have now adopted a ""reasonable"" attitude in private. Assange was interviewed by Chris Anderson, curator of TED, the nonprofit that ran the conference. He asked the audience for a show of hands as to whether he was a hero or a ""dangerous troublemaker."" The vast majority signaled that they viewed him as a hero. CNN's Mike Mount and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon says Pfc. Bradley E. Manning is accused of ""serious offenses""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown will stay in rehab a few more weeks despite a prosecutor's request he be thrown in jail. Brown, who has been on probation since pleading guilty to assaulting girlfriend Rihanna five years ago, is becoming more violent, with his outbursts ""increasing in severity and intensity,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray argued Monday. The singer has been in a rehab program for anger issues and drug abuse since November when the judge ordered him to go there instead of jail for an earlier probation violation. But the prosecutor asked Monday that he been locked up in jail because of his arrest in Washington on an assault charge. Although Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin ruled Brown was again in violation of probation, he cited a new report from his probation officer that concluded Brown ""is doing well in the program and making great strides"" in rehab. For now, Brown can stay in rehab, the judge ruled. ""It appears your doing well in the program,"" he told Brown. ""There's no reason to put him into custody at this point,"" Brown attorney Mark Geragos said after the hearing. ""We're happy that the judge agreed with us."" Brown is expected to complete the rehab program on February 19, but he has to travel to Washington for a hearing on the assault charge on February 20. That case could still send Brown to jail in Los Angeles if he is found guilty. The probation imposed when he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in the 2009 attack on Rihanna requires that he stay out of legal trouble. The judge will hold another hearing on February 28 to decide his fate after rehab. The latest probation report praises Brown's new improved attitude in complying with probation rules. ""He appears to have a more serious and responsible demeanor and is responding well to dual diagnosis treatment program and changes in medication,"" his probation officer wrote. Brown is working on a community labor crew three days a week until he completes 1,000 of work ordered by the judge in November. He's finished 109 hours and still has 809 hours left before his probation can be completed, the probation officer said. At that pace, Brown has another 101 days of work left. The glowing report is a stark contrast to what the probation officer wrote in November after Brown was booted from another rehab facility after smashing his mother's car window during a family session. ""There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility,"" that probation report said. Brown and his bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, face assault charges stemming an incident outside the a hotel near the White House in October. The federal prosecutor handling the case offered to let them each plead guilty to one count of simple assault, but they rejected the offers at court last month.

"(CNN) -- Spain sent police reinforcements to its enclave of Melilla, on Morocco's north coast, on Wednesday, after more than a thousand would-be immigrants to Europe from Mali and Cameroon rushed en masse to try to illegally enter Spain. Under cover of dense fog, on Tuesday just before 8 a.m., the young men climbed a section of the six-meter-tall, chain-link fence that had not been reinforced, while Moroccan and Spanish security forces tried desperately to prevent them. About 500 made it in, and they were soon running toward an overcrowded immigrant holding center in Melilla, shouting ""bosa, bosa,"" which means ""victory, victory."" It was the biggest ""assault"" in nearly decade, surpassing the 350 immigrants who scampered inside Melilla on a single day back in October 2005, authorities said. On Wednesday, Madrid sent 120 additional police and civil guards to Melilla. The Spanish government estimates there are 40,000 African migrants gathered in northern Morocco who want to enter Melilla or the other Spanish enclave, Ceuta, hundreds of miles to the east and close to the Strait of Gibraltar. The government estimates an additional 40,000 migrants are gathered close to the border of Mauritania and Morocco, with the intention of moving north to try to enter Spain. On March 6, Spain's Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz, on a visit to Ceuta, said the mass influx of immigrants was not just Spain's problem, but Europe's, and he called for more EU cooperation. The immigrant-holding center in Melilla now has about 1,800 residents -- more than triple its capacity. After Tuesday's latest influx, the Spanish Red Cross and the army hastily erected 26 tents and expanded the perimeter of the center, where the migrants get meals, showers and medical care, said Mariano Fernandez of the Red Cross. Spanish media reported on Wednesday that the government would soon need to transfer dozens or hundreds of the immigrants to the Spanish mainland. That would put them closer to other EU countries, like France, which have minimized controls at many internal EU borders such as the Spanish-French crossings. But the government had no immediate comment about potential transfers of migrants. The latest influx in Melilla comes as controversy swirls around the events of last February 6, when some 15 migrants drowned while trying to swim from Morocco past a retaining wall and into Ceuta. Spanish police fired rubber bullets on that occasion, and rights groups allege this may have contributed to the deaths. The government says the rubber bullets were not aimed directly at the migrants. Later on Wednesday, a top Interior Ministry official is due to offer further explanations before Spain's parliament.","Would-be immigrants from Mali and Cameroon rushed en masse to try to illegally enter Spain .

"(CNN) -- Ted Nugent sure knows how to stir controversy. The rock star turned provocateur has never shied away from controversy, from singing about having sex with underage girls in ""Jailbait"" to calling people names. In case you missed it, Nugent's most recent rant raised all kinds of red flags when he called President Barack Obama ""a subhuman mongrel."" But even as the self-proclaimed ""Motor City Madman"" was called mad by critics, Nugent didn't appear to lose any support among fans or politicians. Some say Nugent amplifies Americans' anger at Washington. But is he the voice of America? The torchbearer for the disaffected? ""There are reasons ... people listen to him,"" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, said. 'Dead or jailed' It isn't like Nugent is ever short of anything critical to say about anyone with whom he disagrees. He has called Hillary Clinton a ""worthless b****"" and Obama a gangster. Nugent's extreme speech has made a lot of eyes roll. And media outlets, including CNN, have been criticized for giving him a microphone. Two years ago, his comments at an NRA convention that he would be ""dead or jailed"" if Obama were re-elected earned him a visit from the Secret Service. But this time, critics said Nugent's statements went an insult too far. For the record, here's what he said in an interview with Guns.com: ""I have obviously failed to galvanize and prod, if not shame, enough Americans to be ever-vigilant not to let a Chicago communist-raised, communist-educated, communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel like the ACORN community organizer gangster Barack Hussein Obama to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the United States of America."" Outrage ensued. Almost immediately, critics condemned his comments, calling for Nugent to apologize and for public figures to distance themselves from him. Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott came under fire for campaigning with Nugent. Abbott's likely Democratic opponent, Wendy Davis, called Nugent's remarks -- and Abbott's appearance with him -- an ""insult"" to Texans. Abbott told CNN on Thursday there were no plans to campaign again with Nugent, but he did not rule it out completely. And Cruz, who told CNN he didn't agree with the rocker's comments, left the door open for a possible future Nugent cameo for him. Nugent insists 'subhuman mongrel' comments not racist . 'Star power' Republican strategist and former Romney adviser Kevin Madden said politicians ""assume this star power will help them identify with voters and help them get some headlines they might not get if it was just another boring political rally or public event."" That star power is built in large part on Nugent's music career, which peaked in the late 1970s when his signature single ""Cat Scratch Fever"" cracked the Top 40 and he was selling out arena-sized venues. The self-proclaimed ""Motor City Madman"" released his greatest hits album in 1981 but that was followed by dwindling record sales. He served as a county sheriff in his native Michigan and became an advocate for gun rights, hunters and conservation. On an appearance on ""Late Night With David Letterman"" in the 1980s, the rocker spouted statistics about gun ownership and crime and the motivations of an ""anti-gun cause."" ""During the fall... I don't rock and roll, I like to harvest my own food,"" Nugent added. He emerged on the national political scene with the rise of the tea party in 2010. His politically incorrect comments on the music scene, once telling VH1 he had affairs with underaged girls, transferred to the political stage, where he became an outspoken opponent of Obama and the Democratic Party. The risks include the increased chance for negative headlines that could turn off a more mainstream audience. On the other hand, an appearance with Nugent might increase the candidate's appeal to the rocker's active supporters. Take for example the rocker's appearance with Abbott at campaign events. The Times Record reported that attendance at Abbott's event in Wichita Falls in northern Texas near the Oklahoma border ""increased significantly"" with Nugent's appearance. At home with the 'Motor City Madman,' Ted Nugent . Conservative appeal . Ruy Teixeira, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, said that while Nugent is not in the political mainstream, he appeals to a segment of the population that some politicians feel they can't ignore. Nugent has a base among conservatives, and its size is not trivial, Teixeira said. Still, Nugent's comments about Obama this time around drew criticism from within that base of support. Conservatives wrote opinion pieces, including one on CNN by conservative commentator Timothy Stanley, who said he is ""sick and tired of being embarrassed"" by Nugent. Republican Sen. Rand Paul called on Nugent to apologize, which he did, sort of. In an interview on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" Nugent said he would ""stop calling people names."" ""Instead of using terms like 'subhuman mongrel,' I'm going to get right to the meat of the matter where our president is a liar. He lies about you can keep your doctor period. Over and over again he lies about Benghazi. He's lying about the IRS,"" Nugent said. When Nugent took to Facebook to tell his 1.8 million followers that he would continue ""to fight the enemies of America infesting our government,"" the post received 50,000 ""likes."" In response to the latest controversy, Nugent wrote on his Facebook page: ""I seek no attention. I seek no media."" He says he wants to ""spotlight power abusers & gvt [sic] criminals... to fight the enemies of America infesting our government."" That comment drew nearly 50,000 ""likes"" and included comments of support such as the one from Dan Filkins, who wrote ""stand up and fight brother... ted [sic] for president!!!"" Nugent's appearance with Abbott prompted cheers from fellow firebrand Sarah Palin. On her Facebook page, she decided to endorse Abbott, writing, ""If he is good enough for Ted Nugent, he is good enough for me!"" That comment received more than 20,000 ""likes."" Nugent sits on the board of the National Rifle Association and his vehement opposition to most restrictions on firearms attracts the support of many Second Amendment defenders. He also has support from some tea party advocates. Taylor Budowich, executive director of Tea Party Express, said he is pleased that Nugent apologized for the ""mongrel"" remark and realized that inflammatory comments distract from his core message. He noted, however, that Nugent has support because he talks about the issues his tea party group cares about, including reducing the size of government and ""restoring America"" after being ""hurt by this administration and past administrations."" But it's more than the themes that attract people to Nugent, Budowich says, it's how he says it. Politicians are politically correct and calculated, framing issues ""in a way that is least offensive,"" Budowich says. But Nugent ""speaks a different language,"" one to which many Americans can relate. He ""speaks from his heart,"" Budowich said. But when asked about the offensive things Nugent has said, Budowich defended him, saying he doesn't think Nugent is a hurtful person, just passionate. Nugent's brother, Jeff, had a similar take. On CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" he said Ted's latest comments were ""out of line,"" but said his brother is passionate and provocative. ""So you put those two things together and it comes out the way you see it. I agree with him on some points, but I disagree vehemently on others.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Chile's president said Monday that conditions must improve in the country's mining industry, just days after 33 miners were rescued from a collapsed mineshaft at a copper mine in the country's remote Atacama Desert. The miners spent 69 days trapped in a shelter almost a half a mile underground before rescuers were able to reach them by drilling a hole wide enough to send a rescue capsule down. ""We cannot guarantee that another accident will never occur in the future,"" Chilean President Sebastian Pinera told CNN's Connect the World during a visit to Britain to meet Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister David Cameron. ""But we have learned our lesson and we are revising and changing our relations, our procedures."" A dangerous life for Chilean miners . He added that as a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) -- a forum of nations with a focus on helping governments tackle the economic, social and governance challenges of a globalized economy -- Chile's new rules would be compatible with international standards. ""We will make sure they are enforced in the field because that's where it is important,"" he said. ""And not only in the mining sector; we are revising our standards in many other sectors in order to guarantee that we are doing our best in terms of protecting lives, health, and integrity of our workers."" Pinera also described how, as the eyes of the world were fixed on Chile at the start of the dramatic story, he was coming to terms with personal tragedy. As news emerged of the 33 miners trapped a half mile under Chile's Atacama Desert when the San Jose gold and copper mine collapsed, the president's father-in-law was gravely ill. Days and nights were passing without any indication of the state of the men but Pinera spent the night of August 21 at the hospital, at his wife's side. His father-in-law told him: ""Don't give up searching. It's your responsibility. It's your duty."" They were his last words. Pinera's wife encouraged her husband to immediately go to the mine. Something, she said, will happen today. Pinera arrived at the mine near Copiapo to a handwritten message sent up by the miners through a probe. ""Estamos bien,"" it said. We are well. Pinera carries a copy of the message in his pocket always. ""It was an explosion of joy, happiness, tears all over the country, and I think all over the world,"" Pinera said Monday, recounting the mine ordeal to CNN's Becky Anderson during a visit to the United Kingdom. It would be many weeks before a dramatic rescue would hoist all 33 miners to safety. The entire world watched, families rejoiced and Pinera emerged with a burnished image. He has been smiling in relief since last week's rescue but on August 5, the day the mine caved in, the burden of life for the 33 miners rested on Pinera's shoulders. ""The private company that owns the mine was not able to undertake the search and rescue,"" Pinera told CNN. ""So it was either us, the government, or nobody."" So Pinera launched a blind search, against all odds. He said he held onto ""profound conviction"" and his faith in God. ""I feel that their families were so convinced that they were alive that each time I went to visit them at the mine during those 17 days of anguish, I was reinforced in our convictions that they were alive,"" Pinera said. ""I had a kind of inner voice that told me, keep searching, keep searching, don't give up."" He recalled when the energy secretary told him about three possible technologies that could be used in the rescue. Which one should they use? Pinera's thought was: all of them. ""The machines can fail. We cannot fail,"" Pinera said. Then on day number 69, Florencio Avalos became the first miner to make the long journey upward and step out of the rescue capsule. ""I will never forget that moment,"" Pinera said. ""It was so, so overwhelming. It was so impressive."" Pinera bear-hugged him. As he did all the others, all the way to number 33, Luis Urzua, the shift foreman who chose to be the last out. Urzua told Pinera: ""I am handing the ship over to you."" Pinera replied: ""You have been a very good chief. A very good captain. Because you never abandoned your ship until all your men were safe. You were the last one. That was your duty and I'm so proud for that."" Pinera has been credited for his leadership; for his media savvy -- he used to own Chilevision TV -- and even for what some are calling a badly needed new image for Chile. In England, Pinera alluded to the speech delivered by Winston Churchill when he first became prime minister in 1940. ""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat,"" Churchill said. ""And it was similar that we have the same motivation, faith, and commitment,"" Pinera said. ""Therefore, we kept searching. ""And I think that the lessons that we can take from this accident is when a country is united and committed with faith, with hope, using the best possible technologies and the best possible human teams, we are able to achieve goals that for some people seems as impossible,"" he said.","Pinera's father-in-law's last words were to not give up the search .
He died on the same day the miners were discovered .
Pinera says he held onto profound conviction .
He will never forget the moment the first miner came up ."
"(CNN) -- A few days ago, I was coming home from school with a Polish priest. As we walked, he blurted out, ""The smell of spring!"" We were surrounded by the scent of freshly cut grass. I looked around and realized that indeed spring had come; here and there, a number of trees had begun to bud, and the lowly but beaming margarita flower was in full bloom. One thought immediately came to my mind: It has been a year since the election of Pope Francis. It had been raining all afternoon that day in March 2013. Despite the bad weather, many had come to St. Peter's Square. As usual, there were flags from different nations, singing and shouting in different languages -- all this had always been a staple at St. Peter's Square. But that evening was different: People had come to see what the chimney would produce after it yielded black smoke on two earlier papal votes. I was with the throng, among those who were closest to the basilica. It was a scene of joyful anticipation. It was already dark when white smoke poured from the chimney, telling everyone that a new pope has been chosen. Spontaneous applause and cheers filled the square, and then, as if it had been deliberately orchestrated, the sky began to clear and the evening became pleasant, cool and cloudless. Then came the tolling of the bells, the entry of the army of Swiss guards, the music played by the brass band and lights from the balcony. Photos: The night Francis was chosen . A few more minutes and then appeared an elderly cardinal speaking the words: ""Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum HABEMUS PAPAM Georgium Marium Bergoglio qui sibi nomen imposuit Franciscum."" There was a momentary silence. The names were not anticipated: neither Bergoglio, for he was not considered among the strong contenders, nor Francis, for no pope had previously taken that name. Suddenly, great applause followed this short lull. There were roars of approval all around, shouts of ""Viva il Papa!"" I distinctly heard a young priest affirming, ""Francis! Oh, this is revolutionary!"" Our new Pope Francis appeared. After a short message and before giving his first apostolic blessing, he asked the people to pray for him, to beseech the Lord to bless him, their bishop. A solemn silence reigned at St. Peter's Square. Francis broke the silence with his first blessing as pope. Then he took his leave, leaving everyone with an informal ""Good night and sleep well!"" To this the crowd responded in jubilation. Opinion: Why Pope Francis is so shocking . That evening was auspicious. There were several things that kept me awake that night. The new pope was non-European; he took the name Francis; he bowed and asked his flock to pray for him, their shepherd; he ended his first speech in a very candid, familiar greeting. And the words from the young priest: ""Revolutionary!"" The weeks and months that followed confirmed the charisma of this new pope. St. Peter's Square is always packed with huge crowds during general audiences and the Sunday Angelus. Like the candor in his first address, he ends every Sunday gathering with ""Buon pranzo!"" (""Have a good lunch!"") People are hanging on to what this pontiff says: the novelty in his words and deeds and how different groups would interpret them. The ""Pope Francis effect"" I took advantage of this privilege that I am in Rome to follow closely what this new pope has to say and what he does. Most of the time, I take his words from my point of view as a priest, as one who is a co-worker in ministering to the people. In sharing my thoughts and reflection on the first year of his papacy, I also take this bias of one who has the task of shepherding. I see the first year of Pope Francis' pontificate as one of preaching joy and mercy. He told the faithful gathered at the Palm Sunday Mass: ""Do not be men and women of sadness; a Christian can never be sad!"" And perhaps this is what makes the pope an even more relevant figure in today's world. Under Francis, we would expect a revitalization of the church, that he would continue to make it closer to those in the peripheries. It is an echo of the action of the other Francis, the man of Assisi, rebuilding the church of Jesus. The spring evening in which Pope Francis was elected is an apt symbol of the beginning of his papacy and the years that will follow. Perhaps it is not a mere coincidence that his pontificate coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council. If Vatican II opened the windows for the spring air to come in, the papacy of Pope Francis opens the doors for the church and her pastors to go out -- and here I would like to quote from his homily to priests on Holy Thursday: ""May (Jesus) renew his Spirit in our hearts, that this anointing may spread to everyone, even to those 'outskirts' where our faithful people most look for it and most appreciate it.""

"(CNN) -- First some full disclosure: Former President Jimmy Carter has been pretty good to me. He gave me in-person interviews for my last book and a forthcoming one on the end of greatness in the presidency. And every time we've met, our conversations have been friendly and productive. But having worked on the Middle East negotiations for more than a few years and still laboring under the notion that wrongheaded assumptions and conclusions ought to be redressed, I can't help but weigh in on the former President's criticism of both President Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Carter's brief comments raise two important issues worth examining. Carter's idea that the President ought to jump in and get in the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and that Clinton should be somehow blamed for not taking on the peace process are dead-on inaccurate. I've been critical of Obama and Clinton. But blasting them for failure to leap into the throes of a broken peace process isn't a valid criticism. What Carter has done is to allow his own passion for resolving the Palestinian issue and his own experience in peacemaking during the late 1970s to skew his view of what is required now in the way of presidential involvement. Right now, the Kerry talks are hardly ready for prime time, and until they're much farther along Obama should keep his distance. Carter's brief paragraph of comments in his longer interview in TIME takes shots at Obama and Clinton from two different directions. Other than his well-deserved expression of admiration for Kerry, just about everything in that paragraph is wrong. First is the charge that Kerry is ""having a difficult time operating pretty much on his own."" Here's a news flash for you. This is the Israeli-Palestinian issue -- it's the mother of all migraine headaches and root canals operations. Every secretary of state and president who has ever dealt with it has had a difficult time. Indeed, none has even come close to resolving it. Kerry is only the latest in a fairly long line of would-be peacemakers. And the fact is even with the current crisis in the talks, (likely to be resolved on the basis of more process but little peace) he's actually kept this thing afloat longer than anyone would have believed. Implicit in Carter's charge, though, is the idea that Kerry's travails are related almost entirely to the fact that Obama has not played a central role in the enterprise so far. Much of Carter's mediator addiction flows from his own experience in brokering Egyptian-Israeli peace. Let's be clear Jimmy Carter accomplished in 1978 and 1979 remains a truly important and consequential act of U.S. diplomacy. Carter took risks in bringing Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David in 1978, and he was relentless and skillful in his brokering of those accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty that followed in March of the following year. But presidential involvement then was both warranted and critical to the task at hand. Carter had two strong leaders who were serious about making a deal. He had a focus on Egyptian-Israeli peace that both Sadat (reluctantly) and Begin (happily) were prepared to separate out from the more complicated Palestinian issue. He had negotiators below the level of the two leaders on each side who were prepared to play key roles in facilitating, not complicating, the negotiations. In short, then the peace process was ready for prime time. Now it isn't. After all, Sadat in November 1977 in one of the most extraordinary acts of statesmanship in the 20th century had undertaken a trip to Jerusalem and in the process fundamentally altered the shape of the conflict. Today, the Israeli-Palestinian issue remains largely frozen. Should Kerry's effort progress further and the gaps on the core issues of the conflict -- borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees -- narrow significantly, it would be worth a significant push by Obama to close them. Indeed, an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, let alone a conflict-ending one, isn't going to be possible without presidential involvement of a major caliber. But to spend presidential currency now, to make the President part of the political furniture by throwing him into a semihopeless process not only doesn't make sense, it would undermine presidential credibility. Woody Allen was only partly right. Ninety percent of success in life is showing up. But it's showing up at the right time. As for Carter's charge that Clinton ""took very little action to bring about peace"" and that ""it was only Kerry's coming into office that reinitiated all these important and critical issues,"" that's also wrong and unfair. During her term as secretary of state, Clinton dealt with perhaps the most controlling foreign policy president since Richard Nixon. Obama dominated -- he didn't delegate. All of the consequential issues were run out of the White House, including the so-called peace process. And that had nary a chance of getting started because the President chose to focus on Israeli settlement activity instead of what might be required to reach an actual agreement -- not that such an agreement could have been reached then anyway. It was true that Clinton was likely risk-averse on the Palestinian issue. She was smart enough to know the climate was hardly amenable to an agreement. It's also true Kerry is risk-ready. Unlike his predecessor, the arc of his prospective elected political career is descending; Clinton's is ascending. If she runs for president, she has to deal with the consequences of actions she took regarding the Middle East. And so Kerry is prepared to be active. But that's because the President is ready to let Kerry engage. You have a second-term president more focused on the middle class as a legacy, not on the Middle East. And so it's important that he has a secretary of state who is prepared to take on and manage all the headaches the President can't or doesn't want to. It's truly unfair to blame Clinton for a first term peace process that never was and almost certainly never could have been. Carter's views on the Middle East are likely driven by many things: his own success there and the lack of success of all of his predecessors on issues he cares deeply about and that are important to U.S. national interests. But none of that should fundamentally obscure the main issue. Carter succeeded in the peace process because the parties themselves were prepared to own it and take the decisions necessary to make it work. That is not yet the case today. The primary problem is not Barack Obama, John Kerry or Hillary Clinton. It's primarily Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas. And while the United States has a critical role to play, unless that changes, you might as well hang a closed-for-the-season sign on prospects for a solution.","Former President Carter made comments critical of Obama and Hillary Clinton on Mideast peace .

"(CNN) -- All 10 people aboard an air taxi were killed when it crashed and burst into flames at a small airport on southern Alaska's Kenai Peninsula, authorities said. The single-engine de Havilland DHC-3 Otter ""struck the runway and burned"" around 11:20 a.m. Sunday at the Soldotna Airport, about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage, the Federal Aviation Administration said, citing local law enforcement officials. It wasn't immediately clear whether the aircraft was taking off or landing at the time, the FAA said. By the time firefighters and medics arrived, the aircraft was engulfed, Soldotna police said. ""There were 10 souls on the aircraft and all perished,"" said Capt. Lesley Quelland with the Central Emergency Services, which serves the Soldotna area. The flight was supposed to take passengers to Bear Mountain Lodge off Alaska's Chinitna Bay, about 80 miles southwest of Soldotna, the lodge's co-owner, Mac McGahan, told CNN on Monday. The plane was operated by Rediske Air, according to the FAA. A woman who answered the phone at Rediske declined to answer questions and deferred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which has been called in to investigate the crash. Rediske Air Inc. appears in an online directory of charter-plane companies, AirCharterGuide.com. The company, based in Nikiski, Alaska, was established in 1991, according to Alaska's Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing. The airport is about a mile from the center of Soldotna, a community of about 4,100 people.

"(CNN) -- A journal written by the 19-year-old gunman in last week's Maryland mall shooting offers no clues to a key question investigators are asking -- whether Darion Aguilar knew the young man and woman he shot and killed before turning the gun on himself. While police in Howard County, Maryland, are not yet releasing the contents of the journal, they said Tuesday that from his writings, it appears Aguilar knew he had mental health issues. They did not elaborate on that point. But why did he go to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday and fire as many as nine shots into a skateboard apparel shop? Gunman's mother says he was 'gentle, sweet' Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, a friend of his family said. As of now, that's the only known link between him and the skate shop Zumiez. Investigators are distributing fliers with Aguilar's picture to those in and around the mall, in hopes of finding people who either knew him or saw him. Aguilar was known to frequent the mall, according to police, where ""he would hang outside and smoke in small groups."" Investigators are also working on retrieving data from Aguilar's computer and cell phone, according to police. Still, his motive remains a mystery. It started out as a routine day in busy mall . Aguilar's mother told reporters Sunday that her son was a ""gentle, sweet kid,"" and that she doesn't think he knew his victims -- 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson. On Saturday, a federal official briefed on the shooting told CNN that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at Benlolo and Johnson, perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree. ""I know there's a lot of interest in the motive for this, and I have as much interest in that as anybody,"" Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said Sunday. Benlolo was an assistant manager at Zumiez. She had worked there since November 2012, according to her Facebook page. Friend Evelyn McDonald said Benlolo, the mother of a small boy, was ""just full of energy."" ""She was so nice and just an amazing artist and just an amazing person inside and out,"" McDonald told CNN. ""She loved her son. She loved being a mother,"" McDonald said. Cops: Mall gunman expressed 'general unhappiness' in journal . Johnson had worked at the store for about three months, according to his Facebook page. Five people went to the hospital for treatment after the shooting. All were treated and released. Four suffered injuries in the chaos after the shooting. The other injured victim suffered a gunshot wound to the foot. Police said the woman wasn't in Zumiez; rather, she was on the first floor when she was hit. The mall reopened Monday afternoon, but the Zumiez store will be closed indefinitely, according to a sign on the boarded-up storefront. The simple thing your mall can do to protect you .

"New York (CNN) -- A man was arrested Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport after checking a loaded rifle and three other illegal weapons, according to a Port Authority spokesperson. Keenan Draughon of Clarksville, Tennessee, was arrested after he checked two handguns, two defaced rifles and two unloaded high-capacity magazines, according to Port Authority spokesperson Joseph Pentangelo. In New York City, it is illegal to carry a handgun or possess a high-capacity magazine. Rifles and shotguns are legal to carry if unloaded with a proper permit, according to Pentangelo. The two rifles were defaced, one with purple paint and the other with silver paint, covering the serial numbers, which is a crime, according to Pentangelo. One rifle was loaded. Draughon, 23, was stopped and questioned at security before going through metal detectors while trying to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina. He had checked the weapons in gun cases at Terminal 8, according to Pentangelo. Draughon also had a fifth weapon -- a shotgun -- that was legal to travel with, according to Pentangelo. ""It's unusual, but it's not remarkable,"" Pentangelo told CNN about the case. ""Luckily, no one got hurt."" Draughon faces two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, two counts of criminal possession of a defaced rifle and two counts of criminal possession of large-capacity magazine.

"(CNN) -- ""Veronica Mars"" was canceled after only three seasons in 2007, leaving fans hungry for some kind of closure. While creator Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell have teased the idea of a ""Veronica Mars"" movie in the years since, that possibility seemed to die when the studio passed on the project. But fans -- or ""Marshmallows"" as they're known -- wouldn't let executives keep their beloved characters from them a second time and saved the project by donating more than $5.7 million to a Kickstarter campaign for the film earlier this year, reaching far more than the $2 million Warner Bros. required to make the movie. (Time Warner is the parent company of both Warner Bros. and CNN). ""Veronica Mars"" the movie is now in production and will be released in theaters in 2014. Thomas, Bell and the rest of the cast came to Comic-Con to share never-before-seen footage from the film with fans and backers. In the movie, Veronica returns to her hometown of Neptune, California, for a high school reunion, bringing all the old characters back together. The footage reveals that Veronica is now a lawyer in New York City, outlaw character Weevil (played by Francis Capra) is settled down and married, and Jamie Lee Curtis has a role in the movie. Bell spoke with CNN at the Samsung Galaxy Experience at Comic-Con, where she admitted how much the role of Veronica Mars means to her personally, what to expect on ""House of Lies"" season two and that time she and fiancÃ© Dax Shepard were too busy to get married. CNN: How surprised are you by the fact that you are actually making a ""Veronica Mars"" movie? Kristen Bell: At the time (of the Kickstarter campaign), I thought, ""Of course this is happening. This is what's supposed to happen."" The farther I get from the date of that occurrence, I start to realize how absolutely farfetched this idea was to throw out into the universe. I start to realize the size of our balls -- what we attempted and thankfully succeeded at having happen. When we were talking about our Kickstarter launch I had no doubt in my mind that we would make our goal because it has been discussed in every interview I've done since the show was canceled. I was led to believe there was still a good amount of interest, but certainly never in a million years thought we would surpass the goal as much as we did. It was a ballsy response from the fans too, by the way. CNN: It was interesting to see all those Kickstarter backers in the room with you. Is it true when you said some of the creative decisions on the film reflect what you think the fans will want? Bell: Without question. Rob (Thomas) is one of the best TV writers that's ever existed. He plays to everyone's strengths and that includes his audience and himself. He doesn't write selfishly. He knows what people want to see and he gives them that. He's like a really, really, really good father. CNN: Is this film finally going to give you a sense of closure on ""Veronica Mars""? Bell: No. This could be my whole life. And by the way, what a lucky life it would be if it were. There's no formula for it, because it just has never been done before. Except -- and I'm just throwing it out there -- ""Star Trek"" did it. They did a TV show and then nine movies. Who knows? Why can't we make a couple films? Or continue to produce content of ""Veronica Mars""? It gets tricky because television contracts legally only allow you to do one episode of a different show. They purchase you. I am now the face of ""House of Lies."" So the only way I would be able to reprise Veronica Mars (on TV) is in movie form. CNN: What about if it were on Netflix? Bell: There are some loopholes that we are already investigating. CNN: When do you start shooting the next season of ""House of Lies""? Bell: We don't shoot until October. It premieres in January. We left season two on a real cliffhanger between Don (Cheadle) and my character. I know that they're currently breaking story lines and everyone's pitching ideas; I don't really have much contribution other than being excited about it. The characters are definitely going to start off with a lot of tension because there were confessions of love at the end of the last episode, which just makes for a really interesting first episode of season three. CNN: When you started working on ""House of Lies"" did you find that developing a new TV character was difficult after investing so much in ""Veronica Mars"" and that character? Bell: Yes and it was very challenging as an actress to create someone I would wear so often. A movie is a little bit different. Veronica is pretty similar to who I am -- I'm not as frustrated as she is, I don't think. I don't have as many zingers as she does. I certainly throw them out there, they just don't land as often as when she says them. It did feel uncomfortable the first few episodes I played Jeannie because I was in a television situation again and I wasn't Veronica. I don't think at the time I identified it as ""I'm not Veronica,"" it just felt new and unexplored. Now I'm very comfortable with it simply because of the length of time I've played her. No job I've ever had has been as big of a deal to my real life as Kristen (as ""Veronica Mars""). CNN: Has the success of the ""Veronica Mars"" movie opened the door for any canceled show to make a comeback? Bell: I certainly hope so. The way I see it is that Kickstarter is the best example of ""power to the people."" If the people want it, the people can make it. That's the beauty behind a public funding forum. I hope it opens up a lot of doors for fan bases that don't feel heard with the content they would like to see, but I don't think it will put the studio system out of business. I don't think it's the end result for everybody, but I really like the fact that the fans are my boss. CNN: Is there a TV show or movie you would support on Kickstarter if one needed it? Bell: ""The Newsroom."" I will be the first donor. CNN: You and Dax Shepard recently announced on Twitter that you are finally getting married. Can you explain why you wanted to hold out until marriage equality was secured in California? Bell: I did not feel comfortable taking a right that was denied to some of my best friends. I would want someone to stand up for me if I was denied a right in this country that prides itself on having equal rights for everyone. I believe that gay citizens of this country deserve to share not only the label of marriage but also the rights behind it. There are over 1,100 rights denied to a couple when you can't legally get married. I find that to be mind-boggling. Dax and I both very much wanted to wait because if we did do something for our wedding half the people we would be inviting couldn't celebrate the same right. But when we had a baby it became clear as to why we're fighting for this right, because we don't have some rights in regard to the baby that married couples do. I choose to be on the right side of history and I know in my heart that (equality) is what's right. CNN: When will you actually get married? Bell: I don't know. We almost did it on the day (of the Supreme Court decision) out of principle but we were both busy. We don't really want a wedding, though. It's too much stress, but we do really want to sign those papers. If anything just for the baby's sake. CNN: What's the cutest thing your daughter Lincoln has done? Bell: Existing! She's my best friend. She's 3Â½ months. Laying there is extremely cute to me. It's ecstasy for me.","Kristen Bell visited Comic-Con for ""Veronica Mars"" movie .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Peter Head is a Director of Arup, a global firm of designers, engineers, planners and business consultants. He's playing a leading role in the planning and building of China's first eco-cities -- Dongtan and Wanzhuang. Peter Head is in charge of planning and development for Dongtan and Wanzhuang eco-cities in China. The city's planners are aiming to create communities that are not only environmentally friendly, but also socially, economically and culturally sustainable. They'll produce their own energy from wind, solar, biofuel and recycled city waste. Bike and footpaths will take the emphasis off driving and land is being set aside for growing local, organic food. CNN's Principal Voices spoke to Head at Arup's offices in London, and asked him whether there's starting to be a universal language of design, or sustainability. Peter Head: I think there is and I think increasingly we won't call it sustainability because actually what it is, is very careful targets for those social, economic and environmental outcomes. Sustainable development is simply an expression of the desire to increase human development where we live within the environmental limits of the planet. So I think increasingly sustainability is a confusing concept. It's much more about being very clear about what our objectives are. Looking at them holistically and making the connection between the energy we use for watering, the energy we use for transport and so on. And joining all that up rather than looking at things in silos. CNN: What are the characteristics of a Peter Head design? Peter Head: I would like to think that all the projects I have done, I have always been very concerned that they actually work well for people that use them. One of my big things is bridges -- quite often are built and then they tend to be closed to traffic for a lot of the time because of maintenance. So the bridges I've been involved in are ones that actually function just like parts of the motorway network in the UK. They don't get closed all the time and also they are safe for shipping going underneath and the people are protected from cross winds so that vehicles aren't blown over. So it's all about sustainable development. Really it's about making sure they work socially as well as safely for people crossing. CNN: How do you feel that a city functions best? Peter Head: In the end of course it functions in a sort of evolutionary and changing way, so you can't say you design a city and you know how it's going to perform. What you have to do is design the basic infrastructure; that's the green parks, the public transports, the roads that don't get changed later and then allow people and their ingenuity to develop it in a way that is appropriate to the time and to change it and develop it. The public spaces are great places that encourage the culture, the life and the vibrancy of the city. CNN: Let's come on to specifically what you've been doing at Wanzhuang and Dongtan? What is it that makes those cities sustainable while the rest of our cities are not? Peter Head: Fundamentally of course what we are talking about in terms of sustainability is long-term thinking. So we are looking 20 or 30 years ahead and we are making sure that those cities will function economically with good prosperity in 20 or 30 years time when shortage of food and expensive food, and materials and water and so on maybe a greater problem. So it's very much looking at the jobs that one can bring in looking at the environmental performance and the way the city works and making sure that will still be working very well in the future. CNN: What about the people who actually use the projects you've designed. Have you managed to draw an enthusiastic response from them? Peter Head: We certainly do. One of the things we try to do now is something we call cultural planning. When we are starting a project we actually engage with communities and we do a bit of research on the history of the place: The way people have lived there, the way they've interacted with nature, and with each other and then when we do the consultation. In Wanzhuang in China for example, we found that people had history of having dancing squares and all sorts of cultural facilities within their communities. So by retaining the footprint of those villages and the corners and little areas that they remember in the new development then it actually extends the culture which we find people respond to very well. CNN: How do you go about making cities like London, or Paris or Frankfurt or New York more sustainable? Peter Head: The issues that make cities unsustainable at the moment are the problems of energy supply and energy use and security of that energy supply and the cost of it. But also the increasing difference between the rich and the poor people. Rich people are getting rich and poor people are getting poor in most of these places. So actually, tackling that is an aspect of dealing with the best future economic prospects for everybody while actually making the city work more efficiently. It's like an engine. If you have to use less fuel and less materials to run it, it actually runs better and actually is more efficient and therefore produces more economic performance, and sharing that amongst the communities is really important if it's going to be successful. CNN: Are you optimistic that by the middle of this century we can have a planet with nine or 10 billion human beings on it and that we can live on it in a sustainable way? Peter Head: I think by 2050 we can be well on the way to that point. But the only way that can happen is developing countries have to realize that their future lies in going from the agricultural to the ecological age and to really reinvent the way they use materials and they way we sell products and use the riches of those places. And the high income countries around the world have to start this retro-fitting process to make the way they live on the planet much, much less resource consuming. I think if those two things happen together, and they are actually complimentary in many ways, then we can get there, and as I said I think there is a commercial business case and an economic case that is going in that direction. CNN: There is lot of selling of these ideas to do, isn't there? Peter Head: There is a lot of selling, but one of the exciting things is everywhere I go in the world now there are elements of this happening. One can see an acceleration, even small, little steps, but actually everything is moving in this general direction. So there are lots of examples, a lot of demonstrators, a lot of things you can go and see to make you realize it works and that's very encouraging. CNN: Is it too late to create an environment in which we can live sustainable lives? Peter Head: Well, there are a lot of problems associated with this. I mean, a lot of people are now aware of climate change and the issues of emissions into the atmosphere. But of course we also got the problem of food supply, we got the problems of resource management of all kinds and therefore each of those has slightly different parameters as to whether it's too late or not. Overall, my view is that it's not too late if we make changes really quickly.","Peter Head, director of Arup, has leading role in building China's first eco-city .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, ""Antichrist"" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter. Danish auteur Lars von Trier has been making films that shock, provoke and impress for over 40 years. Filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at Cannes and the two-hander starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception. But it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many. Von Trier was labeled a woman-hater for the wince-inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead Charlotte Gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a DIY clitoridectomy right to camera. An Ecumenical Jury that normally hands out a prize at Cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award ""Antichrist"" an ""anti-prize"" for being ""the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world."" ""Lars von Trier, we get it,"" wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times. ""You really, really don't like women."" Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: ""I mostly see myself as the female character,"" the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes. Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . The director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness. Indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von Trier, who is famously multi-phobic, would be able to make another film. In the winter of 2006, he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital, the aftermath of which left him ""like a blank sheet of paper,"" he told Danish paper Politiken at the time. Today, if not fully recovered -- the most terrifying thing he can think of is still ""myself"" -- he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues. Despite, or perhaps because of, what he describes as his ""sensitive"" nature, von Trier is one of today's great contemporary European auteurs, considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of Scandinavian filmmaking. ""I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it,"" said von Trier. ""The good side is that you can sometimes achieve something creatively.

""I had heard stories about him as a director ... maybe he's cruel and vicious."" But she now describes him as her ""guide"" and ""the greatest director I've ever worked with."" Fueled by his unconventional approach and upbringing, the mythology surrounding von Trier looms large over everything he touches. Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying. Each visit to Cannes involves a five-day road trip from Denmark to the French Riviera by camper van. He has an undeniable egotistical streak: this year at Cannes, he declared, ""I am the best filmmaker in the world,"" and in 1991, when displeased that Cannes jury president Roman Polanski had only awarded ""Europa"" the runner-up Grand Prix prize, he called him a ""dwarf."" He also seems to actively court controversy: 1998 Palme D'Or contender ""Dogme #2: The Idiots"" grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non-simulated sex on screen, and for von Trier's typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude. But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates. He says he finds it difficult to know how to satisfy the needs of others with his films and so works only for himself. ""I feel very strongly for satisfying, maybe not my own needs, but my own idea of the film and the images that come from within,"" he told CNN.

"(HLNtv.com) -- A Bristol County, Massachusetts, grand jury indicted former NFL player Aaron Hernandez on a first-degree murder charge and five weapons charges Thursday. Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, is charged in connection with the slaying of his friend, Odin Lloyd, 27. Prosecutors say Hernandez, 23, orchestrated Lloyd's shooting death. Hernandez and two other men allegedly picked Lloyd up on the morning of June 17; his body was found later that day in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. Hernandez appeared in court Thursday afternoon to hear the court announce the indictment. He was handcuffed and wearing a white collared shirt under a dark sports coat. As he sat down, Hernandez mouthed, ""I love you"" to a family member sitting in the gallery. Hernandez showed no emotion during the brief hearing. Police: Gun found in car linked to double killing, Hernandez . ""There's an incredible rush to judgment in this case,"" defense attorney Michael Fee told reporters outside the courthouse. Fee said he was pleased with the indictment because it gives his client ""a path to trial,"" and that a jury will find Hernandez ""innocent."" The former football star has been in police custody since he was arrested on June 26. Prior to the indictment, Hernandez pleaded not guilty. The indictment circumvented the need for the scheduled probable cause hearing that was originally scheduled for Thursday afternoon. Upon reviewing the case, a grand jury determined that prosecutors had enough evidence to constitute probable cause, or that the charges are reasonable based on the facts presented. The case against Hernandez is now one step closer to trial. Hernandez investigation turns to finacee's actions . The judge scheduled a hearing for next Friday to deal with two outstanding defense motions. The next step in Hernandez's case is his arraignment, during which he'll be informed of the crimes he is charged with. He also will have the opportunity to enter a formal plea with the court. No date has been set for Hernandez's arraignment. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted. He was charged with being accessory after the fact to murder. The grand jury has also indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. She's charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury, despite being granted immunity. Her attorney, Peter Parker, declined to comment. The Hernandez case has thrust prosecutors into the national spotlight. Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter downplayed any additional pressure. ""My career ... will be defined more by this case than all of the other things we've done. So to that extent there is added pressure, but I can't say in any way that we shirk from it. I think we welcomed it,"" Sutter told CNN. CNN's Lawrence Crook III contributed to this report.","Former NFL player is charged with first-degree murder, weapons charges .

"(CNN) -- As things have been going for Ukraine lately, Wednesday could easily go down as the best day yet for the new government of Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Topped by a high-profile Oval Office visit, it was a welcome distraction from a string of humiliations and provocations from Russia -- not least of which was the creeping occupation of the Crimea. If Yatsenyuk left Washington dissatisfied, he clearly wasn't showing it. The visit brought promises of $1 billion of desperately needed loan guarantees, an immediate surge in U.S. bilateral assistance that ranges from a doubling of support for the May 25 presidential elections to increased academic scholarships and even Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) for the Ukrainian military. Read more: Senate committee approves Ukraine aid package, Russia sanctions . Washington's overtures came as the G7 group of nations and the European Union rallied to throw additional support to a beleaguered Ukraine. Aside from strong talk of more sanctions for Russia -- should a referendum branded illegal by the West and Ukraine go ahead this weekend -- there were gifts of $685-million in trade benefits from Brussels and hints of an accelerated signing of an EU Association Agreement after presidential elections. Yet, despite all that, Yatsenyuk, one of the most polished and articulate Ukrainian politicians of this generation, hinted that his new government is going to have to deal with autonomy demands -- both present and future - from pro-Russian regions. ""We need to start a nationwide dialogue on the autonomy of Crimea,"" Yatsenyuk said at an Atlantic Council speech in Washington, D.C.. But he added that there are no legal grounds for Sunday's referendum -- a referendum that he and the West see as a rogue act backed by pro-Russian thugs and a show of brute and unprovoked military force. ""This is an illegitimate, unconstitutional referendum,"" Yatsenyuk said, echoing the talking points heard from the corridors of power in London, Brussels and Berlin. To his credit, Yatsenyuk and Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov have, so far, come across as a national unity government of peace and reconciliation. As Yatsenyuk correctly noted, Kiev has resisted Russian provocations and has made real conciliatory gestures to the Russian majority in the east and south - for example not backing legislation limiting the use of the Russian language at the administrative-regional level. To say that the stakes are high is almost an understatement. With Russian military might also amassing on Ukraine's eastern borders there was talk of the region even descending into a quagmire equal to that of ""another Afghanistan."" History of Western promises . While the arrival of an unprecedented tide of Western support and rhetorical embrace has been received with glee in Ukraine, it is undeniable that the history of Western promises has been less than stellar. As one Diaspora member pointed out Wednesday, not one international pledging conference for Chernobyl has ever met its goal. Curious too that the West is acting only now, with Ukraine on the precipice and when Western experts have been warning for years that Putin has long since been developing separatist scenarios. And if the sentiments of ordinary Ukrainians in the Maidan Square are anything to go by, Western assistance has come too late. ""Any moment Putin could land a helicopter in here and destroy us,"" said a pensioner from Dnipropetrovsk who was tending his tent Friday morning on the fringes of Maidan. Said another Maidan protester from western Ukraine: ""What was promised doesn't make any difference to me. They've promised in the past and then what?"" The precedent being set by the holding of a Crimea referendum is surely the main reason for the panic from the White House to Westminster. Brazen land grab . In his Atlantic Council discussion, Yatsenyuk was asked how confident he was of receiving the Western support being promised to him. Yatsenyuk said the issue was one of global security. He cited the 1994 Budapest Memorandum -- inked by the U.S., UK, Ukraine and Russia -- which guaranteed Ukraine's territorial integrity in return for the dismantling of its massive Soviet-era nuclear arsenal. ""We executed this memorandum,"" he said. ""And today we ask for the protection. If we don't get this protection, tell me the way how the world is to reinforce or ask another countries to stop their nuclear programs."" Of course there are other international legal provisions which should prevent Russia from grabbing Ukrainian territory; these include the provisions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) treaty and the U.N. Charter. But, as with the Budapest Memorandum, there aren't any clear enforcement mechanisms. International legal experts say they are hardly surprised by the Kremlin's brazen land grab, pointing to what seems a long-term policy of strategic separatism in the Black Sea region. Lada Roslycky, a past fellow of the Harvard Black Sea Security Program, said that aside from violating national and international laws, the Crimea referendum is being held under the duress of Russian military occupation. ""The referendum, if recognized, will deface non-proliferation and support illegal Russian Federation operations elsewhere,"" says Roslycky. Putin says Russia's actions fall within the scope of the 1997 Friendship Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. But with Russia apparently in operational control of the Crimea it's absurd to claim Ukraine's territorial integrity has been respected. At the end of the day, it will be the actions of greater powers that will determine whether Putin blinks over his Crimea strategy. With talk of suspending Russia's membership of the G8 and even of barring its participation in the World Cup, the Kremlin could decide to back down. But with Putin being quoted as saying such nonsense as Ukraine did not leave the former Soviet Union in a legal way, it is anyone's guess what might happen next. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Bociurkiw.","Ukraine's interim PM Arseniy Yatsenyuk visited Washington and the White House this week .

"(CNN) -- Its claim to fame has been contested, it's been hit by tragedy and it's been photographed by tourists from around the world. But locals still hold firm to their conviction that Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, holds the Guinness World Record for being the steepest street in the world, with a 38% grade at its steepest section. Various sources list Canton Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the steepest. The Guinness World Records website lists no record for world's steepest street, and mentions neither Baldwin Street nor Canton Avenue. Tilted disputes aside, here's what life's like at a slant. Twenty-five thousand balls of chocolate are rolled down the street each year . Every July, thousands of giant Jaffa candies are rolled down the 350-meter-long street in Dunedin's annual Cadbury Jaffa Race. Each candy is numbered and participants can buy a corresponding ticket and hope their Jaffa will be the winner. All proceeds go to charity, and participants can wait at the bottom and get free candy. You may feel guilty having your mail delivered . Kevin Hanifin has been delivering mail on Baldwin Street for the past two years. He says he's in better shape thanks to the route, and that the adjacent streets are no cakewalk, either, since they're almost as steep. It's always an entertaining walk, he says, since visitors often stop and talk to him. While Hanifin prefers to deliver the mail starting at the top of the hill, 17-year-old paperboy Hamish Lilly says going down is actually harder than going up. There's no exercise like going home . Baldwin Street resident Dave Kernahan, 63, started a weight-loss program after he lost his job and began gaining weight 15 years ago. His program? Just going up and down his street. He runs up and down the street 30 times almost every day -- a total of more than 10 kilometers. His personal best is 105 times in one day. Tourists come from around the world; residents are over it . When deciding to move to Baldwin Street, Sue Marshall says she wasn't concerned about the grade, but rather the number of tourists who'd be passing her home each day. ""I love meeting people -- you can't really go out of the front gate without meeting someone from across the world,"" says Marshall. She figures her husband has already shown up in more than 100 tourist photos while working in their garden, but says she'd be doing the same thing if she were visiting. Meanwhile, she's only been to the top of her street once and her husband hasn't made it up yet. There are a few incentives to get to the top . Last year, Dunedin artist Daniel Mead painted a mural at the top of the street. He says one of the hardest parts about painting it was driving up the hill every day. ""It may have been a better idea to just walk as I think it ruined my car,"" he says. There's a rumor that certain residents on Baldwin Street will offer visitors a certificate of completion if they can make the trek. Some bright soul also installed a drinking fountain.

"(CNN) -- Climate skeptics are indicative of societies in decay. So said Mohamed Nasheed, president of the Maldives. Speaking at CNN's Earth's Frontiers debate in Seoul, Nasheed said he was looking for a greater urgency from countries and business across the world in dealing with the problems caused by climate change. Rather than a slow decay, Nasheed's own nation is faced with a rapid extinction caused by a rise in sea-levels, according to many climate scientists. Joined at the debate by filmmaker and environmentalist James Cameron, Puma's CEO Jochen Zeitz, and Changhua Wu of The Climate Group, Nasheed noted what was at stake when talking about future energy sources. ""I think it's going to be very difficult for the Maldives to survive if business goes as usual,"" he said. ""I think it's time especially for big emitter countries to find alternatives and move forward. If not, it's not just going to be the Maldives, it's going to be all of us."" Instead of revisiting the divisions that flared between countries at the Copenhagen climate summit in December, Nasheed struck a more inclusive tone on how countries can work together to create a carbon-neutral future. ""I don't think this is an issue of developed and developing countries. Given the opportunities, (developing countries) would have done the same. ""But of course industrialized countries have more capabilities and more means, and there are people who are in trouble. If they want to lend a hand, that's the decent thing to do."" Zeitz took a stand for businesses taking the initiative in promoting renewable energy by saying that business cannot wait for government action. ""We can't wait for the perfect solutions. It's trial and error,"" he said. Puma has a carbon neutral HQ in California and two of its factories operate off-grid. Zeitz said he was committed to fostering responsible businesses. ""If you plan your business out for the long run, you have to plan with renewable energies and eliminate carbon footprints. Business ultimately has caused a lot of the environmental degradation we see around the world, so business is there to also fix it,"" he said. A number of solutions that balance energy production and environmental protection exist, but the panel took different stands over a particular hydroelectric damn project in the Brazilian state of Para. Cameron had recently visited the region to campaign against the dam, but as a a head of state immediately threatened by rising sea-levels, Nasheed took a different view. ""Reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is the priority right now,"" he said. ""If Brazil does that through damming their rivers, I would say, go ahead and do it. I think a number of countries are unable to understand the mathematics of the whole issue. If we cannot become carbon-neutral by mid-century, then we won't be around here. It's as simple as that."" Zeitz disagreed: ""You have to look at carbon holistically. We live in a connected world where conservation, community, culture all have to play together,"" he said. Wu touched upon China's position as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases as well as its biggest investor in renewable energy projects. ""No matter how much China invests today, it's not just a one country issue. More importantly we need to work together in order to deal with the core issue,"" she said. Ultimately that core issue for Cameron was getting a greater consensus that climate change itself was a serious, global problem. ""The fundamental problem out there is how many people (don't) actually believe there's a problem,"" he said. ""The most powerful force on the planet right now is the ability of individuals to communicate with each other. I believe in the power of ideas. People can certainly make a difference in the way they live, if they're motivated. The important thing is to get the ideas out there."" What do you think?

"Barcelona (CNN) -- BlackBerry CEO John Chen says the company will focus on attracting and keeping business customers as he implements his strategy to reverse its decline. Speaking in Barcelona, where he unveiled the company's new Z3 and Q20 smartphones on Tuesday, Chen said: ""My turnaround strategy relies on the enterprise customer for the next one to two years. ""In the meantime I actually want to make sure that we still have a very keen eye on the consumer space. ""By that time I hope if all my plans work -- a big if -- we will be a much more financially solid company, at which point in time you will see us being more aggressive into the other space."" The Z3 and Q20 will be the first products to emerge from BlackBerry's partnership with electronics maker Foxconn. Under the five-year agreement, Foxconn will develop and manufacture certain BlackBerry handsets, while the company focuses on software and its BlackBerry Messsaging service, BBM. Although they unveiled the Q20 smartphone, which combines a physical keyboard with a 3.5-inch touchscreen, the company didn't show a prototype in Barcelona. Speaking about the production of the Z3, Chen said: ""It's the first collaboration between us and Foxconn. I don't think anybody has been able to put a phone together at this level this quickly and it will get into the hands of our consumers in exactly four months. ""The deal was signed between us and Foxconn on December 12, 2013, and we will see it in April."" BBM has been a talking point at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, following Facebook's blockbuster acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp last week for $19 billion. BBM boasts around 85 million monthly active users, compared with more than 450 million for WhatsApp. Asked if he would consider selling off BBM, Chen said: ""I run a public company. Anything that's good for our shareholder I have to entertain. Having said that, BBM is a huge part of our strategy going forwards. ""There are a lot more features and functionality that will be built up on it. It's an integral part of what value do we add to the enterprise [customer] and why should they continue with us."" BlackBerry unveiled a new version of its messaging service Tuesday called BBM Protected, with a focus on increased security for business clients. He said raising confidence inside and outside the company is the biggest challenge he faces in the next 12 months. ""I need to make sure the employee is confident. I'm making a lot of changes which are a little more of a departure from the norms of the past. ""I've been in the business long enough to know this is really about 'show me.' At the end of the day they want to see that we can make progress as a company both in product and financially. Until I do that, all these things are interesting, relevant, capture a lot of attention, but the real potential cannot be realized until we make money and then the company starts believing in itself.""

"(CNN) -- Much has been said about Kim Kardashian in the weeks leading up to her wedding, and now the reality star is speaking for herself. The 33-year-old opened up Wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to racism. For starters, she posted May 7, she and fiance Kanye West aren't married yet, despite speculation earlier in the week that the two had secured a marriage license. They're also not going to film their upcoming nuptials for E!'s ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" ""You will see everything leading up til and after!"" Kardashian tweeted. ""As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos."" There's also been chatter about who will and won't be coming to the Kardashian-West wedding -- People magazine has indicated that the Kardashian family will be there, but not West's pals Jay Z and Beyonce -- while others have gossiped about the details of Kardashian's wedding dress. Yet according to the reality star, her fans shouldn't believe a word ""unless you hear it from us."" ""No guest list has been released. Seeing fake ones,"" she tweeted. ""Especially not 1600 people invited like I just read. (The wedding is) VERY small & intimate."" And for that matter, she's seen ""fake wedding dress pics of me. No one has seen my dress! Those photos are old or Photoshopped."" After Kardashian got those wedding-related thoughts off her chest, she turned to a more serious matter: how being a mother of a mixed-race child has affected her understanding of racism. In a blog post titled ""On My Mind,"" Kardashian spoke about how welcoming daughter North with West last June is like getting ""to see the world for the first time again, but through someone else's eyes."" ""It's amazing how one little person and the love I have for her has brought new meaning to every moment. What once seemed so important, now feels insignificant,"" she writes. ""To be honest, before I had North, I never really gave racism or discrimination a lot of thought. It is obviously a topic that Kanye is passionate about, but I guess it was easier for me to believe that it was someone else's battle."" But with the arrival of her daughter, Kardashian says she's more aware ""of a side of life that isn't always so pretty."" ""I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being, to do what I can to make sure that not only my child, but all children, don't have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin, or their gender, or their sexual orientation,"" Kardashian concluded.

"(CNN) -- Google must remove the inflammatory film ""The Innocence of Muslims"" from YouTube.com, a federal appeals court ordered Wednesday. The film had been connected to violent demonstrations in several countries . The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court's earlier denial of an injunction that would require taking the film down. Wednesday's order resulted from a lawsuit filed by Cindy Lee Garcia, one of the actresses in the film, against YouTube, its parent company Google, and the producer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, among others. ""Garcia was duped into providing an artistic performance that was used in a way she never could have foreseen. Her unwitting and unwilling inclusion in 'Innocence of Muslims' led to serious threats against her life,"" 9th Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote in his opinion. Kozinski wrote that Garcia had been cast in a minor role in a film whose working title was ""Desert Warrior,"" and received about $500 for three and a half days of filming. But ""Desert Warrior"" never materialized; instead, the scene she acted in was used in ""Innocence of Muslims."" ""Garcia first saw 'Innocence of Muslims' after it was uploaded to YouTube and she discovered that her brief performance had been partially dubbed over so that she appeared to be asking, 'Is your Mohammed a child molester?' "" Kozinski wrote. Garcia's lawsuit also alleged that the copyright of her performance had been infringed. Google argued ""that Garcia didn't make a protectable contribution to the film"" since Nakoula -- whose aliases include Mark Basseley Youssef, a name cited in the lawsuit -- wrote the dialogue that Garcia spoke, managed the production and dubbed over part of the scene, Kozinski wrote. Google sent the following statement to CNN Wednesday: ""Today the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an actress in the Innocence of Muslims trailer may have a copyright claim over her five-second appearance in the video. As a result the court ordered Google to remove the video from our services. We strongly disagree with this ruling and will fight it."" The film portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. Islam categorically forbids any depictions of Mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the Muslim world. The movie, backed by hardcore anti-Islam groups in the United States, is a low-budget project that was ignored in the United States when trailers were posted on YouTube in July 2012. But after Egyptian television aired certain segments, violent protests erupted in several Middle Eastern and Northern African nations, and in Muslim populations elsewhere in the world. The anger faded, however, particularly after filmmaker Nakoula's arrest on September 27, 2012. Although the film was not the direct reason for his incarceration, authorities found that his actions producing ""The Innocence of Muslims"" violated the terms of his probation for a 2010 bank fraud conviction. He was released from prison in May 2013. Garcia had begun receiving death threats after an Egyptian cleric called for everyone involved with the film to be killed, Kozinski wrote. ""While answering a casting call for a low-budget amateur film doesn't often lead to stardom, it also rarely turns an aspiring actress into the subject of a fatwa,"" Kozinski wrote. CNN's Stella Chan, Stan Wilson, Carey Bodenheimer and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Actress in ""The Innocence of Muslims"" had sued Google, filmmaker .

"(CNN) -- A group of Marines trained in crisis-rapid response are moving to a base in southern Italy due to concerns over continuing unrest in northern Africa, the Pentagon said Wednesday. ""We are doing this as a contingency because we believe the security situation in North Africa is deteriorating to a point where there could be threats,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren told reporters. ""They will be there until we are satisfied that there is a little bit less unrest in the region."" Just under 200 Marines from the Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response unit based in Moron, Spain, were moved to the Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily this week at the request of the State Department, according to Defense officials. ""This is part of our new normal,"" Warren said, ""where we have added flexibility to combatant commanders and given them the ability to move forces around and have ready forces available in case of regional contingencies."" In addition to the Marines, there were two KC-130s and four MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft that were also part of the forward deployment to Signoella. While the focus of the mission is to be ready to react to the current threat environment emanating from northern Africa, the force would be ready to deploy to nearby Yemen where Yemeni forces are trying to dismantle the most lethal of al Qaeda's affiliate groups. ""The focus is unquestionably the protection of embassies no question about it, but it's a contingency force,"" Warren told reporters. ""These are United States Marines capable of conducting any mission given to them."" Two American personnel assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, killed two armed militants last month who had attempted to kidnap them CNN reported earlier this week. There was also considerable criticism over the lack of any military rapid response leveled at the Obama administration following the September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed. The Pentagon says the move is unrelated to the operation underway in Nigeria to rescue more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram. Officials continue to maintain there is no intention to put American forces inside Nigeria for the purposes of a rescue effort. The Marines deployed to Sicily are part of an approximate force of 800 based in Moron, and trained to mobilize quickly in response to a variety of crises in the region. The unit assisted in the evacuation of U.S. embassy personnel in South Sudan last year as the security situation in the country deteriorated.","Just under 200 Marines head to base in southern Italy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sheriff's investigators Thursday asked prosecutors to charge Justin Bieber with felony vandalism in his alleged egging of a neighbor's home. ""No decision will be made this week,"" Los Angeles County District Attorney spokesman Ricardo Santiago told CNN. Detectives presented their findings to a prosecutor who must decide whether Bieber, 19, will be charged with vandalism and if the charge is a misdemeanor or a felony, Santiago said. The neighbor accused Bieber of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9. Investigators pressed for a more serious felony charge because the attack allegedly caused an estimated $20,000 in damage. If it were to happen, a misdemeanor charge would be easier for the singer to deal with, since he would not have to personally appear in court. His lawyer could handle the case without his presence.

"(CNN) -- As warring sides prepared to hold their first face-to-face talks to end weeks of ethnic fighting in the world's newest country, clashes flared around a key town Sunday. Nhial Majak Nhial, the mayor of Bor, told CNN that rebel troops had been driven away from his town, which has exchanged hands several times during three weeks of violence that has killed hundreds and forced about 200,000 people from their homes. Defense Minister Kuol Manyang said government forces tried to take back the disputed town but were forced to retreat to a military base eight miles away after rebels ambushed them. Brig. Gen. Abraham Jongroor was killed and several officers were wounded when rebels attacked, the defense minister said. Helicopters airlifted dozens of injured government troops to a military hospital in Juba, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) away. Bor, capital of the oil-rich Jonglei state, has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the violence, as military forces have battled the rebel fighters. ""Their technique of fighting is numbers -- they are using numbers against capable and well-trained government troops,"" Nhial said. ""Many of their men, some even children, have died."" President Salva Kiir and the rebels' leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, have sent delegations to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, for talks on a possible ceasefire.

While neither Kiir nor Machar are in Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, group representatives have gathered and are talking amongst themselves on the sidelines, Maalim said. ""A lot of discussing and discussions going on for sure... we are ready to start face-to-face anytime, but we have to wait on the groups to be ready,"" he said. The talks will focus on the cessation of hostilities and negative propaganda, the granting of access to monitors and to humanitarian aid workers, and the question of detainees, Maalim said on Saturday. The proxy talks have been attended by special envoys to IGAD; the heads of negotiating teams of the two South Sudanese parties; Maalim; and the ministers of foreign affairs of Ethiopia and Kenya. No breakthrough has come yet despite pressure on Kiir and Machar from African and Western powers to end the conflict. So far, the mediators met with representatives of both delegations to try to pin down the issues and set out a framework for the talks. Speaking during a visit to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the negotiations needed to be ""serious."" ""They cannot be a delay gimmick in order to continue the fighting and try to find advantage on the ground at the expense of the people of South Sudan,"" he said. ""We will work to apply international pressure to any elements that attempt to use force to seize power. That is not acceptable."" Ethnic tensions . But as the two sides' teams negotiate, fighting has continued in their country. So far the violence has claimed more than 1,000 lives and displaced about 200,000 others. Humanitarian agencies have warned that the estimated 200,000 who have fled to makeshift camps are facing dire conditions, with many lacking clean water and sanitation in makeshift camps. The fighting began in Juba on December 15 but quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings soon emerging. Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Although the conflict began as a political power struggle, it has taken on an ethnic dimension and includes evidence of ethnically targeted killings, according to the U.N. mission in South Sudan. Some observers have said both sides may want to gain the upper hand militarily before beginning to discuss a possible cease-fire. South Sudan is the world's youngest nation, having seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Even during Tokyo's notoriously hectic rush hour, dozens of commuters stopped to push a 32-ton train car out of the way. A woman trying to get off a train in Saitama, north of Tokyo, fell in a gap between the train and the platform Monday morning, said Takashi Tsukahara, a spokesman for the train operator JR East. About 40 passengers and JR staff rushed to push the train off the woman. Tsukahara said a train carriage typically weighs about 30,000 kilograms, but is able to sway a bit side to side to absorb the train's movements. The commuters pushed the train just enough to free the woman. A loud cheer erupted as the woman was pulled up. The woman, in her 30s, was not seriously injured. Just eight minutes later, the train took off again.","A woman fell in a gap between a commuter train and platform near Tokyo .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- Vote for me or burn in hell. I can't imagine someone running for office saying that. And yet four candidates -- Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum -- have said they had a sense that God was leading them to run. How far can we be from ""vote for me or burn in hell"" when it seems we're already comfortable with ""vote for me, I've been called by God""? There was a time when if a candidate wanted to inject faith into a campaign he or she would be photographed going to church or shaking the Rev. Billy Graham's hand. Now it seems many GOP campaigns aren't complete without claiming God's seal of approval, which suggests the other candidates may be running without it. Such a sentiment is an ideological piÃ±ata for comedians like Bill Maher and Jon Stewart, but for conservatives trying to secure the GOP nomination, it's a highly manipulative campaign tool. Consider the words of Rick Perry's wife, Anita. During a stop in South Carolina last week she said her husband was being brutalized by the media because of his faith and that while his GOP opponents are ""there for good reasons. And they may feel like God called them, too ... I truly feel like we are here for that purpose."" When Perry was asked about his wife's comments on ""Good Morning America,"" he said ""I think she's right in both cases. My understanding is that she said I'm the most conservative candidate in the race and, 'He's a Christian.'"" Cain was a guest on the Christian Broadcasting Network recently and recapped a conversation he said he had with God before entering the race. ""I felt like Moses when God said, 'I want you to go into Egypt and lead my people out.'"" Cain said. ""Moses resisted. I resisted. ... But you shouldn't question God."" Repeat: You shouldn't question God. OK, fine. But why aren't we questioning the candidates who make these kinds of statements the same way we would question whether God actually wanted a particular athlete to win a game? I do believe a person's faith is personal, but I'm not the one using it to get votes. Four candidates have claimed a level of divine intervention with their campaign, which either means the creator of heaven and Earth is hedging his bets or somebody's mistaken. When a candidate claims to have a plan to create jobs or turn our economy around, we expect thoughtful analysis, as we have seen with President Obama's jobs package and Cain's 9-9-9 plan. Why are we not demanding the same level of critical thinking with respect to these candidates? Is the media so afraid to appear to be attacking someone's faith that interviewers don't bother to ask follow-up questions? If I could trade places with Anderson Cooper, who is moderating Tuesday's debate, I would ask, ""Now which ones of you were really called by God and which ones are hearing voices in your head?"" then let them discuss among themselves. It seems like a fair line of questioning, especially when you consider Cain is telling a particular voting bloc that he is like Moses and Perry is telling the same voters that Cain and others misheard God. Why wouldn't conservative Christians want to hear this line of questioning, since they are the sheep who are potentially being targeted by deceptive, power-hungry wolves? Now I know it seems as if I'm picking on Republicans, but trust me, I'm equally disgusted by Democrats who use religion to win elections. I still recoil in horror at the memory of then Sen. Hillary Clinton, on the eve of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in 2008, standing in front of a Baptist church in Harlem, trying to out-black preach then Sen. Barack Obama, who was visiting Ebenezer Church in Atlanta the same day. And at both locations, the crowd was just eating it up, like extras in a Tyler Perry movie. When people ask why I'm not a Democrat, this is one of the reasons I give. But not even in the heat of those moments did I hear them say they were called by God to run. Not because Democrats are not religious, but because they seem to know where the line is. This current GOP candidates seem to have no idea that there is a line, let alone its location. It is beginning to feel like if we don't start pushing back soon, in the next election we're going to see campaign slogans like, ""Vote for me or God won't bless America."" ""Vote for me, or you'll be left behind."" ""Vote for me... Jesus did."" On August 4, 2010, just before 10:30 p.m., former longtime Rep. Pete Hoekstra stood in front of a group of supporters in a small city in Michigan to deliver a concession speech. The Republican had just lost his bid to be governor, a job he said he left Congress to pursue because of ""God's plan."" ""God's got something better in mind for us,"" he said, and in January he finished his term in the House. Today Hoekstra is back in Michigan. Running for Congress. No word yet if God told him to do so or if this is the ""something better"" the Almighty had in mind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Four GOP candidates say they felt called to run .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- An investigation continued Monday into a helicopter crash that killed five people, including prominent Mexican businessman Moises Saba Masri, the state-run Notimex news agency said. The Sunday night crash also killed Saba's wife, their son, their son's wife and the pilot, said Mexican President Felipe Calderon, in an official statement of condolence. Fog and other inclement weather may have played a role in the accident, which occurred at 8:35 p.m., said Mexico City's civil protection secretary, Elias Moreno Brizuela. The helicopter's tail hit a house and its blades struck a tree, Moreno Brizuela said at a news conference monitored by Notimex. There were no injuries on the ground. The helicopter fell into a ravine that is about 90 feet (30 meters) deep, hindering recovery efforts, Moreno Brizuela said. Saba Masri was one of Mexico's wealthiest citizens, said to be worth billions of dollars. He was in the telecommunications business, owned construction and textile companies, was an investor in the TV Azteca network and owned two hotels in Acapulco, published reports said Monday. He was planning to build a 52-story mixed-use building in Mexico City this year.","Helicopter crashed Sunday night into deep ravine, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Graeme Smith has led South Africa to the top of the rankings, but Monday he made the shock announcement he would quit international cricket at the completion of their current Test match against Australia in Cape Town. The 33-year-old Smith has captained South Africa in 108 Test matches and played 347 games for his country in all forms of the game, scoring over 17,000 runs from the opener position. South Africa are currently No.1 rated in Test cricket, but are facing a series defeat to resurgent Australia, with the series tied at 1-1 going into the game at Newlands. Smith was dismissed for just five runs on the third day with Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris bowling Australia into a winning position. At the end of the day's play he broke the news to his teammates. ""This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make in my life,"" said Smith. ""It's a decision that I have been considering since my ankle surgery in April last year. ""I have a young family to consider, and I felt that retiring at Newlands would be the best way to end it because I have called this place home since I was 18 years old."" South Africa are having to cope without record run scorer Jacques Kallis, who quit Tests earlier this year although he will carry on playing in one-day internationals. A stunned Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Haroon Lorgat praised Smith's contribution. ""Although Graeme's decision to retire from all forms of international cricket comes as a surprise to all of us, we must respect him for deciding to call time,"" he said. ""Knowing him as well as I do, having been instrumental as a selector in appointing him as a young captain, he would not have taken this decision lightly or without a great deal of thought. ""He has captained the Proteas for more than a decade and will draw a lot more satisfaction from the fact that he leaves our Test team at the top of the world and in such good health rather than from all the personal records he has achieved as the longest-serving captain the game has seen in the demanding Test format."" Smith, who is set to continue playing cricket with English county side Surrey this summer, said he would reflect on his career with pride. ""I have always been someone who has left everything out there on the field for my team and for my country. I'm extremely honored and proud to have had the privilege to lead so many wonderful players. ""I thank and honor the players who I have played with and those who have supported me and helped me to be the person and captain I am today."" Smith will get one more chance to add to his tally with the bat with an uphill struggle to salvage a draw. Australia lead by 234 runs at the end of the third day with 98 overs set to be bowled on each of the final two days after bad weather on the second day. He is likely to receive a warm welcome as he makes his international farewell, looking to add to his 9,262 Test runs at an average of nearly 49 runs per innings. Smith has also played 197 ODIs, averaging almost 38, and 33 Twenty20 Internationals. He is the latest leading figure in world cricket to announce their retirement, with Indian maestro Sachin Tendulkar quitting at the end of last year and Kallis calling it a day before the series against Australia.","South Africa captain Graeme Smith to retire from international cricket .

"(CNN) -- Rapper and reality TV star Flavor Flav pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence charges in Las Vegas Monday. The plea deal allows the Public Enemy hype man to avoid a trial on felony charges, which could have sent him to prison for several years. Instead, Flav -- real name William Jonathan Drayton Jr. -- must stay out of trouble during a year of probation and attend 12 domestic counseling sessions with his longtime girlfriend's teenage son. He was arrested after an argument involving a kitchen knife in his Las Vegas home in October 2012. Flav, 55, was initially charged with child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and battery domestic violence. Las Vegas prosecutors agreed to reduce the charges to two misdemeanors counts, including attempted battery with substantial bodily harm and battery constituting domestic violence, according to Tess Driver, spokeswoman for the Clark County, Nevada, district attorney. Along with the year of probation and counseling requirement, he was given credit for the time he served in jail after he was arrested and before he was released on bond, Driver said. Although he gained fame with the groundbreaking rap group Public Enemy starting in the late 1980s, Flav, with his collection of clock necklaces, became a reality TV star over the last decade. He began as a cast member of VH1's ""Surreal Life"" in 2004, which spawned ""Strange Love"" in 2005 and three seasons of ""Flavor of Love"" from 2006 to 2008.","Flavor Flav avoids a trial on felony charges with misdemeanor plea .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes I can still taste the cement dust. When the second tower collapsed, there was no place for me to hide. A tornado of black smoke drove me into the ground and filled my mouth with chewable soot. Splayed on the sidewalk, in total darkness, there was nothing I could do except wait and pray for the pelting to stop. A continuous shower of debris rained on my head, shoulders, and back. I couldn't tell when it would end because I couldn't even see my hands. Feeling around my surroundings with my fingers, I determined I wasn't trapped. Within minutes, a triage tag was forced around my neck and I was taken by ambulance to the hospital. Doctors in the ER cut off my clothes and stuck a tube down my throat to see if my lungs were burned. They weren't. I was mostly fine. One of the lucky ones. How do we make sense of a morning like that? Throughout the country, but certainly most palpably in New York, there was a stark before and after -- a period when routines were questioned and familiar steps felt shaky. We quit jobs that weren't fulfilling; couples got married or divorced; and a lot of us got pregnant, choosing to double down on love instead of loss. For me, at least at first, it meant doing my job. I was a producer at WNBC-TV, and as soon as a nurse agreed to give me a phone, I called the newsroom and reported from my gurney. Within a year, I had co-edited ""Covering Catastrophe: Broadcast Journalists Report September 11,"" donating the proceeds to 9/11-related charities. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum now has the rights to the book to support its programming and exhibitions in perpetuity. The museum opened Thursday for a dedication ceremony, attended by President Obama, rescuers and victims' relatives. The president called the museum a ""sacred place of healing and of hope."" Thirteen years after the attacks, the nation finally has a place to learn about the horrors of that day and honor the heroism. Journalists are often taught to distance themselves from the people and stories they cover. Don't get too close, we're warned; it will ruin your objectivity. The rules blurred on 9/11. We ran for our lives alongside everyone else. We were covered in the same ash and were choking on the same smoke. Anchors cried. Suddenly, the old journalism playbook seemed obsolete. It was OK to relate to the story and be part of it, too. This sea change in thinking has allowed journalists to reveal themselves in ways unprecedented in the history of journalism. And it's why I'm honored to have recorded my oral history for the museum and so deeply humbled that the triage tag that identified me as a survivor so many years ago will be on display. I will be able to see that triage tag on Monday, when collection donors are invited to visit the museum before it opens to the public on Wednesday. Museum officials tell me it's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story. I am not sure what my reaction will be in encountering this section of the exhibition, but no matter what, I'll be feeling a deep sense of kinship with all the other survivors in the room. We lived through an experience that bonds us forever. September 11 could have gone very differently for me. My hope is that by supporting the Memorial and Museum, I am, in some small way, honoring those who died and recognizing fully that I am still one of the lucky ones.","New National September 11 Museum opened for dedication ceremony on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Since the revolution in 1959 Cuba has been many things to many people, but the collapse of the Soviet Union meant few have seen the island state as a vision of the future. But that could be changing -- at least in one aspect. Cuba experienced a reordering of its food production in the early 1990's. A boom for organic foods, but problems persist. As worries grow in developed nations about a future without plentiful supplies of oil, the communist republic is proving to be an increasingly popular example of how to cope when the spigots run dry, for the simple reason: they've already been there. With the loss of supplies from oil-rich Russia in 1991, and a U.S. embargo preventing imports from elsewhere, Cuba was plunged into a severe recession in the early 1990's, referred to as ""the Special Period."" Suddenly society was faced with dramatically reduced amounts of hydrocarbon energy, and the result was a fundamental reorganization of food production, leading to a boom in urban organic agriculture, which requires fewer inputs than conventional farming. Despite the increase in organic production, problems remain for Cuba's agricultural system and ability to feed itself with local produce. ""Some estimates of the amount of food imports in Cuba go as high as 80 percent of domestic consumption,"" says CNN's Havana Bureau Chief, Morgan Neill. ""This isn't to say that small scale organic farmers couldn't learn for isolated growers, but Cuba's overall agriculture is one of the government's biggest problems."" Cuba's organic example, however, has been a source for inspiration for many outside of the country, such as the UK-based Cuban Organic Solidarity Group (COSG). ""With the collapse of the Soviet Union Cuba was in a position where no-one thought it would survive -- they lost 80 percent of their trade overnight,"" says Wendy Emmett of COSG. ""As a result the priority given to food changed, and it was immediately seen as much more important."" All over Havana small-scale organic gardens were started on roof-tops, backyards and in empty parking lots, spreading rapidly to other cities and urban centers. Farmer's markets known as ""Kiosks"" sprang up providing city-dwellers with access to locally-grown fruit and vegetables, cutting the use of oil in transporting food in from the countryside. In the countryside, oxen and horses replaced tractors. Manual labor replaced machines. A huge program of land re-distribution was instigated. Many of the vast collective farms beloved by communist planners started to look inefficient, and so were broken up into units more manageable without fleets of tractors. The process is still ongoing. In February 2009 the Cuban authorities announced that 1,827 square miles of state land would be given to Cubans with agricultural experience or other citizens. But this change wasn't easy. Prior to the ""Special Period"" Cuba had been a heavy user of oil-based chemical fertilizers, and much of the land was heavily degraded, requiring years of careful manuring to restore fertility. However, despite the obstacles, they did it. ""I was there in 1992, which was one of the most difficult years, and certainly people were moaning a lot, but they worked together, they still kept the milk coming for the schoolchildren,"" says Emmett. ""Throughout it all they didn't close any hospitals, they didn't close any schools; they kept going against the odds. In many ways they show us what is possible, what a community can achieve when they work together; the power of co-operation."" A blue-print to cope with problems post-peak oil? Of course a powerful authoritarian state and strong central planning made such huge changes easier to implement; a similar process of development might be very different, and possibly lees successful, in the West. But as an increasing number of people believe we will soon face a major social and economic crisis as oil supplies dwindle over coming decades, many believe we have a lot to learn from the Cuban experience. ""The industrialized world can learn that its dependency on oil will eventually push it through similar experiences to that which Cuba had to face in the 1990's, and with similar outcomes,"" says Julia Wright, author of ""Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in an Era of Oil Scarcity: Lessons from Cuba."" ""We can also learn that if we do not have the necessary capacities in place, our food production system will be caught short, as was Cuba."" All over the world from New Zealand to the United Kingdom members of the Transition Town Movement, which aims to help communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil and climate change, hold regular screenings of the film, ""The Power of Community"", an upbeat documentary that explores the Cuban experience, alongside films about our oil addiction such as ""The End of Suburbia"" and ""A Crude Awakening."" ""Cuba inspires groups overseas wanting to develop alternative, more sustainable farming and food systems, partly based on the myth that has built up around Cuba being organic,"" says Wright. ""Organic farming in Cuba only operates in urban areas, not rural... [but] the Cuban organic movement and the people within it are highly dedicated to their work and will continue to influence and be influenced by the organic movement overseas."" The future is less clear. New allies are once again opening Cuba up to the outside world -- and providing fresh oil supplies. ""Hugo Chavez is supplying Cuba with increasing quantities of oil and agrochemicals, so Cuban agriculture -- and here I'm talking about rural farms which supply 95 percent of the nation's domestic food needs -- is becoming more industrialized, though it will not revert back to the extreme practices of the Soviet era,"" says Wright. ""Organic urban agriculture will continue and likely continue to expand out to peri-urban areas."" But whatever the years ahead bring, Wright believes the experience of the ""Special Period"" has left its mark on Cuban society. ""The crisis that Cuba suffered has made it a better place in certain aspects, as people had to become more resilient and self-sufficient and less wasteful,"" says Wright. ""Although Cubans would certainly say that their food shortages and lack of inputs has been a hardship.""","Cuba's economic hardship in early 1990's led to reorganization of agriculture .

Some see Cuba's experience as way to cope with problems of future oil crises ."
"(CNN) -- Every day the whereabouts of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remain a mystery, the search area grows, complicating rescue efforts. ""Crucial time is passing,"" David Gallo, with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. ""That search area -- that haystack -- is getting bigger and bigger and bigger."" Nearly three dozen aircraft and 40 ships from 10 countries have so far failed to find any sign of the aircraft, which took off from Kuala Lumpur shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday (noon Friday ET). The Boeing 777-200ER, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members, went missing while flying to Beijing. Gallo described what will happen once some debris from the aircraft is found, though he stressed there's still no evidence the plane hit the water. ""Once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the 'X marks the spot' on where the plane actually hit the water, because that would be the center of the haystack. ""And in that haystack you're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact, in the case of the flight data recorders, you're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle,"" he said. 4 scenarios . 'Not hopeless' Rescue officials have expanded the search area. ""What I'm seeing here is clearly they have no idea,"" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. ""They know roughly the area, but even there they are starting to scrabble around as to -- was it going in this direction? Had it turned round?"" The newly expanded search area encompasses a larger portion of the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and Vietnam, according to Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, director general of the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department. Quest described the search as ""extremely painstaking work,"" suggesting a grid would have been drawn over the ocean and that teams are combing the area, bit by bit. ""Let's not be fooled into thinking this isn't a vast swath of water. That area between Malaysia and Vietnam is still several hundred miles. That's an enormous amount of water,"" he said. Although the work is challenging, Quest is confident Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be found. ""It's not hopeless by any means. They will find it.,"" he said. ""They have to. They have to know what happened."" Mystery passengers ID'd . 'Still a mystery' Gallo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, speaks from experience. He helped lead the search for the recorders of Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. The Air France flight was en route from Rio De Janeiro to Paris when communications ended suddenly from the Airbus A330, another state-of-the-art aircraft. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean. It took even longer to find the cause of the disaster. In 2011, the aircraft's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles. ""In this case, I thought for sure -- in a highly-trafficked area where there's lots of air traffic, lots of ship traffic, not far from shore -- that for sure this would be a more rapid finding of some remnants of the plane -- but nothing,"" Gallo told CNN's Blitzer, comparing the Malaysia Airlines and Air France flights. Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet similarly spoke to Blitzer on Monday. ""We are looking over a -- now -- a very large search area in the Gulf of Thailand, and then yesterday, an area northwest of the Strait of Malacca. But as the hours go by, that area keeps getting bigger and bigger when you account for currents and the wind,"" he said, while aboard the USS Blue Ridge, which is assisting in the search. Marks continued: ""It's a very large search area, but still a mystery -- still a lot of question marks."" CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: ""They will find it ...

"(CNN) -- Clashes between protesters and police in the Omani industrial town of Sohar wounded about 10 people Sunday, state media reported Sunday. At least two protesters were killed, Oman TV editor Asma Rshid told CNN. ""The police shot them because they burned shops and cars in Sohar,"" Rshid said. Another source said it was rubber bullets that the police fired. A number of police had also reportedly been injured, but numbers were not confirmed. The protests started Saturday and were ongoing Sunday, said Zamzam al Rashdi, editor-in-chief of the state-run Oman News Agency. There were about 1,000 protesters in Sohar, calling for more jobs. The demonstration started peacefully before a couple of groups split off and started attacking a supermarket and a police station, and members from the Shura Council, al Rashdi said. One of the targeted buildings was the Walli House, where the governor who represents the sultan in Sohar lives, a witness told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Two weeks ago, South Sudan was best known as the youngest African country, created with much international fanfare in 2011. Today, it is possibly the next Rwanda. A flash-fire conflict threatening to escalate into full-blown civil war combines trademark elements of African tragedy -- resource wealth coveted by global powers, in this case oil, and longstanding political and ethnic divisions. Here's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation: . 1) First things first. Tell me about South Sudan. South Sudan is a landlocked country of more than 11 million people in central Africa, bordering Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. It gained independence from Sudan on July 9, 2011, making it the world's newest nation after decades of ethnic and political conflict between the Sudanese government in Khartoum and opposition elements in the South. Two years later, South Sudan remains one of Africa's most impoverished countries despite containing the majority of known Sudanese oil reserves. 2) Who is fighting whom? The South Sudanese government and military, dominated by the Dinka ethnic group of President Salva Kiir, is fighting rebels allied with former Vice President Riek Machar of the Nuer ethnic group. At stake for now is control of oil-rich regions responsible for more than 95% of the country's economy, and perhaps leadership of the country. Mass killings and other violence in the past two weeks have caused tens of thousands of people to seek shelter under protection from U.N. forces in Juba, the capital, and some other cities. More U.N. peacekeepers from Africa and perhaps elsewhere may be coming soon, and 150 U.S. Marines are on standby in Djibouti to assist if needed in evacuating American government and aid workers from the country. 3) Is this something new? Yes and no. While the sudden escalation of the conflict in recent days caught many by surprise, the causes were familiar. South Sudan's independence two years ago followed decades of rebellion by various ethnic and political groups against the Khartoum government in Sudan. Kiir and Machar were longtime rivals who had an uneasy relationship atop the government, with Machar making clear his presidential ambitions. The valued oil resources and history of ethnic divisions amounted to a recipe for political mayhem, noted Jon Temin, an Africa specialist at the United States Institute of Peace. ""It didn't start about oil,"" Temin told CNN on Tuesday, adding that the political rivalry at the top was ""no secret to anybody."" 4) What triggered the recent violence? Kiir fired his Cabinet, including Machar, in July in a shuffle considered ""not uncommon"" for such a fledgling African nation, Temin said. While the move caused concern, a relatively calm aftermath bolstered hopes of continued stability. However, that unraveled in mid-December with gunfire between security forces loyal to Kiir and Machar. It remains unclear who fired the first shot, according to Temin. Kiir accused forces backing Machar of launching a coup attempt, and retribution attacks erupted with top allies of Machar detained. Machar has denied any coup attempt occurred. ""It has been surprising in how quickly it spread,"" Temin said. 5) Where do things stand? The situation is both dire and uncertain. Consider this grim report Tuesday from Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who said an official saw more than 30 bodies in two mass graves and that the global body was trying to verify the existence of others. ""It is very difficult, and there are reports that some bodies may have already been burned,"" Shamdasani added. The United Nations said fighting had spread to five of South Sudan's 10 states, and that it had credible reports civilians were being attacked and killed based on their ethnicity. Meanwhile, U.N. officials struggled to make accommodations for some 45,000 people crowding its compounds seeking shelter from the violence. Nearly as many people were seeking shelter elsewhere. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to increase the 6,800-strong U.N. force in South Sudan by another 5,500 troops to try to ensure the safety of the displaced, a role that peacekeepers failed to fulfill in the Rwanda genocide of 1994 that killed 800,000 people. ""Even with additional capabilities, we will not be able to protect every civilian in need in South Sudan,"" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned after the vote, adding that ""there is no military solution to this conflict."" On Monday, Ban said in a message to the people of South Sudan that ""the U.N. stood with you on your road to independence,"" and that ""we will stay with you now."" 6) Where does the United States stand? The United States was one of the strongest supporters of South Sudan's independence for a few reasons. A democratic South Sudan could be a regional hedge against the Khartoum regime, which the United States lists as a sponsor of terrorism, and President Omar al-Bashir, who has been indicted on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. In addition, the possibility exists of future U.S. involvement in South Sudan's oil industry. U.S. oil companies have no role now in South Sudan due to sanctions against Sudan, which still plays a major role in overall oil production. Secretary of State John Kerry has urged Kiir and Machar to enter peace talks, but there was no clear signal that the fighting would ease. Kerry also dispatched his special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, Donald Booth, to the country. In a statement Monday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it was positioning 150 Marines in Djibouti in East Africa to be able to respond should conditions in South Sudan deteriorate even more. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported Tuesday that 50 of the Marines then proceeded to Entebbe, Uganda, to be even closer to South Sudan if needed. The decision grew out of last year's experience in Benghazi, Libya, when no U.S. forces were close enough to respond quickly to the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. According to a senior administration official, 380 Americans and about another 300 third-country nationals have been evacuated. ""Based on registration, there are American citizens in other towns and areas throughout South Sudan,"" the official said. ""We are trying to track down how many may still be there."" CNN's Mike Pearson, Khushbu Shah, Jennifer Rizzo, Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Barbara Starr and Antonia Mortensen and journalist Mading Ngor in Juba, South Sudan, contributed to this report.","The world's newest country descends into violence and chaos .

"(CNN) -- He's back -- Lionel Messi returned to action with his customary goal spree following a 59-day absence as Barcelona crushed Getafe 4-0 Wednesday. Messi, who has been sidelined since November 10 with a torn hamstring, scored twice during a cameo appearance in the second half of the Spanish Cup tie. The Argentine, who had scored 14 times in 16 appearances before his goals at the Camp Nou, has endured a frustrating season with injuries. But he gave a brief indication of his return to fitness with a fine second individual effort. Messi's two goals came after Cesc Fabregas had also scored twice as Barcelona took control of the last-16 contest. The 26-year-old, who has been named World Footballer of the Year in each of the previous four years, is hoping to retain the Ballon D'Or on January 13. He faces strong competition from Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo and Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery. Alonso . Meanwhile, Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso ended speculation surrounding his future by signing a new two-year deal. The 32-year-old, whose contract was set to expire in June, was reportedly courting interest from a whole host of top European clubs. ""This will continue to be my home for two more years. I am very happy to tell you. Come on Madrid!"" he posted on his official Twitter account, alongside a photo of the Santiago Bernabeu. ""Real Madrid can announce the extension of Xabi Alonso's contract, that will keep him tied to the club for two more years until June 30, 2016,"" the club added in a statement on their website. City slickers . Elsewhere, Manchester City cruised to a 6-0 victory over a woeful West Ham. City has won all 10 of its Premier League home games this season and has scored 92 goals in its 31 games so far. While Manchester United continues to struggle under David Moyes, City is playing with a style and swagger which its rival could only dream of. Alvaro Negredo scored a classy hat-trick, while Edin Dzeko scored twice following Yaya Toure's effort. West Ham, which was beaten 5-0 last weekend by Championship side Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup, was blown away in emphatic fashion. ""It's not easy to win 5-0 at home against another Premier League team,"" Dzeko told Sky Sports. ""We still have to play away and this 5-0 - or 6-0, in the end - will give us the confidence for the second leg."" The two teams will meet in the second leg at Upton Park on January 21.","Lionel Messi returns to action following injury .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer came from set down against Tomas Berdych to claim a sixth Dubai Duty Free Championships title on Saturday. The Swiss who rallied after losing the first set to Novak Djokovic in Friday's semi repeated the trick against his Czech opponent in the final winning 3-6 6-4 6-3 to claim the 78th tour title of an illustrious career. ""Things definitely went my way out here tonight, but I have had a lot tougher matches in the last one-and-a-half years, so this is nice to get a lucky break again."" Federer notched up a solitary title in 2013, beating Mikhail Youzhny on the grass of Halle last June as the 32-year-old struggled with a back injury. But after hiring Stefan Edberg as a part-time coach at the end of last year (he wasn't present in Dubai), Federer has enjoyed a promising start to 2014, reaching the finals of the Brisbane International and the semis of the Australian Open in January. The 17-time Grand Slam champion led the Czech 11-6 in head-to-heads going into Saturday's match, but Berdych had prevailed in their last two encounters, which including a three-set win at the semifinal stage in Dubai last year. It was the big Czech who took an early lead, breaking in the sixth game before taking the opening set without alarm. Another break of serve in the fifth game of the second set and Berdych looked odds on for back-to-back titles after winning in Rotterdam last month. But Federer made the most of some unforced errors by the Czech in the next game to level and then broke himself in the 10th to level the match. After saving a break of serve in the opening game of the third, Federer then made a crucial break in the fourth game before clinching victory and ending Berdych's 11-match winning streak. Federer's win sees him claim third place outright on the list of all-time ATP Tour winners list, although it seems he is unlikely to go any higher. In second place is Ivan Lendl with 94 wins with Jimmy Connors way out in front on 109. Meanwhile at the Mexico Open, Andy Murray's quest for a first title since Wimbledon goes on after he was defeated in the semifinal of the Mexico Open by Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov. The 22-year-old Bulgarian won 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-3) and will face South Africa's Kevin Anderson in Sunday's final. Read more: Nadal, Djokovic confirmed for exhibition league .

"(CNN) -- The blaze that killed two Boston firefighters last week was unintentionally caused by a welding operation, Boston fire officials said Friday. But prosecutors have yet to determine whether anyone was criminally culpable, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. The welders did not have a required permit. The nine-alarm fire occurred on March 26 at a brick brownstone in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. Lt. Edward Walsh, 43, and firefighter Michael Kennedy, 33, were killed. Thirteen other firefighters were injured. Fire Commissioner John Hasson told reporters that the blaze was caused by sparks from welding in the rear of the building. The sparks probably festered in the wooden structure, with flames later fed by strong winds off the Charles River. ""We're confident this was an unintentional death at this time,"" Evans said. ""Whether anyone should be held culpable for this event, as the investigation goes on, that will be a determination made by investigators in the District Attorney's Office."" Ed Zabin, chief of the homicide unit for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said investigators would try to determine whether anyone was criminally responsible. He said welders were installing an iron hand rail behind the building. Evans and Hasson said that no fire detail was present at the job site and that the welders did not have a required permit. ""In most cases,"" Hasson said, ""a fire detail is required."" Walsh had worked with the Boston Fire Department for close to 10 years, and Kennedy had 6Â½ years on the job. Walsh was married with three children, all under the age of 10. Kennedy was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. Walsh and Kennedy were trapped soon after entering the building. They were later found in the basement, where the fire appeared to have started. Fueled by strong winds, flames quickly engulfed the four-story building. An explosion at one point threw a number of firefighters down stairs. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","A wind-fueled fire that killed two Boston firefighters was unintentional, fire officials say .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Passes, tackles, shots, saves, goals -- you go to a football match expecting to see these kind of things. Zinedine Zidane lays out Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final. But what about those times when something out of the ordinary happens on the pitch, something astonishing that leaves you rubbing your eyes? Below, are the 11 most shocking moments from football matches from the last 25 years. Do you agree with our list? Which ones have we missed? Let us know in the Sound Off box below. 1. Maradona leads Barcelona brawl, 1984 The year before, Andoni Goicoechea, a renowned hard man dubbed ""The Butcher of Bilbao,"" broke Barcelona star Diego Maradona's ankle with a reckless tackle. Bad blood between Barca and Athletic Bilbao continued into the Copa del Rey final and when the sides met at the Nou Camp in 1984, Maradona exacted his revenge, jump-kicking anyone in a red-and-white shirt. Players from both sides waded in and fists and boots flew amid scenes best described as ugly. Watch the YouTube video here. 2. Zidane headbutts Materazzi, 2006 Zinedine Zidane, the world's greatest footballer, was hoping for a glorious swansong and he had put France ahead against Italy in the 2006 World Cup final. Italy had drawn level through Marco Materazzi and penalties were on the cards when Materazzi, himself never far from controversy, wound the impetuous Zidane up with a remark about the bald playmaker's family. Read more about football at Football Fanzone . Zidane's response, to turn around and headbutt the defender's chest, was astonishing. A commotion followed and eventually Zidane received his marching orders. It was the final, unforeseeable act of a brilliant career. Watch the YouTube video here. 3. Cantona's kung-fu kick, 1995 Manchester United forward Eric Cantona had a reputation of being highly strung and when he kicked Crystal Palace's Richard Shaw, a red card was inevitable. As he trudged down the Selhurst Park touchline, Palace fan Matthew Simmons shouted abuse at the Frenchman and the red mist descended. Cantona flew feet first into the crowd at Simmons, then got up to aim punches at the fan as shocked supporters looked on. Eventually, Cantona was pulled away. He was ordered to serve 130 hours' community service and banned from football for nine months. Cantona later explained to a bemused press conference: ""When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown in to the sea."" Watch the YouTube video here. 4. Schumacher knocks out Battiston, 1982 Harald Schumacher showed his uncompromising side in football's worst-ever challenge. West Germany were playing France for a place in the 1982 World Cup final when Patrick Battiston was sent clear on Schumacher's goal. Do you agree with our selection? Let us know. The defender's touch had taken the ball past the on-rushing goalkeeper, but Schumacher was not interested in playing the ball. Instead he jumped side-on into Battiston, flattening him. The out-cold Frenchman suffered three cracked ribs, damaged his vertebrae and lost three teeth, while Schumacher was not even booked. To add insult to injury, West Germany went on to win the match. Watch the YouTube video here. 5. Di Canio pushes the referee over, 1998 Paulo Di Canio was a wonderfully gifted forward, capable of the sublime and, judging by this incident, the ridiculous too. Playing for Sheffield Wednesday against Arsenal at Hillsborough, the Italian had been shown a red card by referee Paul Alcock. Blood boiling, Di Canio strolled over to Alcock and pushed him, sending the referee stumbling back, theatrically, before falling over. Di Canio was fined, banned for 11 matches and did not play for Wednesday again. Watch the YouTube video here. 6. Dyer and Bowyer come to blows, 2005 Fisticuffs, or ""handbags"" as they're often described, between opposing players are not uncommon -- but a fight between two players from the same side is rare. So when Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer were caught tearing the Newcastle shirt from each other's backs, the incident raised more than a few eyebrows. Bowyer, always a fiery character, threw the first punch, Dyer reacted and they were both sent off. The pair were later reunited at West Ham United, where their time on the pitch together has been restricted by injury. Watch the YouTube video here. 7. Rivaldo's theatrics, 2002 Rivaldo was a brilliant player, perhaps as good a forward as Brazil has ever produced, but his reputation will forever be tarnished by this blatant piece of play-acting. With the ball out of play during the 2002 World Cup group game between Brazil and Turkey, Hakan Unsal kicked the ball at Rivaldo from a distance, which ricocheted off his thigh. Rivaldo then threw himself to the floor, rolling around and holding his face. His shameful gamesmanship got Unsal a second yellow card and, following a video review, Rivaldo was handed a small fine. The world's opprobrium carried greater weight. Watch the YouTube video here. 8. Di Canio's fascist salute, 2005 The controversy in Paulo Di Canio's career did not end after he left England. He returned to Italy to play for home-town team, Lazio and after a 3-1 win over city rivals Roma, Di Canio was photographed making a straight-armed ""Roman salute,"" the kind associated with Italy's former fascist leader, Benito Mussolini. The gesture was aimed at Lazio fans, a minority of whom hold far-right views. Di Canio was banned for a game and fined a minimal amount but claimed there was no political motivation behind his celebration. 9. Fowler ""eats the grass,"" 1999 Childhood Everton fan Robbie Fowler was an obvious target for Toffees fans once he'd started banging the goals in for rivals Liverpool. And it was during a Merseyside derby that Fowler felt like giving something back. Everton fans had accused Fowler of being a drug taker and so after putting away a penalty, the striker celebrated by pretending to ""snort"" the white painted lines of the pitch markings in front of the away end. Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier said afterwards it had been a jokey goal celebration where Fowler was pretending to be a cow. Watch the YouTube video here. 10. Gazza plays the flute, 1998 Paul Gascoigne's mental problems were not known during his 1990s heyday, with England manager Bobby Robson diagnosing him merely,""daft as a brush."" But there was no excusing the midfielder's actions during an always-heated Glasgow derby at Celtic Park. The Rangers midfielder pretended to play a flute, a symbol of the Protestant Orange Order marchers, in front of the traditionally Catholic Celtic fans. Gascoigne later claimed to be unaware of its significance, but his life was threatened afterwards. 11. Foe dies on the pitch, 2003 Marc-Vivien Foe made his name in England and France as an athletic, ball-winning central midfielder. In short, a picture of health. So it was perhaps the ultimate shock when playing in the semi-final of the Confederations Cup for Cameroon against Colombia, Foe collapsed in the middle of the pitch, with no one near him. Efforts to resuscitate him on the field failed and he died shortly after arriving at the medical centre at the stadium in Lyon. An autopsy revealed the 28-year-old's death was heart-related.","Football has produced some shocking moments down the years .

"(CNN) -- A Hollywood genius might have been hard-pressed to produce a more perfect ending to Melanie Servetas' story. Servetas was marrying the love of her life Wednesday morning near a picturesque Rio de Janeiro beach. At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court was striking down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, the sole reason the couple was forced to start their life together thousands of miles away from America. Joy turned to joy times a million. Everything had changed. Servetas could now come home and, yes, live happily ever after with her wife. ""This is the happiest day of our lives for so many reasons,"" she said by phone on the taxi ride home from her wedding. ""The journey (to come home) is just beginning ... but at least we know we can make the journey now."" Read the ruling on DOMA . Servetas, 48, left a high-powered job and a good life in Rancho Cucamonga, California, after she fell in love with Claudia Amaral, 45, a citizen of Brazil. Even if Servetas had married Amaral in Washington, D.C., or one of 12 states that allow same-sex marriage, she was barred from sponsoring her wife for immigration purposes because of DOMA. The federal law prohibited married same-sex couples from collecting federal marriage benefits. There are nearly 30,000 such couples, many of whom, like Servetas, were forced to choose between love and country. Wednesday's high court ruling means they no longer have to make that tough decision. It was an issue that Immigration Equality had worked to resolve for two decades. The organization helped gay and lesbian binational couples seek legal help on immigration. Wednesday, its website said in giant letters: ""Yes. You can get a green card,"" referring to the common term for permanent U.S. residency. ""At long last, we can now tell our families that yes, they are eligible to apply for green cards,"" said Rachel Tiven, executive director of Immigration Equality. ""Many of our families have waited years, and in some cases decades, for the green card they need to keep their families together. Couples forced into exile will be coming home soon. Americans separated from their spouses are now able to prepare for their reunion. Today's ruling is literally a life-changing one for those who have suffered under DOMA and our discriminatory immigration laws."" Servetas had been anxiously awaiting a Supreme Court decision even as she planned her wedding six weeks ago, after Brazil removed barriers to gay marriage in May. She picked out a vintage-style cream-colored dress, and Amaral chose Ralph Lauren velvet pants. The two selected lavender accessories. The ceremony started at 10 a.m. ET at the Botafogo Beach town hall. The justice of the peace ordered an electronic blackout until everything was finished. No Internet, no cell phones. What's next for gay rights movement? Servetas and Amaral exchanged rings inscribed with Wednesday's date. They were the first same-sex couple to be married at that location in Brazil, and the paperwork took a while. The suspense was killing them. They couldn't wait to find out the Supreme Court's decision. When it was over, a clerk called them over and showed them a CNN headline: ""DOMA struck down."" ""Sorry, I'm babbling on the phone,"" Servetas said, so excited that she could hardly speak. To be with Amaral, Servetas gave up her life in the United States and moved to Brazil, where she launched an information technology company. The company is struggling and Servetas misses everything about America. She lived in limbo, not knowing if one day her work visa in Brazil might not be extended. She went to sleep every night worrying that tomorrow, she may be separated from the woman she loves. On Wednesday, Servetas took the first steps back to America. She still owns her house in Southern California but says she will go anywhere in the United States that a job takes her. After that, she will sponsor Amaral for a green card -- under U.S. law, her marriage in Brazil will be recognized as legal. A bill to recognize same-sex partners for immigration purposes was first introduced in Congress in 2000. Since then countless couples have been separated or have had to make the same difficult decision as Servetas and leave home. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, tried to address the issue in the immigration reform bill with an amendment that included same-sex couples. But the Supreme Court decision on DOMA makes that provision moot. Read an iReport from a man who plans to sponsor his husband . In Atlanta, Nepal native Satyam Barakoti, 36, on Monday found out the gender of her first baby: a girl. She had already picked out a name for her: Annapurna. But until Wednesday, she was unsure of how she would keep her family together. She and partner Tonja Holder have been together five years. They bought a house and run a nonprofit consulting agency. But they were forced to discuss the possibility of moving abroad -- to Canada or Thailand. In February, Barakoti's temporary work visa, known as an H-1B, will expire, and until Wednesday she faced the likelihood of having to leave America. Under DOMA, Holder could not sponsor Barakoti for a green card. Although Barakoti's child will be born a U.S. citizen, children cannot sponsor parents until they are 21. Uncertainty was king in their lives, disrupting their every move. Not any more. What about couples who still can't marry? ""We've waited so long for this that I'm still not quite ready to believe it,"" Holder said. ""Everything that was in limbo is actually secure now."" Perhaps she and Barakoti will move to Iowa, which not only allows gay marriage but also ruled recently that both parents in a same-sex marriage be allowed to have their names listed on a child's birth certificate. That would make Holder a legal parent of their daughter. Holder fights back tears. ""It's extraordinary,"" she said. ""I can't believe (the court) supported my family. It's amazing to me."" She cannot imagine what life is going to be like without having to worry about all this. But she can't wait to find out.

"Cairo (CNN) -- The trial of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy got off to a raucous start Monday, with a judge twice pausing what was supposed to be a brief opening hearing as Morsy and his co-defendants loudly spoke over him, rejecting the charges and claiming Morsy still is the rightful ruler. And the recesses were hardly calmer -- while the judge was away, journalists who were calling for Morsy's execution argued with defense lawyers. A fight appeared to break out at one point. In the end, the judge adjourned the trial until January 8 so that lawyers could meet with their clients and sift through more than 5,000 pages of recently filed documents. But not before several wild scenes in the court, where more than 100 observers looked on. Morsy helped set a tone of defiance when he walked in, wearing a suit as opposed to the white uniforms of his co-defendants. Throughout, he refused to recognize the court's legitimacy and made it clear he still considers himself President. ""I warn everyone that what's happening is a cover for the military coup,"" he said shortly after the judge entered the room the first time. ""I don't want the great Egyptian judiciary to ever serve as a cover for the standing military coup."" The charges . Morsy appeared with seven co-defendants; seven others are being tried in absentia. The charges stem from protests last December 5 over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy, whom the military removed from office in a coup on July 3, and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. The 11 others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. Defendants chant: 'Down with military rule' Monday's proceeding was unruly even before it began. Before Morsy and the judge entered the room, some of his seven co-defendants chanted ""down with military rule"" and ""Morsy is my President"" from the dock. Even some of the defense lawyers, who numbered more than 20, chanted, ""the people support the resilience of the President."" Morsy became Egypt's first freely elected President in 2012 after the overthrow of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. The military deposed him in July, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Supporters, including the Muslim Brotherhood, have said the coup was a power grab by the military and elements of the old Mubarak regime. After Morsy made his statement at the start of Monday's proceeding, the judge asked if the defendants were present -- and they didn't answer. When the judge addressed the defense lawyers, Morsy spoke up again and things broke down. ""I am Dr. Mohamed Morsy, the President of the republic,"" Morsy said. ""The coup is a crime and ... treason."" This led to chaos, with a number of people -- lawyers, journalists, the judge -- trying to speak at once, and Morsy repeating himself to make sure he was heard. With no one able to hear anyone clearly, the judge called a recess for more than an hour. Upon returning, the judge let the prosecutor present the charges. Several defendants responded to the charges by proclaiming they rejected the court. The second recess came after more commotion, after Morsy alleged the court wasn't properly specialized to charge Egypt's President. The judge never returned to the courtroom: He sent a court official after the second recess to announce the adjournment until January 8. Pro-Morsy demonstrators outside court . Outside the police academy where the trial was being held, more than 100 pro-Morsy demonstrators faced a cordon of security forces behind barbed wire. The demonstrators waved flags and chanted loudly against the military, which deposed Morsy four months ago, and against Egypt's interim government. Some protesters attacked television news crews they claimed were not reporting the truth, but that incident was brief. Several hundred people have died in clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces since the military removed him. Authorities have warned they will crack down on any violent protests tied to the trial. Constitutional claim . Defense lawyer Mohamed El-Damaty told CNN that Morsy's team will argue that it is illegal under the constitution approved under Morsy to try a President without approval of two-thirds of the members of the parliament. The military suspended that constitution, but the court could honor it, El-Damaty said. Morsy had been held at an undisclosed location since the coup. Amnesty International has described his detention as an ""enforced disappearance."" After Monday's hearing, Morsy will be taken to the Borg El-Arab prison in Alexandria, state-run TV reported. State-run Al Masriya TV reported that Morsy was transported by military plane to the court. The other defendants were transported by military armored vehicles. Who represents Morsy? It wasn't immediately clear after Monday's proceedings whether Morsy will accept the lawyer provided to him, as accepting legal representation could be perceived as acceptance of the court and the trial. Morsy's Islamist Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, assigned lawyer Mohamed Selim El-Awa to him. El-Awa argued Monday that the court doesn't have jurisdiction to try Morsy, and that Morsy is illegally held -- asserting that anything gleaned during his detention would be null and void. Lawyer Rajia Omran, who represents victims of the December clashes, repeatedly argued that this isn't a political trial -- saying she'd been working on the case since December, months before Morsy's ouster. CNN's Sarah Sirgany and Ian Lee reported from Cairo; Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Last Sunday, a group of us sat on the beach, watching the children play, when the talk turned, as it often does, to Pope Francis. ""The Pope said the loveliest thing yesterday. My father in Porto Alegre called me to tell me about it,"" my Brazilian friend Bete told us. My Swiss friend Diego chimed in with another charming anecdote, and everyone remarked how warm and affectionate Francis is. I was pleased to hear all the comments, but not surprised, since it's been like that all year. Everyone is talking about him, all the time. In this first year of his papacy, Francis has stirred up hearts and minds, not only among his flock, but also among a wider culture that is generally inhospitable, if not downright antagonistic, to the teachings of the Church of Rome. He has sparked admiration and consternation, and most of all, he has inspired wide-flung interest and debate. It seems the voice of the vicar of Rome, even in this secularist age, has tremendous carrying power. People who long ago dismissed the church as a hidebound, irrelevant institution seem to be irresistibly drawn to the captivating Francis. I was stunned, recently, to have a very liberal acquaintance of mine, who happens to be Jewish, tell me we finally have a progressive pope. A priest reflects on Francis' first year . He used the word ""we."" To my acquaintance, ""progressive"" is high praise, as it describes a belief in the growing wisdom of mankind and the inevitable improvement of our culture, resulting in welcome human flourishing. It was clear to him that both he and Francis share the same desire, to see all people living more joyful, fulfilling lives. My friend's comment illustrated the peculiar power of Francis: that of presenting the central message of the church -- that God loves every man and woman passionately and desires their good -- in ways that those quite outside the influence of the church can recognize and warm to. Pope Francis has been at pains to explain what he is about, which he characterizes as a new chapter of evangelization for the church. His task is to find ways, and help the rest of the church find ways, to transmit the joy which so obviously fills him and sustains him. He calls it the joy of the gospel, which perhaps might be explained as the joy of knowing that we are truly loved, although all of us are completely undeserving of that kind of sacrificial devotion. He is the first one to declare himself a sinner, and undeserving, with an utterly disarming humility. He writes, in Evangelii Gaudium, ""I dream of ... a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything, so that the Church's customs ... can be suitably channeled for the evangelization of today's world rather than for her self-preservation."" This is quite a statement. It seems he understands that too many Catholics today find themselves with a bunker mentality, hoping to ""get by"" without calling too much attention to themselves. They feel beleaguered by those who no longer have the philosophical and religious education that would enable them to understand social doctrine, especially sexual, as anything other than stuffy nonsense that has outlived its usefulness. The church has found itself, understandably, in a defensive posture. It has been greatly exacerbated recently by a new tendency in modern culture to decry an adherence to age-old, universal attitudes toward marriage and sexuality as intolerance and bigotry. But that defensive posture, Francis seems to say, is not courageous and outward-looking, and not worthy of those who have been charged with the sacred mission of spreading the good news. Of course, there are many who hope that he will repudiate some of those social teachings, and thereby change the character of the church itself. Again and again he is asked why he doesn't emphasize those difficult matters, like abortion and marriage. He didn't mention them in Brazil, during World Youth Day. He explained then: ""The Church has already expressed herself perfectly on this. ... It wasn't necessary to talk about that, but about the positive things that open the way to youngsters."" When pressed for his personal position, he answered with direct and perfect simplicity: ""That of the Church. I am a Child of the Church!"" Francis wants Catholics, bravely, out of their bunkers. He is telling them that there is tremendous power in the knowledge that believers carry within them. The joy of the gospel, as Francis sees it, is capable of setting us free from sorrow, loneliness and inner emptiness. Aren't those exactly the torments that plague modern people, satiated with material goods like never before but atomized and radically alone? It would be criminal for Catholics to hide it away because they are fearful of criticism or just lazy and unmotivated. The Pope tells us to put joy into action, in service to the poor, love of the sick, going out to meet our brothers and sisters at the crossroads and bringing them home.

"(CNN) -- A massive landslide in Washington has destroyed one home and threatens more than a dozen others, an official and CNN affiliates in the Seattle area reported Wednesday. One home has only about 10 feet of its backyard left after the slide on Whidbey Island, north of Seattle, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. That home's resident was able to escape, said Ed Hartin, fire chief at Central Whidbey Island Fire and Rescue. No injuries have been reported. The landslide cut access to 17 homes, and residents have been taken out by boat, Hartin said. Others area homes also were evacuated. Live video showed small sections of the cliff continuing to fall at 10:45 a.m. local time as people removed furniture and other belongings. Tons of earth had fallen into Puget Sound. Richard Barker, who lives about 500 feet south of the landslide, told CNN on Wednesday he does not currently plan to leave his home. ""However, the Red Cross has told us they will let us know if we need to evacuate,"" Barker told CNN. ""We're feeling a little bit nervous. We've got a beautiful view and we'd hate to see our view and house head into the ocean."" According to Barker, the neighborhood had above-average rainfall over the winter and into spring. A snowfall late last week left several inches of wet snow that was gone. The homes are on a seismic fault that on rare occasions shifts, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Barker said the cliff has not seen movement for many years. ""We just thought OK, that is something you pay for the marvelous view that you have."" Fire officials first received a call about the slide shortly after 4 a.m., Hartin said. Residents reported hearing a sound like thunder around the time of the slide, CNN affiliate KING-TV reported. A spokesman with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources said a team of geologists is on its way to Whidbey Island to investigate. The cause of the landslide was not immediately clear. There hasn't been rain in the past few days, said Hartin. Recent deadly landslides in: Indonesia, China, Peru .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Physical attraction may be as old as time, but new studies are beginning to uncover the science behind sex appeal. Unexpected factors -- like biochemical odors, face shape and voice pitch -- just might have more to do with your choice of mate than anyone ever expected. Biostatistics expert Kendra Schmid explains why actress Halle Berry scored very high on facial attractiveness. Karl Grammer and Elizabeth Oberzaucher are leading the research on the human scent's influence on sexual attraction. They've found that when women are ovulating, they produce copulins, a scent that attracts men. The researchers believe when a man gets a whiff of copulins, his testosterone levels rise. As a result, he secretes androstenone, an odor that repels women who aren't ovulating. ""Bars and nightclubs across the world are the battlefield for this invisible biochemical war,"" Oprah Winfrey says. Sex therapist Dr. Laura Berman says attraction has a lot more to do with science and evolution than people might think. ""We are innately all puppies in heat,"" she says. ""We are capable of discerning 10,000 different scents consciously. But then there's a whole realm of unconscious scents that we're not even aware that we're smelling."" Oprah.com: Get Dr. Berman's 5 steps to better sex . These odors let people know when a woman is fertile and when a man's testosterone levels are high, Berman says. As a result, individuals can tell when someone else is most ripe for reproduction. ""It's all about survival of the species,"" she says. One common complaint Berman hears among women with relationship problems is that they love their partner, but they're not in love with him. ""There is a difference between love and chemistry,"" Berman says. ""Take a really good whiff of him without cologne when he's relatively clean. If that smell turns you on, that's a really good cue of chemistry."" Oprah.com: Can the chemistry come later? In one recent study, Berman says, researchers had women smell men's T-shirts. The women were most attracted to the shirts of men with a different major histocompatability complex (MHC) from them. MHC is a collection of genes that are related to immune systems. ""We unconsciously want to mate with someone who has a different immune system than ours because that helps with the survival of our offspring,"" Berman says. The T-shirt study also found that women taking hormonal contraception were attracted to men who had similar MHC as they did. ""If you're on the pill, your body is being tricked into think you're pregnant, so you're not ovulating,"" Berman says. ""The bad news there is that they have looked at these couples who have similar MHC, and not only do they have higher levels of infidelity and higher levels of marital discord, but they also have higher infertility issues."" Another unexpected factor that has been found to directly affect attraction is voice pitch. Gordon Gallup, Ph.D., a professor at the State University of New York at Albany, says that women with higher estrogen levels have higher voices, which makes them more desirable to men. ""When females are midcycle, when they're the most fertile, the most likely to conceive, their voices are rated as being significantly more attractive,"" he says. It's hard to pinpoint what distinguishes a gorgeous face from an average one, but some researchers are getting pretty close. Psychologist Lisa DeBruine, Ph.D., of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland says she's found that women's faces get more attractive to men when they are ovulating. ""We're not entirely clear why there's this difference, but we think that the women might look healthier, have a bit of a healthier glow when they are ovulating."" Symmetry is another factor that determines a face's attractiveness. Kendra Schmid, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, says there is a formula for the ""perfect"" face. She uses 29 different measurements to determine someone's appeal on a scale of 1 to 10. To start, Schmid says the ratio of the length of the face to the width of the face should be 1.6, also known as the golden ratio.""The face should also be divided into three equal pieces vertically,"" she says. ""The forehead, then [the bottom of the forehead to] the nose and then from the nose to the chin."" Who's face is the most ""perfect,"" according to Schmid's measurements? No big surprise here! ""Brad Pitt's is the highest that I've ever used the [formula] on,"" she says. ""He was a 9.3 [out of 10]."" Brad's partner, Angelina Jolie, didn't fare too badly either. ""Angelina was a 7.67, and that's pretty high,"" Schmid says. ""Most people rate about 4 to 6. ... The thing that is probably lowering her score is the thing that she's most famous for -- her full lips."" Schmid says that ideally the width of a mouth should be twice the height of the lips. Other celebrities Schmid tested were Halle Berry, who scored a 7.36, and Hugh Jackman, a 6.45. ""There's never been anyone who was a perfect 10,"" Schmid says. ""If you're out there, we're looking for you!"" Not everything that goes into finding a partner is biological. Researchers have also found that if a woman looks at the face of a man whom she knows nothing about, she will give it a rating on a scale of 1 to 10 that's different than if she is shown the same face and a corresponding income. When a man makes a lot of money, a woman will rate him higher on an attractiveness scale than she would that same man with a smaller income. Oprah.com: What do women really want? Berman says this isn't a case of women being gold diggers. ""It goes back again to evolution. When we were having babies who were very dependent on us, we couldn't hunt and take care of ourselves, so we were looking for the man who had the most social status, who was the best hunter, who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies,"" she says. ""It's the same thing today."" Smell, voice pitch and face symmetry might be unconscious detectors of attractiveness, but if you're trying to consciously assess the future of a relationship, Berman says there's one surefire way. ""You really learn a lot from a kiss. ... Sixty-six percent of women say they would dump a guy after a bad first kiss,"" she says. ""It's not only because you're getting that good whiff of him so you're seeing if you like the way he smells. All your senses are engaged, and you get a sense of his sensuality, his connection, whether he's a take-charge kind of guy or more of a stepping back kind."" When it comes to relationships, Berman says kissing frequency is a direct indicator of happiness. ""It turns out that couples who kiss and cuddle regularly are eight times less likely to be stressed and depressed than couples who don't get that,"" she says. ""You have to have a minimum of a 10-second kiss every day."" From The Oprah Winfrey Show . Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price.

"(CNN) -- Seattle Seahawks routed Denver Broncos Sunday 43-8 in one of the most one-sided contests in Super Bowl history to win the coveted Vince Lombardi trophy for the first time. AFC Champion Denver was undone by a toxic combination of Seattle's ruthless defense and its own errors, with famed quarterback Peyton Manning having a night to forget. He was intercepted twice as Seattle took an early stranglehold on the game while his inexperienced opposite Russell Wilson hardly put a foot wrong in an assured display. Allied to the powerful running, epitomized by inspired wide receiver Percy Harvin, the result was five touchdowns to a single score by Denver and the contest was effectively over by halftime as the NFC Champions took complete control. By then linebacker Malcolm Smith had intercepted a wayward Manning pass to return 69 yards and he was to be named MVP although in truth there were many candidates for the honor. ""This is an amazing team,"" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. ""These guys would never take anything but winning this game."" Wilson, 25, was answering his critics in only his second year in the NFL. ""It feels great to win this title,"" he said. The franchise owner Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, said it was an ""amazing feeling"" to win the 48th edition of the Super Bowl. Seattle had been beaten in its only previous Super Bowl appearance by Pittsburgh in 2006. Fears of freezing conditions which had dominated the pre-match talk proved unfounded with the kickoff temperature of 49 degrees (9.4 Celsius) positively balmy. It was 10 degrees warmer than the coldest-ever Super Bowl from 1972 in New Orleans, but Manning and his team were caught cold from the very start. Denver made a hash of its first offensive drive. Broncos center Manny Ramirez's snap flew over Manning's head and Knowshon Moreno was forced to dive on the ball in his own end zone for a safety and two points for Seattle. Manning shook his head as he returned to the bench and he proceeded to spend much of the opening quarter warming his seat as Seattle took a stranglehold. But the Broncos defense held up well to at least deny Seattle a touchdown, the further scoring coming from a pair of field goals from Steven Hauschka to make it 8-0. Towards the end first quarter Manning was intercepted by Seattle safety Kam Chancellor at the Denver 39. It eventually led to the first touchdown for Seattle as Marshawn Lynch forced his way over from close range, showing typical strength. It got worse for the 37-year-old veteran Manning as Seattle pressure forced him into another errant and off balance pass which was intercepted by Smith. He ran it back 69 yards for the second TD for the Seahawks and with the extras from Hauschka it was 22-0 at the half. It was scarcely believable that a team which had set an NFL scoring record with 606 points in regular season had failed to make a 20-yard play during the opening half and Super Bowl history was against a team coming back from such a deficit. Denver was left with 30 minutes to reflect on its disastrous start as Hawaiian singer Bruno Mars delighted 82,000 fans in the Metlife Stadium in the much vaunted halftime show. The clean cut Mars rounded off his solo act with his song ""Treasure"" before being joined by rockers The Red Hot Chili Peppers for their ""Give It Away"" -- which ironically summed up some of Denver's efforts on the pitch. The combination certainly did rock but the corporations paying up to $4 million for an advertising slot during the Super Bowl must have been hoping for a revival by the Broncos for fear of the team's supporters switching off their televisions in disgust. Some hope. It got even worse straight from the kickoff as the quicksilver Percy Harvin returned for fully 87 yards for the Seahawks to effectively end the game as a contest. Harvin had played only two games all season after injury, but danced through a jaded Denver defense to score his team's third and decisive touchdown. Seattle quarterback Wilson had played a quietly effective game and his pass found Jermaine Kearse, who eluded some more weak defense to add the fourth TD towards the end of the third quarter before Demaryius Thomas finally got Denver on the scoreboard. He picked off a pass from Manning -- his 12th catch a Super Bowl record -- but it was to prove too little too late as his team trailed 36-8 going into the final quarter. A chance to salvage further pride was snuffed out at the start of the fourth when Wilson found Doug Baldwin just short of the end zone and he wriggled his way through. It completed the scoring with the Seattle celebrations started well in advance of the final whistle -- coach Carroll getting the traditional dowsing from his charges. By contrast, it proved a miserable night for his Denver counterpart John Fox, whose hopes of a reported $1 million winning bonus were in tatters almost from the first play, while the result will throw Manning's future in doubt, with talk of retirement.","Seattle Seahawks wins Super Bowl XLVIII .

"(CNN) -- From swimming pool slides and oversized LEGO stations to Plinko walls and Wii consoles, hotels all over the world have committed to having fun. Some have transformed their lobbies and public spaces into the kind of playgrounds children and grown-ups alike can enjoy, inspiring a bit of healthy competition among guests. Here are eight properties that stretch and bounce and slide beyond a place to lay your head: . Sea Island, Georgia . This massive resort on Georgia's coast packs in a lot: Nature lovers are especially spoiled with plenty to do, from salt marsh exploration to kayaking to an after-dark survival skills course where younger guests are groomed for the outdoors with lessons in pitching tents, lighting fires, reading a compass, etc. The resort can also provide a very thorough primer in gyotaku fish printing that includes dissecting the fish. For guests who prefer a more traditional take on play, there's a life-size chess set on the lawn, and a very civilized weekly Bingo service, where men age 12 and up are required to wear a jacket. 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels . Hotel Zetta, San Francisco, California . This months-old Viceroy Hotel Group property in San Francisco's Union Square neighborhood was meant to attract those traveling to the city for business -- the startup variety. To appeal to that ""work hard, play hard"" mentality, a massive Plinko wall greets guests in the lobby. The rest of the hotel's playful perks can be found in the sharply curated Playroom, where Wii consoles share the space with ping-pong and pool tables, a massive assortment of board games and life-size Jenga. The phone booths, which have been updated with Samsung tablets that will allow users to Skype, are a nice touch. Heading up to your room? Have an Atari game sent up on request. 10 record-setting natural wonders . Martinhal Resort, Sagres, Portugal . Located on the southwest corner of continental Europe in the Portuguese fishing town of Sagres, Martinhal Resort is a true family-friendly destination, where every member of the brood can find something to do. Everything from stand-up paddling to kayaking to jeep safaris to surfing to Pilates on the beach are on offer. Or give Padel a try. This racquet sport, popular in the Iberian Peninsula and Latin America, is a combination of tennis and racquetball. Martinhal has two glass-sided courts in which to learn. The resort's Village Square acts as its entertainment hub, where children can let loose at the playground while older children head to the Blue Room to play foosball and video games. Bonus: All dining venues here are outfitted with play areas separate but visible from and near to the actual dining room, allowing adults to eat in peace without totally losing sight of the kids. Primland Resort, Meadows of Dan, Virginia . This resort in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains sits on 12,000 acres -- that's roughly the size of Bermuda -- so there's always a variety of activities available for guests. One of the most fun, given the abundance of space, is a game of geocaching, a high-tech treasure hunt in which a GPS device helps participants locate hidden canisters, or geocaches, that reveal interesting information about the resort's surroundings as well as local fauna and flora. Some of the geocaches might reveal a puzzle to solve for an added challenge. In addition, clay shooters will enjoy the Game Trail Virtual Simulation Hunt, featuring 10 challenging scenarios. Younger guests, on the other hand, can take on the Blue Ridge Tree Climbing contest. 7 secret Caribbean islands . Yotel, New York . This pod-style hotel right next to the Lincoln Tunnel may not win points for space -- a luxury in New York City (though its 4,000 square-foot terrace is the largest hotel terrace in town), but it certainly delivers if it's whimsical playfulness guests are after. For example, luggage storage is manned by a mechanical robot, programmed to collect suitcases and backpacks and stuff them into their assigned lockers. But Yotel's pièce de résistance is its Lego wall, which was unveiled in January 2014. The 30-foot long lobby wall includes thousands of colorful bricks, tools for Yotel guests' next masterpieces. Some have drafted messages while others used the Lego bricks to create more ambitious visuals (flags, animals, cartoon characters, even NYC landmarks). See some examples of them online. Travaasa, Austin, Texas . Playful activities at the original Travaasa property (there's also one in Hawaii) are heart-pounding but fun. Take the mechanical bull exercise as an example. Guests who have completed Pilates or the core-conditioning workout can take on this core-strengthening task -- cowboy hat not included. There's also an adventurous bike track for riders of all levels and the renowned Prickly Pear Challenge Course -- with its multistep, vertical climbing elements and zip-line finish -- is sure to push all sorts of physical boundaries. To unwind, guests can always participate in a game of Texas Hold'em. Four Seasons Hotel, Hampshire, England . The Four Seasons property in the English countryside is so committed to its family-friendly programing that it has planned activities during key school holidays. So, it might be a Segway adventure during the Easter break or themed tea parties during the February half-term holiday. There's also Henry's Hangout -- a wooden playground stocked with swings, slides and a climbing wall. ""Tweens"" may prefer the Rose Cottage with its games. The grand estate, however, is better suited for outdoorsy endeavors -- think boat rides on the canals, croquet, falconry, quad bikes -- especially when a new equestrian center opens this spring, featuring stabling space for 12 horses and a petting zoo. Hotel Unique, São Paulo, Brazil . Hotel Unique lives up to its name. One of the most design-forward hotels in the world has an exterior resembling a slice of watermelon. While this hotel doesn't offer the games of many of the hotels on our list, its curvaceous silhouette merits a mention -- and takes the edge off the see-and-be-seen vibe that attracts local glitterati to the rooftop terrace and bar. Many guests have not been able to resist trying to slide on a sloping wall near suites on the edges of the property. And fortunately, the multicolored indoor pool has something few city pools do: a slide.","Life-size chess, LEGO and Plinko are among the amenities at some hotels .

"(CNN) -- As the right of college athletes to form unions is debated across the country, at least one state is moving to head off that idea at the pass. An Ohio House committee added an amendment to a state budget bill Monday that says students attending state universities in Ohio ""are not public employees based upon participating in athletics for the state university."" It's the latest reaction to the ruling last month by the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago that football players at Illinois' Northwestern University are considered employees of their school and can vote to form a union. Because Northwestern is a private school, the NLRB governs whether athletes there can vote to form a union. At public schools, that decision is governed by state law. That prompted movement from lawmakers in two states Monday. In Connecticut, legislators said they were considering drafting legislation that would allow it. The amendment added to the budget bill in Ohio would ban it. The players at Northwestern still have to vote to actually form their union. That vote takes place April 25 and some of the leaders on the team have said they plan to vote ""no."" Head coach Pat Fitzgerald told his team he doesn't think a union is in their best interest. Reaction from current and former athletes has been mixed. Other private schools, like Duke and Stanford, have had meetings on the issue, according to remarks by Northwestern's president emeritus Henry Bienen at the Knight Commission on intercollegiate athletics last month. State lawmakers in Connecticut have expressed support, praising University of Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier -- named the most valuable player in the team's win Monday over the University of Kentucky for the NCAA basketball championship -- for talking out about NCAA reform. The Ohio measure will probably go to a vote in the state House on Wednesday, a staffer said. If it passes there, it still must be approved by the state Senate. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association and a driving force behind the union idea, has said that the NLRB ruling would have a domino effect, but he wouldn't comment on whether athletes at other schools are considering a hard push to form a union. Northwestern is appealing the NLRB's decision, and the appeals process could take years, making its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.

"(CNN) -- Cell phone video recorded from inside a car clipped by a FedEx tractor-trailer truck before it slammed into a bus carrying students in Northern California is being reviewed by investigators, the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. The driver of the Nissan Altima that passed the bus just before the crash reported seeing flames coming from underneath the FedEx truck, but investigators have found no physical evidence of a fire before the collision, said Mark Rosekind, an NTSB board member. The truck clipped the car occupied by Joe and Bonnie Duran before it crashed into the bus Thursday evening, killing 10 people -- five high school students, three chaperones and the drivers of both vehicles. More than 30 people, mostly teenagers, were taken to local hospitals. Bonnie Duran told the CNN affiliate KOVR the truck was on fire before it hit the bus. She said she made a quick decision to swerve to avoid a direct hit from the truck, sending their rental car into a ditch. The video captured from inside the Durans' vehicle is being examined for clues, Rosekind said. Despite the initial lack of physical evidence of a fire before the crash, ""nothing is ruled out yet,"" Rosekind told reporters at a news conference Sunday. The NTSB team is looking at the FedEx driver's last 72 hours to determine whether he had enough rest and whether he was using his cell phone when he lost control of his truck, Rosekind said. ""Fatigue, distraction and other human performance issues are at the top of our list."" Dash-camera video from the first California Highway Patrol vehicle on the scene could also help investigators understand what happened in the minutes after the crash as both vehicles burned, he said. Investigators are interested in knowing whether passengers on the bus, which was new, were wearing seat belts, Rosekind said. Some bus passengers were ejected from the vehicle, including the ones who died, he said. The investigation shows the southbound truck did not brake as it crossed the median at a 10-degree angle and entered the northbound lanes, Rosekind said Saturday. Investigators found 175 feet of tire marks left by the bus, indicating the driver tried to avoid crashing into the truck. A computer on the truck that could have revealed how fast the truck was traveling -- known a the electrical control module -- was destroyed by fire, he said. The electrical control module on the bus survived but has not yet been examined, he said. Blood samples should be obtained from the bodies of both drivers, which will provide information about whether drugs or alcohol might have been in their systems, he said. Blood samples also might tell investigators if the drivers inhaled smoke from the fire, he said. Investigators are only collecting information now and aren't drawing conclusions about the cause of the accident, Rosekind said. Students traveling from the L.A. area . The students were traveling from the Los Angeles area to take part in a program at Humboldt State University, which allows prospective attendees to visit the campus. Their journey ended in the fiery wreck 90 miles north of Sacramento when the truck hit one of three buses taking the teens to the campus in Arcarta. The students on the buses represented 31 Southern California high schools. They were heading to ""Spring Preview Plus,"" which invites low-income and first-generation prospective students to the university. As part of the program, students stay in residence halls, attend events and visit with staff and students from a program that helps historically underrepresented students, the university said. The two other buses in the caravan made it to the university. Those students were placed in dorms, and the university is offering them counseling.

"(CNN) -- The police officer who fatally shot a Hofstra University student as she was being held at gunpoint by an intruder has been cleared of any wrongdoing, according to a report released Wednesday by the Nassau County District Attorney's office in New York. Officer Nikolas Budimlic ""reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly,"" the report concluded. The 28-page investigative report, which includes interviews with police officers and civilian witnesses, as well as forensic evidence, was ordered by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice after Budimlic opened fire and killed both the armed home intruder and the student in May. The intruder, Delton Smith, 30, was fatally shot seven times by Budimlic, according to the report. The student, Andrea Rebello, 21, whom Smith had in a headlock at the time, was shot once in the head by Budimlic. She later died of her injuries at Nassau University Medical Center, the report said. ""Smith ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic,"" the report said. ""Officer Budimlic clearly and reasonably believed that the use of deadly physical force was necessary to defend himself and Andrea Rebello and, on this basis, made the decision to discharge his weapon."" Smith, wearing a hoodie and a black ski mask, invaded the home Rebello shared with her twin sister and two others during the pre-dawn hours of May 17, the report said. He told the occupants he was there to enforce the repayment of $10,000 they owed to a ""Russian guy,"" the report said. Rebello and the other three were forced upstairs where Smith demanded their valuables, including jewelry and electronics. Smith also had one of Rebello's roommates travel to a nearby ATM to retrieve cash, the report said. The roommate called 911. Budimlic and three other officers were the first to respond. Budimlic was the only officer to enter the residence, which led to the standoff with Smith. Despite repeated commands to drop the gun and let Rebello go, Smith repeatedly threatened to kill Budimlic and Rebello while alternately pointing his gun at each of them. According to Budimlic's account, included in the report, the officer noticed a change in Smith's tone and demeanor, describing it as ""more tense and desperate."" Budimlic described seeing Rebello turn her body away from Smith, leaving a larger portion of the suspect's body exposed, the report said. Budimlic fired twice. When Smith let go of Rebello -- who was struck by one of the shots -- Budimlic fired an additional six shots, according to the report. The Nassau County Medical Examiner's office determined that Rebello died from a single gunshot wound to the head. The bullet entered behind her right ear. Smith died of multiple gunshot wounds. ""The incident last year was a tragedy for the Rebello family and a reminder of just how difficult and dangerous police work can be,"" Rice said in a statement Wednesday. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Andrea Rebello's family and friends as they continue to cope with this heartbreaking loss."" Hofstra University declined to comment on the report.","Hofstra University student Andrea Rebello, 21, was killed by police gunfire during a home invasion .

"(CNN) -- After a nerve-jangling four days, Arsenal can breathe a little easier. A 3-1 win over West Ham United on Tuesday saw Arsene Wenger's team climb back into the English Premier League's top four, keeping the Gunners in contention to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. Two goals from Germany's Lukas Podolski and a 20th of the season from Frenchman Olivier Giroud saw Arsenal leapfrog Everton in the table, after Matt Jarvis had given West Ham a shock lead in the first half. The vital victory came just three days after Arsenal had secured a place in the FA Cup final with a dramatic penalty shootout victory over second-tier Wigan Athletic. Two wins in quick succession have boosted Arsenal's hopes of reaching the Champions League for 17th consecutive season, while also keeping alive their chances of lifting silverware for the first time in nine years and relieving some of the pressure on beleaguered manager Wenger. ""I think we built the victory tonight through consistency in our game, the vital part was to come back just before half time and in the second half we controlled the game well,"" Wenger, who has been at Arsenal since 1996, told Sky. ""After Saturday's game we had to dig deep."" Everton climbed above Arsenal at the weekend, and it looked as if the north London club would lose further ground in the battle for fourth place when West Ham took the lead on 39 minutes through one-time England winger Matt Jarvis. With Arsenal fans fearing a chastening defeat, the home team responded. Just five minutes later, Spain's Santi Cazorla expertly picked out Podolski, who turned inside the penalty area and fired a fierce low drive beyond West Ham goalkeeper Adrian. Ten minutes into the second half, Arsenal hit the front when Giroud showed sublime touch to control Thomas Vermaelen's lofted pass before converting with aplomb. Podolski put the seal on a much-needed result when he lashed home on 78 minutes following a header from substitute Aaron Ramsey, who was making his first Premier League appearance after a lengthy injury layoff. The win move Arsenal onto 67 points with five matches left to play, one point clear of Everton who have a game in hand on their rivals. Arsenal's next match is on Sunday at Hull City, who they will play in the FA Cup final on May 17. ""After the FA Cup it was important we switched on to the Premier League,"" said two-goal hero Podolski. ""Everyone wants to play in the Champions League because the matches are amazing and important for the club. ""There are hard matches to come, we must win all of our matches and then I think we will qualify. ""The most important thing tonight was to win. We focus now on the next game.""","Arsenal beat West Ham 3-1 to climb back in fourth place in the EPL .

"(CNN) -- Strong countries need a thriving middle class, but in America today, the people who have to work for a living are getting squeezed. Republicans in Congress are poised to vote this week on a plan to make it even worse, selling out the middle class to enrich the already rich. With their latest budget, Republicans are stacking the deck for special interests -- and whether you're a student, parent, commuter or senior citizen, Republicans will force you to pick up the costs so that special interests get their tax breaks. In Washington, too many people speak in vague hyperbole. So let's look at the numbers in the GOP budget and see exactly how its priorities would affect real Americans. Many economists predict that this budget will lead to a loss of more than 3 million jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The Republicans' budget makes life harder at every turn for the average person trying to succeed in America. If you are a student at Florida State University -- in Republican Rep. Steve Southerland's district in Tallahassee -- the GOP budget would make you pay interest on student loans while you're sitting in class, raising a total of $40 billion for the Treasury. Not by coincidence, the biggest and wealthiest oil companies get $40 billion in taxpayer subsidies. If you are a middle-class commuter in my congressional district on Long Island and you're trying to drive from Melville on the Long Island Expressway to get to your job in New York City, this budget gives you more brake lights and potholes. It strips $52 billion out of road repair and infrastructure improvements. On the other hand, if you're a corporation in New York, the Republican budget keeps tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas. If you are a middle-class senior citizen living in Rep. Rodney Davis' district near Springfield, Illinois, your costs increase 11% right away. You'll have to pay another $1,200 for your prescription drugs after this budget reopens the prescription drug doughnut hole. Future generations of seniors get an even worse deal -- they would get a Medicare voucher or have to pay up to 56% more just to get the benefits Medicare offers today. And finally, if you are middle-class parents with children in Rep. Mike Coffman's district in Aurora, Colorado, this budget increases your taxes $2,000, according to the Office of Management and Budget. But if you are making more than $1 million in anywhere else in America, you get a $200,000 tax cut, says Citizens for Tax Justice. In short, Republicans are turning their backs on the middle class. Democrats have the backs of the middle class. House Democrats have launched a sweeping national project -- ""Battleground: Middle Class"" -- and we are already communicating with voters in 76 districts around the country to tell them how the GOP budget would cost them more in every aspect of their lives, whether it's higher taxes, worse roads, costlier college educations or an end to the Medicare guarantee. The American people want their representatives in Washington to focus on strengthening the economy, making sure everyone has a shot at getting a better job and can count on a secure retirement -- which is exactly what Democrats have proposed. For middle-class voters, the 2014 midterms will come down to one question: Who's got our backs? The debate over our budget answers that question. We will fight from now until November to protect middle-class families from these backward priorities that threaten their financial security, cost us jobs and hold our economy back. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Rep. Steve Israel argues that the latest GOP budget hurts middle-class Americans .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid have done their bit, so now it's up to great rivals Barcelona to play their role if this year's Copa del Rey final is to become an extension of 'El Clasico'. Leading 3-0 against Atletico Madrid, Real's other main rivals, Cristiano Ronaldo scored two early penalties to wrap up the most comfortable of 5-0 aggregate wins in the semifinal. The Portuguese forward, currently serving a three-match league ban after a red card for violent conduct, was struck by a cigarette lighter as he headed towards the tunnel at halftime but reappeared afterwards without showing any ill effects. The manner of victory is a modicum of revenge for Atletico's 2-1 triumph against Real in last year's Copa del Rey final. Barcelona will meet Real in April's decider should coach Gerardo Martino's side defend a 2-0 lead at Real Sociedad in Wednesday's second semi. Needing an early goal to have any hope of overturning the odds, Atletico made the worst possible start when Ronaldo was tripped in the box after six minutes -- and the reigning FIFA Ballon d'Or holder made no mistake from the resulting spot-kick. Ten minutes later, the game at the Vicente Calderon stadium was effectively over as Ronaldo netted his second penalty after Gareth Bale was brought down. Despite Atletico's fine run of form this season, they lacked spark as Real coasted into their third Copa del Rey final in the last four years. Fiorentina also made it through to their domestic cup final but their 3-2 aggregate defeat of Udinese, bidding to reach their first Italian Cup final since 1922, was far more dramatic. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg, Fiorentina found the first of the two goals they needed when Manuel Pasqual made the breakthrough after just 14 minutes. Shortly after the hour, Colombia's Juan Cuadrado scored the all-important goal in a game soured by the dismissal of two Udinese players in stoppage time, with Ghanaian Emmanuel Agyemang Badu sent off from the bench. Tensions frayed as Udinese narrowly failed to score the goal that would have taken the game into extra-time. Fiorentina will play the May final against either Napoli or AS Roma, with the team from the capital leading 3-2 after the first leg on home soil. In England, the Premier League took yet another twist as Chelsea dropped points for only the second time in nine matches. Thanks to a goal from Branislav Ivanovic, Jose Mourinho's side were leading 1-0 at West Bromwich Albion until substitute Victor Anichebe headed home in the 87th minute to salvage a 1-1 draw. The goal stopped the Blues from going four points clear at the top of the table, so offering the chance to either Arsenal (who host Manchester United on Wednesday) or Manchester City (who are also at home, against Sunderland) to climb above them. ""We were comfortable in the game, maybe too comfortable. We didn't kill the game when we had the chance,"" Mourinho told reporters. ""In this moment we have one more point than before. If Arsenal and City win (on Wednesday), they go above us but that is their job. Every game is difficult and every team needs points."" West Ham were among the night's biggest winners after their 2-0 home victory over Norwich City enabled a side that has recently been fighting relegation to climb up to 10th after a third straight win. Their rapid rise coincides with keeping four consecutive clean sheets in the top flight for the first time since 1985. Southampton went a sixth game without defeat as they won 1-0 at Hull to go just two points behind Manchester United, while relegation strugglers Cardiff could only draw 0-0 at home to Aston Villa.","Real Madrid beat city rivals Atletico 5-0 on aggregate to reach Copa del Rey final .

"(CNN) -- Doctors and hospital officials from Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, are notifying 18 neurosurgery patients that they might have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a serious and incurable neurological disorder. ""Today we are reaching out to 18 neurosurgery patients who were exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the last three weeks at Forsyth Medical Center,"" said Jeff Lindsay, president of the center, according to CNN affiliate WGHP. The hospital is in the process of contacting the 18 people, spokeswoman Jeanne Mayer said Tuesday. She was not sure how many had been reached. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, CJD affects about one person in every 1 million people per year worldwide. ""It is important to note that there are multiple variations of CJD and this case is not related to mad cow disease,"" Novant Health said in a statement. The hospital confirmed that on January 18, an operation was performed on a patient with CJD symptoms who later tested positive for the illness. Even though the surgical instruments were sterilized by standard hospital procedures, they should have gone through enhanced sterilization procedures used when there are confirmed or suspected cases of CJD. The original patient ""had neurological symptoms that could have been attributed to CJD or another brain disease,"" Novant Health said. ""There were reasons to suspect that this patient might have had CJD. As such, the extra precautions should have been taken, but were not."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the World Health Organization, recommends that surgical equipment used on CJD patients be destroyed or decontaminated through an intense disinfecting process. Although CJD can be transferred through surgical equipment, hospital officials say the likelihood of these patients contracting the disease is very low. The CDC corroborates that assessment. It says that no cases of the disease have been linked to the use of contaminated medical equipment since 1976. But Lindsay made no excuses. ""On behalf of the entire team at Novant Health, I apologize to the patients and their families, for having caused this anxiety."" CJD is a rare, degenerative and fatal brain disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. It's characterized by rapid, progressive dementia. Initial symptoms can include problems with muscular coordination, personality changes including impaired memory and thinking; and impaired vision. CJD is believed to be caused by a type of protein called a prion. It can be sporadic, hereditary or acquired; the acquired type is the rarest form, according to the NIH, and seen in fewer than 1% of cases. It is not contagious through casual contact. Asked whether the 18 people would be tested, Mayer said there is no quick test for CJD. The original patient underwent brain surgery and then the disease was found through a number of tests afterward, she said. In some cases, CJD can take years to show up, Mayer said. The hospital has instituted the enhanced sterilization process on all surgical instruments used in brain surgery, Novant Health said. In September, 13 patients received similar warnings from two hospitals in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, when a patient who had undergone neurosurgery was later suspected to have CJD. The hospitals shared the specialized surgical equipment that was used to operate on the patient and continued to use it until the suspicion of exposure to the disease surfaced.

"(CNN) -- Is it the end of an era for a side recognized as one of the best in football history? Just four players made the squads for all three of Barcelona's Champions League successes of 2006, 2009 and 2011 -- and now the first is set to leave in the shape of club captain Carles Puyol. On Tuesday, the all-action defender -- who turns 36 next month -- announced that he will sever ties at the end of the current season. This leaves midfielders Xavi, Andres Iniesta and goalkeeper Victor Valdes -- the only one of the quartet to play every minute of all three finals -- as the last bastions of those era-defining teams. ""After two very serious operations, I'm finding it very hard to get back to the level I need to be at to stay here,"" he told a news conference at Barca's training ground. ""Much more than I thought and much more than the surgeons told me. That's why I have made this decision."" Puyol's contract had been set to expire in 2016 but it will now terminate two years early because of the persistent knee trouble the veteran has experienced in recent years. Having spent seven months out of the game before returning last October, the defender has managed just five league games this season. Puyol, who captained Barca to victory in the 2006 and 2009 Champions League finals, has made 593 appearances for Barcelona, more than any outfield player save for Xavi's 709. Xavi, who skippered the side in the 2011 after Puyol was forced to start the game on the bench because of injury, celebrated his 34th birthday in January, although time would be appear to be on the sides of Valdes, 32, and Iniesta, 29. Iniesta, Xavi, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho may have lit up Barcelona's play with their sumptuous skills but it's questionable whether they embodied the Barca side during their years of dominance quite like Puyol. Defying his poodle-style haircut, the defender's displays were typified by his 'thou-shalt-not-pass' spirit as he made up for his relatively short stature for a center back (standing 5ft 10 inches) with unbridled commitment. Having made his debut against Valladolid in October 1999 under coach Louis van Gaal, Puyol spent the first five seasons of his Barca career without winning any silverware. So what does it say about the versatile defender, who moved to the center after starting out on the right, that this all changed in the very season he was appointed club captain? On May 14 2005, Barcelona drew 1-1 at Levante to win La Liga for the first time since 1999 -- sparking an avalanche of trophies. Five more league titles would follow in addition to two Spanish Cups, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups and the Champions League titles. Success also followed at international level where Puyol became part of an historic Spain side that ended a 44-year wait for a major trophy when clinching the 2008 European Championship, before then lifting the World Cup for the first time in 2010 -- with Puyol's header having knocked out a dangerous Germany in the semifinals. As he addressed the media on Tuesday, with another club legend -- Gerard Pique -- a notable attendee, Puyol explained that he will attempt to finish his Barcelona career with the attitude that has been his hallmark. ""There are three months of the season left and anyone that knows me will know that I won't give up and I'll keep fighting to the end to try to improve and help the team to achieve its objectives this season,"" he was quoted as saying by Barcelona's own website. ""I don't know what I'll do after June 30, but what I am sure of is that when the season ends I'm going to need to get some rest. I haven't stopped for four years because of injuries. After that, we'll see what happens."" Puyol joined Barcelona's youth team in 1995 and has never played for any other club. His onfield successes aside, the Spaniard will also be remembered for his gracious gesture during the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley. Despite appearing as a late substitute in the 3-1 win over Manchester United, the club captain passed up the opportunity to lift the trophy and instead handed the honor to Eric Abidal, who had had surgery to remove a liver tumor just two months earlier. That may well be among the many questions thrown his way at the end of the season, when Puyol says he will be delighted to reflect on his two decades at one of football's most distinguished clubs. ""I'd like to give a press conference at the end of the season and say farewell to all the people that have accompanied me though these 19 years,"" he said. ""Whoever wants to, whoever can -- presidents, directors, coaches, teammates, people from the club, reporters, friends, relatives -- that day I'll answer whatever questions they want. ""Thank you very much and see you soon!""","Club captain Puyol to leave Barcelona at end of the season .

"(CNN) -- They are former Olympic doubles champions, but Switzerland's ""dream team"" of Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka suffered another Davis Cup disaster on Saturday. Federer, a 17-time grand slam winner, and 2014 Australian Open champion Wawrinka crashed to a fourth successive defeat as a pairing in the international men's tennis tournament as unfancied Kazakhstan took a 2-1 lead in the quarterfinal tie. Andrey Golubev, who upset Wawrinka in Friday's singles, teamed up with debutant Aleksandr Nedovyesov to triumph 6-4 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) in match lasting just under three hours in Geneva. ""It feels special. That was my first match for the Kazakhstan Davis Cup team,"" said Nedovyesov, whose only previous appearance in the competition was for his native Ukraine in 2005. The 27-year-old is ranked 76th in singles and 126th in doubles. ""They are Olympic champions but honestly it doesn't matter who I beat, I'm just proud of my team and proud of my country,"" he added. Russia-born Golubev, who is ranked 61st, continued his unbeaten run in the competition this season. ""Against those guys you have to play an almost perfect match and I'm happy we did that today,"" the 26-year-old said. Golubev, who won both singles matches in the opening round against Belgium, will play former world No. 1 Federer in what could be the decisive rubber on Sunday. Third-ranked Wawrinka will try to keep Switzerland's semifinal hopes alive in the first of the reverse singles when he takes on world No. 56 Mikhail Kukushkin -- also born in Russia. Federer and Wawrinka were playing together for their country for the first time this season, but had lost their previous three matches in 2011 and 2012 following Olympic success at Beijing 2008. ""I'm not overly worried about what happened the last couple of days,"" Federer said. ""We are good players and we are the favorites still for each singles reverse match but we have no more margin for error so we are aware of that and, who knows, that's maybe going to make us play even better, so I'm really excited about tomorrow."" The winner of this tie will next play either Italy or Great Britain, which took a 2-1 lead in Naples after Andy Murray won his rain-delayed singles match and then returned to the clay court to triumph in the doubles. The world No. 8 completed a 6-4 7-5 6-3 win over Andreas Seppi before teaming up with Colin Fleming to beat Fabio Bognini and Simone Bolelli 6-3 6-2 3-6 7-5. Britain has not reached the semifinals since the World Group format was introduced in 1981, while Italy's last appearance was in 1998. The defending champion Czech Republic team marched into the last four after sealing an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Japan in Tokyo. Lukas Rosol and Radek Stepanek won 6-4 6-4 6-4 against Tatsuma Ito and Yasutaka Uchiyama to set up a clash with either France or Germany. Both teams are missing their No. 1 player, with Tomas Berdych absent for the Czechs and the injured Kei Nishikori out for Japan. France's hopes of a third semifinal in five years remain alive after Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra beat Tobias Kamke and Andre Begemann 6-1 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-5 in Nancy. The visitors will seek to come from 2-0 down for the fourth time in the nation's competition history, having last done so against Italy in 1996. Meanwhile, Switzerland also suffered a defeat at WTA Tour tournament in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday as highly-rated teenager Belinda Bencic lost in her first top-level semifinal. The 17-year-old upset Italian third seed Sara Errani at the Family Circle Cup on Friday, but could not repeat that form in another three-set match against Jana Cepelova. The 21-year-old Slovakian reached her first WTA final by triumphing 6-4 5-7 7-6 (9-7) on the green clay. Ranked 78th, she followed up shock wins over world No. 1 Serena Williams, Russian Elena Vesnina and compatriot Daniela Hantuchova. Cepelova will next play German Andrea Petkovic, who beat young Canadian sixth seed Eugenie Bouchard 1-6 6-3 7-5 in Saturday's opening semifinal. Bouchard beat former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic in her previous match but the 20-year-old -- who reached the Australian Open semifinals in January -- could not continue that form against Petkovic, a former top-10 player who is rebuilding her career after long-term injury problems.","Switzerland 2-1 down ahead of reverse singles in Davis Cup quarterfinal at home to Kazakhstan .

"(CNN) -- A powerful storm system brought drenching rains, hail and -- in a few cases -- tornadoes to a wide swath of the central United States on Thursday evening, causing damage but no known fatalities. The National Weather Service reported a number of twisters across several states. That includes a tornado spotted around 8:16 p.m. (9:16 p.m. ET) on the ground in St. Louis County, Missouri, near Glendale. About an hour earlier, the agency reported a ""damaging"" twister with quarter-size hail about 50 miles west near Washington. And a tornado was earlier reported in the Osage County community of Rich Fountain. It was not immediately clear whether there was any related injuries or damage in any of these Missouri locales. The weather service also reported twisters Thursday night in the southeastern Missouri community of Doniphan, as well as nearby in Butler County. Denton County, Texas, sheriff's office spokeswoman Sandi Brackeen said that ""a tornado touched down south of Krum."" Outbuildings and barns, but no known homes or commercial properties, suffered damage, said county emergency services chief Jody Gonzalez. ""We do have significant hail damage across the county -- downed tree limbs, roof and gutter damage, and busted windows,"" Gonzalez said, adding that some residents ""took pictures of little rope tornadoes that did touch down."" ""We do not have any reports of injuries,"" Gonzalez said. The weather service hasn't confirmed a Krum touchdown, but it did report one about 45 miles east, around Princeton, that crossed U.S. 380. The agency reported a twister in nearby Farmersville, 30 miles northeast of Dallas. While the threat of tornadoes often dies down when the sun and temperatures go down, that wasn't necessarily the case Thursday. St. Louis residents actually awoke Thursday to tornado sirens as a cluster of heavy thunderstorms began moving through. The weather service confirmed a tornado touched down about an hour before sunrise in the St. Louis suburb of University City, gouging a half-mile-by-100-yard path. The weather service gave the tornado an initial rating of EF-1, packing top winds of 112 miles per hour. The twister knocked down trees and ripped up a gas main in University City, but there were no injuries, University City Mayor Shelley Welsch reported via Twitter. St. Louis County officials said about 100 homes had been damaged. All day, it wasn't just strong winds that proved a problem. The national Storm Prediction Center noted reports of large hail falling Thursday in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Renato Reyes-Gomez sent CNNiReport a picture of golf-ball-size hail in Denton, Texas, saying he cannot recall anything ""ever this big."" Authorities in Jefferson County, Missouri, made ""a couple of water rescues and evacuated a couple of mobile homes"" due to rising waters there tied to flash-flooding reports that first came in around 2:15 p.m, said the county emergency management spokesman Warren Robinson. While several highways had closed, Robinson didn't know of any significant damage in his eastern Missouri county. Thursday's spate of tornadoes may have caused some damage and rattled some nerves. But at least it wasn't a repeat of what transpired exactly 40 years earlier, when 148 reported twisters killed 330 people across 13 states. The Storm Prediction Center is forecasting a slight risk of severe weather -- down from the moderate risk reported earlier -- for along and around the path of Mississippi River, as well as for a large swath of Texas, including Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Matt Smith, Henry Hanks and Jennifer Moore contributed to this report.","NEW: There's a slight risk of severe weather for parts of Texas, beyond for Friday .

"(CNN) -- Democrats need to show more political spine when it comes to the issue of taxes. This week, income taxes are on everybody's mind with Tuesday's filing deadline in view. Republicans have no interest in defending the progressive income tax system. Rand Paul, with an eye toward 2016, has called for a flat tax with one rate for all income levels. In their minds, the progressive tax is system has often been inequitable, and they claim that those who work hard are penalized for spurring economic growth rather than rewarded. Ever since conservatives undertook their ""starve the beast"" strategy in the early 1980s, Republicans have also been aware that continually cutting taxes is the best way to ensure that Democrats won't have the money they need to start new government programs. But Democrats can't afford to sit still when it comes to this issue. Too often in recent decades, Democrats have desperately tried to avoid the subject of taxes. When Republicans complain that taxes are bad, Democrats slip into the corner so that nobody asks them what they think. Ever since Ronald Reagan came to Washington in 1981 and slashed tax rates to historically low levels, Democrats have always felt that talking about a more vigorous progressive income tax system that brings more revenue into the federal government is toxic. They all remember when Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale admitted in a debate against Ronald Reagan in 1984 that he would raise taxes and suffered as a result. When President Bill Clinton took the step of raising taxes in 1993 to curb the deficit, his party suffered in the 1994 midterm elections. President Obama, who simply decided not to restore some of the Bush tax cuts, came under intense criticism and was branded a tax and spend liberal. The failure to defend taxation has its cost. At a time everyone is celebrating Lyndon Johnson's historic achievement with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Democrats should remember the consequences of another piece of legislation passed 50 years ago -- the Revenue Act of 1964 which provided an across-the-board tax cut, reducing top rates from 91% to 70%, the bottom rate from 20% to 10% and the corporate rate from 52% to 48%. This too was a historic tax cut, unequaled at the time, that liberal economists had proposed as a way to stimulate consumer demand. While many liberals signed on to the tax cut, including President Johnson, others warned that it would starve the government of needed revenue right as the President was embarking on an effort to build a Great Society. To obtain passage of the tax cut, which Johnson believed would stimulate the economy by the time of the 1964 election, he agreed to a stringent budget in order to win over the support of Virginia Democrat Harry Byrd, the conservative southern chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As a result of the tax cut, Johnson didn't have much money to play with early in his term. When he convinced Congress to pass the War on Poverty in 1964, it was done on the cheap. Congress didn't allocate, and he didn't ask for, sufficient money to construct programs capable of really taking a bite out of economic inequality. Many of the programs still did well and provided a huge boost to the disadvantaged, but the money that would have been needed to really eradicate poverty was never there. Johnson also backed away from other proposals, like the public works programs his Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz was proposing, because he didn't want to endanger the tax cut and didn't have enough funds to do more. Later in his presidency, Johnson would also hesitate to propose increased taxes to finance the war in Vietnam. He waited too long, fearful of the political consequences, finally approaching Congress in 1967 to ask for a temporary tax surcharge. But he did so when his political stock had fallen and the war was controversial. Congress passed a 10%, temporary tax surcharge in 1968, but only after forcing Johnson to agree to steep cuts in domestic spending and after inflation had really taken off. Another Democrat who took a very different approach to taxes was Franklin Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal. Early in the 1930s, FDR displayed an antipathy toward taxation, generally resisting any efforts to undertake a mass expansion of the tax system, which then only touched a small portion of the population. But did finally take steps to increase taxes on the wealthy, such as the enactment of the ""Wealth Tax"" in 1935 as well as the earmarked taxes tied to Social Security. In the middle of World War II, FDR became even bolder. He understood that we have to pay if we want the government to do great things. In other words, we needed ""Taxes to Beat the Axis."" In 1943 and 1944, FDR undertook a massive expansion of the income tax system, expanding the number of people subject to the income tax from 4 million to 44 million and instituting the policy of withholding at the source. The Department of Treasury conducted an aggressive campaign -- using film, radio and more -- to sell Americans on the idea that they had to sacrifice, through taxes, while other Americans were sacrificing their lives. Even Donald Duck was called in with the movie ""The New Spirit"" to persuade the nation that taxes were a patriotic duty. Irving Berlin wrote ""I Paid My Income Tax Today,"" which reminded Americans: ""You see those bombers in the sky? Rockefeller helped to build them -- so did I!"" The campaign worked and the tax system put into place remained a permanent part of the political landscape with upper level taxes reaching over 90% in the 1950s. While proposing taxes is politically frightening, it is necessary. And Democrats, as the party that believes in government, must also be willing to defend and fight for the progressive tax system that has been the backbone of domestic and foreign policy since the start of the 20th century. They need to find a way to build support for increasing rates and filling loopholes such as lower rates on dividends and capital gains and the earnings of hedge fund millionaires -- all of which exacerbate the problem of inequality in America.

"(CNN) -- A former mining tycoon accused of running a ""mafia-style"" gang to amass billions of dollars in personal wealth has gone on trial in China, facing charges including murder, state media reports. Liu Han was former board chairman of the Sichuan Hanlong Group, the largest private enterprise in the southwest Chinese province of Sichuan, with interests including mining, real estate, electricity, energy and finance. He also holds major stake in a number of Australian companies. Official Chinese news sources estimate his wealth, which was seized with his arrest, as in the ""tens of billions of yuan,"" or billions of U.S. dollars. The 48-year old, who was detained last year along with younger brother Liu Wei on suspicion of criminal activities, has been charged with a raft of crimes, including murder, financial crimes, operating casinos and gun-running, according to state news agency Xinhua. The trial against the brothers and 34 of their associates began in Xianning Intermediate People's Court in Hubei Province Monday, when a photograph of Liu Han in the court's dock, flanked by policemen, was published on social media networks by state news agencies. Details of the charges against the alleged gang -- including nine murder charges -- were carried in a Xinhua report in February. Gang of thugs . According to the report, the Liu brothers started out running gambling centers in their base in Guanghan, China's southern Sichuan Province, in the early 1990s, gathering around them ""a gang of local thugs and vagrants."" The report said the brothers' empire grew, before finally attracting the attention of central authorities with an alleged public shooting at a Guanghan teahouse one afternoon in January, 2009, supposedly directed at an underworld rival. According to the report, the two suspects detained over the attack, which killed three and injured two, allegedly identified Liu Wei as having ordered the attack. Liu Han also developed a reputation as a philanthropist, building a rural school campus following a 2008 earthquake that devastated Sichuan Province. His brother also had a reputation for charity, and had been a torch-bearer in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics, also in 2008, according to Xinhua. Anti-corruption purge . Large numbers of senior Communist Party officials are reportedly attending the trial, which is being closely watched for any signs of links to a potential investigation into former senior official Zhou Yongkang. The 71-year old was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, before he retired in 2012, and previously served as the czar of China's domestic security apparatus, and as the party chief in Sichuan from 1999 to 2002. Speculation has swirled in recent times that Zhou is set to become the next high-profile target of President Xi Jinping's heralded anti-corruption purge. Chinese state media has hinted that Liu Han's alleged gang operated with political connections to central government officials.","Chinese mining mogul accused of running mafia-style gang to amass billions in wealth .

We believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.vice.com) -- For someone who likes to talk about the virtues of disconnecting, the media critic Douglas Rushkoff seems surprisingly always on. When I visited him at his storefront office near his home in Hastings on Hudson, New York, he was preparing to teach a new class, getting ready for a BBC interview, writing an essay, staring down a pile of articles to read, trying to figure out his new iPhone, and hurrying to finish his third book in three years -- a graphic novel called ADD, which revolves around gaming culture, celebrity and the pharmaceutical industry. ""It also asks the question,"" he says, ""what if attention deficit disorder weren't a bug, but a feature?"" The hyper-speed hyperlinked life is familiar ground for Rushkoff, whose first book ""Cyberia"" made him a popular tour guide to the Internet in the early 1990s, and an early prognosticator of its radical potential. But much has changed between the awkward days of ""the 'Net"" -- then a non-commercial collection of public networks accessed by local ISPs -- and the overloaded era of Facebook, YouTube and iPhones. If Rushkoff is well-versed in the language underneath the ""digital revolution,"" he's also become one of its most outspoken critics. ""A society that looked at the Internet as a path toward highly articulated connections and new methods of creating meaning is instead finding itself disconnected, denied deep thinking, and drained of enduring values,"" Rushkoff writes in his recent ""Program or Be Programmed."" His remedy is simple, if ambitious: once people begin to understand how software works, ""they start to recognize the programs at play everywhere else. From the economy and education to politics and government, all systems have embedded purposes. The less we recognize them, the more we mistake them for given circumstances."" Understanding how things work In order to make them work better is the basic hacker ethos, but Rushkoff has applied it to his broader discussion of the way the culture and politics of the many are driven by the interests of the few. Between his landmark documentary ""The Merchants of Cool"" to his recent book ""Life Inc.,"" Rushkoff has indexed the risks that capitalism and corporate influence pose to democratic society. Or, to extend the metaphor, he's sought to show how we the users routinely get screwed by an ""operating system"" that's more than 500 years old. See the rest of ""Douglas Rushkoff in Real Life"" at Motherboard.vice.com . ""We're leveraged in so many ways, it's like, our economy is leveraged to produce more than it can in order for it to survive,"" he says. ""It's leveraged to grow. Human beings are financially leveraged now. So how do you roll that back and say, well, you know, 'this is it'?"" Or, rather, ""How do you get the good of a zombie apocalypse without the zombies? That's sort of what I'm trying to help people with."" Enter Occupy. Rushkoff has watched the movement with cautious optimism, penning editorials on CNN and organizing November's Contact Con, a powwow of net roots activists and open source hackers working to foster new civic-minded apps and hardware. To include prizes, Rushkoff enlisted the help of Pepsi, which ultimately granted $10,000 to the Free Network Foundation, which was profiled in our recent documentary. Rather than shun corporate sponsors, Rushkoff revels in what they bring to the table, and in the contradictions of the movement. Occupy's power, ultimately, is its meme -- the idea that a citizenry can not only protest the system but demonstrate a new way of responding to it and reworking it. Like his call to program, Occupy's nebulous mission may be hard to swallow or carry out. But that also lends it its own kind of power, he says. Its radical promise isn't unlike the earlier Internets: a distributed and open system that could change civic discourse and remake culture. But as on the strange battlefield of the Internet, Occupy could also crash against its own giant ambitions, which will be heavily tested in the next few months. Progress will have to be made gradually, says Rushkoff. ""There are ways to slowly move towards a sustainable life path, and it's just a matter of doing that, and I'm hoping that more people in Occupy start seeing it that way -- in that more subtle way, rather than exclusively in the kind of activist, let's-get-pepper-sprayed by cops way."" Much has changed in the decades since Rushkoff started critiquing the system. But his philosophy is still animated by a big question, one that applies not only to the digital spaces of the Internet, built by the Facebooks and the Googles, but to other kinds of ""public"" spaces too, in town squares, Congress, and culture: who programmed these spaces, and to what ends, and how can they be hacked into something better?","Motherboard sits down with media critic and author Douglas Rushkoff .

"(CNN) -- With the world's population set to reach the seven billion milestone later this year the challenge of feeding our planet has never been more urgent. But that challenge could become even greater as current models predict our population could reach nine billion by 2050. Is feeding these extra two billion people a mission impossible? Not according to study published in January by the French research agencies the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) & Agricultural Research for Development (CIRAD). The resulting report titled ""Agrimonde"" optimistically concludes it is possible to sustainably feed the future, though nothing short of a revolution in food production, distribution and consumption is required to do it. Most predictions in the field verge on the apocalyptic, warning of extreme shortages of food and widespread hunger in a rapidly expanding population. Depleting natural resources, land degradation, natural disasters and the impact of continued climate change also often hit the headlines. ""These fears are strongly related to the periods of food price volatility in 2007, 2008 and today,"" says Sandrine Paillard, deputy delegate in charge of foresight at INRA. ""(They) are also sustained by players who have interests in keeping our agro-industrial farming systems unchanged, in focusing on the goal of increasing yields even at the expense of the preservation of the environment and natural resources."" The UN's Food & Agricultural Organisation has predicted that we will need to increase food production of 70% by 2050. However Argimonde proposes an alternative scenario that would need an increase of just 35%. It suggests that increased food production from sustainable improvements and changing the consumption habits of the developed world would be enough to meet this goal. Agrimonde's authors suggest that by consuming 25% less in developed countries, developing regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, could increase consumption by 30%. One key to achieving Agrimonde's proposal is convincing people in rich countries to limit their waste and meat consumption and create more even distribution of animal products in diets around the world. ""Of course, it does not mean that what can be 'spared' in the rich countries could directly be used to feed population in developing countries,"" explains Paillard. ""It means that diffusion of our food consumption pattern all over the world would have a dramatic impact on natural resources and our ability to feed the planet in the future."" The uptake of more radical innovations, such as drought resistant GM crops, is another solution to increase food production, suggests Agrimonde's report. ""The main challenge will be in the rapid scaling up of these experiences, through knowledge dissemination and strong public policies, especially in developing countries,"" says Paillard. ""We have to make a shift of paradigm and this always encounters resistance from society and from economic players who find advantages in keeping the food and agricultural system unchanged.""","Global population is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050 .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- U.S. immigration officials have decided that an undocumented immigrant college student apprehended by authorities after driving without a license can stay in the United States for another year, the student said. Reached by phone as she rushed to class Tuesday evening, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl said the decision was ""like a big present."" A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Danielle Bennett, issued a statement saying the agency ""uses discretion on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate, and has the authority to grant a deferral of removal based on the merits of an individual's case and a review of specific facts."" She would not elaborate on the merits of Colotl's case. Colotl's immigration attorney, Charles Kuck, said his client was facing a deportation deadline later this week.  On Friday, he filed a petition with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for an extension to stop the removal order, arguing that Colotl's graduation was days away, and asking for time to allow her to put her personal affairs in order.  The petition also cited similar cases across the United States in which the deportations of undocumented students were being deferred. Kuck said the extension was granted Tuesday, and it allows Colotl to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension. Colotl, who is scheduled to graduate next week with a degree in political science, became a lightning rod in the immigration debate last spring. Activists on both sides of the issue said her case was a symbol of a broken system. Her legal problems started in March 2010, when police stopped her car on the Kennesaw State campus, saying she had been obstructing the flow of traffic in a university parking lot. Born in Mexico but living in the United States since she was 11, Colotl could not produce a driver's license, so she handed over as identification an expired passport from Mexico. She was arrested the next day and turned over to immigration officials. The young woman spent more than a month in the Etowah Detention Center in Alabama. Friends came out in force and marched on campus in Colotl's defense, and the university president spoke in support. In May, she was released and her deportation was deferred for a year to allow her to finish her studies. But she was quickly arrested on a warrant from the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and released on $2,500 bail. Cobb County participates in a federal program that allows jail officials to initiate deportation procedures for inmates believed to be in the country illegally. ""I'm just trying to live the American dream and finish my education,"" she said at the time. Kuck said despite the reprieve, the chances that Colotl will be able to remain in the country are still slim. He said it will be much harder to get a third extension next year. She could also be barred from re-entering the United States for up to 20 years if she is deported. CNN's Dan Gilgoff and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Student Jessica Colotl says the decision is ""like a big present""

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's dreams of an English domestic treble were left in ruins Sunday as they fall victim for the second year in a row to Wigan in the FA Cup. Last year's defeat in the final at Wembley preceded the departure of Roberto Mancini, but in many ways the 2-1 quarterfinal exit at their own Etihad Stadium was an even bigger giant killing feat. City under Manuel Pellegrini won the English League Cup at Wembley last weekend and are battling for the Premier League title, while Wigan have dropped to the second flight after being relegated following their own cup triumph. With fortunes revived under Uwe Rosler, who was a favorite son at Manchester City as a player, Wigan took the game to their illustrious opponents and led 2-0 through a first half penalty from Jordi Gomez and an early strike after the break from James Perch. City hit back with a goal from Samir Nasri, but in a frantic finish were unable to equalize as Wigan held out. Rosler, who has lifted Wigan from mid-table in the Championship to challenging for a playoff spot since taking over in December, hailed a ""tremendous performance"" from his side. ""Obviously a lot of things have been written (about his return to City) and I kept my emotions under control and focused on the job in hand, but the players made it easy for me the way they performed,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. A stunned Pellegrini must now get his team ready for a midweek trip to Barcelona, trailing 2-0 from the first leg in the Champions League last 16 tie. ""We are going to try to win every match we play and we will see who scores more points in the Premier League,"" the Chilean told BT Sport. ""It's important for a big team, when you have a setback, you have to react quickly."" Wigan face another massive test in the semifinals where they were drawn to play EPL title challengers Arsenal, who beat Everton 4-1 Saturday. The other last four clash will see EPL new boys Hull City take on Sheffield United of the third flight. United beat Championship strugglers Charlton 2-0 in their quarterfinal clash, with Ryan Flynn and John Brayford scoring within two minutes in the second half. Hull accounted for Sunderland, who were attempting to reach Wembley for the second time this season after losing to Manchester City in last week's League Cup final. David Meyler, who was at the center of the head-butting incident with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew last weekend in the EPL, scored Hull's second in the 3-0 win. He duly made his point by going over to the corner flag to mimmick the incident.","Wigan beat Manchester City 2-1 in FA Cup quarterfinal .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's newest hotelier Mark Fuller is showing commendable bravado for someone about to open a luxury hotel during a global recession. Entrepreneur Mark Fuller in the Sanctum Soho hotel, a rock'n'roll ""haven of hedonism"" in London. ""F*** the recession, let's get on with it,"" he says, while sitting on the roof terrace of the Sanctum Soho, a 30-room establishment dubbed the rock'n'roll hotel, as much for its ""anything goes"" service philosophy as the pedigree of its owners, which include the co-managers of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. ""We do not recognize there is a credit crunch because we believe you should battle through it,"" Fuller says, adding, ""If you get panicky and scary about things like this, you're no man at all."" Besides, he admits, three years ago when he started working on the concept of an 'alluring haven of hedonism' (as the hotel is described on its Web site), the credit crunch didn't exist. And by the time it hit, it was too late to pull out. ""We wouldn't do anyway,"" Fuller insists, adding ""fortune favors the brave, as they say.""  See images of the rock star hotel » . The former band manager turned entrepreneur, is looking quite the rock star tonight, decked head-to-toe in black while a shiny silver skull stares ominously from his belt buckle. Downstairs, staff are frantically preparing for a launch party that promises to be heavy on champagne, cocktails and celebrities. It's almost like the crunch doesn't exist. This is Fuller's world and he's hoping plenty of people will want to join it. ""In every downturn in the economic climate I think people look for some affordable glamour and escape,"" he says. Fuller also owns and runs the Embassy Hotel, an exclusive nightclub in the upmarket London suburb of Mayfair which he plans to franchise in Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. The partners in his new hotel venture ooze rock credential: Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor. While Taylor has experience running a restaurant and hotel, ""The Inn on the Green,"" Smallwood's experience in the hotel industry is based on 30 years on the road with Iron Maiden. Last year he stayed in 80 hotels in 40 countries and one of his biggest gripes is returning to his hotel after a gig and finding the bar is closed. ""You want good service, and you want the bars open, and you want good food available,"" he says from the roof terrace equipped with a bar and Jacuzzi he's taken to calling ""my lounge."" Smallwood expects to stay in the hotel once a week and says it will become a London bolt-hole for the band. While non-music types and the tone-deaf are welcome to stay in the hotel, over-enthusiastic groupies are not. ""If you're on the road for three months, you can never escape,"" Smallwood says. ""The fans, some of them, think they have a God-given right, just because they're staying in the same hotel, to put a camera in your face over your cornflakes."" ""The rule here is no autographs and no photographs,"" he says firmly. ""Say Paul Weller is sitting in the corner having a beer, and you go and ask for an autograph or photograph, you will not stay here again."" Along with privacy and a beer at all hours, guests have access to an on-call guitar doctor, a necessity, apparently, if you break a string while strumming in your room. Guests who have inadvertently left their guitar at home can hire one from reception. The rock star concept extends to the room decor. The silver wallpaper and mirrored columns may appear garish in daylight, but at 3 a.m. one suspects they add a touch of glamour. Free standing baths are a bold leap from the bed and the mini bar is well-stocked with champagne. Rod Smallwood is confident the concept will work. ""Recession or no recession, we're talking about 30 rooms in a huge major city. If we can't sell 30 rooms in the depths of recession it means we're useless, and we know we're not."" Mark Fuller says he's selling more than a hotel room. In times of economic crisis the Sanctum Soho offers the chance to forget the mortgage and live like a rock star, if only for a day. ""You can sit in the restaurant and have a hamburger for seven pounds ($10),"" he says. ""The drinks are cheaper than most hotels, and probably cheaper than most nightclubs. The room accommodation runs everywhere from £125 ($255) straight up to £450 ($650). Take your pick. Cut your coat."" I mishear him. ""Cut your coke?"" I ask. ""No, you can't do that!"" he exclaims. ""Musicians are not like that anymore,"" Fuller says. ""The music industry is such now that people release CDs to support tours, not the other way around, so this is a professional state. ""I just don't want to be the hotel at the end of the tour, then I'm in danger,"" he laughs.","Entrepreneur braves recession to open rock'n'roll hotel in London's Soho .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- France footballer Thierry Henry will meet his country's President Nicolas Sarkozy on Thursday to explain the national team's behavior during the World Cup, Sarkozy's office said Wednesday. The meeting, scheduled for 10:30 a.m. (4:30 a.m. ET), is at Henry's request, Sarkozy's office said. France was eliminated from the World Cup on Tuesday after a 2-1 loss to tournament host South Africa. French media slams 'shameful' exit . It followed an apparent collapse in relations between coach Raymond Domenech and his players that saw captain Patrice Evra left out of the match and the team refusing to practice on Sunday. Henry, once France's main striker and a World Cup winner in 1998, was reduced to a minor role in this year's tournament as he started all three matches on the substitutes' bench. Pedro Pinto: Heads should roll for French farce . France, traditionally among the strongest national sides in world football and the losing finalist in Germany four years ago, become one of the first to be eliminated this time around. Striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home after confronting Domenech at halftime during France's 2-0 defeat by Mexico last week. Evra was then involved in a public training ground dispute with the squad's fitness coach on Sunday and is reported to have led dissent over Anelka's expulsion from the squad, with the entire squad boycotting the training session. Adding to the confusion, French team director Jean-Louis Valentin then publicly announced his resignation to the media, while French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot has been in France attempting to mediate between Domenech and his players. France's World Cup nightmare ends in defeat . But on Monday night Bachelot told journalists the French players had ""tarnished the image of France,"" according to French sports newspaper L'Equipe. In an indication of the extent to which relations had broken down between Domenech and his squad, the coach on Monday described this players' decision to strike as ""unspeakably stupid,"" and called their actions ""an aberration and an imbecility."" ""Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high-level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football,"" Domenech told reporters. ""We tried to convince the players that what was happening was irregular, that their actions were unspeakably stupid. I told myself this masquerade had to be stopped. No way would I back this action."" France's problems at the World Cup had exacerbated long-standing dissatisfaction with the controversial Domenech, who is due to step down as national coach after the tournament to make way for former World Cup-winning defender Laurent Blanc. The French only qualified for South Africa by virtue of a tight playoff win over Ireland, sealed with the help of Henry's controversial handballed assist for William Gallas' goal. Exit at the group stage in South Africa marks a second successive failure in the opening stages of a major tournament, with France having crashed out of Euro 2008 without winning a match.","Thierry Henry to meet French president this week to discuss World Cup debacle .

"(CNN) -- Meghan McCain was on the talk-show couch, being grilled by the hosts of ""The View."" Does it bother her to hear jokes about her father's age? Megan, 23, started chuckling, and allowed, ""He IS old!"" Tension was replaced by laughter. But that was summer. These days, for Republican Sen. John McCain, age is no laughing matter. Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain and wife Cindy greet supporters Monday in New Mexico. Age as political issue has become a reality the McCain campaign does indeed have to face. McCain turned 72 in August, which would make him the oldest man to begin a first term as president -- three years older than Ronald Reagan. Clips of McCain making supposed age-related gaffes circulate on the Internet. Last month, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat and a supporter of Democratic candidate Sen. Barack Obama, said McCain's age and skin cancer history were fair game as a campaign issue. ""We're talking about a reality here that we have to face."" A few days ago, a liberal activist group, Brave New Films, ran a full-page ad in the New York Times, accompanied by a petition signed by more than 2,700 physicians calling on McCain to release his full medical records. All this skates over the fact that McCain already allowed reporters a peek at eight years worth of health records, dating back to 2000, while Obama has released a one-page summary from his doctor. McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said it's a double standard. ""The arbiters of this election  are not demanding the same level of disclosure about Sen. Obama. He's essentially running on a doctor's note. I had a harder time getting out of high school math class.""   Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta report on the age and health questions surrounding McCain » . McCain bristles when it is suggested that he might lack youthful vigor. Early in the primaries, he faced a blunt question from a New Hampshire teenager. Was he worried he would get Alzheimer's disease or die in office? ""I'm very active,"" McCain shot back. ""People will judge by the vigor and enthusiasm associated with our campaign. I've out-campaigned my opponents, every race I've ever been in."" He ended with a joke. ""Thanks for the question, you little jerk!"" In an effort to dispel health concerns, this spring McCain's campaign allowed select reporters, including CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a look at more than 1,100 pages of medical records. In a teleconference with reporters, Dr. John Eckstein, McCain's personal physician, declared him to be in excellent health. ""I and my colleagues can find no medical reasons or problems that would preclude Sen. McCain from fulfilling all the duties and obligations of the president of the United States."" Since 1993, McCain has had four skin cancers removed. McCain's biggest health scare came in December 2000, when he was found to have a Stage 2 melanoma on his left cheek. The cancer was about as wide as a dime and a little thicker than a nickel. By today's standards, his surgeons took an extremely aggressive approach, removing more than 30 lymph nodes even though a test showed the cancer had not spread. McCain's surgeon, Dr. Michael Hinni, said they simply wanted to err on the side of caution. McCain's records might be an open book compared to Obama's, but his campaign is a long way from full disclosure. They gave reporters three hours to look through the massive stack of paperwork, and didn't allow pictures or photocopies. Dr. Wendy Epstein is a dermatologist who signed a petition calling on McCain to release all his records to the public. ""Anybody running for the president gives up their right for personal privacy. Their health is my concern."" Epstein, who said she's a registered Democrat married to a Republican, said it's not clear whether McCain's most severe melanoma was related to the others, a so-called metastasis. ""We need to know: Did this melanoma spread, or didn't it? And that can only be answered by an independent group of dermatopathologists, looking at slides."" Hinni and McCain's dermatologist, Dr. Suzanne Connolly, said it was not a gray area: The cancer was clearly Stage 2. Gupta, one of few reporters to see the pathology report, said the file backs up that assertion. Eight years post-removal, Connolly said the chance of a recurrence is less than 10 percent. Bounds, the McCain spokesman, said it is ""unacceptable"" that doctors who haven't examined McCain are questioning his own physicians. ""This is a highly respected team of doctors he's been working with. They have concluded he is in perfect health."" Coming this weekend on CNN: Fit to Lead . Dr. Thomas Perls, a geriatrician who has conducted some of the most extensive research on aging, said advantages ranging from good health care to good genes work in McCain's favor. McCain likes to point to his mother, Roberta, still spry and giving interviews at age 96. Perls agreed that longevity runs strongly in families. ""Having a 96-year-old mom who's in pretty good shape definitely bodes well for him, and not only for his ability to get to older years, but to spend a greater period of that time in good health."" Perls' greater concern is mental sharpness. ""While we have some data about [McCain's] cholesterol and some other physical exam features, we don't really have good testing of his brain,"" said Perls. Studies based on census data show that by age 79, one in six Americans is suffering from cognitive decline, and that each year 12 percent of that group progress to full-blown dementia. To be clear, those are simply averages for the population as a whole, and there is no indication that McCain is suffering a cognitive decline. Voters might take heart from other leaders who served well into their golden years. Israel's Golda Meir was 76 by the time she left office. French President Charles de Gaulle was 78, and Nelson Mandela led South Africa until he was 80. Or McCain might take a page from Ronald Reagan, who was 73 when he ran for re-election in 1984. During a televised debate against Walter Mondale, then 56, Reagan famously began by saying, ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I will not hold my opponent's youth and inexperience against him."" The audience laughed. Reagan went on to win the election.","If elected president, John McCain, 72, would be the oldest man to begin a first term .

"(CNN) -- The body that represents England's professional footballers says it still has work to do to enable gay footballers to come out while still playing the game. Bobby Barnes, the Deputy Chief Executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), was speaking after Robbie Rogers, who quit the sport on the day he revealed his homosexuality last month, said it was ""impossible to come out"" while still playing. In his first media interview since, Rogers -- a former United States international who was playing in the English football league earlier this season -- admitted concerns about how both the dressing room and fans would react to news of an openly gay player. Having played for third tier Stevenage on loan earlier this season, the 25-year-old was released by parent club Leeds United in January, days before retiring from football when coming out through his personal website on February 18. ""I think the PFA -- along with all the stakeholders -- have a responsibility to perhaps redouble our efforts if players do not feel that enough is being done,"" Barnes told CNN.com. ""I think football has tried hard to create an environment where there is a supportive network around a player should he decide to come out as a gay."" Nonetheless, Rogers did not feel the environment was conducive to staying in the English game after his announcement and says he would have found it hard to come out at any global club -- after being asked whether he could have done so during a 2007-2011 stint with MLS side Columbus Crew. ""No. Not at any club -- anywhere,"" Rogers told England's The Guardian newspaper. Rogers is only the second footballer in England to have come out, with Justin Fashanu -- the first Â£1 million black player in the country's football history -- having tragically committed suicide in 1998, eight years after revealing his sexuality while still a professional. At present, Sweden-based Anton Hysen is the only openly gay footballer although other sportsmen have come out in different disciplines, such as Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz, Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas and English cricketer Steven Davies. In a wide-ranging interview, Rogers revealed the internal strife he went through when trying to reconcile his love of playing football for a living with his desire to be honest with those closest to him.

After Columbus Crew won the MLS Cup in 2008, what should have been a night of collaborative celebration for the winger -- who won 18 caps with the U.S. while also representing his nation at the 2008 Olympic Games -- turned to individual torment instead. ""We won that trophy in Los Angeles, in front of my family, with this amazing team. Afterwards we went to a bar and I was like, 'I should be so happy now...',"" Rogers recalled. ""But I left after a few drinks and sat on my own in my room, thinking, 'OK. I'm gay. But I can't come out because I love football so much. What am I going to do?'"" ""The more successful you become, the harder it is to step away."" Yet that is precisely what he did, despite being at an age where he had yet to reach his peak, with most footballers performing best in their late 20's. Barnes, who believes that Rogers' revelation received a positive response all round, with ""nothing negative"", feels the American may have been pleasantly surprised had he felt empowered enough to continue in the game after his announcement. ""I don't think he tested the water as such -- in that he had already made his decision to quit when the announcement was made -- but I hope he would have found a much more supportive arena,"" he said. ""I think the attitude now is far more: 'A player is gay, so what?' We don't see it as a major issue and I do not believe players do either. ""The big concern, I feel, is the negativity that players might receive from the terraces."" Rogers, who says he was 14-15 when he realized he was gay and who sometimes dated girls as a cover for his sexuality, did have concerns about his teammates however, in addition to those about supporters. ""Maybe a lot of fans aren't homophobic. But, in a stadium, sometimes they want to destroy you,"" he said. ""I was very fearful how my teammates were going to react. Was it going to change them? Even though I'd still be the same person would it change the way they acted towards me -- when we were in the dressing room or the bus?"" Even if he has yet to hear from another gay footballer in the game, Rogers has been so inundated with support from fellow players and the public that he has mixed feelings on his future. ""About a month ago I would've thought: 'I don't want to be a spokesman for gay footballers.' I have so many different things I'm interested in. ""But after thousands of emails, I'm thinking, OK, how can I help others? How can I make some positive change? How am I going to reach young Robbie and tell him to be himself? ""He might not fit the gay or football stereotype. That's one thing I definitely want to do -- break some barriers and kill some stereotypes."" And most intriguingly, a man who is weighing up a career in fashion and who co-owns a clothing label (Halsey) is finding himself being seduced by an old flame -- his former profession itself. ""Football will always be part of me. I don't know if I'm done playing yet. I might ask [the coach] Bruce Arena if I can train with LA Galaxy -- we'll see. I miss it and think about it a lot. ""But I'm so happy now I don't want to mess with that. Football was my life and maybe I'll need to go back ... or maybe I'll just be a fan. But it's an industry where there are lots of problems -- from sketchy agents to homophobic culture.""","The body that represents footballers in England may step up efforts to help gay players .

"(CNN) -- In a sea of uncertainty, two bits of good news emerged Wednesday. The Australian ship Ocean Shield picked up fresh signals that officials hope are locator beacons from the data recorders of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The ship had first picked up the underwater pulses Saturday. But then, for the next three days, nothing. On Tuesday, the ship once again reacquired the signals. That's four signals in the same broad area: two on Saturday; two on Tuesday. ""I believe we are searching in the right area but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370,"" Houston said. The second piece of good news? Authorities analyzed the signals picked up Saturday and determined they were not of . natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment. ""They believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder,"" Houston said. Signals getting weaker . Wednesday is Day 33 in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing March 8. It was carrying 239 people. Authorities haven't given up trying. Instead, they are pinning their hopes on the so-pings. But time is not on their side. The batteries powering the flight recorders' locator beacons are certified to be working for 30 days. Stored in a plane's tail, they are designed to begin sending off distinct, high-pitched signals as soon as they come in contact with water. ""The signals are getting weaker. Which means we're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying,"" Houston said. The first signal, at 4:45 p.m. Perth Time on Saturday, lasted 2 hours 20 minutes. The second, at 9:27 p.m. Saturday, lasted 13 minutes. The third signal was picked up Tuesday at 4:27 p.m. That lasted 5 minutes 32 seconds. The fourth, at 10:17 p.m. Tuesday, was 7 minutes long. ""It's certainly encouraging that more signals have been detected,"" Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN. ""There is still much work to do, however."" Four reasons to believe; six reasons to doubt . Discovery of possible 'locator beacon' pulses gives hope . Wednesday's search includes up to 11 military planes, four civilian aircraft as well as 14 ships -- three of which, Australia's Ocean Shield further north and the British HMS Echo and Chinese Haixun 01 to the south -- will be focusing underwater. All told, everyone involved will be scouring a 29,000-square-mile zone centered about 1,400 miles northwest of Perth, according to Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. That's large and challenging, but still pales in comparison to the once nearly 3 million miles, at sea and on land, the searchers were scouring for signs of the lost aircraft a few weeks ago. Kevin McEvoy, a New Zealand air force commodore involved in the effort, noted that authorities once ""didn't even know which haystack"" to look in for the aircraft. ""I think we have got a much clearer picture around the areas that we need to concentrate on,"" McEvoy told CNN's Erin Burnett from Auckland. Authorities greatly shrank that area after analyzing satellite data to determine Flight 370 had set off from Kuala Lumpur toward Beijing, turned around to go back over the Malay Peninsula, then ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. Why? No one really knows. The best chance to answer that question may rest wherever the plane -- and its so-called black boxes, with their trove of information about the plane and its movements -- now resides. Search planes dispatched day after day looking for evidence of the missing airliner -- a floating wing, a seat cushion, anything -- thus far have come up empty. The latest, greatest hopes have come from crews listening underwater for signs of Flight 370. The first such possible breakthrough came last Friday and Saturday, when a Chinese ship detected pulses that may have been from the plane. No more have been heard since. According to McEvoy, ""the main focus"" centers around the site of Saturday's discovery from Australia's Ocean Shield. It used more advanced detection gear than that aboard the Chinese vessel and was found some 375 miles away, leading Houston to believe they are separate signals. The first signal, detected by a towed pinger locator, persisted for more than two hours; a second went on for about 13 minutes. Tuesday afternoon, it lasted about 5 minutes and 32 seconds. Tuesday night, about seven minutes. Beyond the dwindling battery life, there's all the ocean to contend with: The Ocean Shield signals were in water about 2.6 miles deep, meaning a number of things could literally get in the way of or otherwise disrupt the pulses. Searchers' intent not to roil the waters any further is why air and seaborne traffic in that find area is being limited, and why there is no rush to put in underwater drones to take photos. ""The better the Ocean Shield can define the area the easier it will be for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to subsequently search for aircraft wreckage,"" Houston said. Bear in mind with the Air France disaster, it took the underwater vehicle 20 days to get to the wreckage."" What happens after the Malaysian plane's pingers die? And it's not as if, if more pulses are detected, they'll lead down in a straight line to the flight recorders. As is, the pings that were heard could have emanated from anywhere within a 5-mile radius, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Finding more signals could narrow the search area. Without them, authorities could then start the painstaking process of using side-scanning sonar to try to find the aircraft on the ocean's bottom. Meanwhile, the air search continues. As McEvoy explained, this area is ""slightly different"" than that being probed for pings because it is focused on surface debris, which would have shifted over the past few weeks -- thanks in part to a cyclone packing winds in excess of 160 mph that pushed through two weeks ago. So far, none of the aircraft that have been sent out has found anything. And even if it is narrowed, Wednesday's air search area is still roughly the size of South Carolina. As Wing Cmdr. Andy Scott of New Zealand stated: ""It's a large task that's still ahead of us."" Next steps in underwater search . Pings without wreckage 'befuddling' The absence of wreckage near these detected signals leaves some skeptical, worried that the Chinese and Australian ship's finds could be yet another false lead in an investigation that's been full of them. Acknowledging ""a very high-speed vertical impact"" could explain the lack of aircraft remnants, CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said there's reason to be cautious. ""It's either the most extraordinary event, or those pings weren't real,"" O'Brien said. ""It's somewhat befuddling."" Sarah Bajc, the partner of American passenger Philip Wood, isn't convinced about anything. She told CNN's Erin Burnett she thinks the plane was hijacked. Whether that proves true, one thing she won't believe are the Malaysian officials heading the investigation. ""All of us pretty well agree that until there's the bulk of the plane, the bulk of the bodies discovered, and a black box intact, we won't believe that it's final evidence,"" Bajc said early Wednesday from Beijing. ""... I don't think the authorities have given us much confidence of their investigative skills so far."" The lack of clarity makes it hard to ""grieve properly and ... move on,"" -- something that she's not yet willing to do. ""I want to fight to find him, in whatever form that ends up being,"" said Bajc, who is coordinating with other passengers' kin to press for answers. ""And I think most of the families feel the same way."" Until they get answers, women and men like Steve Wang -- whose mother was on the Malaysia Airlines plane -- are clinging to hope while trying to hold themselves together. ""We're just going through so many kinds of emotion,"" said Wang. ""... Desperate, sad and helpless -- something like that. Everything."" Timeline: Leads in the hunt for Flight 370 weave drama .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Passengers and crew members thwarted an attempt to hijack a plane in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang, local authorities said Friday. Ten minutes into the flight between the cities of Hotan and Urumqi, six people on board the plane tried to take control of it ""through violence,"" a short statement by the provincial police said. The passengers and crew members managed to subdue the alleged hijackers, sustaining minor injuries in the struggle, police said. The plane then returned to Hotan. Once the plane was back on the ground, police took the suspects, all ethnic Uyghurs, into custody. Police later released their names on state media. The government said it plans to honor crew members and passengers who offered help. Two air marshals and two flight attendants were injured, the Civil Aviation Authority in Beijing said. ""During the incident, crew members were brave and resolute,"" the authority said. ""The cockpit crew remained calm and landed the aircraft safety at the origin airport. Many passengers were courageous and acted promptly to offer help, highlighting their sense of justice and responsibility as citizens. They played a key role in an emergency situation by safeguarding state security, saving lives and protecting property."" Authorities said the case is still under investigation but operations at the Hotan airport have returned to normal. Uyghurs are Turkic Muslims, a group linguistically, culturally and religiously distinct from China's majority Han population. Chinese authorities have often blamed militants of Uyghur descent for outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang in recent years, labeling them terrorists. Xinjiang was rocked by the worst violence in decades in July 2009 when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left nearly 200 people dead and 1,700 wounded in the regional capital, Urumqi. Last year, the authorities carried out a two-month security operation, which ended in October, against violence, terrorism and radical Islam across Xinjiang, a resource-rich region that borders Pakistan, Afghanistan and several Central Asian states.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- I landed in Beijing on a December afternoon after a conference in Japan. Walking on the air bridge, I looked out of the window and noticed that it was dark. Subconsciously, I looked at my watch, and it was 4:40 pm. Though it was winter and the sun sets early, it was too early to be so dark. It turned out to be another day of heavy smog in Beijing. The moment I drove out of the parking lot, I realized how terrible it was. Visibility was extremely low, as if a dense fog had descended upon the city. The headlights and taillights were hazy, and I couldn't see much beyond the highway. I felt that the air I breathed in was heavier, and that something was irritating my eyes. The joy of homecoming was instantly replaced by the sadness of living in a heavily-polluted city. Residents of Beijing and nearby cities seem to have become accustomed to such heavy smog, but those in the Yangtze River Delta to the south have not. So it became national news when, starting from December, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other cities in that region were cloaked in heavy smog for about a week. Schools and highways were closed, and many flights were canceled. In the past, Beijing was called China's capital of smog. Now China has a smog belt that extends from Beijing all the way to Shanghai. It took a little more than three years to build up the high speed railway that connects Beijing and Shanghai, but it took less than two years for smog to spread from Beijing to Shanghai. At this rate, the nationalization of smog will be accomplished in even less time. This new ""great leap forward"" in pollution could be as disastrous as the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s, when a push to industrialize and collectivize caused a famine that reportedly killed millions of people. Smog is a major cause of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. According to Chen Fengjuan, a doctor at the No. 8 Shanghai People's Hospital, the number of respiratory patients treated by the hospital in early December increased by 96%, and medical costs for these patients increased by 195%, compared with statistics from the same period last year. Though a little bit outdated, a study conducted in 2007 by the World Bank and the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration reported that 750,000 Chinese people die prematurely every year, mainly due to air pollution in large cities. Thus China may well become sick before it becomes modern. In the 19th century, China's reputation as the ""sick man of East Asia"" stemmed from foreign aggression and internal division. Ironically, in the 21st century, that tag is a product of China's growing power. For a government that has relied on economic performance as a cornerstone of its legitimacy, it has had few incentives to slow down economic development for the sake of environmental protection. The China model thus boils down to ""development at all costs."" Yet faced with mounting public discontent and anger, the central government has taken some measures to address environmental pollution, such as the ""Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution"" released in September last year. To achieve the goals set out in the plan by 2017, the government needs to invest $1.75 trillion, according to one estimate. This is more than twice the amount of the economic stimulus package that the Chinese government launched in 2008. In defending the government's GDP-centered growth strategy, some Chinese officials point out Western countries also adopted the model of ""development first, conservation later"" in their early stages of modernization. This is true, and Western countries paid a dear price too. In the United States, names such as Donora and Los Angeles still evoke memories of heavy smog and tragic human loss. But one advantage late-developing countries hold is that they can avoid repeating the same mistakes made by early-developing countries. There is no need for millions of Chinese to die prematurely before the Chinese government takes immediate and decisive action to reduce pollution. These days the ""China dream"" is a hot topic among Chinese officials and scholars. The Chinese government certainly deserves credit for the dramatic improvement in material welfare of the Chinese people over the past three decades, which is undoubtedly an important component of the China dream. However, it seems that today the biggest dream of the average Chinese is to have more days of fresh air and blue sky. If the Chinese government cannot make this come true for the Chinese people, the China dream may well become a China nightmare. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tao Xie.","China's ""smog belt"" is expanding, with disastrous health implications, says Tao Xie .

"(CNN) -- Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who drew heavy criticism from Republicans over her statements after the September attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state on Thursday. In a letter to President Barack Obama, she said ""the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive, and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country."" Obama acknowledged her letter in a statement that described her as ""an extraordinarily capable, patriotic, and passionate public servant."" He will meet with Rice Friday at the White House, National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Read Rice's letter to the President . She was thought to be a frontrunner for the post, which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would vacate as soon as a successor is confirmed. Democrat 'extremely upset' with Rice's withdrawal . But Rice drew criticism for her description of the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. On several television programs several days after the attack, she described a protest of an anti-Islam video outside the mission buildings. She said her comments were based on declassified talking points, and sources within the intelligence community said the talking points were not modified by any other body, such as the White House. She further explained her decision to withdraw and defended herself Thursday in a piece for the Washington Post, writing: ""I have never sought in any way, shape or form to mislead the American people. ... Even before I was nominated for any new position, a steady drip of manufactured charges painted a wholly false picture of me."" Obama had defended her, describing the criticism from several key Republicans as ""outrageous."" ""If Senator (John) McCain and Senator (Lindsey) Graham and others want to go after someone, they should go after me,"" Obama said at a White House news conference in late November. ""When they go after the U.N. ambassador, apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me."" She visited Capitol Hill in an attempt to answer what the legislators called ""unanswered questions,"" but her visit there appeared to backfire. Senators who sat in on the meetings said her appearances raised more questions than they answered. 5 questions on Susan Rice . Her closed-door meetings ""really hurt her,"" one knowledgeable Democratic source said. ""She probably underestimated the club."" The longer Rice went un-nominated, the source said, the worse her prospects appeared. It was ""better to get out now"" so that Obama could begin announcing a national security slate as early as next week. In a statement, Clinton called Rice ""an indispensable partner over the past four years."" ""From the National Security Council to the State Department to the United Nations, Susan has worked tirelessly to advance our nation's interests and values. I am confident that she will continue to represent the United States with strength and skill,"" Clinton said. After Rice's Thursday announcement, Graham said in a statement: ""I respect Ambassador Rice's decision. President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next secretary of state."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described Republican opposition to Rice's possible nomination as ""shameful."" ""Ambassador Rice is eminently qualified to serve as Secretary of State and she could have been confirmed by the Senate. The politically motivated attacks on her character from some of my Republican colleagues were shameful,"" the Nevada Democrat said in a statement. ""Their behavior was a disgrace to the Senate's tradition of bipartisan cooperation on national security issues and beneath the stature of senators with otherwise distinguished records on national security."" Rice's decision to not seek the post now leaves Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, as the presumed frontrunner for the spot. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other high-ranking officials are also expected to depart soon. Kerry praised Rice as ""an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant"" in a statement after her announcement. ""I've known and worked closely with Susan Rice not just at the U.N., but in my own campaign for president. I've defended her publicly and wouldn't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment,"" he wrote. ""We should all be grateful that she will continue to serve and contribute at the highest level. As someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be, I've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks, but I also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction."" Kerry's road to the State Department, should he be nominated, would appear to be smoother than Rice's. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after Rice's announcement that Kerry would be a ""popular choice with the Senate."" Obama's cabinet: Who's in, who's out? Another Senate Republican, Rob Portman of Ohio, named Kerry as one of Obama's ""better choices"" for the spot, according to The New York Times. But despite his lauded role assisting Obama in preparing for the presidential debates this fall, Kerry is understood to be less of an Obama confidante than Rice. Kerry is a decorated veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam before his career as a lawyer and then in the U.S. Senate. His assignments there include the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Should Kerry step down before his term ends in 2014, Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary replacement to hold the seat until a special election could be held. The special election race would likely include Sen. Scott Brown, who won in a special election three years ago but lost his bid for a full term, as well as Democratic Rep. Ed Markey, who is seriously considering a bid should Kerry's seat open, a Democratic source said. On Thursday, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire said she had ""respect"" for Rice's decision, ""however, my concerns regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi go beyond any one individual. I remain deeply troubled by the continued lack of information from the White House and the State Department. With four of our public servants murdered, it is critical that we get to the bottom of what happened."" Ayotte told CNN after the late November meeting with Rice, Graham, and McCain, ""Certainly she misled the American public."" Opinion: A lucky day for Susan Rice . Former CIA Director David Petraeus, who resigned last month after admitting to an extramarital affair, returned to Capitol Hill to testify on the attacks, and Clinton is scheduled to testify next week. Sen. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican from Maine, said through a spokesman that the Senate Homeland Security Committee, where she serves as ranking member, would continue its investigation into the Benghazi attack. She had raised her own questions about Rice's potential nomination after a private meeting with the ambassador. The Thursday decision was Rice's own; she was not asked to step aside in the consideration process, a former administration official who had knowledge of her decision said. ""She has got a lot of honor, a lot of dignity, a lot of patriotism. This was a completely manufactured distraction, and she was determined to put her country first,"" the former official said. ""No nominee for secretary of state has been subjected to such a sustained campaign of politicization and slander. And it is really troubling."" Madeleine Albright, who was the first woman to serve as secretary of state and has known Rice for decades, said Rice is ""brilliant"" and described her withdrawal from consideration as ""sad."" ""I think it is genuinely, genuinely sad because she is one of the smartest people that I know and completely dedicated to serving the United States,"" Albright told CNN. Rice ""put the country and the president ahead of her own ambition. It just shows what a tremendously thoughtful and good and responsible person she is."" In her letter to Obama, Rice wrote ""the position of secretary of state should never be politicized."" ""As someone who grew up in an era of comparative bipartisanship and as a sitting U.S. national security official who has served in two U.S. administrations, I am saddened that we have reached this point, even before you have decided whom to nominate,"" she wrote. ""We can not afford such an irresponsible distraction from the most pressing issues facing the American people."" Rice served in President Bill Clinton's administration on the National Security Council, eventually leading African affairs for the council and serving as a special assistant to the president. She was confirmed by the Senate as the top diplomat to the U.N. in January 2009. If Rice had been nominated, she would have faced criticism from religious leaders about her role in the Clinton administration's handling of the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN that Rice's decision was ""probably for the best."" ""I think Ambassador Rice was facing an uphill battle in the senate for any confirmation she may have received,"" he said. Asked in an interview Thursday on NBC whether she wanted the top diplomatic post, Rice replied that she ""would have been very honored to serve in that job."" She added, ""But yeah, sure.

"Yusufeli, Turkey (CNN) -- The most impressive thing about Yusufeli is the people who live there. When we go on shoots with CNN's Earth's Frontiers, it's usually the spectacular scenery, or technical wizardry that we are trying to film. This time we had to film a way of life -- people and animals and nature. In a word, biodiversity. Yusufeli in the Kaçkar Mountains is famed for its wealth of species. The rural areas are alive with bees buzzing, frogs croaking and the sound of rushing water. Brown bears roam the upper slopes of the mountains. In the town itself, old men sit outside and play backgammon with a cup of Turkish tea to hand. It's very picturesque. And it's under threat from an unlikely source. The Yusufeli dam project is part of Turkey's national plan to expand its use of hydropower. This is a huge project, which will eventually see up to 3,000 working dams all over the country. The Çoruh River, which runs through the town, will eventually have 15 dams on it. When the project is complete the town will be flooded, but the dam system will provide one tenth of Turkey's electricity. And that's the crux of the matter. Turkey is a rapidly developing country with one of the fastest growing economies in the world. As the mayor of Yusufeli told us, ""Energy has an important role to play in terms of the development of countries."" Nobody can deny that hydro is one of the cheapest, cleanest, most efficient ways of producing electricity. That means the Yusufeli dam is a very attractive proposition for the state and perhaps a sacrifice for the greater good. At the moment Turkey's energy sector is dependent on dirty, expensive fossil fuels, which are imported. By capitalizing on the country's rivers, the state moves towards greater energy independence. I arranged an interview with DSI, the state hydraulic company that is building the Yusufeli dam. But when we turned up, they refused to speak to us on camera, despite having agreed to the interview some weeks before. The company said the situation was ""sensitive."" The people of Yusufeli have been waiting for the axe to fall for some time. One resident we interviewed said he had first heard talk of a dam forty years ago. Most people we spoke to said if it was going to come, it should come soon. All residents were unsure of their future. And yet I was struck by the building sites all over the town. Yusufeli residents have not yet accepted this dam. Mustafa Yikilmaz, a local NGO worker, described his town as ""thriving."" The Çoruh River is the second fastest river in the world, which draws rafting tourism to this small town from all over the world. Yusufeli is also one of the UN's designated ""biodiversity hotspots"". There are over 200 species of butterflies in this region alone. And it is along these lines that the campaign to stop the Yusufeli dam continues. Locals who have worked the land using traditional methods are joining with NGOs and international campaigners to raise the profile of Yusufeli as an area of exceptional importance. Following several campaigns, some European financial backers have withdrawn their support for the dam. This is a problem without a satisfactory answer. Biodiversity is important. And yet if countries like Turkey want to develop, hydro-electricity is a clean, efficient way of doing so. Will Yusufeli dam be built? Will progress win out over preservation?

"(CNN) -- A South Dakota ranch worker who found a record-setting hailstone says the chunks of ice falling from the sky sounded like ""big bricks"" being thrown at his house. Leslie ""Les"" Scott found the record-breaker, which is almost the size of a soccer ball, last week.  It's been been officially declared the largest ever recorded in the United States, in terms of both diameter and weight.  The hailstone measured 8.0 inches in diameter, had a circumference of 18.62 inches, and weighed one pound, 15 ounces, according to the NOAA National Climate Extremes Committee. Scott says larger hailstones fell around the tiny town of Vivian, South Dakota last week.  As severe thunderstorms swept through the area on July 23, Scott says he and a few friends gathered on a hilltop to watch the weather system.  He abandoned his position when he saw twisters taking shape in the clouds, but continued watching the storm from his home.  He told CNN that he saw hailstones that were as large or larger than the one he actually kept.  In fact, Scott said the smallest hailstone he found was about the size of a tennis ball. Damage around the town is also evidence of the unusual large size of the hailstones that fell, according to Scott. He said there are patches on every home in Vivian.  Hailstones punched through many roofs and ended up in attics and even bedrooms. As for the record-breaking hailstone itself, Scott said it's unusual shape was what caught his attention initially.  He told CNN that, as he watched the storm pass, he saw this particular stone falling from the sky and thought it looked ""spidery.""  On closer inspection, he found it covered in ""fingers"" of ice that were four or five inches long . Scott immediately took steps to preserve his unique specimen.  But the after-effects of the storm interfered.  He put it in the freezer but a power outage lasting 5 or 6 hours caused some melting.  Scott said many of the ice ""fingers"" that first attracted his attention disappeared and the entire hailstone shrank a bit.  He believes it was up to eleven inches in diameter when he picked it up the first time. With the focus in Vivian firmly on cleaning up and repairing homes, Scott seems bemused by the new-found notoriety that has come along with breaking a U.S. record.  He wasn't even the one who notified weather officials about the hailstone.  News about its unusual size actually spread by word-of-mouth.  Scott says he was surprised when he started getting calls from the media. It was the weather office in Aberdeen, South Dakota that notified regional weather authorities about the discovery.  They asked the National Climate Extremes Committee to evaluate the stone.  Official measurements were submitted to the committee of three, who then certified that the hailstone was a record-breaker. Scott says the weather in his area has been ""way out of whack"" all summer.  It's been much wetter than normal, and says he can keep track because he has to cut the grass about twice as often as he normally does. Even Scott's mother has been talking about how strange the weather has been during the summer of 2010.  She's celebrating her 86th birthday Friday, and Scott says she's never seen anything like this before in her life. Scott's hailstone actually broke two previous records.   The previous record in the weight category came from a hailstone that fell in Coffeyville, Kansas.  It weighed 1.67 pounds. The previous record-holding hailstone in the diameter category fell in Aurora, Nebraska.  It measured 7 inches across.  This stone -- at 18.75 inches -- still holds the hailstone record for circumference.","NEW: Hail sounded like ""big bricks"" being thrown at the house .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal battled for nearly six hours with Novak Djokovic at the 2012 Australian Open, the longest grand slam final in history. Seemingly on the verge of exiting in the fourth set, Nadal rallied and then led by a break in the fifth before his Serbian opponent ultimately had the last word. When the bruising slugfest was over, in an unusual move, the players were given chairs during the trophy presentation. Nadal's loss to Stanislas Wawrinka this January in the Australian Open final featured a more routine looking scoreline and lasted a shade over two hours, so nowhere near as tiring -- but the world No. 1 says it was tougher to deal with than the reverse to Djokovic. That's because Nadal hurt his back in the warm-up and wasn't able to compete at 100%. The injury, coupled with Wawrinka's play, led to the Swiss claiming his first grand slam title. Nadal was the heavy favorite pre-match, owning a 12-0 head-to-head record without dropping a set. ""It was one of the toughest moments in my career,"" Nadal was quoted as saying by the ATP's website Thursday at the BNP Paribas Open. ""It was tough being there for 90 minutes knowing that you will not win. But not winning was not the worst thing. The worst thing was knowing I could not compete. ""When you are losing and competing, that's part of sport. This loss was worse for me than 2012 and the six hours against Novak. I did everything right to be there and compete in the final, and I couldn't. Wawrinka was playing unbelievable. I don't know if I would have had the chance to win that match because he was playing amazing."" Nadal admitted it took a while for him to get the loss out of his system. ""I am a great loser,"" he said. ""Normally after a few hours I forget about the losses and look straight to the next thing, but after this tournament it took a little bit more time."" The back still not recovered, Nadal skipped an event in Argentina last month but returned -- and won -- in Brazil. He says the back is now ""healthy,"" bad news for his opponents in the California desert. It's Nadal's most successful hard-court Masters tournament, having won in Indian Wells three times and only failing to reach the semifinals once. Last year Nadal triumphed not long after his comeback from a serious knee injury. ""It was one of my most special titles,"" he said. Nadal faces a tricky draw, however, with Wawrinka, Roger Federer and Andy Murray in his half. Azarenka uncertain . Meanwhile in the women's draw, two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka played down her chances after only recently recovering from a foot injury. Azarenka was forced to wear a protective boot so the foot could heal. ""When you hear for the first time from the doctor, 'You've got to wear a boot for three weeks,' and the tournament is in four and a half weeks you're like, 'Okay, well, we'll see how it goes.' ""What I expect for myself is to fight for every ball. The rest is a little bit of an unknown for me right now. ""The first match is going to happen. I'm going to go out there and I'm going to play. The most important thing for me is that my foot feels good.""

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Tito Mukhopadhyay uses poetry to talk with his mother, Soma. The autistic teenager is a published author. (CNN) -- Tito Mukhopadhyay shuffles to the front door of his home in Austin, Texas. He's coming home from school, something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. His mother, 45-year-old Soma Mukhopadhyay, is considered a pioneer in a breakthrough treatment for some autistic children who face the stigma of being considered ""mentally retarded."" That was a label Soma never accepted for 19-year-old Tito. And after hearing Tito's story, you'll never look at an autistic child the same way. ""How was your day?"" Soma asks. Before Tito can answer, he obsessively moves around the house, placing the TV remote in its proper place, arranging the salt and pepper shakers just so. Then he sits down in front of his specially designed keyboard to type his response. ""It was like a floating kangaroo that kept itself invisible,"" Tito answers. Tito's cryptic reply is part of his  medical condition. But his distinctive way of speaking is also a gift that has made him famous in a misunderstood community.  Watch Tito interact with his mother » . Though Tito is virtually mute, that changes when he picks up a pencil to write, or begins tapping at his keyboard. He is a poet, and the author of several books and essays in which he eloquently describes what it's like to be autistic. In his writings, he explains why he doesn't make eye contact, what it is like to be obsessed with a ceiling fan, and how his brain has trouble processing sound, touch and sight all at once. Experts confirm Tito's observations of autism. One doctor described it as the way the brain fails. None can agree on its exact cause, but most believe there is a genetic predisposition to the condition, with significant environmental triggers involved. The developmental disorder affects the way the brain works and affects the way the child interacts with society. Some doctors and parents see a link between childhood vaccines, others suspect pesticides or drugs taken during pregnancy. The theories are endless and most experts agree there is no single cause. Whatever autism is, its symptoms range from a mild form to rendering individuals dependent on others for life. Many people with autism are able to take in information very well, but the wiring in the brain simply won't allow the information to be processed in the form of organized thought and language. Tito has given experts some rare insight into what that feels like. His poetry includes stanzas like this: . ""I am he. And I am me. I am he behind that mirror . I am me watching the he."" One of his favorite books is Plato's ""Republic."" The world may have never known about Tito's gift except for the efforts of his mother, Soma, who is from India. Doctors there told Soma that Tito was mentally retarded and beyond hope. She gave up her career in chemistry, determined to teach him. Eventually, an organization in the United States brought Soma and Tito, then 10 years old, to the United States to study him because he defied the stereotype of an autistic child. Soma's method of teaching Tito is called the Rapid Prompting Method. I watched her work with other children at the HALO -- Helping Autism through Learning and Outreach -- center in Austin, Texas, where she teaches while Tito attends school. The therapy starts by asking the children to point at words on pieces of paper. Once they've mastered that, they use the stencil. If their motor skills develop well enough, the children will type on a specially designed keyboard. Her technique seems to be working for the children who attend therapy at HALO. There is a yearlong waiting list for four-day therapy sessions. It can take years to see progress. Rapid Prompting has not been tested in long-term scientific studies, and Soma is not without her critics. Some criticize her methods as harsh and unproven. During her sessions, Soma never says ""good job,"" never rewards a child with a high-five or a treat, which is a common reward in other therapeutic techniques. Soma is unapologetic. ""I don't see the child as autistic. I don't see the label at all,"" Soma says, speaking quickly in her musical Indian accent. ""I see the child as a person. And just as I would talk to any person, I would talk to a child, because the world is not going to talk to them in a very slow way."" Dr. Michael Merzenich was one of the first experts to pay attention to Soma's technique. He's a neuroscientist at the University of California, and he believes Soma's rapid prompting works. He says there is no doubt the children are using their minds to create their own words and express their own ideas. Unlike facilitated learning techniques that have been discredited, Soma does not guide the children's hands. ""Imagine what it would be like,"" he says, ""to be able to understand everything that's said to you -- to think and to be unable to communicate your own thoughts and ideas."" Merzenich does not believe Rapid Prompting works for all autistic children, but has no doubt it can help thousands. I watch several young children in their therapy sessions on this day in Austin. Some struggle horribly. The session makes the children appear stressed, but they continually make small breakthroughs and answer questions correctly. Soma conducts about 10 therapy sessions a day. ""You must be exhausted,"" I say to her. ""I can't be,"" she answers curtly but with a smile. ""I have to go home now and teach Tito."" At their home, I ask Tito if he is happier now that he can communicate. He writes out a long response on a piece of paper on a clipboard. ""I can't say whether I am happy or not, because happiness is a state of my mind. So sometimes I think I'm happy. Other times it is hollowness."" It's probably a true statement for most of us at some point in our lives. Soma smiles at the response and doesn't miss a beat. ""Keep writing,"" she says to Tito. ""Keep going.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Four civilians were killed and three were injured Thursday when their vehicle was shelled in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, two Interior Ministry officials said. Eyewitnesses told CNN that two of the injured are in serious condition. The civilians are part of the powerful Awaliq tribe, which is demanding an explanation from the Yemeni government. Tribal leaders blame government forces from a nearby military base for the mistake attack. ""The shelling came from the direction of a military base, and militants don't have a presence in those areas,"" a witness said. But a senior military official in Shabwa denied the military had anything to do with the shelling. ""The army is trained and such a mistake is not possible,"" the official said. He blamed terrorists for the attack, saying it was meant to cause friction between the Awaliq tribe and government forces. Government troops have taken control of a number of districts previously held by al Qaeda militants. Thursday's shelling came nearly a month after Yemen launched a military offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula amid an uptick in violence in the capital. Thousands of troops were deployed to the provinces of Hadramout, Shabwa, al-Baitha and Abyan.

"(CNN) -- If Muhammad Ali, Pele, Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher and Michael Jordan are arguably the greatest proponents of their respective sports, Roger Federer made a compelling case for joining that pantheon of greats after securing a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title on Sunday. At the age of 30, considered a grand old age in tennis, he came from behind to leave Andy Murray -- an opponent five years his junior -- shattered and tearful after a gripping three and a half hours on Centre Court. It ended Federer's two-and-a-half-year wait for a record-extending 17th grand slam title, and equaled his hero Pete Sampras' seven successes at the All England Club. ""I believe Roger is the best player to have ever played the game,"" American tennis coach Nick Bollettieri told CNN. ""When you look at groundstrokes and all parts of the game, there is not a weakness in Novak Djokovic's technique, movement and recovery,"" added Bollettieri, referring to Serbia's 2012 Australian Open champion -- who Federer beat in Friday's semifinals. ""But when you come down to who is the best player that can change, that can anticipate and come forward and do anything, then my vote goes to Roger Federer."" Federer's latest victory ensured his return to the top of the world rankings, ending Djokovic's 12-month reign, as well as matching Sampras' record of 286 weeks at No. 1. The Swiss is only the second player in the men's game to have held the top ranking over the age of 30, alongside Andre Agassi, who was one of the many leading players to attend Bollettieri's academy in Florida. ""I believe Roger thinks in his mind he can win anything,"" said Bollettieri, who also helped develop grand slam champions such as Jim Courier, Monica Seles, and Mary Pierce. ""With his game he can play for another two, three or four years and I sincerely believe he's another two, three or four grand slam titles in him."" Much has been made of the impact Ivan Lendl has had on Murray since becoming his coach in December 2011, but Bollettieri suggested Paul Annacone, who began working with Federer in August 2010, also deserves credit for persuading the four-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year to adopt a more aggressive approach. ""Paul won't give too much advice to Roger Federer, a little bit here and a little bit there,"" said the 80-year-old. American. ""He has him coming in and he has him much looser on that backhand. ""Annacone has got him hitting the backhand very aggressively and there is a lot of rackethead exploration rather than just blocking the ball. ""Roger's footwork is meticulous --- it reminds me of Ali. On Sunday he went around the ball a lot and when you do that you give up a lot of court space, so your success depends on your balance when hitting that shot as that is what operates the face of the racket."" While labeling Federer as ""beyond description,"" Bollettieri stressed that Murray's gritty performance in the Wimbledon final bodes well for the future. ""Even though he lost, there will be an inner feeling he gave it his all,"" said Bollettieri, reflecting on the Scot's fourth successive grand slam final defeat -- three of them against Federer. ""Lendl has brought tremendous focus and a few simple tips on strategy, but he hasn't messed with his technique and all that crap. Murray's movement and anticipation is as good as anyone's in the game."" However if Murray is to win a grand slam, Bollettieri pointed to the hard-court surfaces of either the U.S. or Australian Opens as his best opportunity to break his duck. ""I don't believe grass or clay is the best surface for him. He is so good, but if the bounce is even he can stand closer to the baseline, he can hit aggressive and he can come in."" Australian tennis coach Pete McCraw, who has also worked with Bollettieri, is equally encouraging about Murray's future. ""The best is yet come for Andy, he is just entering the third phase of his career -- where he has the physical strength and emotional maturity, as well as the technical skills and experience,"" said McCraw, who has worked extensively with stars such as Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic. ""With the British team around him and Lendl's wisdom, Andy is well positioned to make more grand slam finals in the future. The previous two finals were premature for Andy; the sport was ready, but he was not. ""He is more mature emotionally. There are less outbursts and lapses in concentration. His game from outward appearances is the same, but his mind and emotions are not. ""As a result he is playing with more structure and patterns, using his strengths more often, whereas in the past he would rely on a wider array of shot against his opponents. "" McCraw, who frequently travels to Britain to run coaching workshops, also argues that Murray's achievement in reaching the Wimbledon final will have a spinoff for grassroots tennis in the UK. ""British tennis will benefit immensely. It validates the pathway and what's possible for thousands of aspiring tennis players, and will be indelibly etched in their mind for years to come: 'If he can do it, so can I.' ""","Roger Federer's win over Andy Murray equals Pete Sampras' seven-title Wimbledon record .

"(CNN) -- She had the most memorable entrance of any character on ""The Walking Dead"" so far. Just as Andrea was about to be set upon by a herd of walkers, a shadowy figure dispatched them -- with a Katana sword. It was one of the standout moments of the season two finale, and we would soon learn that this person's name was Michonne, a quiet warrior who had seemingly mastered how to survive in the zombie apocalypse (one bright idea: bring along a couple of chained walkers with no hands or mouths to draw away the others). Ever since that moment, Michonne, played by Danai Gurira, has been rivaled only by Daryl Dixon in terms of rabid fans. At times, she is a silent force of nature, but has opened up a good deal to the rest of the survivors lately. The season's midway point having ended with (spoiler alert!) a brutal attack on the prison, sending the group off in different directions, not to mention the horrifying death of Hershel. CNN spoke with Gurira about what fans can expect when the season returns on Sunday. CNN: Michonne has been through a lot already. Where is her head after the attack at the prison? Gurira: It was deeply trying for her and a major loss for her. The idea of finally connecting with people -- that's not easy for her at all. She's very guarded and really has serious armor on. She's slowly letting that armor chip away, opening up to people. She actually spent some time being in this community full time, so to have this happen under her watch, and to see all the trauma it causes, and the things she was trying to avoid, is very traumatic to her. She's still just starting to invest again in people. She has suffered great loss and it's a question of how she responds to it. There are a couple of ways it could go down. We'll have to see which road she takes. CNN: She lost a good friend in Andrea last year, and now more loss. Does she still feel a connection to this group? Would you describe her as very loyal? Gurira: Even in the first episode this season, you see how she's very connected to Carl, bringing him comic books and candy. There are tons of little moments between her and Daryl as well. In terms of her opening up to the group, she's become very connected. Yes, she was very loyal to Andrea, very loyal to the people with whom she goes outside of the prison. She risks her life for them. She actually really wants the best for these people. Most recently, she didn't run away, she went back to make sure that Rick wasn't killed by the Governor. CNN: Where are things headed for the rest of season four? Is there a big difference from the first half? Gurira: It's gonna be a very different tone. You see people going in different directions, you don't know who's going to align with whom, who's going to make it. It's going to be a whole different tone from what's been done before on the show. It's going to be very exciting and thrilling, and no one knows what's coming next. There will be very powerful moments, and very powerful character developments. CNN: Did you have to learn any different forms of fighting or different stunts this season? Gurira: I always like trying out different things. There are always ways that the writers will write something that will allow me to attack it in a different way. Absolutely -- we try to make things a little different than they were last time. There's always that journey I'm taking with the physical demands of the character -- I want to do as many different things as I can! CNN: This show has a very passionate fan base, and there is certainly a big fan base for Michonne in particular. Does this still surprise you? Gurira: It's a worldwide thing now. I was in Zimbabwe and there were fans there who would stop me on the street. It does still take me aback how much the show has resonated across culture, class and creed. CNN: Any interesting fan moments lately? Gurira: The one that comes to mind most immediately are two different guys who have me tattooed to them, so that was a little shocking and unexpected. I've seen about three now like that. CNN: Do you think Michonne can be seen as someone to look up to, or do you try to play her that way? Gurira: What you have to do as an artist is invest your character with as much life and dimension, and stick to what's written. You stay true to that -- you don't think ""let me make this character someone to look up to."" I don't know how to play that. All you can do is function in the character that's been crafted. However she resonates, I just have to go with that. You really can't bank on that. The beauty of the show is that -- and I share this with her -- we're not people pleasers. And the writers are amazing, so they know exactly how to give her a story that's rich -- we have wonderful conversations and I'm able to collaborate with them in terms of what they're going for, and I give my all to that fiction. CNN: What has been the toughest scene for you so far? Gurira: Shooting the Hershel death scene was very difficult emotionally for us. It was very tough. That was definitely way up there. CNN: Do you own an action figure of Michonne? Gurira: I get given them, I don't go out and buy them. There's been a lot of stuff lately, so I don't know if I've kept up with it! The initial stuff that came out, I definitely have most of it. I've given away some of it. CNN: Was it interesting to see yourself as an action figure? Gurira: It was, it was! The first time I got the model -- it was very different and unexpected. It wasn't something I thought of in acting school. It was pretty darn cool! ""When I get into the world, I want to have an action figure!"" I never dreamed that dream, but to see it was very cool.","Fans have loved ""The Walking Dead's"" sword-wielding character Michonne .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A political coalition widely regarded as the liberal option dominated Libya's historic parliamentary elections, results showed Tuesday. The National Forces Alliance (NFA) won 39 seats, the most of any group. The coalition was trailed by the Justice and Construction party, a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate, which won 17 seats nationwide. The results make Libya unique among countries that have held elections after Arab Spring uprisings. Voters in the North African nation chose a more liberal coalition to lead, while voters in Egypt and Tunisia both opted for Islamist parties. The balance of power in the 200-seat General National Congress, however, remains up in the air. Head of leading Libyan political party calls for unity . Eighty seats are allocated to political entities, while 120 are reserved for individual candidates, which means the NFA's electoral victory does not automatically grant it a majority. The results, though complete, are not yet final. Rivals have a 14-day period to file appeals, after which the results will be certified. Libyans voted July 7 for the assembly that will appoint a transitional government and oversee the drafting of a constitution. About 3,500 candidates ran for the new parliament. The assembly, which will take over from the National Transitional Council, will have 30 days from its first meeting to appoint a prime minister. The NFA is led by Mahmoud Jibril, who was prime minister in the interim government that declared Libya a free nation after the 2011 revolt that toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi in October. The mercurial Gadhafi dismantled many of the civic institutions common to democratic states during his 42 years in power, leaving Libya struggling to emerge from his shadow. While Gadhafi's death ended much of the violence, unrest continues in parts of the country, particularly the south and the west, and the government has not been able to completely contain the militias that helped overthrow the former leader. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week, Jibril said that it is vital for Islamists, liberals and secularists to ""sit around one table"" and form a new government. ""I think the biggest challenge right now is to convince our potential partners, especially the Islamist forces, that now it's time that we sit around one table and talk about one destiny that is in the interest of the Libyan people,"" he said from Tripoli. ""It has nothing to do with who prevails in those elections or those who do not prevail."" Jibril said the absence of a civic structure in Libya means people of all political ideologies can be part of a new government. ""It's an opportunity that all parties, all political forces can have a new start where all of them can participate and take part in the reestablishment of the state,"" he said. The NFA is a coalition of 58 political parties that campaigned as a ""more liberal, progressive option"" and focused heavily on economic issues, according to the Project on Middle East Democracy, a U.S.-based group. Bucking the trend of the Arab Spring .","Libyans voted July 7 for a General National Congress, a 200-seat assembly .
