"Washington (CNN) -- Family members of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were involved in a bus accident Wednesday after the high-profile ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, police said. The bus and a car collided near Washington's Tidal Basin just off the National Mall where the ceremony was held, according to Park Police, who have jurisdiction over the Mall. They said a person in the car was injured and taken to a hospital but did not provide information on injuries to bus passengers. Several members of the King family were aboard the bus and had laid a wreath at the memorial to the civil rights leader, according to Omarosa Manigault, a reality television star who was aboard the bus. ""We were very afraid,"" she told CNN. ""There were children on the bus, seniors and everything. Everybody was thrown out of their seats."" She said she hit her head in the accident.

"(CNN) -- Three members of a suburban Boston junior varsity boys' soccer team were arrested Friday in connection with an alleged sexual assault at a sports camp, according to authorities. The assaults occurred last Sunday at Camp Lenox near Otis, a town in western Massachusetts, according to the Berkshire District Attorney's Office. The city of Somerville, just northwest of Boston, rented the facility for team-building activities for its fall sports teams. According to prosecutors, the three Somerville High School students allegedly entered a cabin occupied by freshman students and assaulted three victims. The eldest of the three juniors, a 17-year-old male, faces charges that include aggravated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery on a person who has turned 14, assault and battery and intimidation of a witness. The two other male athletes, both 16, face similar allegations, prosecutors said in a statement. The allegations were reported to members of the Somerville High School athletic department on Tuesday. A criminal investigation began immediately, officials said. In a joint statement, Somerville's mayor and schools superintendent said, ""We are disturbed and appalled that these crimes may have taken place and our thoughts and concerns are with the victims and their families."" Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone and Superintendent Tony Pierantozzi said the district attorney's office has given no indication that any other students were implicated. The alleged assaults appear to be a ""single, isolated incident."" Support services are available to help victims, parents and team members who attended the camp.","Three freshmen allegedly assaulted at sports camp .

"(CNN) -- Together they shared an all-conquering season at Inter Milan, now Jose Mourinho and Samuel Eto'o are to be reunited in London. The Cameroon striker will get his first taste of the English Premier League at the age of 32 after joining Chelsea from Anzhi Makhachkala. Eto'o reportedly became the highest paid player in the world when he moved to the Russian club in 2011 but is the latest high-profile departure in the club's fire sale. Anzhi announced their intention to cut costs earlier this month, with Willian joining Chelsea on Wednesday for a deal reported to be worth $46.5 million. Now Eto'o has followed the Brazilian to London in a move which means Wayne Rooney's much-touted switch to Stamford Bridge from English champions Manchester United looks increasingly unlikely. During their time at Inter, Mourinho and Eto'o won Serie A, the Italian Cup, and the European Champions League. Eto'o arrives at Chelsea as a four-time African Player of the Year. ""I am very happy to be here but also anxious because I want to get playing as soon as possible,"" he told Chelsea's official website. ""It wasn't a hard decision. I saw the qualities Chelsea have, and I was very happy with Jose Mourinho before, so when the opportunity came, I was very happy to take it."" Eto'o's career took off when he joined Spanish giants Barcelona in 2004, as he won three league titles and lifted the Champions League twice. He found the net 152 times in 232 appearances for the Catalan club before he left to join Inter in 2009. His move to Anzhi came as a surprise when it was announced in 2011, with reports claiming he was on a salary of $464,000 a week. At the start of this month, the club said they would be aiming to save between $50-70 million dollars a year and sacked coach Rene Meulensteen after just two games in charge. Eto'o is the latest in a line of high profile signings Chelsea have made since Mourinho returned to the club. German international Andre Schurrle, Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, Croatia striker Stipe Perica and Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel have all arrived, leaving Mourinho with a wealth of options.","English club Chelsea confirm the signing of Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- If Diana Nyad never realizes her dream of swimming the Florida straits, it won't be for lack of trying. The 64-year-old began her fifth and last bid to swim from Cuba to the United States on Saturday morning. Previous attempts were thwarted by dehydration, ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue. ""There's the fine line between seeing that things are bigger than you and letting your ego go,"" Nyad said at a news conference in Havana Friday. ""And there's another edge over that fine line where you don't ever want to give up and I am still at that place!"" Were Nyad to swim the 103 miles from Havana to the Florida Keys, she would be the first person to do so without the benefits of a shark cage, flippers or wet suit. And it would validate her attempts, which have spanned 35 years. In 1997, Australian endurance swimmer Susie Maroney, then 22, completed the swim from within a shark cage. Along with the protection the cage offers against toothy predators, swimmers say the cage provides a barrier against waves and other weather hazards. Since Maroney's swim, some of the world's best endurance swimmers have tried to cross the straits of Florida without using a cage. All have been turned back. But few have done so as persistently or as colorfully as Nyad. The Key West, Florida, resident says she feels a special bond with Cubans and hopes her repeated efforts to swim between the two countries will help improve the still-tense relations between Havana and Washington. Nyad often tried to communicate in rudimentary Spanish during the news conference Friday. She has said that during her long swims, she sings the Cuban ballad, ""Guantanmera,"" to herself hundreds of times. Cuban authorities said that after her latest attempt was announced in state media, they received a barrage of suggestions from across the island on how she could ward off the stinging jellyfish that ended previous attempts. This time, Nyad said, she will wear surgical gloves and a specially designed prosthetic face mask to prevent the jellyfish from stinging her. ""It took us a year, we made mold after mold,"" Nyad said of the mask, adding it was the kind used to protect people who had suffered injuries to their faces. ""It's a two-edged sword for me. It's cumbersome, it's difficult to swim with, but it doesn't matter. I am safe. There's no other way."" Nyad will be accompanied by a 35-member crew aboard two sail boats. They will monitor her health, update her progress on social media and try to ward off sharks that might view her as a potential snack. If all goes to plan, Nyad said, the swim will take her three days to finish. CNN's Matt Sloane contributed to this report.","Her attempts started 35 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The opening stage of the Tour de France in Corsica Saturday descended into chaos after a team bus became trapped under the finishing gantry in Bastia. As organizers desperately tried to free the bus, the 213km leg from Porto-Vecchio was initially shortened to finish at the three kilometers to go mark. With teams trying to bring their star sprinters to the front of the peloton earlier than expected, a big crash saw Britain's Mark Cavendish and Slovakian Peter Sagan and some of the race favorites held up. At the same time, the bus, belonging to Australian team Orica GreenEdge was finally removed and the original finish line was reinstated. From the depleted pack, Germany's Marcel Kittel won a frantic sprint to claim the stage honors for Argos Shimano -- his first win on the Tour de France. Orica GreenEdge's Matt Goss took a tumble in that sprint to end his hopes with another top contender, Andre Greipel, the victim of a mechanical problem, to leave the way clear for the in-form Kittel to take the first yellow jersey of the 100th edition of the Tour. He edged out Norway's Alexander Kristoff with Danny Van Poppel of the Vacansoleil team in third place. The bus incident also affected the race's electronic timing function, but the official Tour de France website announced that because of the incident all the riders would be awarded the same time. Among the favorites for the overall classification, Team Sky's Chris Froome emerged unscathed, but arch-rival Alberto Contador of the Saxo-Tinkoff team finished with a torn jersey and time trial specialist Tony Martin of Germany suffered a reported broken collarbone. Cavendish, who was looking to add to his 23 career stage wins in the Tour, was critical of organizers after seeing his hopes dashed in the crash. ""What caused the problems was changing the finish. We heard on the radio with literally five kilometers to go that the sprint was in two kilometers, and then one kilometer later they were like 'No, it's at the original finish.' It's just carnage,"" he said. The race continues Sunday with a 156 km second stage in Corsica from Bastia to Ajaccio.","Chaos on opening stage of Tour de France in Corsica .

"(CNN) -- What's the end game? That's what I want to know. It's the question I ask, silently, every time I hear of a first grader going for extra academic tutoring; every time one of my daughter's friends is permanently unavailable for a play date because she has after-school ballet on Monday, after-school theater on Tuesday, after-school swimming on Wednesday, after-school mathematics on Thursday and after-school origami on Friday. Because I am a coward, I refuse to stop other parents and ask the question aloud. But it burns inside of me. I'd like to know. What's the end game? Or, put differently: What the heck are you trying to accomplish here? Back when I was a kid, growing up on the mean streets of Mahopac, New York, we returned home from a day at school and did (always in this order) three things: First, we had a snack (long story, but my mother hid the treats in the trunk of our '80 Datsun 510, leaving my brother and me a choice of plain graham crackers, carrots or -- dear God -- homemade yogurt). Then, we did our homework. Then, we played our asses off. Motherhood and work, is it possible? Really, we did. We'd meet up with Gary Miller and Dennis Gargano and Matt Walker and John Ballerini and David Clingerman and Jonathan Powell and a dozen other neighborhood kids and run. And bike. And tackle. There were games of kill the carrier and tag and H-O-R-S-E and kick the can; gleeful mile-long walks into town for bubble gum and soda. Inevitably, as darkness fell, Matt's dad, Bob Walker, would let loose a two-fingered whistle that shot up Emerald Lane's steep hill like a flamethrower. ""Time to go in,"" Matt would say, and we'd all leave for dinner. Remarkably (and against all modern parental logic), we've all wound up doing just fine. Married, kids, homes, careers, contentment. Matt is a designer for ESPN. Dennis is an attorney. Powell graduated from the Naval Academy. On and on and on. It came, to a large degree, naturally. Just letting children be children. Nowadays, however, I live in a community relatively similar to the place where I grew up, and nothing for kids is allowed to come naturally. Pressure reigns, the air poisoned by a looming need to make certain—cost and logic and inanity be damned—that your child has been placed on the 100-percent-guaranteed-or-your-money-back path toward success. It's no longer enough to have Junior learning at his grade level. He has to be, testing-wise, one or two notches ahead (Unintentional end result: A classroom of bored, poorly behaved tykes). It's no longer OK for Junior to have little to do after school, free time to use as he sees fit. No, now you're either signing your child up for myriad organized activities, or you've somehow allowed him to fall behind. Everything revolves around success, success, success, success. But here's the thing: What in the world is success? Opinion: Hey, baby boomer parents, back off! Please, I would love someone to tell me. Is it being a class valedictorian? Is it getting into Harvard? Is it earning an MBA or a Ph.D.? Is it skating for the Tampa Bay Lightning? Going to law school? Joining an exclusive country club? Working for NASA? Dating Justin Bieber? Having your own reality TV show? Everyone is in such a rush to guarantee a child's future, yet nobody has been able to rightly (and righteously) explain the ultimate reward. I've heard people say, ""I just want to give my child the best opportunity to succeed"" at least 100 times, but always without elaboration. Hell, many of the parents I see gunning hardest for said success are, quite frankly, unhappy. They either work 70 hours per week at a job they loathe or count the hours until the kids go to sleep, or they just generally long to be somewhere — anywhere — but here. It's as if we're all lined up on a racetrack, and we know we need to sprint as fast as possible — only there's no discernable finish line. Just run hard, expend all your energy, and maybe you'll find it. Maybe. Fortunately, I have the solution. Actually, it came from my wife. We were discussing which so-and-so teacher would best suit my son's so-and-so needs. ""You know what I want?"" she said. ""What?"" ""I want him to have fun."" ""In school?"" ""Yes, but also in life."" I couldn't agree more. Kids are gifted with 18 years of childhood. That's it — less than two decades before the cruel, dark, real word overtakes their bliss. Yes, I want mine to do well in school, and learn the virtues of compassion and empathy and hard work. But I also aspire for them to jump on our trampoline until their legs sag from exhaustion, and ride their bikes up and down the street until someone lets loose a loud whistle, and play tag next door in Ashley and Emily's yard and chase down the ice cream man and watch in amazement as the pink petals fall from our cherry blossom tree. If they wind up at Yale, and they're happy, I'll be thrilled. If they wind up collecting garbage, and they're happy, I'll be thrilled, too. That's my end game.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich beat Chelsea on 5-4 penalties to win a pulsating UEFA Super Cup showdown in Prague Friday after equalizing with the last kick of extra time. Down to 10 men but leading 2-1, Chelsea looked set to hand Jose Mourinho the first silverware of his second reign until Javi Martinez found the net for the European champions to force the penalty shootout. Both sides had a perfect record from the spot kicks until 20-year-old Romelu Lukaku stepped up to deliver a tame effort which was comfortably saved by Manuel Neuer. So instead it was Pep Guardiola, a bitter rival of Mourinho when the pair managed Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga, who landed his first trophy since taking over at Bayern in the summer. For Chelsea, it was a second successive defeat in the UEFA Super Cup, having been beaten 4-1 by a Radamel Falcao inspired Atletico Madrid in Monaco last year. But they will take heart from their performance in a match in which they twice led only for Bayern to show their typical resilience by pulling them back. Fernando Torres put Chelsea ahead with a crisp finish from an Andre Schurrle cross in the eighth minute. It was a lead which lasted until the second minute of the second half when Franck Ribery leveled with a 20 meter effort which beat Petr Cech at his near post. Bayern were on top, but Chelsea fashioned the best chances as Branislav Ivanovic rattled the crossbar with a header and Neuer was forced to save from a David Luiz header. Chelsea midfielder Ramires departed for a rash challenge on Mario Gotze which earned a second yellow card and the omens did not look good for the English Premier League side heading into extra time. But those fears were dispelled when Eden Hazard lit up the Eden Arena with a fine solo goal, Neuer at fault as the eventual low shot eluded him. Cech made amends for his error on Ribery's earlier goal with a pair of stunning saves from Mario Mandzukic and Ribery. But he could not keep out Martinez's late effort which so cruelly denied Chelsea. A defiant Mourinho said his team deserved better. ""The best team clearly lost the match, we played with ten men for a long period against the European champions and we have only reason to be proud,"" he told ITV Sport.","Bayern Munich win UEFA Super Cup on penalties .

"Washington (CNN) -- A post-mortem Sunday of the mid-term elections provided little evidence that Democrats and Republicans will work together to address major issues such as deficit reduction any better than they have in recent years. Republicans interviewed on talk shows promised congressional investigations, an all-out effort to repeal health care reform, and steadfast opposition to any form of higher taxes. Democrats, meanwhile, said the losses they suffered in the congressional elections reflected voter dissatisfaction with lingering high unemployment in the slow recovery from economic recession, rather than an outright repudiation of their policies. Republicans won more than 60 seats formerly held by Democrats to take majority control of the House, and also narrowed the Democratic majority in the Senate, while winning the lion's share of governors' races around the country. When asked what they would do with their greater power, GOP legislators offered a hard-line agenda that left little room for middle-ground compromise. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, considered a likely presidential contender in 2012, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he advocated repealing the health care bill and ensuring that government operates on the revenues available. Voters want to see results on creating jobs, and if Republicans don't produce, ""we'll be thrown out in two years,"" Pawlenty said. Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, who is expected to become the new House majority leader in January, questioned on ""Fox News Sunday"" whether there was any benefit to compromising with President Barack Obama. The question was not whether Obama was willing to work with Republicans, as he stated last week, but, ""Are we willing to work with him?"" Cantor asked. ""I mean, first and foremost, we're not going to be willing to work with him on the expansive liberal agenda he's been about,"" Cantor said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that agreement exists on some specific provisions, but he refused to signal any willingness to compromise. ""We anticipate we'll be able to do the people's business in areas on which we agree,"" McConnell said. In Mumbai, India, on Sunday, Obama told a student at a town hall-style meeting that the election results showed he needed to make adjustments after two years in office. After explaining he must stick to core policies such as education and infrastructure investment and clean energy development, Obama said he also needs to ""make some mid-course corrections and adjustments."" ""How those play themselves out over the next several months will be a matter of me being in discussions with the Republican Party,"" the president said, adding: ""There are going to be areas where we disagree and hopefully there are going to be some areas where we agree."" However, beyond four items listed by McConnell -- nuclear energy and electric-car development, clean coal technology, and expanded free-trade agreements -- Republicans offered no other areas of agreement. The first issue likely to come up when Congress reconvenes next week in a lame-duck session will be whether to extend Bush-era tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Obama wants to extend the lower tax rates for income below $200,000 a year for individuals and $250,000 a year for families, saying that means 98 percent of Americans won't be subject to a de facto tax increase. Republicans oppose higher tax rates for anyone, including the nation's wealthiest 2 percent, arguing it would harm small business owners who traditionally bring about significant job creation. In an interview to be broadcast Sunday night on the CBS program ""60 Minutes,"" Obama expressed a willingness to compromise, perhaps by extending the lower tax rates for wealthy Americans for a two-year period as long as everyone else also maintains their current lower rates. McConnell, however, made clear that Republicans believe no one should have their tax rates return to the higher levels of the 1990s. ""We don't have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem,"" McConnell said, repeating a line parroted by Republicans on other shows. ""So the whole nomenclature surrounding this -- that somehow we're doing people a favor by giving them their own money back -- I just don't accept. The government is too big. It needs to be shrunk."" Other GOP positions spelled out Sunday included reducing non-military ""discretionary"" spending -- such as department and agency budgets, but not including entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to 2008 levels, reducing federal wages and cutting the federal workforce. A unanimous Republican policy is to try to get the health care reform bill repealed. While acknowledging Obama and the Democrats will almost certainly be able to stave off full repeal, Republican lawmakers including McConnell, Cantor and others advocated cutting funding and mounting legal challenges to hinder implementation of the measure until they can try to defeat Obama in 2012. Some of the Republican opponents of the bill also called for keeping popular provisions touted by Obama and Democrats, such as preventing insurance companies from dropping coverage when people get sick, or denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. ""We're going to do everything we can to try and repeal and replace this thing,"" Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, expected to be the new chairman of the House Budget Committee, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina told CBS that the Republicans were on the wrong side of history on the health care issue. Clyburn noted that similar calls for repeal followed landmark legislation in the past including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that allowed African-Americans to vote. ""The fact of the matter is what we did with health care is to make that a fundamental right of every citizen,"" Clyburn said. Amid the legislative wrangling will be new investigations by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the expected new chairman of the panel in January, told the Fox program. He cited White House attempts to influence candidates to drop out of primary elections, as occurred in the Pennsylvania Senate race, as one issue to be investigated. Issa's committee also will support a Judiciary Committee probe of alleged voter intimidation by two members of the New Black Panther Party at a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, voting station in 2008, he said. Issa later told reporters that he currently had no plans to issue subpoenas to members of the Obama administration. ""There's a history of corruption in American politics at the presidential level that goes back to Andrew Jackson,"" Issa said. ""I think what we have to do is look for the places where we can make changes, and make those changes, and try to get the administration to do what they need to do to comply."" Meanwhile, signs of friction within the Republican Party also appeared Sunday, with conservative lawmakers pushing plans not favored by some in the GOP congressional leadership. Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who supported Tea Party candidates across the country in toppling mainstream contenders in GOP primaries, called for a halt to all congressional earmarks as part of a conservative action plan against high spending. McConnell, however, said the issue was more complex than just spending, involving whether the legislature has the authority to determine exactly how money gets spent. DeMint made clear that he and the new Tea Party conservatives rejected McConnell's position. ""I know there's some senior members in Congress who think it's their job to bring home the bacon,"" DeMint said on the NBC program ""Meet the Press."" He called such thinking ""parochial politics"" against the national interest and said: ""We can't do that anymore."" One of those Tea Party-backed winners Tuesday, Senator-elect Rand Paul of Kentucky, offered a potential major concession on the ABC program ""This Week"" when he said military spending should be part of the cuts needed to balance the federal budget. Republicans traditionally push for increased military spending and have generally made clear they favor cutting only non-military discretionary spending, and McConnell said Paul would have to persuade his new colleagues to support him. ""Well, you know, he's going to have an opportunity in the Senate to offer all of those ideas,"" McConnell said. ""We'll get votes on them.""","GOP targets health care reform, government spending .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Rims and bling? They're ""super-played out,"" Common said, explaining that hip-hop is finding another direction and President Obama is helping point the way. Rapper/actor Common says he is not hearing as much ""gangsta talk"" in hip-hop lately. Common spoke of the ""Obama effect"" before a recent performance in Atlanta during the Hennessy Artistry Series.

""It's not a relationship for the public, you know?"" He did, however, spend a few minutes providing a progress report on Obama's influence on hip-hop. Nine months ago, Common told CNN he believed Obama's presidency would change the attitudes of many hip-hop artists. ""I think hip-hop artists will have no choice but to talk about different things and more positive things, and try to bring a brighter side to that because, even before Barack, I think people had been tired of hearing the same thing,"" he said in December. Read his December conversation with CNN . On Saturday, Common said he is already seeing signs that Obama is making a mark on a musical genre often vilified because of its focus on drugs, violence and the degradation of women. ""I also don't find as much gangsta talk,"" he said. ""You see the whole chain-shining-and-rim era is gone. That's like super-played out. Just to have that, I think, is part of the Obama effect.""

Common, born Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr., believes hip-hop patrons want to hear more positive, upbeat messages in songs, and he believes the ""conscious rapper"" -- that is, the more socially aware -- is on the rise. ""People always want to feel better and be inspired,"" he said. ""Sometimes we need it. I think the conscious rapper will always be able to live and exist."" Obama and the American spirit, he said, are prodding the movement along. Common said he hopes more rappers abandon vacuous materialistic ideals and the glorification of vices plaguing American communities -- ""and if whatever MC doesn't, I will,"" he warned. ""I think Obama is definitely bringing people to be able to inspire people to create for themselves,"" he said. ""What America was built on was being able to say, 'Hey, we're going to come in and use our resources to build for ourselves and our communities and build around that. We're not going to depend on others.' ""I think that's what hip-hop is starting to do to a certain extent.

"(CNN) -- Ferrari team principal Stefano Demenicali has rejected suggestions a power struggle between him and driver Fernando Alonso is the reason behind the Italian team's faltering Formula One season. Alonso, a two-time world champion, picked up two grands prix wins in the first five races of the season, but he has struggled to match the blistering pace set by Red Bull's three-time drivers' champion Sebastian Vettel. The Spaniard is second in the drivers' standings and trails the leader Vettel by 46 points after finishing runner up to the German at Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix. Domenicali, who has been team principal of F1's most successful team since 2008, denied a rift with Alonso and also dismissed suggestions he is too soft for one of motorsport's most demanding jobs. ""No, no, this is something that I totally reject,"" Domenicali told the sport's official website. ""We want to win together. ""It is a super-competitive environment where you are a hero when you win and a zero when you lose -- there is not really something in between for us. Be sure that we are united to win -- because that's what we are here for."" Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has not been shy in expressing his dissatisfaction with the team. He ""tweaked"" Alonso's ear last month when the driver sarcastically remarked he would like ""someone else's car"" for his birthday. ""He is our chairman and he is very passionate about this part of his job, this side of the business,"" Domenicali said of Di Montezemolo. ""It is normal that he is very pushy with us because we had a really difficult July. It was a sign of attention from him -- I read it this way, that's it. ""We know we need to be focused -- and he reminded us of that -- and that we have to be united to pass this difficult moment."" Domenicali was also coy on rumors Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen could be in line for a return to the team he won the world championship with in 2007 -- Ferrari's last drivers' title. ""Kimi is a very fast driver and everybody knows how I rate him. But if I make a comment now it will be taken as a direct answer. ""As I said, there is no rush and we will make the right decision in the right moment."" Meanwhile David Ward has announced he intends to stand in the FIA's presidential elections later this year. Ward has resigned from his post as director general of world motorsport's governing body's charitable foundation to run for the post currently held by former Ferrari chief Jean Todt. ""After much careful thought I have decided to stand,"" Ward said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Ethiopia's prime minister is ""recovering well,"" a spokesman said Wednesday, amid frenzied speculation about the health of the usually visible leader, who has not appeared in public for two months. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, 57, came to power two decades ago and is considered a strong force in the frequently volatile horn of Africa. He has not appeared in public since June, and the secretive nation has released little information about his whereabouts, prompting rumors and opposition claims that he is dead or facing a life-threatening illness. After weeks of speculation, the government held a news conference last month and announced he got treatment for an unspecified illness. Zenawi is ""recovering well, resting and performing his duties as prime minister and head of state,"" government spokesman Bereket Simon reiterated Wednesday. He declined to give exact details on Zenawi's whereabouts or the nature of his illness. His absence has been a hot topic in the nation, with bloggers launching a counter of the number of days he's been missing. Citizens have taken to social media to discuss his whereabouts and exchange conspiracy theories. Searches for Zenawi are at their highest since 2004, according to Google trends. ""Ethiopians are a bit confused,"" said Endalk Hailemichael, 30, of Addis Ababa. ""In Ethiopia, there are traditions of secrecy and hiding the whereabouts of leaders. People are afraid, there is a lot of uncertainty looming. A lot of rumors and unclear information going on."" Hailemichael said the disappearance has sparked a lot of questions, including who would succeed him in case of a power vacuum. But most people are discussing it with fear of repercussions, he said. CNN reached several people in the nation who expressed their concerns about his whereabouts, but did not want to be quoted for fear of retribution. ""People are afraid to talk about it. This is a police state,"" Hailemichael said. ""They are talking about it, but they are looking over their shoulders. In bars, in taxis, coffee shops, that's all people are talking about. But they are afraid."" His absence was more evident last month when Ethiopia hosted an African Union summit in its capital of Addis Ababa. Zenawi, a key player in talks on the tensions between Sudan and its rival neighbor South Sudan, did not attend. ""Some people are worried, some people are crying,"" said Jomanex Kassaye, 30, who lives near Addis Ababa. ""While some people are worried about the instability that might occur ... others are happy that he may be gone."" Kassaye said, while he is not a fan of the leader, he wants him to leave through a democratic process. ""I need him to go because there is no democracy, no freedom of speech, no food, no justice, no accountability,"" he said. ""But not like this. If he leaves like this, we will have another dictator who will take over power and stay for too long."" Ethiopia, which is a key Western ally often lauded for effective use of aid money, is surrounded by unstable nations such as Somalia and Sudan. Zenawi has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region. The Ethiopian army has sent peacekeepers to battle Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. More recently, the prime minister was working to broker a peace deal in the negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan, which split last year but still have unresolved issues. In an attempt to quash the rumors, the government censored a newspaper that tried to report information about his health, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""This weekend, the government ordered the state-run printing company not to produce the latest edition of the weekly Feteh, which was to have carried front-page coverage of Zenawi's condition,"" the media advocacy group said on its website. Zenawi, a former guerrilla leader, is part of a group that toppled dictator Haile Mengustu Mariam in 1991. The shrewd politician is credited with economic progress and maintaining peace in the nation surrounded by volatile countries. However, human rights groups have accused his government of a heavy hand and a series of abuses, including limiting press freedoms and cracking down on opposition political parties. Last year, Ethiopia found two Swedish journalists guilty of supporting terrorism and sentenced them to 11 years.","Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has not appeared in public since June .

"(CNN) -- Attention travelers: Your high-flying status with Delta Air Lines may take a dive with the airline's new frequent flier rules. Delta announced a new spending requirement Thursday for gaining elite status in the airline's SkyMiles program. In addition to racking up Medallion qualifying miles or segments, passengers will have to spend a minimum dollar amount on tickets each year for each rung on the mileage ladder. For silver status, the spending requirement is $2,500. Gold status requires $5,000 in ticket purchases, $7,500 for platinum and $12,500 for diamond status. The change starts on January 1, 2014, for membership status in the 2015 program. ""Adding a revenue component to the SkyMiles Medallion program ensures that our most valued customers receive the best program benefits and a more exclusive experience,"" said Jeff Robertson, vice president of the SkyMiles program, in a statement. Tim Winship, publisher of Frequentflier.com expects a mixed reaction to the change among travelers,""depending on which side of the fence you find yourself on."" It's a win for business travelers who easily qualify for the programs through company-paid flights, Winship said, because fewer elite members means better odds for upgrades. But travelers who have been using cheap flights as a status strategy, may get bumped down -- or out -- of the game, Winship said. Justin Cook, a sales trainer from Orlando, Florida, flies nearly every week in the mid-Atlantic or the Southeast. Cook is a Delta Diamond Medallion member -- the highest level -- yet he estimates his company spends between $8,000 to $10,000 a year on his air travel, shy of the $12,500 requirement. By 2015, he suspects he could drop two levels to gold status. ""I will actively be looking into other airlines to see if they will match my status.""","Delta has added a spending requirement to elite frequent flier status .

"(CNN) -- The ""Call of Duty"" franchise is a perennial blockbuster, with more than 65 million units sold so far in the United States and hordes of fans lining up each fall to buy the latest installment of the war-simulation video game. Now, Activision Publishing will find out whether fans who are accustomed to dropping $60 on a new ""CoD"" game each year will also cough up an extra $50 to keep their game content fresh. The much-hyped ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" is set to arrive in stores on Tuesday. As usual, players get inside the helmets of soldiers -- in this case, fighting a near-futuristic global war against Russian forces who have invaded multiple countries, including the United States. The storyline, with battles in London, New York and Paris, is a continuation of its 2009 predecessor. But ""Modern Warfare 3"" will be the first game in the series to launch with a new member service called ""Call of Duty Elite."" Players will be able to sign up for a free social network that encapsulates the new game, last year's ""Black Ops"" and future ""Call of Duty"" games. They'll be able to create a profile that extensively tracks gameplay statistics for multiple ""CoD"" games across the various console platforms for which they're available. Stat systems are typically maintained by console developers, like Microsoft and Sony, which means Xbox 360 gamers cannot rank themselves against PlayStation 3 players. The Elite service bridges that gap, although gamers still will not be able to play against someone using a different type of console. Elite users will also be able to share videos or screen shots captured within the game and download ""Call of Duty"" stat-tracking applications to their smartphones or tablets. Microsoft and Bungie maintain a similar dedicated service for ""Halo."" Despite competition this fall from fellow first-person shooter game ""Battlefield 3,"" which sold 5 million units in its first week, Activision is confident the ""Call of Duty"" franchise has enough muscle to persuade customers to spend the $50 per year for premium services. ""'Call of Duty' is a franchise that's grown every year of its existence,"" Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg said in a recent interview. ""I think that we are finding that people have a very healthy appetite for content."" Subscribers will be served a new piece of content they can download each month and use to participate in competitions. The content will include new maps and gameplay modes. ""The things that we're charging for are things that we really wouldn't be able to provide if we didn't,"" Hirshberg said. ""It's not modeled after anything. It's kind of a new entry into the model here."" Activision has been working on the Elite service, which was previously called Project Beachhead, for two years, Hirshberg has said. The company formed a division called Beachhead Studio to maintain its development. ""Black Ops"" players were able to beta test Elite until mid-October, when Activision shut down parts of the service in advance of ""Modern Warfare 3's"" debut. Subscription gaming has proliferated in a genre called massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMO, or MMOG), the most prominent being ""World of Warcraft."" That game happens to be owned by Activision's Blizzard arm, allowing the Beachhead team to learn from the pros. ""There are a lot of big brains that we picked down at Blizzard,"" Hirshberg said. ""They've done this kind of relationship with consumers, with gamers, very well, probably better than anybody."" Sony has tried to marry the first-person shooter genre with vast online worlds in a game called ""PlanetSide."" It wasn't a hit, but the company announced a sequel this summer. Activision believes it has found a sweet spot that won't muck with the ""Call of Duty"" formula but will still spur gamers to open their wallets. ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" will be available Tuesday for PCs and the PlayStation3, Xbox 360 and Wii consoles. The game retails for $60 and is rated Mature, meaning it contains content suitable for people ages 17 and older.","""Call of Duty"" franchise is launching a special service alongside new game .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Furniture from the rented mansion where pop star Michael Jackson died was being auctioned off Saturday, and among the most expensive items sold were paintings that went for $46,875 and $35,200. Some of the furnishings were made infamous by crime scene photos shown in this year's trial of Michael Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, who was sentenced last month to four years in the Los Angeles County jail for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Though the mansion is located in Los Angeles' Holmby Hills neighborhood, the auction was being held in Beverly Hills and was being carried live online. Auctioneers were selling 524 items. Jackson did not own the beds, chairs, clocks, paintings, dishes and other objects, but their value was expected to skyrocket because of the personal touch added by the pop icon and his children in the months before he died on June 25, 2009. Julien's Auctions has been careful not to call it a Michael Jackson auction out of legal and public relations concerns, instead marketing it by the mansion's now-famous address -- 100 North Carolwood Drive. As of early Saturday afternoon, among the most expensive items sold were a $35,200 watercolor painting of floral still life by Maurice Utrillo and a $46,875 oil painting of fishing village by Adelsteen Normann. The table where Jackson's sedatives sat and the rug on which paramedics tried to revive him are also among the items on the sale block. Without the connection to Jackson, the entire property might bring $400,000, Nolan said. But with the connection, ""the sky's the limit,"" Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said. A chalkboard left behind in Jackson's kitchen may have cost a few hundred dollars, but what his children wrote on it makes it a very valuable object, Nolan said. The note, handwritten on the black board attached to a 26-inch-tall ceramic rooster, reads ""love Daddy/ I (heart) Daddy/ Smile it's for free."" It sat in the kitchen where, according to testimony in the trial of Murray, Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. It was not known which child wrote the chalk note, but Nolan said his research suggested it was from Paris, who was 11 when her father died. Another striking piece is a Victorian-revival-style armoire from Jackson's master bedroom. On the mirror, presumably where Jackson looked each day as he dressed, is a handwritten message of inspiration: ""Train, perfection March April Full out May."" The wax-pencil note is significant, considering that Jackson was battling the calendar as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" concerts set to premiere in London in July 2009. Murray's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on Jackson to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep, which led to Murray administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life. Julien's Auctions backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Nolan said. The auction house's re-creation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called ""the medicine room"" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed. The nightstand seen next to the death bed in coroner's photos, bearing numerous bottles of sedatives and other drugs, is for sale. The ""French occasional table"" is listed for between $300 and $500. The room-size Oriental rug that covered the floor where Jackson was placed when paramedics tried to revive him is listed in the auction catalog for between $400 and $600. The couch and chairs where Jackson likely sat with show producers worried about his health in the days before his death are for sale. One chair in Jackson's bedroom has a stain which Nolan suggested was makeup spilled by the star as he sat in front of a mirror. None of Jackson's relatives has expressed an interest in any of the items, Nolan said. He pointed out that they had a chance to take whatever they wanted from the house in the months after his death. The notes and posters brought to the auction house by Jackson fans and placed on the ""medicine room"" memorial will be sent to Jackson's mother and children, he said. Jackson's relationship with Julien's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his Neverland ranch. The singer sued the auction company, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch. The suit was settled in April 2009 when Julien's canceled the auction and later returned the items to Jackson.","Two paintings sell for thousands of dollars .

"(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday. The observatory warned of more vigorous activity with the Pavlof and Veniaminof volcanoes, both on the Alaskan Peninsula -- though that will likely just mean more ash. Pavlof, a snow-covered, cone-shaped mountain, has been erupting since early May. While its activity since then has waxed and waned, seismic activity increased since Tuesday morning and the volcano has started continuously shaking, said David Schneider, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Some lava is flowing, and the volcano is spewing a cloud of steam and ash that has risen as high as 28,000 feet, said Schneider, at the observatory in Anchorage. ""It's a pretty good size, but not high enough to affect overflying aircraft between America and Asia,"" he said. ""It's more of a problem for local aviation."" Pavlof is near the town of Cold Bay, a regional transportation hub whose long World War II-era runway serves flights to area villages, Schneider said. The ash has at times affected those local flights. Veniaminof, about 60 miles from Pavlof, started showing activity in early June and began erupting June 13, Schneider said. It has also produced a lava flow and an ash plume, though not as high as Pavlof -- only about 8,200 feet. Veniaminof is a broad mountain topped with a large, flat ice field, and in the middle is a small cone that produces the lava and ash. The eruptions of both volcanoes compare to those in the past, where activity lasted for weeks or months before dying down again. The main hazard now, Schneider said, is ash fall, which is more of a nuisance than anything else. ""So far there's been trace amounts of ash, so it's just a fine coating,"" he said. ""Our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash.""","The volcanoes are both on the Alaskan Peninsula .

"(CNN) -- Among the most enduring urban legends about high-level policy-making in the U.S. government is the proverbial memo with three options: 1. do nothing; 2. do everything; 3. find a middle ground and muddle through. And yet in truth, Barack Obama really does have only three options in Syria. It appears that the president, rightly the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria, has chosen option three, the least bad alternative. And here's why. Do nothing . This isn't really an option. Forget the fact that the president a year ago drew his own red line against Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons. Disregard the reality that this is reportedly the largest single deployment of chemical weapons since Saddam Hussein used them against the Kurds in 1988; dismiss the fact that 100,000 Syrians have died in this civil conflict; and the president is accused of fiddling, Nero-like, while Syria burns. Just focus on the events of the past five days in Washington. What has been emanating from administration officials both on and off the record is the most well-advertised and telegraphed military action in the history of modern warfare. Rarely do we get this kind of preview of the operation, its size and character. Combine that with the Secretary of State John Kerry's brief but powerful statement of moral outrage the other day and the president's PBS interview, and you get as authoritative a commitment to strike as is humanly imaginable. Indeed, forceful statements and actions of the past few days have now constituted their own red line. And if the president doesn't enforce it, he will be truly damaged goods when it comes to foreign policy for the remainder of his term. Neither his regional allies (Israel and the Saudis) nor his adversaries (Iran, Hezbollah, Russia) will find him credible or believable. As it is now, everyone says no to the U.S. without much cost or consequence. Do everything . From the beginning, Sens. John McCain and Lindsay Graham and a whole host of liberal interventionists and neoconservatives outside the government have repeatedly called for a more robust policy on Syria, even suggesting that the president, by not acting sooner, enabled all of this misery to unfold. Syria, the president's critics maintain, is a major threat to U.S. interests -- and to our allies in the region -- and only a takedown of the al-Assad regime through supporting the opposition and direct application of U.S. military power will begin to address the problem. The argument has not called for boots on the ground but for extensive use of no-fly zones, the use of U.S. air and missile power to degrade the regime and military support for the opposition. President Obama has wisely and willfully avoided this approach. And he continues to avoid it now. The reason has to do with the general problem of an open-ended military commitment and the lack of correlation between the use of U.S. military power and its relation to the end state. Syria is in the throes of a brutal civil war. The opposition is composed of more than 1,000 disparate rebel groups, the most effective allied with al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists. A victory of the latter would be a blow to U.S. interests. Ousting al-Assad won't be cheap or easy. It took eight months to get rid of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, and he had no weapons of mass destruction, no serious air defenses or military capacity and no credible allies. And look at the end result: a post-Gadhafi environment in which there are too many guns, grievances and regional rivalries and no credible central authority. And Libya pales in comparison with Syria's complexities. Devising a serious military strategy to get rid of al-Assad -- serious weapons for the rebels; no-fly or -drive zones; and sustained air/missile strikes against Syrian military units, infrastructure and leadership targets -- also means U.S. responsibility for what follows. Barack Obama has avoided this option because he rightly doesn't want America getting stuck with the check for Syria. Muddle through . The option the U.S. is likely to undertake -- focused more narrowly on trying to deter the Syrians from using chemical weapons again and degrading al-Assad's military capacity in the process -- is far from ideal. Although I think the administration's military actions will be far more devastating than the limited strikes being talked about, it is unlikely to change the arc of the battlefield balance. There are other downsides, too. Once the glass ceiling against the use of force is broken, the expectations and pressures to use it again will grow. There's always the danger too of a response by Hezbollah or Syria against Israel, however unlikely. And sooner or later, al-Assad will commit some other horror that will require another U.S. response. This kind of episodic intervention without a real strategy can undermine American credibility, too. To be sure, there are real risks in acting on option three, and Obama most assuredly is a reluctant warrior. Indeed, in view of the parliamentary opposition to British Prime Minister David Cameron's willingness to join the U.S., he may be a lonely warrior, too. But he's going to war with Syria nonetheless. Al-Assad's apparent use of chemical weapons, the president's own words and those of others in his administration leave him no other choice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Miller .","Aaron Miller says President Obama seems to be leaning to the least bad option in Syria .
He says limited strike may be risky but less so than doing nothing or trying for regime change .
Miller: If Obama doesn't act after large chemical weapons attack, he'll be written off as ineffective ."

"(CNN) -- This week, as I was searching for popular topics and interesting articles, I kept finding posts dealing with obesity. It doesn't really make sense, but for whatever reason, the Internet world seems to be fascinated by fat. There was chatter about a new report that says by 2030 half of all adults in America will be considered obese. Essentially, in 18 years most of us will be sweating actual bacon grease. Sunbathing will smell delicious. Reading this report was sort of depressing, but at the same time, it was also kind of encouraging. Depressing, because we're all becoming a bunch of disgusting fat-bodies. Encouraging, because it sounds like, perhaps, the future holds pie! Another trending article told how lawyers for an obese death row inmate in Ohio say their client can't be executed because he weighs almost 500 pounds -- it'll cause too much pain and suffering to administer the lethal injection. On top of that, they argue that the gurney literally might not even be able to hold him. I simply can't imagine how one actually gains that much weight sitting behind bars, presumably separated by several states and (at the very least) a sheet of plexiglass from Paula Deen. I seriously don't know. Maybe he has conjugal visits with a tub of buttermilk. ""No, silly. I love you more."" But the story that really got to me -- the one that really tugged at the empty space where my heartstrings would be if I had the ability to feel -- was about a dog. A dachshund. But not just any dachshund. A 77-pound dachshund! I don't know how to put this any other way, but ... that's a huge wiener! (Thanks, folks. I'll be here all week.) The 5-year-old dog's name is Obie, and he was originally owned by an elderly couple in Seattle. Apparently, they expressed their love for him through food. And Obie expressed his love for them by becoming a zeppelin. A relative of the elderly couple eventually put out a plea for help, and a willing foster mom emerged in Portland, Oregon. When Obie finally arrived on August 18, driven down by a friendly volunteer, Nora Vanatta was shocked by the size of her new dog. The former vet tech had seen a lot in her day, but this thing here was blocking out the damn sun. Thus began Biggest Loser, Doxie Edition -- an epic quest to get Obie back into shape. Vanatta started a Facebook page for Obie -- who's otherwise healthy -- to track his weight loss and solicit donations for help. She also wanted her dog's story to rally humans. Vanatta wrote, ""My hope is that he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight. It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible. Prevention is the key!"" And she's right. Good habits make healthy dogs. Hopefully, excessive weight gain won't really be something I'm going to have to worry about with my dog, Mikey. He's a Great Dane mix who, one would think, could eat the entire contents of my fridge given a full hour and nothing better to do. But, amazingly, he's not overly motivated by food so much as he's completely motivated by licking the place where his testicles used to be. I stopped judging him a long time ago. I've got my hobbies. He's got his. Still, I don't get why he's not completely hyper-crazy-bonkers-insane about food like other dogs. I don't allow him any people food, so it's not like he knows he's missing out on something better. Which he is. Specifically, the McRib. Don't laugh. I swoon for that stupid thing. It completes me. ""No, silly. I love you more."" Eventually, Mikey eats. But when he's full, he stops. This dog literally has the self-control to leave remaining food just sitting in the bowl. Whereas I can't remember the last time I didn't lick my plate. I'm single, ladies. Your parents will love me. But despite my dog's disinterest in food, what's even more amazing is that Obie -- that short, stumpy dachshund -- actually weighs more than Mikey. And he's still completely adorable! Besides, chubbing out wasn't Obie's fault. Naturally, it was human error. Getting all nice and fat has clearly become the great American pastime. And these days there's an added incentive, because, now if you manage to get your entire family to weigh more than a Buick they give you a show on TLC! Though, not to be outdone, Obie has already been on the Today Show. And in his own private version of The Biggest Loser, he's sure to be the big wiener. (Thanks, folks. I'll be here all week.)","Bellini: For whatever reason, the Internet world seems to be fascinated by fat .

"(CNN) -- You can't escape tango in Buenos Aires. It is danced on the trains and in the streets. Restaurants in the bohemian neighborhoods of San Telmo and La Boca try to lure tourists inside with exhibition dancing outside their doors. Taxi drivers play tango music on their radios, and giant billboards promote choreographed tango shows. Tango grew from the working class port neighborhoods of Buenos Aires to become a global dance and music phenomenon that in 2009 was inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But for those visiting the Argentinean capital for the first time, the sheer number of opportunities to experience tango can be overwhelming, and many of the best venues are off the beaten track. Expat-New Yorker Migdalia Romero is here to help. Here, the author of the ""Tango Lover's Guide to Buenos Aires"" offers her insights for all aspiring ""tangueros"" traveling the city: . History . Tango was especially important in Buenos Aires at the turn of the century when immigrants -- especially men without partners -- were looking for a worthwhile diversion. The men would practice together to perfect their dance -- and hopefully impress the women. But tango moved from the brothels to higher society very soon after it became fashionable in Paris. The music has always been an integral part of growing up in Buenos Aires. Generations have been nursed on it. The older generation of women dancers remember when they danced resting on the feet of their fathers. Boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men (brothers and fathers) dancing. While tango skipped a generation of men and women who preferred rock in the 60s, it is now very much in vogue among the youth. Dance halls fill with young and old alike -- there are strictly no age restrictions. Read related: Musician's passionate journey through Buenos Aires . Embrace the passion . There's a saying in Spanish that captures the importance of the embrace in tango: ""El abrazo es mas important que el paso"" (The embrace is more important than the step) The prelude to tango begins at the moment that two people stand face to face and listen silently to a few notes of the music, before settling in on the embrace and beginning to dance. Tango is a dance that stresses elegant walking and close attention to the music. More than anything, if you are new to it, just enjoy the scene. Notice the subtle movements of the dancers, the ways in which they negotiate small spaces and crowded dance floors, and the delicate way they accomplish the seductive invitation to dance. Where to watch . There are classy dinner shows that feature full stage productions for tourists, and then there are intimate tango venues that provide more authentic shows for enthusiasts and local patrons. Be aware that dinner shows can be expensive, and some of the more hidden and intimate clubs offer a less expensive alternative -- many charging only for what is consumed. On Sunday afternoons at Plaza Dorrego in the San Telmo Antiques flea market, a local legend and resident, El Indio, does a demonstration of tango accompanied by a bit of history (in Spanish). Even if you don't understand the language, the demonstration is worth your time and, best of all, it's free. A number of ""milongas"" (dance halls dedicated to tango) offer late night shows with either live music and/or authentic exhibition dancing. Generally these milongas open at 11 pm, but Buenos Aires is a nocturnal city and the shows themselves don't normally start until after one in the morning. Two noteworthy examples are the milonga at Confiteria La Ideal on Thursday nights and that at Salon Canning on Tuesday and Friday nights after 11 pm. At both places you will see locals, as well as tourists who are completely hooked on tango, dancing socially while making sure to respect all the dance floor etiquette (""codigos"") that make this a cultural experience. You will notice men signaling silently for a dance across a crowded room with the nod of their head, a wink, or a raised eyebrow. Men and women are never seated together, even if they are in close proximity. The most traditional milongas place men on one side of the room and women on the other. If you're more interested in choreographed shows, then head straight to the Piazzolla Tango, which offers a flamboyant dinner show, preceded by a lesson. The space has been restored beautifully with a real air of art-deco elegance. Meanwhile, those concerned with the history and culture of tango should stroll to the former fruit and vegetable market area of Abasto in the Balvanera neighborhood, which is very much connected to Carlos Gardel -- the definitive tango icon. Gardel wrote many tango classics and was famed for his extraordinary baritone voice. He lived his whole life in Abasto and within a two block radius you will see signs of this famous tango figure on buildings, in stores, and even in the museum that was once his home. Where to learn . Tango is a dance that takes years to master. However, a good teacher can get you on the dance floor, walking simply and in time to the music, within a few lessons. The two studios that teach tango seriously and cater in large part to tourists from around the world are the Studio DNI and the Escuela Argentina de Tango at Galerias Pacifico -- inside a beautiful upscale mall. Both schools offer lessons to beginners as well as to experienced dancers. Some milongas also provide lessons right before the official dance begins. One of my favorites is Nuevo Chique at La Casa de Galicia. The class is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the late afternoons. Nothing builds the appetite more than a day of tango and, conveniently, there is a lovely Spanish restaurant on the second floor where hungry bellies are quickly satisfied.","Buenos Aires is the birthplace of tango, and the city still buzzes with its music and culture .

"(CNN) -- Scientists look at a warming Arctic and see a shift from white to green, as tundra gives way to new plant life. Governments and corporations are also seeing green, as receding ice cover opens new shipping routes and opportunities to get at long-hidden natural resources. But the downside of those opportunities is the risk that the current pace of climate change could be sped up dramatically by the release of long-trapped methane gas in the region's permafrost -- a risk to which a new study has attached an eye-popping price tag of $60 trillion in the next several decades, on top of previous estimates. That's trillion, with a ""T,"" a figure rivaling the entire globe's economic output in 2012. And it's a tab that's far more likely to be paid by people living in the latitudes far below the Arctic Circle, said Gail Whiteman, a researcher at Erasmus University in the Netherlands. The developing nations of Asia and Africa face more risk of bigger storms, worse flooding and more intense droughts, she said. ""It will have gains for some countries,"" Whiteman told CNN. ""But as we can see, if 80% of the impacts are going to be borne by developing regions, they're not getting any of the benefits."" Scientists have long worried that thawing the permafrost soil of the high northern latitudes could release large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide. U.S. and Russian scientists who study the region say methane has already started bubbling up from the floor of the East Siberian Sea -- a region believed to hold to 50 billion tons of the gas. ""Everybody should be trying to pay attention to the shifts that are happening in the Arctic, and not just leave that up to the Arctic countries and not just to some crazy researchers that are in that beautiful white space,"" Whiteman said. ""We all need to pay attention to what's happening, because the Arctic is the canary in the coal mine."" Using a British computer model, Whiteman and two scientists at Britain's Cambridge University estimated what would happen if the store of methane currently locked into the East Siberian Arctic Shelf were released over a 10-year period, without any other reductions in carbon emissions. The results, published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature, indicated that global average temperatures could hit 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial levels by 2035 -- 15 years earlier than currently predicted. Even if other emissions were limited, the 2-degree mark would still be reached by about 2040, they wrote. The same model had previously computed the costs of climate change at $400 trillion by 2200. Adding a decade-long rush of methane to the atmosphere would boost that by $60 trillion, mostly between 2050 and 2075, said Chris Hope, a modeling expert at Cambridge's Judge Business School. Even a slower release, dampened by other cuts in emissions, could cost $37 trillion -- a figure that dwarfs the $100 billion that Lloyds of London estimates will be invested in the Arctic over the next decade. The model includes the estimated effects of human health impacts and sea-level rise. Richer countries are better able to adapt to those changing conditions, but developing countries ""will suffer most of the extra impact,"" Hope said. And while the brunt of the damage will be inflicted closer to the Equator, Northern Hemisphere nations aren't likely to escape unscathed. ""Mid-latitude economies such as those in Europe and the United States could be threatened, for example, by a suggested link between sea-ice retreat and the strength and position of the jet stream, bringing extreme winter and spring weather,"" the paper states. Cambridge ocean physicist Peter Wadhams said receding sea ice cover in the Arctic has allowed summer temperatures in the East Siberian Sea to rise several degrees above freezing. ""Up to now, you've had offshore permafrost, which is a relic of the last ice age. And that's only been kept in place by the fact that the water is roundabout the freezing point,"" Wadhams said. But as the water over it warms, that permafrost has been thawing -- ""and what's been released from it have been huge plumes of methane gas."" How much methane is being released is still under study, Wadhams said. But atmospheric methane levels rose about 1% last year, and ""We think that the source is primarily this offshore methane plume from the Siberian sea,"" he said. While the idea of long-term, human-generated climate change is a controversial notion politically, it's accepted as fact by most researchers. Global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since the 1880s, according to NASA. The concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide hit a concentration unseen since prehistoric times at the benchmark Mauna Loa observatory in May, and scientists reported in November that the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica were losing mass at an accelerating rate. Researchers can't pin any particular storm on climate change, but say the warming of the air and oceans ""loads the dice"" in favor of more extreme weather. Whiteman said she hopes putting a price tag on one facet of the issue will spur debate and new action. The authors urged the World Economic Forum to support development of new economic models and press world leaders ""to consider the economic time bomb beyond short-term gains from shipping and extraction."" ""We need to get our act together globally, and if we can't do it globally, we need to do it more regionally,"" she said. And she said there may be opportunities for business, such as finding ways to capture the methane -- it's natural gas, after all. ""The story is not doom and gloom,"" she said. ""We're hoping that we can use this to kick-start some innovative discussions."" CNN's Ralitsa Vassileva and Tashiana Osborne and CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves contributed to this report.","Methane from Siberian permafrost could speed warming, raise costs .

"San Diego (CNN) -- The cast and directors of the upcoming ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" appeared this weekend at Comic-Con in San Diego to preview the film and reveal new footage. The movie, scheduled for release on April 4, was directed by brothers Joe and Anthony Russo and is meant to bridge the gap between ""The Avengers"" and its 2015 sequel. The footage screened to fans in Hall H reveals the superhero adjusting the modern world and presents Captain America with some new and dangerous challenges compared with the original ""Captain America"" film, which was set in the 1940s. ""The movie is very different in tone from the first one,"" Joe Russo said during a news conference after the panel. ""The first's one is kind of a love letter to the Captain of that time period. The Captain is now in the modern world and the film is a political thriller. In order to be germane to that tone, we wanted the movie to be modern and edgy and aggressive. ""You can't have thrills in the thriller unless the characters are in a real state of jeopardy. So Captain goes through a lot in this film. It's action-heavy and a very intense movie."" The directors won't reveal too much of the plot, but there are several new characters. Anthony Mackie plays Falcon, an ally of Captain America (Chris Evans). Details: The Avengers and their sequels . ""Cap is looking for a friend in the modern world,"" Russo said. ""He's sort of lost."" Robert Redford, playing a mysterious S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, appeared in the footage screened on Saturday, and Emily VanCamp was on hand to (sort of) discuss her character, Agent 13. ""I can't reveal too much about the character,"" VanCamp said. ""I think people have a certain idea of what I'm meant to be playing, but I think you'll be surprised at how we use this character. Compared to other characters I've done, it was certainly a challenging experience and an exciting experience."" The central point of the film seems to be a friendship between Captain America and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who initially joined forces in ""The Avengers."" ""The hurdle of Captain America is that his nature is to put himself last,"" Evans said. ""The first Captain America film is about getting the opportunity to serve, the opportunity to lead, to a soldier. I think he's so determined to do what's right. The conflict with this modern society as opposed to the '40s is in the '40s, it was easy to say 'the Nazis are the bad guys.' Today it's a little bit harder to know 'who am I serving?' ""It's not about doing the right thing, it's about 'what is the right thing?' We get to see Captain struggling with that. That's where his relationship with Black Widow comes to fruition. She's someone who has had to compromise her morals and not live in black and white, and I think as a result -- I can't say too much -- something happens.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors have offered Ariel Castro, a Cleveland man accused of holding three women captive for close to a decade, a plea deal that removes the possibility of the death penalty, a Cuyahoga County courts source said Thursday. The defense is considering the deal, and there is no signed agreement. The deal would include a recommendation to keep Castro in prison for life, the source said. ""We're on the home stretch,"" said a second source close to the case. That source said all that remains to be done to seal the deal is for Castro to plead guilty at the podium, which could happen at a hearing scheduled for Friday. An attorney for the victims told CNN they are hoping for a plea deal because they do not want to testify at trial. Earlier, the courts source said prosecutors and defense lawyers were close to an agreement. Castro, charged with 977 counts -- including aggravated murder, on suspicion of ending the pregnancy of one of his alleged captives -- is set to go to trial August 5 if a deal is not reached. The murder charges could trigger the death penalty. Castro's defense attorneys have said they want a deal that would take capital punishment off the table. ""Negotiations are close, but nothing is final,"" the court source said earlier Thursday. ""It's safe to say (Castro) wouldn't take a deal with the death penalty,"" the source said. According to authorities, Castro abducted Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002. The women, as well as Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who authorities say was fathered by Castro, were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away from his 1,400-square-foot home. Castro, a former school bus driver, pleaded not guilty to the charges this month. He is being held with bail set at $8 million. Besides two aggravated murder charges, Castro faces 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 counts of rape, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of felonious assault, three counts of child endangerment and one count of possessing criminal tools. CNN's Pamela Brown and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We're on the home stretch,"" says a source close to the case .

"(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home. Ahlittia North had been missing since Saturday morning. Her mother awoke to find her gone from their apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harvey. Late Tuesday night, authorities charged Matthew Flugence, the nephew of Ahlittia's stepfather, in the girl's death. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said Flugence, 20, often babysat for her. Flugence was arrested after he was spotted walking along a road in the area. He had a knife on him, Sheriff's Col. John Fortunato said. Witnesses told authorities that Ahlittia was a friendly, outgoing child who always wanted to be first at the door when the doorbell rang, Normand said. After she was reported missing Saturday, investigators spent all day combing her neighborhood, looking in alleys, Dumpsters and boarded-up fourplexes. They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again. That's when they found the girl's body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said. Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday -- but they still don't know when, he said. It's possible Ahlittia's body was placed there so the garbage trucks would take it away. Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings. Ahlittia suffered four stab wounds -- two to her neck, likely the fatal wounds, and two to the abdomen, Jefferson Parish Coroner Gerald Cvitanovich said. She also had bruises to the front and back of her head, shoulder, lower back, and lower extremities. Cvitanovich said were no obvious signs during an autopsy of sexual assault. Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said. Russell Flugence had information about the crime that he didn't come forward with, and he also had information implicating his brother, the sheriff added. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Police make an arrest .

"(CNN) -- When Apostolos Polyzonis's bank refused to see him last September, the 55-year-old Greek businessman had just 10 euros ($13) in his pocket. Out of work and bankrupt, he thought all he could do with his remaining money was to buy a gas can. Desperate and angry, Polyzonis stood outside the bank in central Thessaloniki, in northern Greece, doused himself in fuel and surrendered to the flames. ""At that moment, I saw my life as worthless, I really didn't care if I was going to live or die,"" recalls Polyzonis, who says he was hit by financial troubles after the bank recalled a loan given to him for his business. ""My sense of living was much lower than my sense of self-respect and pride, the fact that I had lost my right to be a free Greek,"" adds Polyzonis. Polyzonis, a father of three, was eventually saved by police. He recovered after spending seven days in hospital on life support. His public protest made headlines and touched a nerve with many Greeks bearing the burden of a worsening debt crisis. One in five Greeks was unemployed last year, according to Eurostat figures. Many more have suffered unprecedented hardship due to increasing pension and salary cuts. ""I don't feel proud about it, no way, but all these situations made me lose my self-respect and feel like I've been deprived of my rights,"" says Polyzonis, ""because being able to pay your taxes is not only an obligation but also a right. People should have the possibility to pay their taxes, to pay their obligations to others, to offer the basic goods to their family so they can feel that they live with self-respect and dignity."" Until now, Polyzonis's self-immolation was the most vivid image of a singular public act of protest in a country that's been shaken by anti-austerity violence. But Greece was jolted even more Wednesday after a 77-year-old man took his own life in the busy Syntagma Square, central Athens, the scene of several violent clashes between anti-austerity protesters and the police in recent months. Just a few hundred yards away from the Greek Parliament, retired pharmacist Dimitris Christoulas shot himself with a handgun amid the morning rush hour, in what was apparently a protest over the financial crisis gripping the nation. Minor clashes between police and protesters followed a vigil held Wednesday night to mark his death. Up to 1,000 people gathered for another rally Thursday in Syntagma Square, which was largely peaceful apart from a few scuffles between small groups of protesters, Athens police said. In his suicide note, Christoulas wrote that the government had made it impossible for him to survive, according to Greek state TV. Christoulas's death can be added to an increasing number of suicides in Greece, as more people feel hopeless amid the worst economic crisis in the country's recent history: according to the health ministry data, the suicide rate jumped about 40% in the first five months of 2011 compared with a year earlier. ""The further we go into the crisis, the more things get ugly,"" says Aris Violatzis of Klimaka, a non-governmental organization that runs a suicide helpline in Greece. The group -- Klimaka translates as ""scale"" -- says it receives up to 100 calls a day, with three of four callers citing economic problems as their main concern. In 2007, just before Greece fell into recession, the helpline used to take 10 calls a day maximum, explains Violatzis, and only one in four callers mentioned economic issues. ""The social framework in Greece has become pathogenic -- we have a morbid social environment where one of its symptoms is suicide,"" he adds. Under its second bailout program, approved last month, Greece has agreed to implement a series of austerity measures and undertake broader reforms to make its economy more competitive. New taxes, rising unemployment and cuts to pay, pensions and social welfare provisions have brought many ordinary Greeks to their knees. As Greece remains mired in financial woes -- the country's economy is heading for its fifth year of recession -- many now fear that Christoulas's public act of protest could find more imitators. ""I believe there are going to be more suicides and that's what got the government worrying,"" says archaeologist Despoina Koutsoumpa, who was among the hundreds who rushed yesterday in Syntagma Square to pay tributes to Christoulas. ""His act was a punch in the stomach for all of us. It made you realize that the overthrowing of these policies requires self-sacrifice, like in Tunisia and in Egypt where hundreds of people died,"" Koutsoumpa, a regular at the anti-austerity demonstrations in Athens, told CNN. ""In Greece there are also hundreds of people dying because of the crisis, people we don't see -- there are suicides over debts, there are people dying in the streets because they don't have anything to eat,"" she adds. ""A lot of people here understand that there will have to be even sacrifices of people in order to get rid of the situation."" Seven months after setting himself on fire, Polyzonis says more and more Greeks find themselves close to the desperate condition he was in last September. ""The situation is becoming every day worse,"" he says. ""Every day people lose their jobs, every day people are unable to pay rent for their house, the basics to find something to eat -- the last step before doing what I did or what another human being yesterday did in Greece.""","Suicide rate in Greece jumped 40% year-on-year in first five months of 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Trial lawyers use an expression -- ""You can't unring a bell"" -- after a jury is exposed to something damaging. Even if a judge commands people to disregard that something, the harm is done once the words have been uttered. George Zimmerman may be wishing that several ringing bells sounded in his attorney's opening statement last week could be unrung, beginning with a now infamous joke. After a streamlined prosecution opening in which a rapt courtroom was told of efforts to resuscitate Trayvon Martin's lifeless form and heard a straightforward argument that Zimmerman shot Martin ""because he wanted to, not because he had to,"" Zimmerman's attorney Don West chose to open his defense by telling a joke. Resorting to humor -- even in traffic court -- is fraught with risk, but seems a particularly unwise idea at the outset of a murder case in which the defense must counter the appearance of casual and callous indifference on Zimmerman's part. Even worse, perhaps, it runs the risk of appearing to trivialize the trial itself. (The joke chosen even implies that selected jurors who weren't savvy enough to dodge their civic duty will now have their time wasted.) Prosecutors will tell you that the most significant challenge to securing a guilty verdict is to persuade initially resistant jurors to grasp the gravity of a case, making them at least open to returning a guilty verdict. Several post-joke comments made by West in his opening could unwittingly pave a path to conviction. West said that it was a dangerous dog in Zimmerman's neighborhood that forced his hand, necessitating that he buy a 9 mm Kel-Tec PF automatic firearm. The attorney matter-of-factly suggested it was the American way for an ordinary person, faced with an uncontrolled animal in his community, to procure a firearm. (Firing shots at a menacing dog could easily imperil others, of course.) Arguing that during the confrontation with Martin, Zimmerman's head was struck against the pavement, West told the jury: ""When you get your bell rung, stuff happens."" While defending an emotional case like this is admittedly a tricky high-wire act, these words suggest an act of vengeance by an armed man rather than a genuine effort to avoid death. It will not be surprising to hear those words repeated back in the prosecution's closing statement. Five of the six jurors are mothers for whom ""stuff happens"" may seem an insufficient accounting for the termination of a life cut short shy of two decades. By his lawyer's account, Zimmerman's worries were not confined to perceived community dangers, but to his own physical well-being. He wanted to learn martial arts, West said, but washed out of fight school, where he was described as too ""soft."" Many defense attorneys deliver short openings or don't open at all because of the risk of a bad backfire. West's lengthy opening resulted in a composite picture of a person who easily conjures threats and fears, sought a gun as a leveler for his insecurities and whose response to these perceived threats could be seen as questionable and retaliatory. Criminal defendants are not only at the mercy of the state's awesome powers, but also must live with the tactical decisions of their attorney. Trying to persuade an appeals court to overturn your conviction because of detrimental choices made by your lawyers at trial is all but impossible. On Monday, the prosecution resorted to the often potent technique of using a defendant's inconsistent statements in an attempt to collapse his believability and blunt possible jury empathy for him. Prosecutors showed a video of Zimmerman giving an expansive explanation of what happened during a scene walk-through the day after the shooting, followed by playing a lengthy taped interview that was conducted by Sanford police a couple of days later. The prosecution hopes that jurors will agree that the more Zimmerman explains his actions, the more self-serving he sounds, and the less trustworthy he will appear, something vitally important for someone who, when all is said and done, offers the only account detailed enough to justify using lethal force. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eugene O'Donnell.","Eugene O'Donnell: In George Zimmerman's trial, his attorney began with a bad joke .

"(CNN) -- Having established itself as Apple's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper, Amazon will now go head to head with the category-defining iPad on its own turf. Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD. That pits the new device, which will ship in late November, against a device with which Apple has, thus far, squashed all direct competition. No tablet that has tried to match the iPad feature-for-feature has gained more than a token foothold in the market. So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up? Because only a few people have gotten their hands on the new device, some questions can't be answered yet. But here's a look at what we do know so far: . Price . The Fire comes out way ahead on this one, as is to be expected from Amazon, which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay Apple's heftier price tag. For $499, the cost of the lowest-end iPad (the 16GB, WiFi-only model), a buyer can get a 32GB version of the Fire HD with a 4G LTE connection on an upgraded cellular network. The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad. Size . While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire. Apple's iPad screen measures 9.7 inches diagonally, while the Fire is at 8.9 inches. That's less than the difference between the screen sizes on the iPhone 4S and the larger Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones. (There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen). But competition between Apple and Amazon could heat up on another front if rumors that Apple plans to release an ""iPad Mini"" turn out to be true. Display . Both tablets feature high-definition screens, although the details vary. The iPad's ""retina display"" featured a total of 3.1 million pixels, with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536. By contrast, the Fire HD measures 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, with custom features designed to reduce glare and improve color saturation. Both Apple and Amazon boast that the resolution on their tablet is so sharp that it's impossible for the human eye to discern individual pixels. Data plans . Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way. But Bezos announced that the top-end version of the Fire HD is available in 4G. The plan is offered at an attractive price of $50 a year. But that price gets you 250 MB of data per month -- not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media. It was unclear Thursday what the charges will be for going over the allotted data. The $50 is well under what AT&T and Verizon charge for a year of data on the iPad. When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data. Currently, Verizon offers a variety of plans, from 1GB of data per month for $20 (or $240 per year) all the way up to a massive 8GB per month for $80 ($960). AT&T offers a 250MB per month plan (the same as the Fire) for $15, or $180 per year. For $5 more, customers can get up to 2GB per month. There are obviously lots of permutations of plans customers can seek out for iPads, based on carrier and special offers. It's safe to say Amazon's is going to be less expensive, although it offers a minimal amount of data. Apps . It's hard to compete with Apple's App Store. There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad. Many work to take advantage of its display and screen size. Add the more than a half-million apps that run on mobile devices and you've got a lot from which to choose. Amazon, of course, likes to play up the movies and books that make up its universe of content (and the sale of which make Kindle prices possible). Bezos lumped together more than 22 million movies, TV shows, songs, apps, games, books, audiobooks and magazines available from Amazon's store. He showcased a few, nice-looking new apps. But while the Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Google's Android operating system, it only runs apps available from Amazon. That cuts the number available down to several thousand -- more than enough for many users, but nowhere near what the iPad offers.","Amazon's Kindle Fire HD goes head-to-head with the iPad .

"(CNN) -- ""If you give me Times Square, I want to give it back to the people."" JR, the 30-year-old globetrotting French street artist, could well say the same about the slums of Kenya or the favelas of Brazil, where he has created large-scale projects. Known for his black-and-white portraits, poster-sized or much larger and pasted on public walls, streets, grounds, rooftops and even trucks, JR considers himself an ""urban artivist"" -- i.e., an artist who is an activist. In New York earlier this month, he invited passersby to get their portraits taken and pasted on the ground at Times Square. Equipped with a photo booth truck that instantaneously printed 36""x53"" posters, his crew recruited volunteers -- some of whom held a large broom/brush and very sticky glue -- to help add the next portrait to the mosaic of faces. The line stretched long as endless numbers of tourists, New Yorkers and the curious waited for hours to get a piece of the action. Nearly 6,000 portraits were taken over three weeks. The Times Square project stemmed from an initiative that JR launched in 2011 when he won the prestigious TED Prize. Prizewinners get to make a wish and his was to start a global participatory art project. So was born ""Inside Out,"" which invited people all over the world to submit portraits, share a statement of what they stand for and paste the posters in a public space in their home cities. To date, the project has printed and sent more than 130,000 posters to their subjects in more than 100 countries. JR is drawn to impoverished and conflict-ridden regions, bringing attention to faces and people that most would easily ignore or forget. He goes to the poor, the repressed, the hungry and the invisible and gives them art in the form of portraits. Those on the receiving end feel, if only momentarily, joyful and proud. ""Art is not meant to change the world, but when you see people interacting, when you see an impact on their lives, then I guess in a smaller way, this is changing the world,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""So, that's what I believe in. That's why I'm into creating more and more interactions."" Unlike most visual artists, JR has no qualms about embracing technology. His medium may be archaic -- ink, paper, glue -- but he leverages the power of social media by inviting all to participate, upload, comment and share in what he likes to call the ""people's project."" He has a Facebook fan page, a Twitter account and is most active and at home on Instagram, where he shows what he's working on and relates to participants by liking their portraits. Yet when it comes to his personal identity, JR prefers anonymity. He has never revealed what his initials mean nor given out his real name. And he always wears dark glasses. He wants his art to be about others, not him. ""Even when I do really big pieces, I do them strips by strips -- so you have to paste, you have to involve people. It's a whole process. And I like that. For me, that's where the artwork is. But I use technology more and more, because that's a great way to share, that's a great way to be in touch with people. It's just a great way to do something and spread it to millions of people through the Internet."" But is interaction enough? One fan asked: What's artistic about JR's work? Another wondered if JR's posters too much resemble advertisements, especially in image-saturated cities like New York. JR has a response: ""I see this project as a social experimentation ... how people see themselves. ... And you see that sometimes -- they're like yeah, I want to paste it there! -- to show part of the community or people from different parts of the world. Or someone comes out and says -- Oh hey, I want to be at Times Square! I want my face up there -- and they have no message. Some people ask me if I like that or not. I can't like it or not. For me, it's a reflection. I have to observe it and study it."" Some people reveal themselves in the portraits by just being visible. Others reveal themselves by being incredibly expressive. The intentions of the portrait subjects vary as much as the responses they elicit. To be fair, many of JR's projects have taken place in far-flung parts of the world where people don't have easy access to print photographs. In the documentary, ""Inside Out: The People's Art Project,"" screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and debuting on HBO on May 20 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, we see the track of JR's career, from his start as a graffiti artist in the backstreets of Paris to his more recent projects in earthquake shattered Haiti. Director Alastair Siddons shows JR's work in the context of its environment, and underlying it is a consistent strand of social justice and political activism. In ""Women are Heroes,"" eyes and faces of women cover the rooftops of houses in the Kibera slum in Kenya. Seen aerially, the haunting group of eyes seems to call out to the heavens for help, for relief. In ""Face2Face,"" monumental portraits of Israelis and Palestinians in the same professions were pasted next to each other on both sides of the Separation Wall and in nearby cities. Most people couldn't distinguish the Israelis from the Palestinians. In one of the most powerful scenes from the HBO documentary, JR's cohort of photographers stealthily pasted portraits of ordinary Tunisians in a public square in the middle of the night. When day broke, people started tearing them down. It seemed Tunisians, who just went through a revolution and deposed their longtime president, Zine el Abidine Ben Ali -- whose huge posters used to be everywhere -- were not ready to accept any other large portraits in their public spaces. For the crowds in Times Square, maybe the portrait was about a moment in the spotlight. For the Tunisians, it was altogether something else. The message is simple. Portraits are powerful in their ability to evoke vastly different responses. It just depends on where you are and who you are.","JR, a French street artist, brought his ""Inside Out"" project to Times Square in New York .

"(CNN) -- The United States government on Friday released a declassified summary of why it says it believes Syria's government used chemical weapons in an attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21. The report's release came amid continuing U.S. signals of a possible military attack on Syria in response to the suspected poison gassing, which reportedly killed hundreds of people. Here are five key points: . 1. A chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 people August 21 . The U.S. government has preliminarily assessed that 1,429 people -- including at least 426 children -- died in the attack. The report cites ""a large body of independent sources,"" including U.S. intelligence information, accounts from medical personnel, videos, witness accounts and reports from nongovernmental organizations. Three hospitals in the area received about 3,600 patients with ""symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure in less than three hours ... according to a highly credible international humanitarian organization,"" the report said. ""The reported symptoms were consistent with mass exposure to a nerve agent."" What do Syria's neighbors think? The report also cites 100 videos showing bodies ""exhibiting physical signs consistent with, but not unique to, nerve agent exposure."" Some videos show imagery ""consistent with death from chemical weapons, and inconsistent with death from small-arms, high-explosive munitions or blister agents,"" the report said. 2. Syrian government launched rocket attack on area . Multiple intelligence streams show that the Syrians executed a rocket and artillery attack in the affected area shortly before symptoms were reported, the U.S. report said. This includes detection of rocket launches from government-controlled territory about 90 minutes before the first social media report of a chemical attack, the report said. 3. 'High confidence' that government behind chemicals . The report concludes ""with high confidence"" that the regime used the munitions to deliver chemical warfare agents. Some of the points it makes: . -- Intelligence indicates Syrian chemical weapons personnel were preparing chemical munitions. They ""were operating in the Damascus suburb of 'Adra from Sunday, August 18, until early in the morning on Wednesday, August 21, near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons, including sarin."" Bergen: Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. -- ""We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence."" -- ""On the afternoon of August 21, we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations. At the same time, the regime intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred."" 4. Opposition couldn't have fabricated this . ""We assess the Syrian opposition does not have the capability to fabricate all of the videos, physical symptoms verified by medical personnel and NGOs, and other information associated with this chemical attack,"" the report reads. Why Russia, China, and Iran are standing by Syria . The report also said that it was highly unlikely that rebels executed the attack. It cited, among other things, Washington's belief that the rebels have not used chemical weapons and have not carried out a large-scale rocket and artillery attack like the one seen August 21. 5. A possible reason why government would have used chemical weapons . ""The Syrian regime has initiated an effort to rid the Damascus suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital,"" the report said. ""The regime has failed to clear dozens of Damascus neighborhoods of opposition elements, including neighborhoods targeted on August 21, despite employing nearly all of its conventional weapons systems. ""We assess that the regime's frustration with its inability to secure large portions of Damascus may have contributed to its decision to use chemical weapons on August 21."" The report adds that Washington, to protect sources and methods, cannot publicly release all available .","U.S. report says more than 1,400 people killed in August 21 Damascus-area attack .

"(CNN) -- The European Union forged a political agreement on Monday to list the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, a European diplomat told CNN. The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group, which is a strong force in Lebanese politics, already is regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town . There had been political pressure to put the entire group on the terror list amid developments in Bulgaria and Cyprus. The designation would put asset freezes on Hezbollah entities. ""Legal details need to be worked on in the coming days,"" the diplomat said. The Bulgarians cited evidence that Hezbollah's military wing was involved in a terrorist attack last year that killed five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian bus driver. In Cyprus this year, a court found a Hezbollah member guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on Israel. Lately, its fighters have sided with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's civil war. Terrorism at a moment of transition . The European Union agreed to target just the military component, the diplomat said. Critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity isn't effective or practical. Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni's spokeswoman called the decision ""correct and just,"" adding that it ""puts an end to the wrong argument"" that Hezbollah's military activities are absolved by the group's political status. ""Even if Hezbollah is a political party, that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities,"" the spokeswoman said. Positive reaction . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the move ""will have a significant impact on Hezbollah's ability to operate freely in Europe by enabling European law enforcement agencies to crack down on Hezbollah's fundraising, logistical activity and terrorist plotting."" ""As Hezbollah has deepened its support for the brutal Assad regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world, a growing number of governments are recognizing Hezbollah as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is,"" Kerry said. ""We call on other governments to follow the EU's lead and to take steps to begin reining in Hezbollah's terrorist and criminal activities."" White House spokesman Jay Carney cited Hezbollah's support for the al-Assad regime in Syria. ""The United States is proud to stand with the European Union on this front,"" Carney said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the agreement sends ""a clear message"" that the European Union ""stands united against terrorism."" ""It shows that no organization can carry out terrorist acts on European soil, such as the appalling attack in Bulgaria one year ago, without facing the consequences. European nations have rightly come together in response,"" he said. U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, praised the EU move, noting the Bulgarian and Cyprus developments and Hezbollah's role in Syria underscore its terrorist identity. ""While I believe that the entire Hezbollah organization unabashedly qualifies for a place on the European Union list of terrorist organizations, today's decision will send a clear message to Hezbollah, and to their primary backer Iran, that Europe is not a safe haven for terrorists,"" Menendez said. Donilon: Hezbollah not 'responsible political actor' Hezbollah was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to go after the Palestine Liberation Organization and has been accused of high-profile terror attacks over the years. Opinion: Time for G8 to make Hezbollah statement . ""Hezbollah first gained notoriety in 1983 after it bombed the United States Embassy in Beirut -- an attack that killed 63 people. Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah bombed the American and French Marine Barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans and 58 French service members with one of the largest explosive devices ever detonated during a terrorist attack,"" Tom Donilon, President Barack Obama's former national security adviser, wrote in a New York Times column this year. ""Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the group conducted kidnappings and airplane hijackings, two bombings in Buenos Aires, several in Paris and an attempted bombing in Bangkok. In 1996, it assisted in the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 Americans. Thanks to this bloody record, in 1997 Hezbollah was among the first groups added to the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations."" Donilon said the group has tried to portray itself as a political entity focused on social services and defending the country. ""But it is an illusion to speak of Hezbollah as a responsible political actor. Hezbollah remains a terrorist organization and a destabilizing force across the Middle East,"" he said. Renewed Israeli-Palestinian talks planned . The latest EU move comes amid two diplomatic developments last week: its own intention to ban funding to Israeli entities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and serious diplomatic wrangling over peace in the Middle East. Kerry is working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together for peace talks. Opinion: Europe, name Hezbollah in terror . EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton noted that the European Union published a document reiterating ""the long-held position that bilateral agreements with Israel do not cover the territory that came under Israel's administration in June 1967."" The move prompted criticism out of Israel and from some U.S. lawmakers, who called it ""counterproductive."" She said the ""specific provisions"" of the guidelines covering Israel-EU ""funding instruments"" won't be implemented before January 1. ""This is meant to clarify the EU's position in advance of negotiations of agreements with Israel during the forthcoming financial perspective commencing in 2014. In no way will this prejudge the outcome of peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. It has been the EU's long-held position that it will recognize changes made to the borders once agreed,"" Ashton said. She said the European Union is ""deeply committed"" to peace negotiations. Hezbollah has been a staunch opponent of Israel. The Jewish state and Hezbollah also fought a war in 2006 after the military group kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Beirut and CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta. CNN's Tom Cohen in Washington contributed to this report.","NEW: White House says U.S. ""proud to stand"" with EU on the matter .

"Washington (CNN) -- As more than one pundit has noted, President Barack Obama now has three choices in Syria: Bad, worse, and horrible. At least the evidence is steadily stacking up to suggest that is the case. Last year, Obama made it clear that the United States would take action if Syria crossed ""a red line"" by using chemical weapons in its civil war. And there's evidence that it has. What's not clear is what kind of action the United States will or should take. Some of the players in that troubled country's civil war are more unsavory than others, but there appears to be no clear or reliable ""good side"" behind which the president might deploy U.S. military might at this moment. Indeed, military, political, and diplomatic analysts widely agree that every potentially positive move on the table is freighted with negative side effects. ""I think there are no good options in Syria,"" says retired Army Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN contributor. ""There is an array of bad options and you have to take the least bad option that is out there."" So let's break down those options, including some that have already come and gone in this tortured march toward a possible military engagement: . Option 1: Ground troops . The White House called this a non-starter from the get go. You don't have to be a political scientist to know that American voters are exhausted by more than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and would show little or no tolerance for more boots on the ground in the Middle East. Furl the flag, lieutenant; no one is going anywhere tonight. What do Syria's neighbors think? Option 2: Establishing a no-fly zone . Yes, it might work, but the administration has shown little taste for that, either. Maintaining such a presence over the months it might take to have an impact would be hideously expensive, and would involve endangering U.S. pilots with highly uncertain results in a battle that many Americans find confusing at best, baffling at worst. Option 3: Arming the rebels . This is a monkey trap in which the United States has been snared before. Some brave rebel group proclaiming its love of freedom and democracy arises to oppose a distant tyrant. America rewards the rhetoric with training, missiles and munitions. The coup is accomplished and suddenly, to paraphrase Woody Allen, the oppressed start looking a lot like the oppressors and they no longer return your phone calls. In Syria it is even more complicated. As the civil war has droned on against President Bashar al-Assad, interlopers affiliated with terrorist groups have become big-leaguers. ""Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, is generally acknowledged to be the most effective force fighting,"" says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen who adds, ""Al-Nusra's military prowess and close ties to al Qaeda make it a potentially serious threat to U.S. interests in the region."" Bergen: Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Syria watchers roundly agree that no other rebel group is currently positioned to take control of the country. In other words, if the United States pushes too hard or too fast to overthrow al-Assad (even though in the long run, American officials do want him gone) the U.S. risks helping terror groups take power. And you know what they say about the devil you know... Option 4: Securing United Nations' support . Not going to happen without some other major developments in Syria. Russia and China have left no doubt that they will oppose any effort at the U.N. to approve a strike, and other countries have hardly shown much appetite for the subject. Why Russia, China, and Iran are standing by Syria . President Obama calls it an ""incapacity"" on the part of the U.N., but there is no sign that the name-calling will change anything. Does the public care about U.N. support? Option 5: Assembling a coalition without the U.N. A week ago, newscasts were buzzing with speculation about a nascent coalition, perhaps born of NATO allies -- a daring group of nations ready to stand with the United States as it punished al-Assad. Secretary of State John Kerry is ballyhooing support from the Arab League, Turkey, and France, saying ""We are not alone in our will to do something."" One by one, however, names have slipped off of the list from this support group. And with the British Parliament now having rejected the idea of Britain's military getting involved, Obama is looking more and more like the lone commander charging the hill while his allies hunker down in the trenches. Option 6: Firing missiles from warships in the Mediterranean . Yes, it is pretty much down to that now, and even that option is complicated. Make no mistake: Cruise missiles are magnificent, virtually unstoppable weapons capable of pinpoint, devastating strikes. However, all the days of wrangling have given the Syrians an immense amount of time to hide their own weapons, secure their airplanes, and disperse critical command and control assets. Should the Tomahawks start flying, they may well find themselves crashing down into an inordinate number of empty buildings, according to Gen. Marks -- or worse, into places packed with civilians. What's more, Syria's allies such as Iran could respond to what would undoubtedly be called an act of war by stepping up aid to al-Assad, and he could emerge with a stronger military as a result. At home the situation is not much better. The White House has blitzed the airwaves and the Internet with official statements. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has declared the military ready to go. Secretary Kerry has described the lurid pictures of chemical attack victims, saying ""All of them show and report victims with breathing difficulties, people twitching with spasms, coughing, rapid heartbeats, foaming at the mouth, unconsciousness, and death..."" President Obama himself sat down with PBS to explain the broader, regional implications of allowing Syria to use chemical weapons with impunity. ""This is a volatile country in a very volatile region. We've got allies bordering Syria. Turkey is a NATO ally, Jordan a close friend that we work with a lot. Israel is very close by. We've got bases throughout the region. We cannot see a breach of the nonproliferation norm that allows, potentially, chemical weapons to fall into the hands of all kinds of folks."" But none of it seems to have mattered much. The president faces stiff opposition in Congress. Democrats, like Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, are saying that America ""cannot be the lone sheriff of the whole world. The United States must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries."" Republicans, like Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, seem disturbed by the administration's lack of clarity on the mission and timetable. ""The administration informed us that they have a 'broad range of options' for Syria,"" he says, ""but failed to layout a single option."" As for the public, an NBC poll has found only half of Americans support any kind of military action against Syria, and 80% say it should happen only with congressional approval. So we're back to where we started: The choices are dreadful and would be for any president, Democratic or Republican; the outcomes are wildly uncertain; and the consequences -- no matter which direction he turns -- are likely to be grave. Against this backdrop of unspeakable acts and unfathomable causes and effects, perhaps it is small wonder that Obama keeps saying, ""I have not made a final decision."" Although in the very act of doing that, he is committing to one choice not mentioned so far: Waiting. Waiting to see if some new evidence, some new ally, some new intelligence clears the smoke over Syria and makes plain a way forward.","Analysts say there are no good options for the U.S. in Syria .

"(CNN) -- Let me just start by saying this: Redemption, political or otherwise, is a good thing. And by and large, voters are amenable to proffering forgiveness -- especially when they believe the candidate is making a good-faith effort to reform, atone and emerge as a chastened and wiser person. And so it was with Anthony Weiner, the erstwhile sexter who left Congress in disgrace two years ago to work on his problem, his life and his marriage. At least that's what we thought he was doing, until we learned this week that -- one full year after he resigned from Congress -- he was still sending explicit text messages to a young woman. Maybe there are more. New Yorkers react to Weiner's scandal . We don't know the full story, and honestly, it's hard to say whether we ever will, or how much we should care. But here is what we do know, and this does matter: That Weiner is running for mayor of New York, and that in preparing us for his candidacy in April, he cleverly alluded to the fact that there were more texts with other women. ""I did it, with more than one person,"" he said. ""It was wrong. I was doing it for some time, and I'm glad it's behind me."" What we didn't know was it wasn't that far behind him. In Weiner's efforts to inoculate himself against further women coming out, he left the timing of his inappropriate behavior vague. He knew that most of us would assume that, once he resigned from Congress in disgrace, he was fully involved in recovery, trying to regain his identity. An Anthony Weiner timeline . Instead, he was masquerading as Carlos Danger. And he was trolling as this bon vivant at least a full year after he left office. So while he has been making the case that his family's love, support -- and therapy -- has gotten him to a good place, he kind of forgot to tell us one key fact: His sexual misconduct did not end with his resignation from office. Silly us for assuming that? Or silly us for allowing him to let us believe that? All of which begs the question: Why believe him now? Enter Huma Abedin, his smart, savvy, politically connected (especially to the Clintons) wife. It was breathtaking to see her Tuesday next to Weiner. Not only standing beside him as The Good Wife but also speaking directly to voters. ""I have forgiven him,"" she told us. ""I believe in him."" Indeed, she said, the decision to keep the marriage together ""took a lot of work"" and ""a whole lot of therapy."" Opinion: Why does Abedin put up with Weiner? I am sure it did, and we should respect her decision -- both to stand by her man and to speak. But here's one question: Is running for mayor a required part of couples therapy? This should be a private matter. But once Weiner threw his hat in the ring, asking for redemption, it became a lot less private. The couple participated in a very orchestrated PR rollout -- with interviews in The New York Times Magazine and People magazine, discussing their personally difficult journey. And we seem to be on it with them, like it or not. Weiner's problem is not just about his personal compulsions. It's also about his inability to tell the complete truth to the people he is asking to redeem and forgive him. When he was first caught in the sexting scandal, it took him what seemed like forever to fess up -- after lying, and saying he had been hacked. And now, while hinting last spring there were other women, he never actually said his sexting did not stop when he left Congress. He says it's behind him now. Thanks for that. Eliot Spitzer, who is trying to manage his own political redemption as he runs for New York City comptroller, was no doubt thrilled to be asked about Weiner. He deflected the question, as if to implyâ€”as others haveâ€”that it's a personal matter, between Weiner and his wife. Sad to say, it no longer is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: When Weiner left Congress, we assumed he would deal with problems .

"Passaic, New Jersey (CNN) -- Neighbors gathered around Eagle Liquors on Monday were sizing each other up as they waited to hear which one of them just struck it rich. ""Everyone is saying, 'Is it you? Is it you?' It's a cat and mouse game,"" Robert Ash said. ""Everyone's coming together, smiling, trying to figure out who it is.""

Lottery officials haven't confirmed the identity of the winner, but Pedro Quezada says he's that man. For winner, unexpected change can come with those dollars . Quezada stopped by the store Monday afternoon, mobbed by camera crews, and store owner Sunil Sethi told CNN that Quezada presented the winning ticket earlier in the day. Lottery spokeswoman Judith Drucker confirmed that the winning ticket was brought into the store, and the holder left with the form needed to claim the prize. But the agency won't confirm the identity of the winner until the forms are filed, Drucker said. Sethi said his customers have been winners before -- but not with a jackpot this big.

At the time the ticket was bought, the winner chose the up-front cash option instead of an annuity.

"(CNN) -- Yemeni jets launched an aerial assault Thursday against suspected senior al Qaeda operatives meeting in a remote location, and about 30 militants were killed, according to the Yemen news agency SABA. Without mentioning a number, the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said in a news release, ""Preliminary reports suggest that the strike targeted scores of Yemeni and foreign al Qaeda operatives."" One of the militants may have been the radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, the embassy said. Al-Awlaki recently told the Arab-language Web site of Al-Jazeera that he had been in touch with the U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5. In that interview, al-Awlaki said Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan communicated with him via e-mail starting about a year before he went on the shooting rampage. Hasan wanted al-Awlaki's advice about killing U.S. troops, the cleric said. ""Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the regional al Qaeda leader, and his deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, alongside Anwar al-Awlaki, were presumed to be at the site (of Thursday's attack),"" according to a news release from the Yemen Embassy in Washington. Also among those targeted was Mohammed Saleh Oumair, who spoke a few days ago at a rally in Abyan province in southern Yemen, the government said. The apparent purpose of the meeting was to plan a retaliation operation after Yemeni forces raided militant hideouts last week in Abyan and in Sanaa province, where the nation's capital is located, the embassy said. Security forces killed 34 terrorists and arrested 17 in that raid, officials said. Al Qaeda in Yemen has been a growing concern for the country's government and the United States. In late July, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the U.S. Central Command, and an accompanying delegation met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. One of the topics of discussion was how to better combat terrorism, according to SABA.","Strike occurred at a hideout where suspects were holding a meeting .

"(CNN) -- David Cameron must have whiplash. Practically overnight this week, the British prime minister went from being one of the leading voices demanding that Syria's President Bashar al-Assad be punished for using chemical weapons, to a humbled, chastened politician with his hands tied. British lawmakers voted Thursday night against even the possibility of using force against Syria, forcing Cameron to concede bluntly, ""We will not be taking part in military action."" What do Syria's neighbors think? The vote was close -- seven MPs out of the 557 who voted could have changed the result -- and the outcome was a shock. Prime ministers aren't supposed to lose votes on the use of military force. British media said it hadn't happened in hundreds of years. But although the result was stunning in one sense, in another it wasn't surprising. Over more than seven hours of debate on Syria loomed one chilling specter: Iraq. Bergen: Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Britain feels badly burned by the way Tony Blair led the country into war there a decade ago, and Cameron was fighting a defensive battle against the memory of Blair from the moment he kicked off debate in the House of Commons: ""I'm deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts, in particular the deep concerns of the country of what went wrong in Iraq. We're not invading a country; we're not searching for chemical weapons."" It's an argument he needed to make. Why Russia, China, and Iran are standing by Syria . Just a few hours earlier, the speaker of Syria's Parliament raised the memory of the ""dodgy dossier"" which Blair's critics say falsely helped lead Britain to invade Iraq. And some lawmakers clearly felt burned by the Blair government's case for war, based on false intelligence. Even a senior member of Cameron's own Conservative Party warned Thursday: ""We must consider that our intelligence might be wrong because it has been before. ""And we must be very hard on testing it,"" David Davis said. Does the public care about U.N. support? ""We cannot ignore the calamitous lessons of the Iraq war,"" said Angus Robertson of the Scottish National Party, who opposed action in Syria. That's a very normal human response -- so common that there are cliches about it, like ""once bitten, twice shy,"" and ""fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" It's also the wrong response. Syria is not Iraq. It's not Libya or Serbia or Nazi Germany. Syria is Syria. Be careful in trying to follow history . Tempting as it is to base policy decisions on past experience, it's dangerous. No two situations are the same. And yet politicians and pundits, generals and journalists do it all the time. Traumatized by the image of U.S. troops being dragged dead through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, Washington declined to intervene in the mass killings in Rwanda a year later. With those hundreds of thousands of deaths fresh in its memory, the West did intervene in Bosnia when concentration camp-style images suggested that genocide was going on there. Any of those decisions could have been right or wrong on their own merits -- the critical thing is that they must have been made on their own merits. Somalia is not Rwanda. Neither one is Bosnia. Iraq is not Afghanistan. For that matter, David Cameron is not Tony Blair and Barack Obama is not George W. Bush. Difficult as it may be, policymakers must not rely on historical examples because every case is unique. It's intellectually dishonest to say the West shouldn't bomb Syria because Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction; it's naive to say it should bomb because bombing Libya helped dislodge Muammar Gadhafi. Syrian evidence and policy must be considered solely on their own merits. The story of the boy who cried wolf is a caution not to raise false alarms, but it also contains an admonishment for the villagers who didn't check the facts when it turned out there really was a wolf. As usual, Mark Twain put it best: ""We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there, lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again and that is well but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.""","Lessons of Iraq pervade dramatic debate in Britain .
No two international situations are the same .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The annual Electronics Entertainment Expo, which wrapped up here Thursday, is all about next-generation gaming. More than 45,000 game industry professionals got their first look at Microsoft's Xbox One, which will retail for $500 starting in November, and Sony's PlayStation 4, which will sell for $400 this fall. But for players, the real focus at the show was on the next generation of games, especially the slew of exclusives lined up for each device. What's at stake is a piece of the global video-game market, which Newzoo video game analyst Peter Warman expects to reach $70.4 billion this year and grow to $86.1 billion by 2016. Warman forecasts that the number of gamers worldwide will reach 1.2 billion this year. The latest crop of games features an upgrade in graphic fidelity that brings athletes like Miami Heat star LeBron James to life in 2K Sports ""NBA 2K14"" in photorealistic detail. Watching an ""EA Sports UFC"" match on Xbox One or PS4 is like seeing a live mixed martial arts pay-per-view, thanks to new technology. Even the undead look better, as the zombies in Capcom's Xbox One exclusive ""Dead Rising 3,"" an open world horror game, would scare the ""walkers"" of AMC's ""The Walking Dead."" The new consoles feature the processing power to create larger, more immersive open worlds for gamers to explore, as evidenced in Ubisoft's online open world role-playing game ""Tom Clancy's The Division."" The latest game in the Tom Clancy universe, which has sold more than 76 million games worldwide, is set in New York after a lethal virus has unleashed chaos. But among a host of fresh-looking titles, there were several that stood out at E3 2013. ""Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag"" (Ubisoft, October 29, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One): Ubisoft is betting that gamers will love living a pirate's life this fall with this open world virtual Caribbean. Set in the turbulent 18th-century West Indies, the game lets players step into the boots of Edward Kenway and set sail for adventure across a huge map with more than 50 islands and locations to explore. Gamers will interact with famous pirates like Blackbeard and Charles Vane as they contend with warring British and Spanish ships and armies and other privateers. Seamless gameplay allows the player to traverse the rooftops of a bustling Havana and then jump into the ocean to climb aboard the ship Jackdaw and escape. This bestselling franchise continues to innovate with new gameplay and a constantly changing window into history -- one that's fun to play through again and again. ""Destiny"" (Activision/Bungie, 2014; Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3): Bungie knows a thing or two about shooters, having built ""Halo"" into a global franchise for Microsoft. Now, the developer has partnered with ""Call of Duty"" publisher Activision to add multiplayer and a persistent world to the alien-fighting action. Players take on the roles of Guardians of the last city on Earth in a story that spans the solar system. The shooting action is trademark Bungie, but where this game stands out is the seamless blending of cooperative gameplay into bigger public events like taking out a giant alien boss with other players who are also exploring the world. There are community spaces for players to prepare for their next missions and connect with friends, as well as competitive multiplayer (although Bungie is keeping mum on details). The developer has mapped out a franchise worth of adventures for this new world, and the first reveal looks promising. ""Ryse: Son of Rome"" (Microsoft/Crytek, Xbox One): Players take control of Gen. Marius Titus in this brutal third-person action game that blends elements from popular movies like ""Gladiator"" and TV series like ""Rome"" and ""Spartacus."" In addition to featuring sword and sandal hack-and-slash gameplay, the player will have to order troops to do things like fire catapults at enemies and remain in formation with shields up to avoid an onslaught of arrows. Ancient Rome has never looked more beautiful, not that the game's pace will give players much time to take in the scenery. Developer Crytek, creator of the ""Crysis"" franchise, is making the most of Xbox One with this interactive take on history. The first gameplay demo at E3 showcased a pick-up-and-play experience that blended swordplay and shield defense through an active battlefield. The amount of activity around your army is staggering and a glimpse into what next generation offers. ""The Crew"" (Ubisoft/Ivory Tower, Xbox One, PlayStation 4): Though there was a lot of traffic in the racing genre, from Electronic Arts' ""Need for Speed Rivals"" to Sony's ""Driveclub,"" one game stood out from the crowd. Ubisoft's ""The Crew"" introduces the entire United States as a cooperative playing ground for up to four players to join up and take on missions in fully realized cities like New York, Las Vegas and New York. The heart of this experience is a gearhead's dream, which allows players to customize licensed vehicles to the smallest details. Depending on whether the mission is across Miami beaches or the Las Vegas desert, players can fine-tune their vehicles before leaving the garage. Driving games (and sports titles) are among the best ways to showcase new technology, and ""The Crew"" delivers. ""Titanfall"" (Electronic Arts/Respawn, 2014, Xbox One, Xbox 360, PC): The original founders of Infinity Ward are offering a very different first-person shooter experience with ""Titanfall."" The game features pilots who can fight on the ground with traditional weapons (and a cool jetpack) or jump into 24-foot-tall Titans, mechanized robots that introduce a lot of firepower to the battlefield. The dynamic and advantage of these two very different fighting styles -- agile pilots and hulking Mechs -- introduces something fresh to the crowded shooter genre. The action, which in an E3 demo focused on protecting a hovering spacecraft, is fast and furious. It's seamless jumping from on-foot action to the hulking Titans as the battle erupts around you. The game's multiplayer features Hollywood-style action sequences as centerpieces of this conflict between warring factions (the Interstellar Manufacturing Corp. and the Militia) in a distant frontier.","New wave of video games at E3 2013 show off better graphics, more expansive worlds .

"Boston (CNN) -- Courtroom drama erupted Friday when James ""Whitey"" Bulger stood and angrily addressed the judge, without the jury present, about how his murder trial was ""a sham"" and he wasn't going to take the stand in his own defense. That provoked an outburst from the widow of a man who is among 19 people Bulger is charged with killing. The judge quickly restored order. Bulger told the court Friday why he won't testify. ""My thing is...I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,"" the reputed Irish mafia boss told the federal judge. His voice shaking, the 83-year-old Bulger told the judge he had a deal with now-deceased Jeremiah O'Sullivan, the head of the Justice Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force who later became U.S. attorney in Boston during the height of Bulger's allegedly brutal reign. ""In return he promised to give me immunity. As far as I'm concerned I didn't get a fair trial,"" Bulger said. He didn't elaborate on what the agreement was. Judge Denise Casper questioned Bulger on his decision not to testify. Bulger responded: ""I'm making the choice involuntarily. I feel I've been choked off from making an adequate defense."" Bulger's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side . At one point, the widow of a man whom Bulger allegedly killed interrupted proceedings with an outburst. ""You're a coward!"" Patricia Donahue asserted when Bulger indicated he would not testify. Casper called for ""silence"" in the gallery. Bulger is charged with killing Donahue's husband, Michael. Jurors were not present when Bulger spoke or when Donahue made her outburst. When the jury returned to the courtroom, the defense rested, concluding 35 days of testimony. Bulger's claim to immunity seemed to contradict his legal defense: His lawyers spent a large part of the seven-week trial disputing assertions that Bulger was an FBI informant. The judge previously ruled that Bulger could not argue immunity as defense in this trial. The jury will begin hearing closing arguments Monday. Outside of court, Tommy Donahue, son of Michael Donahue, shared his mother's sentiment and called Bulger ""a rat coward."" ""He is going to take his secrets to the grave with him,"" Donahue said of Bulger. Before resting its case, the defense read aloud the prior deposition of one witness who has brain cancer and could not deliver testimony in person. In all, the defense called 10 witnesses over five days. Prosecutors called 63 witnesses. One of the witnesses did double duty, called to the stand by each side. That means the jury heard from a total of 72 witnesses over the 35 days. Bulger witnesses' death ruled a homicide . Bulger's defense team said earlier in the day that Bulger is prepared to forfeit the assets found in his Santa Monica, California, apartment to the families of two men he is accused of murdering. Nearly $822,000 was found in the alleged Boston Irish mob boss's possession when he was arrested in 2011. ""My client is prepared to have all the money forfeited to the victims' family that prevailed at trial first, but had it reversed because of ... a highly technical (court) process,"" J.W. Carney said Friday. The families of alleged murder victims Donahue and Brian Halloran -- whom Bulger is also accused of killing -- won a judgment in 2009, but an appeals court tossed it out, saying the suit was filed too late. The Donahue family has been in court virtually every day of this trial. There remains a question as to whether Bulger's offer is a meaningful one. The government has seized the money, so technically it no longer belongs to Bulger. Only if he is found innocent and the money is found to have been earned legitimately would it be returned. Carney confirmed outside of court that Bulger's decision not to testify was made shortly before it was announced, after his client heard all of the witness testimony. Tommy Donahue expressed appreciation to Bulger's defense attorneys Hank Brennan and Carney. ""I tip my hat to Carney and Brennan,"" Tommy Donahue said, referring to the gesture of forfeiting Bulger's recovered assets to his family and Halloran's family. In a 32-count indictment, prosecutors accuse Bulger of participating in 19 murders, racketeering, money laundering and extortion during some two decades. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Deborah Feyerick contributed from Boston and Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles. Ross Levitt contributed to the report.","Widow of alleged victim shouts from gallery to Bulger, ""You're a coward!""
""He is going to take his secrets to the grave with him,"" her son says later .
""This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,"" Bulger tells the judge .
He offers assets of nearly $822,000 to murder victims' families if convicted ."
"(CNN) -- Susie Wolff says she will keep fighting to win a place on the Formula One grid -- but she won't rely on her sexuality to get there. Wolff took a big step forward as she spent a full day testing a Williams F1 car at Silverstone. It was the first meaningful running by a female driver in 20 years. ""Some say I seem very reluctant to play the female card but ultimately a race team is only going to put the best driver they can in a race car,"" said Wolff. ""It was important to show that I have the performance. I'm really pleased. ""I'm not going to say 'give me the [seat] right now because I'm a girl and I was fast enough.' I've got to keep fighting hard."" The 30-year-old Scot, who started karting at the age of eight, completed 89 laps of the challenging British Grand Prix circuit. Wolff was the ninth fastest of 16 drivers running at Silverstone Friday. Her best lap of one minute 35.093 seconds was 2.199 seconds slower than the fastest time set over the three-day test by Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel. It is difficult to read into testing but to put Wolff's time into context the leading Williams car was also just over two seconds slower than Vettel during qualifying at the last race in Germany. Wolff was watched late on in the test by her husband Toto Wolff, who is a minority shareholder in the Williams team and director of the Mercedes F1 team. Experienced Ferrari driver Felipe Massa, who was on track at the same time as Wolff, praised her impressive full track debut. ""She was pretty quick,"" said the Brazilian. ""I was very happy for her when I saw her lap times. ""It would be good for a team to push Susie in driving at the races and it would be very interesting for everybody to have her in Formula 1."" Wolff, who ended her career in the German Touring Car Championships [DTM) to join the Williams team as a development driver in 2012, said her main aim was to earn the right to drive again for the team, not to earn acceptance in the male-dominated sport. ""For me it's not about getting praise, it's not about caring what the other drivers think,"" she said. ""It's most important that the team are happy because if they're happy I'm going to get more chances. ""Many people said they were crazy and why would they waste a day on me but they took that chance and I was happy that I could do a good job. ""I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think this was possible and I believe in myself. ""After a tough end to my DTM career many people assumed I was always at the back and just wasn't quick enough but I have showed that was possibly an unfair judgment."" F1 experts at Silverstone were impressed with Wolff's debut and were pleased to see a positive performance by a female racer. Spaniard Maria de Villota, who was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012, lost her right eye in an accident on her first run in the team's race car. Of the five women to join F1 before Wolff and De Villota, only two have ever qualified to start a race. The most prolific of these was Italian Lella Lombardi, who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s. Lombardi made history while driving with March at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the only woman to register a point-scoring finish in a grand prix. Tire test . The Silverstone test doubled up as an opportunity to evaluate new drivers and for many of the regular race drivers to trial the new Pirelli tires which will be introduced at the next grand prix in Hungary. F1's sole tire supplier had been under pressure to find a safer solution after a series of tire blowouts wreaked havoc during June's British round of the world championship. The new tires blend 2012's more solid construction with this season's softer compounds and, after three days of testing, both Pirelli and the drivers believe a safe compromise has been found. ""The consistency and safety of the tires is better,"" said Massa. ""Nothing has happened here in terms of the punctures that we have seen and that is the most important thing."" Vettel added: ""We have had three days with different drivers in different cars and no failures. That's good."" Pirelli expect the new tires will provide an ""interesting mix of race strategies"" although many of the drivers at the Silverstone test are predicting the new rubber will mean fewer pit-stops are made during the race.","Susie Wolff makes full Formula One debut for Williams team at Silverstone test .

"(CNN) -- Daniel Tosh, host of the Comedy Central show ""Tosh.O,"" recently came under attack on the Internet. People on the Internet with way too much time on their hands love attacking someone all at once. The attack on Tosh came after an account of one of his stand-up shows at an L.A. club was posted to a website. According to the account, relayed by a female audience member to the person who kept the website, Tosh started making some rape jokes during his show. The woman was shocked that the shocking Daniel Tosh would say such shocking things. She called out from the audience in the middle of his set, ""Actually, rape jokes are never funny."" To which Tosh allegedly replied, ""Wouldn't it be funny if that girl got raped by like five guys right now. Like right now? What if a bunch of guys just raped her?"" I'm not going to talk here about the joke. I'm not here to give an opinion about whether what he said was funny or not funny; that's strictly a matter of taste, as is any joke. My subject here is whether it's OK for him to say it. Opinion: Nothing funny about rape jokes . If you have never in your life seen a comedian perform, here are the instructions: . If a comedian tells a joke that you find funny, you laugh. If he tells a joke you do not find funny, don't laugh. Or you could possibly go as far as groaning or rolling your eyes. Then you wait for his next joke; if that's funny, then you laugh. If it's not, you don't laugh -- or at very worst, you can leave quietly. This is the way going to see a comedian has worked for centuries. Some comedians tell nice jokes that you can tell to your kids. Some use bad words -- they work ""blue."" If you don't want to hear a joke that's blue, you shouldn't go to a comedy club where a comedian who makes blue jokes is performing. Back to Tosh: There was talk that he might lose his TV show. I, for one, say this will not happen. Big corporations that hire you decide what will shock and offend them. Their hearts and brains are located in their piggy banks. If they already wanted Daniel Tosh to be gone, they could use this as an excuse. I know of what I speak. Let's jump back a few years, shall we? A few days after September 11, 2001, I was doing a Friars' Roast of Hugh Hefner in New York City. Outside, smoke was still in the air. People seemed very reserved and were not totally laughing at any of the comics that night. I wanted to be the first one to slap them out of it. I said, ""I have to leave early tonight. I'm flying to L.A. I couldn't get a direct flight. We have to make a stop at the Empire State Building."" No one in the history of comedy ever lost an audience more completely. You could hear chairs move back and murmuring throughout the crowd. Gasping, groaning. One guy yelled, ""too soon,"" which I thought meant I didn't take a long enough pause between the set-up and punch line. I figured there was no lower I could go, so I went into doing The Aristocrats jokes. These are very blue. The crowd soon exploded with laughs and cheers. So: Terrorism is shocking and in bad taste, but a joke about incest and bestiality is totally fine. Jump ahead a few years. Over that period in between, I've done several very poor-taste jokes. Then the tsunami in Japan happened, and it's all over the news, with newscasters pretending it hits them personally. Newscasters really should get acting awards. Anyway, I figured I'd treat a natural disaster the same way I treated terrorism ... with comedy. So, I proceeded to tweet jokes about the tsunami. Most of them were actually quite silly. If there were anything to be outraged about, it would have been about how dumb the jokes actually were. I have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates. If you look up comedy and tragedy, you will find a very old picture of two masks. One mask is tragedy. It looks like it's crying. The other mask is comedy. It looks like it's laughing. Nowadays, we would say, ""How tasteless and insensitive. A comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask."" I'm returning from a job out of town. My agent says, ""You're not going to print anymore tsunami jokes, are you?"" I look on the Internet and on every news site, it says, ""Aflac fires Gilbert Gottfried."" Of course, as is procedure, when you make a joke nowadays, you must immediately make a public apology. So, much as Tosh did with his rape jokes, I did with my tsunami jokes. People on the Internet were screaming for my death. The news media jumped in, but of course their job is to make a mouse fart sound like it's a nuclear explosion. They reported on it and repeated my jokes, which seems odd: If what I said is so shocking and inexcusable, why are they repeating it? Well, it's to get asses in the seats. They referred to my jokes as ""comments"" and ""remarks,"" not ""jokes"" because if they did, any rational person would have said, ""So, a comic made jokes. What's the story here?"" I've been telling jokes like this for a very long time, so the reaction surprised me. It's like eating Corn Flakes every day for years, and then one day you eat Corn Flakes and all hell breaks loose. Aflac thought I was such an evil person and what I did so heinous that there was only one way to deal with this: Hire a new guy to imitate Gilbert Gottfried, pay him less, save a trainload of cash on commercials, thus bringing closure to this horrible tragedy. My favorite tweet that a fan sent me was, ""Aflac fires Gilbert Gottfried after discovering he's a comedian."" I got this tweet after the nut jobs on the Internet were through and common sense prevailed. I had an overwhelming response from people saying the same thing, ""**** 'em if they can't take a joke."" George Carlin once said, ""It's the duty of a comedian to find out where the line is drawn and then step over it."" I don't want to compare myself to George Carlin because when I first heard his quote, I laughed and said, ""He said dooty."" I guess he was more intellectual than me. In conclusion, I wish to inform every comedian, the new motto is: ""Guns don't kill people. Jokes kill people."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gilbert Gottfried.","Gilbert Gottfried: During a stand-up comedy show, Daniel Tosh made jokes about rape .
Gottfried: A woman objected. Comics make jokes; people can decide to laugh, not laugh, leave .
He says people criticized his jokes after 9-11; Aflac fired him for making Japan tsunami jokes .
Gottfried: Media, Internet like to blow things up; comedians' job to find line, step over ."
"(CNN) -- Rebels in an unstable part of the Democratic Republic of Congo have until Thursday afternoon to hand in their weapons to U.N. peacekeepers or risk being disarmed by force. The ultimatum comes amid the latest flare up of unrest in central Africa's volatile Great Lakes region. The 19,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country, MONUSCO, issued the deadline on Tuesday. It's the first time it has said it will use its troops there to implement a security area around the city of Goma, by the border with Rwanda. Sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, the city has been at the center of clashes in the region over the past year between the M23 rebel group and Congolese government troops that have displaced more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N. The rebels occupied Goma for more than a week in November before withdrawing amid pressure from regional leaders and the African Union. Renewed attacks . But since mid-May, M23 forces have carried out repeated attacks on government troop positions ""in an apparent attempt to advance on Goma and Sake,"" another nearby city, the U.N. mission says. The rebels have used ""indiscriminate and indirect fire, including by heavy weapons, resulting in civilian casualties"" and attacks on U.N. installations, the peacekeepers say. The latest fighting has also reportedly drawn in a group of Uganda-based rebels. If rebel troops in an area of North Kivu province that includes Goma and Sake ignore Thursday's deadline to give up their weapons at a U.N. base, ""they will be considered an imminent threat of physical violence to civilians and MONUSCO will take all necessary measures to disarm them,"" the peacekeepers' statement says. Those rebels who agree to hand in their arms will enter a process of demobilization and reintegration, the U.N. says. A breakaway group . The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army last year, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. Region in crisis . The humanitarian crisis in the region involves 2.6 million internally displaced people, the U.N. says, and 6.4 million people in need of food and emergency aid. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when ethnic Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. At least 800,000 people in Rwanda were killed in the 1994 genocide, one of the worst mass slaughters in the post-World War II era. The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis also were killed.","Rebels around the city of Goma have until Thursday afternoon to hand in their arms .
Those who don't will be considered an ""imminent threat,"" U.N. peacekeepers say .
It's the first time the U.N. has said it will use troops to uphold a security zone in the area .
The region is beset by a long-running humanitarian crisis affecting millions of people ."
"Washington (CNN) -- If President Barack Obama fancies himself a modern Will Kane of ""High Noon,"" standing up for what's right when his allies desert him on Syria, he might be following advice the marshal got in the iconic 1952 Western film. Kane, played by Gary Cooper, goes to his mentor and predecessor Martin Howe in a last-ditch plea for help, but the former lawman -- crippled by age and arthritis -- declines and explains why everyone from the judge to the deputy to the church-going folks of Hadleyville backed off. ""It figures. It's all happened too sudden,"" says Howe, played by Lon Chaney Jr. ""People got to talk themselves into law and order before they do anything about it."" Obama bought himself time for that discussion on whether to attack Syria over the use of banned chemical weapons by putting the question to Congress, setting up Senate committee hearings this week and votes in both chambers after the House returns from summer recess on September 9. Stunned by what U.S. officials call a major chemical weapons attack on August 21, less than two weeks ago, Obama initially tried to put together an international coalition to respond immediately to punish the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and signal widespread resolve. With Russia undermining any U.S. Security Council action, Obama hoped for a coalition similar to the one forged for the 2011 air strikes on Libya -- led by NATO allies with backing from Arab League states. Congressional hawks tie Syria to military budget cuts . That plan crumbled last week when Britain's Parliament voted against taking part in a military intervention in Syria. Both France and Germany, while agreeing that the international community must respond to the Syrian chemical weapons attack, also have balked at military intervention without U.N. approval. Even with backing for an international response from regional powers Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others, Obama decided to force Congress to take a stand instead of using presidential authority to order a U.S. strike. His arguments for acting sound like a modern ""High Noon"" script. Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike . ""This attack is an assault on human dignity,"" he said Saturday in detailing his decision to seek congressional authorization. ""It also presents a serious danger to our national security. It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons."" Citing a possible escalation in the use of chemical weapons without a response, he added that ""in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted."" ""We cannot raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say, the accords we sign, the values that define us,"" Obama said. However, the response he then outlined sounded a bit less direct than Marshal Kane's shootout in the streets with Frank Miller's gang. A U.S. strike would be self-wounding . ""This would not be an open-ended intervention,"" Obama said. ""We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. But I'm confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out."" To CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen, Obama's surprise decision to seek congressional authorization was strategic. ""He probably calculates that for Republican skeptics in Congress, they will have to explain to the American public why it is that they will not sanction military action on Syria after its large-scale use of chemical weapons while they continue to describe Syria's closest ally, Iran, and its nuclear weapons program -- which still has yet to produce any nuclear weapons-- as a grave threat to the world,"" Bergen wrote Monday.. For liberal Democrats who generally oppose any U.S. military action, ""Obama can essentially ask, 'If not now, when?'"" Bergen continued. Obama posed that question Saturday in his remarks to the nation. Syria vote could have consequences for 2016 . ""What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price?"" he said. ""What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced?"" Insisting the decision goes well beyond the issue of chemical warfare, Obama argued that ""if we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules, to governments who would choose to build nuclear arms, to terrorist who would spread biological weapons, to armies who carry out genocide?"" Opinion: Obama on war -- a realist and risk taker . ""We cannot raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say, the accords we sign, the values that define us,"" he said, channeling a bit of Marshal Kane. Rep. Mike Pompeo, a conservative Kansas Republican, told CNN on Monday that Obama is ""standing up for what he believes, and I agree with the president"" on the need to respond militarily to what he called ""horrendous war crimes being committed against the civilian population"" of Syria. ""I just don't think it's something we can look the other way and say, 'Well, it's halfway around the world. Who cares?'"" Pompeo said. ""We do care. And we also have a strategic interest there because our adversaries are not stopping."" That sounded like Obama, not Martin Howe in ""High Noon,"" who tells Kane the reason nobody will back him is that ""maybe because down deep, they don't care. They just don't care."" Military has concerns about Syria mission .","President Obama may feel like Marshal Will Kane in the iconic Western film .

"(CNN) -- A Saudi Arabian man was arrested after bragging about his sex life on television, local media reported. Mazen Abdul Jawad appeared last week on a show on Lebanese channel LBC, where he went into ""graphic details about his sexual conquests,"" according to Arab News, an English daily. A segment of the show ""Red Line"" posted on YouTube shows the 32-year-old talking about sex and foreplay. He also discusses losing his virginity to a neighbor while he was 14. In deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, pre-marital sex is illegal and unrelated men and women are not allowed to mingle. A government official told the newspaper that discussing sex in public is a punishable offense that may affect anyone involved in the broadcast. ""It is wrong to host people on television to speak publicly about vice and issues against our religion,"" said Ahmad Qasim Al-Ghamdi, director of Mecca's branch of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also known as the religious police. ""The program presents anomalies and deviancy in society that are unacceptable and immoral, and should be punished according to Shariah."" About 100 people have filed a complaint against Abdul Jawad, alleging among other things, that he violated a principle of Shariah law by ""publicizing his sinful behavior,"" the daily said. It is unclear what punishment, if any, Abdul Jawad faces.

"(CNN) -- Passengers on a United Airlines flight on Monday helped subdue a man who they said stood up and screamed about the CIA, national security leaks and poison. The disruption occurred during Flight 116 from Hong Kong that eventually landed safely at its scheduled destination in Newark. Passengers aboard the Boeing 777 said the unidentified man began making troubling statements about 10 hours into the flight. ""There was this gentleman screaming that he had names of people that work for the CIA and he was screaming those names -- not making too much sense,"" Jacques Roizen told CNN's The Situation Room. But it wasn't until the man reached for something in his pocket that a group of passengers converged and tackled him. ""He resisted and started saying things like 'they're trying to kill me, they're trying to poison me,'"" Roizen said. Roizen believed that one of the first things the man mentioned was the ""NSA leaker,"" and he wanted the flight diverted to Canada. American Airlines passengers will not 'always love her' Edward Snowden, who admitted this month to leaking National Security Agency documents about classified U.S. surveillance programs to journalists, is said to have fled the United States for Hong Kong.

Law enforcement officials met the flight and took the man to a hospital for evaluation, FBI spokesman Luis Rodriguez said. No charges were immediately filed, Rodriguez said.

"(CNN) -- The prosecution in the federal trial of alleged mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger rested its case Friday, after calling 63 witnesses over 30 days. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during two decades. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. Bulger rose to the top of the notorious Winter Hill gang, prosecutors say, before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after a crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 that he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. In court on Friday, the prosecution's last witness, an FBI agent on the Los Angeles fugitive task force, placed just under $822,000 in cash in airtight plastic casing and 30 guns on a table, and jurors gazed, flinching at the sound of the weapons being checked that they were unloaded. The agent, Scott Garriola, testified that he pulled these items from Bulger's Santa Monica apartment in 2011 the day he led the notorious mobster, then one of the FBI's top 10 most wanted fugitives, out of his fortress on a ruse that his storage locker had been broken into. ""We asked him to get down on his knees on the ground, he swore at us a few times, told us he wasn't getting on his knees and that there was grease on the floor,"" Garriola told the jury Friday. ""There was harsh exchange back and forth, then he got on the floor and was cuffed."" When Garriola asked Bulger to identify himself, Bulger told the agent his name was Charles Gasko, one of several aliases Bulger used during the 16 years he was on the lam. Developer describes threats in trial . Girlfriend, guns in the apartment . Garriola says he threatened to go upstairs and ask Bulger's then-girlfriend, Catherine Grieg, under the alias of Carrol Gasko, if she could produce identification that might prove Bulger was the notorious crime boss of the South Boston underworld. Garriola said then, Bulger's demeanor changed. "" 'Well, you know who I am,' he says. 'I am Whitey Bulger,' "" Garriola testified. He asked if there were weapons in the apartment. ""Yeah, there are plenty of weapons and they are all loaded,"" Bulger told him, Garriola testified. Later, Garriola told the jury that Bulger advised him that only the handguns were loaded. When Garriola asked if he was going to need a SWAT team to remove Grieg from the apartment, Bulger assured the FBI agent that ""She's never held a gun."" Garriola went upstairs with a team to get Grieg, who asked to change before heading to the garage where officers were holding Bulger. Outside, Garriola said he asked the couple for consent to search the apartment. ""They are gonna get it I don't want to delay this,"" Bulger said to his girlfriend, Garriola testified. As he signed off the on the search warrant, Garriola said, Bulger said it was ""the first time I have signed this name in a long time"" as he wrote James J. Bulger. Garriola said Bulger was extremely cooperative, even helping the agents do a sweep of his apartment, pointing out were all the guns, money and weapons were hidden. He asked for future consideration for Grieg, Garriola said. Grieg is now serving eight years on charges that she aided a fugitive. Garriola said he asked if Bulger had the guns to ""shoot it out"" with anyone that tried to capture him. He said Bulger replied, ""No, because a stray bullet may hit someone."" Opinion: Just don't call Bulger a rat . Keeping up with his associates . As a fugitive, Bulger kept tabs on former associates. He read a novel by his former drug pusher, John ""Red"" Shea, titled ""Rat Bastards,"" and he read ""Brutal,"" written by his enforcer and ""surrogate son,"" Kevin Weeks. â€ªBulger also did research on how to stay hidden, reading ""How to Find Missing Persons"" and ""Secrets of a Back-Alley ID Man."" Authorities found fake IDs stuffed behind mirrors and in walls, including Social Security cards, birth certificates, prescription cards, fake business cards, work permits and even casino loyalty cards. In Nevada, Bulger was Sidney Terry. In California, he was gambler James William Lawlor. In New York, he was Donald Gene Gould and worked at a movie theater. Garriola identified each of the 30 weapons for the jury: shotguns, revolvers, semiautomatic pistols, Magnums, specials and Berettas. He said they were all tested and determined to be operable. The weapons and fat stacks of cash were strewn across the table in front of Bulger, who probably saw them for the last time Friday. At the apartment, the weapons were hidden under towels on windowsills, and in the walls with more cash. The defense will begin to present its case Monday and intends to call about 16 witnesses. Defense counsel has not made it clear whether it will call the defendant. Bulger pal on his cooperation with U.S.: 'I was dead either way' The mobster's money . Earlier Friday, an IRS special agent who spent 18 years in money laundering investigation into Bulger testified that she spent ""thousands of hours"" reviewing documents, never finding so much as one record of Bulger holding legitimate employment. What she did find was that on many occasions, Bulger, his henchman Stephen Flemmi and enforcer Weeks ""made it look like they were getting wages to conceal their illegal activity."" In the 1980s, Bulger had been charging Kevin O'Neil legitimate rent to operate a liquor store on their property, O'Neil testified Thursday. O'Neil was also involved in collecting ""rent"" from bookies for Bulger -- essentially a tax paid to the underworld mob boss to operate criminally in South Boston. Bulger put the heat on O'Neil and said he was going to sell the property, unless O'Neill agreed to buy it. O'Neil decided to take a loan from Bulger and agreed to pay $400,000 for the property. Documents in court show that Bulger bought out his partners Weeks and Flemmi for $40,000 that same day. O'Neil paid off his debt by giving Bulger $4672.96 a month for seven years between 1990 and 1997. This extends past the time that Bulger went on the run, in 1995. ""I thought he would come back,"" O'Neil said. Special Agent Sandra Lemanski said she found 67 monthly mortgage payment checks deposited in an account shared by Bulger and his brother John ""Jackie"" Bulger, who has been sitting front row virtually every day of trial.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's interim leader on Sunday issued a strong warning to supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy, state news said. After a meeting of the National Defense Council, headed by interim President Adly Mansour, the Egyptian presidency issued the statement, calling on protesters to remain calm. It urged them to end their ""incitement and hateful speech against Egyptian citizens and state institutions and end their violations of the law and endangering the safety of citizens,"" the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said. It also reportedly said that the National Defense Council would watch developments closely and take action against anyone who violates the law. The warning came on the heels of violent clashes in the nation's capital. Dr. Mohammed Ali Sultan, chairman of Egypt's ambulance services, told CNN that 72 people had been killed in Nasr City, an area of Cairo the Muslim Brotherhood has made its base. Morsy is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that was sidelined under longtime Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak only to become the country's dominant political force after his forced exit in 2011. According to that group, police fired live ammunition on protesters Friday and Saturday. Yet the prosecutor general's office, state-run Nile TV reported early Sunday, said protesters initiated the clashes, firing live bullets on security forces. Fresh clashes erupted early Sunday in Helwan, south of Cairo, between residents there and pro-Morsy protesters, reported state TV, citing witnesses. Also Sunday, state-run EGYNews reported that an Egyptian delegation was granted permission Friday by the military to visit where Morsy is being held. The former Muslim Brotherhood leader became Egypt's first democratically president in June 2012 but found himself at odds with the opposition before the military removed him from power and detained him this month. He has not been seen publicly since the military forced him from office July 3. The delegates, who represent human rights organizations, said Morsy is being held at an army facility at an undisclosed location. They reportedly said Morsy declined to meet with them because their group did not include Mohamad Salim Al Awa, a former presidential candidate and Islamic scholar. Instead, they met with Morsy's former chief of staff, Refa'a al-Tahtawi, and his secretary. Both men are being held along with Morsy. The delegation recommended that the military hold Morsy in a known and specific location and allow him to communicate with his family and have representation of his choosing, EGYNews reported. It also recommended the release of Morsy's staff unless the men are charged with a specific crime. Morsy is being held in relation for a jailbreak that took place during Egypt's 2011 revolution but well before he came to power, state media reported. Prosecutors have said the escape of Morsy and 18 other Brotherhood members, among others, was plotted by ""foreign elements"" including Hamas, the Islamic Palestinian Army and Hezbollah. The Muslim Brotherhood was named as a domestic group that cooperated with those who broke them out of prison. Morsy -- who local media reports say was in prison for a single day without any formal charges against him -- is accused of escaping, destroying the prison's official records and intentionally killing and abducting police officers and prisoners. CNN's Dana Ford, Greg Botelho, Hamdi Alkhshali and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Egypt's interim leader reportedly urges protesters to end their ""incitement and hateful speech""

"(CNN) -- Cuban dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez visited the White House on Wednesday, a milestone in her being allowed to travel outside the communist island. Sanchez is visiting the United States as part of an 80-day tour of 10 countries that she began in February. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden described Sanchez, a winner of the State Department's International Women of Courage Award, as ""a respected advocate for the freedom of information."" ""The United States looks forward to the day when all Cubans will have the opportunity to express themselves in public without fear and we will continue to support policies that encourage the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba,"" Hayden said. In the White House on Wednesday, Sanchez met the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs, Ricardo Zuniga, who is a special assistant to President Obama. She discussed her efforts to promote free speech in Cuba. Sanchez is a vocal critic of Raul and Fidel Castro, the revolutionary brothers who have been running the country for more than 50 years. Last week, Sanchez visited Columbia University in New York. For several years, Sanchez said the government retaliated against her criticism by repeatedly refusing to give her an exit visa. In January, Cuba ended its unpopular policy of requiring citizens to obtain a letter of invitation and an exit permit before leaving the country. Dissidents said the policy was used to punish them for their anti-government advocacy. While other government critics have left the country under the new law, Sanchez is the highest-profile figure in the dissident community to test the easing of restrictions. Much of the funding for her trip, Sanchez has said, came from donors and from people offering her a free place to stay. Sanchez has more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, but with limited access to the Internet in Cuba, she said she had been forced to communicate with the public by sending cell phone text messages that are uploaded to the social messaging service. She said beyond attending technology forums and enjoying easier access to high-speed Internet, she was looking forward to meeting some of the volunteers who translate her writings from Spanish to other languages. MJ Porter, who helps translate Sanchez's blogs into English from her apartment in Seattle, told CNN last year she couldn't wait to meet the Cuban blogger. ""I am a big crier, so I will probably cry for about an hour,"" Porter said. ""Then I will laugh and then cry some more. It's hard for me to imagine."" Sanchez said she was surprised to be able to travel, especially because some Cubans still face restrictions on leaving the country. The government still prohibits the travel of some officials, sports stars and citizens whose travel abroad violates ""public interest."" A handful of other dissidents have reported that they were informed by the government they would be barred from leaving the country. Longtime dissident Gisela Delgado said she was told by officials that even though she has a valid passport, she is on the list of Cubans who aren't permitted to travel. ""The state decides who can leave and who can't,"" Delgado said. ""For 54 years, it's been a way to manipulate us and divide us, the whole Cuban family."" CNN's Patrick Oppman in Havana contributed to this report.","Yoani Sanchez meets with aide to President Obama at White House .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Lifestyle guru Martha Stewart hopes to return to the United Kingdom as soon as a reported travel ban stemming from her criminal history is ""resolved,"" the chairman of the company she founded said Friday. Martha Stewart has not been to the United Kingdom since her 2004 conviction, according to British media. ""Martha loves England; the country and English culture are near and dear to her heart,"" Charles Koppelman, chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said in a written statement. ""She has engagements with English companies and business leaders and hopes this can be resolved so that she will be able to visit soon,"" Koppelman said. The statement was released after British newspapers, led by the Telegraph, reported that she had been refused a visa to enter Great Britain because of her criminal convictions four years ago. Stewart was scheduled to meet at the Royal Academy with several figures in the fashion and leisure industry, the Telegraph reported. The newspaper attributed the rejection of her visa to a blanket policy banning people with criminal convictions. A representative of the British Borders Agency would not comment on Stewart, saying only that ""we continue to oppose the entry to the UK of individuals where we believe their presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive to the public good or where they have been found guilty of serious criminal offenses abroad.""

"(CNN) -- The United Nations condemned an Iraqi raid on a camp housing Iranian dissidents north of Baghdad on Sunday, an attack that led to at least 15 deaths and allegations of more. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was still trying to determine exactly what happened at Camp Ashraf, near Baquba. But ""it appears that deadly force has been used and that a number of people have been killed or wounded,"" the relief agency said. Camp Ashraf houses members of the Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq, whose members fought alongside Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's troops during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Relations between Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government and the MEK have been tense since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Hussein and his Sunni-led government. Iraqi health officials in nearby Baquba put the death toll from Sunday's raid at 15, with 30 others wounded. But Shahriar Kia, a spokesman for the MEK, said 44 of its members were killed. ""The use of violence against a civilian population is unacceptable in any circumstances,"" a UNHCR statement said. ""We call on the Iraqi authorities to immediately ensure the security of the residents. It is important that the violence stop and that medical help be urgently provided for the wounded."" Al-Maliki's office has ordered an investigation into the attack, his office announced late Sunday. But two officials with Iraq's Interior Ministry told CNN that security forces raided the camp after their base was hit by mortar rounds. The officials said there were casualties from the raid, but they said they could provide no further details. The leftist MEK also opposed the Iranian monarchy and targeted American military advisers before the 1979 revolution that ousted Shah Mohammed Pahlavi, leading to its designation as a terrorist organization by the United States. That designation was lifted last year, with the State Department citing the group's renunciation of violence and the passage of a decade without its carrying out any attacks. Camp Ashraf once housed more than 3,000 people, but nearly all of the residents have been moved to a former U.S. military base outside Baghdad in preparation for resettlement to third countries. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday that only 100 members of the MEK remained at Camp Ashraf. Gyorgy Busztin, the deputy U.N. special envoy to Iraq, said UNAMI would use ""all possible means"" to conduct its own investigation into the attack. ""The priority for the Iraqi government is to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and to ensure their security and safety against any violence from any side,"" Busztin said in a statement issued Sunday. Maryam Rajavi, the head of the MEK's political arm, called for those remaining at Camp Ashraf to be transferred to the United States or put under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. Rajavi, the president of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the attack was carried out ""at the order of the religious fascism ruling Iran."" ""Mrs. Rajavi urged the U.S. president, the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general to immediately dispatch delegations to Ashraf in order to stop the ongoing killing and to save the lives of those injured and taken as hostages,"" her office said. The MEK's new site at Camp Hurriya, the base formerly known as Camp Liberty, has come under fire as well. Rocket attacks killed 10 people from February to June, according to the MEK. Sunday's clash at Camp Ashraf follows news that Iraq's internal strife killed 804 people and wounded more than 2,000 in August, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. The toll was lower than July's 1,000-plus -- the deadliest month since the peak of Iraq's sectarian warfare in 2006 and 2007 -- but ""remains disturbingly high,"" according to UNAMI. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under al-Maliki, whose government fears that Sunni Islamists who've been involved in fighting in neighboring Syria are now targeting it. Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunni protests against the Iraqi government have continued since the Hawija incident.","NEW: Iraq's prime minister orders an investigation into the deadly raid .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress is a stalemated cesspool of government shutdown showdowns that could come straight from an Aaron Sorkin TV series. But on the issue of using military force in Syria, bipartisanship is coming from unexpected places. Liberal members of Congress are joining forces with some of the most conservative to rein in the president. For instance, two lawmakers who legislate from complete opposite ends of the political spectrum are calling for the president to back down from a possible military strike. ""The president's line in the sand may have been a strategic blunder. But it is not enough reason to go to war,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said in an opinion piece on CNN.com on Friday, referring to President Barack Obama's declaration that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, was even stronger in his opposition. ""We are not the world's policemen. That is not our responsibility,"" he said Thursday on CNN's ""The Lead."" While Grayson and Paul are urging the president to take a step back from deploying the U.S. military, a large number of Republicans and Democrats have joined together to demand that he allow Congress to have a say on U.S. involvement. It's a message almost identical regardless of political party. U.S. to release information on Syria chemical weapon use . Said one lawmaker: ""(T)he president has the responsibility to seek authorization from our nation's elected leaders before initiating military action."" And another: ""For too long, the legislature's responsibility to authorize military force has been overlooked."" The first statement was made by liberal Democratic U.S. Rep. John Garamendi of California, and the second by U.S. Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina, a Republican. They aren't alone. More than 100 members of Congress, mostly conservative Republicans but nearly two dozen liberal Democrats as well, have signed on to a letter to the president urging that he ""consult and receive authorization from Congress before ordering the use of U.S. military force in Syria."" How much say will Congress have on Syria strike? While partisanship has kept Congress from agreeing on the budget, gun control, and immigration, lawmakers have been able to find commonality on the issue of war. ""Those decisions are very tough decisions, and you'll find some strange bedfellows,"" said Connie Morella, a former Republican congresswoman from Maryland who was one of seven Republicans and 147 Democrats who voted against the use of military force in Iraq in 2002. Analysts tell CNN that uncommon alliances have become more common in recent years. ""We used to have this model that bipartisan was when the center-right and the center-left compromised each other,"" said Heather Hurlburt, executive director of the National Security Network. ""Now it works when legislators vote because it makes (them) more conservative ... or more liberal."" The coalition of the right and the left has especially been evident over the issue of war. The last decade has left many lawmakers full of skepticism when it comes to American foreign policy. Many members felt lied to by the George W. Bush administration in the lead-up to the Iraq war and worn out from a 12-year-old war in Afghanistan. ""There's an increasing skepticism amongst those on the right and left when it comes to these types of foreign entanglements,"" said Jim Manley, former communications director for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""Members who were around (during the Bush administration) are determined that's not going to happen again."" That is a sentiment made evident by Democratic Rep. Garamendi. ""The past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived,"" he said. ""Our brave men and women in uniform deserve better."" Paul echoes Garamendi in his editorial. ""Understandably, Americans are not eager to be plunged into another questionable or misguided war,"" he said. Like with anything in politics, however, there's a bit more to the story. It's not just about the merits of war and congressional responsibility, but also about, well, politics. How the latest chemical weapons claim differs from others . Some lawmakers demanding congressional oversight ""want to resist anything Barack Obama does,"" says J. Michael Hogan, director of the Center of Democratic Deliberation at Penn State University. He says it looks good to their constituents back at home who oppose anything the president proposes. Hogan speculates that if a Republican were president, the number of Republicans who signed that letter would be less than 98 and Democratic signatures would number more than 18. Hurlburt said that war doesn't suspend politics. ""I'm not sure that was ever true in the past, and it's definitely not true now,"" she said. ""Issues of war show up these fissures that are there all the time."" A bipartisan group of lawmakers challenging the president is only half the story. Some lawmakers are much more measured. Although many strongly urge the president to seek congressional authorization before any military strike, some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support a military strike. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, chairman of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after a congressional briefing by the administration that ""a decisive and consequential U.S. response is justified and warranted."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on Thursday that the U.S. ""should be helping (the Syrian rebels) attain the goal of freeing themselves from one of the most brutal dictators in history."" Hurlburt says many senators are old-guard lawmakers who have been dealing with issues of war and peace together since Bosnia and Kosovo in the '90s. It ""reflects that those in the Senate have been chewing on these issues for 20 years,"" she said. If Obama does allow Congress to vote on the use of military force, it's unclear if the unholy alliance of the right and the left would stay united to oppose any military attack. There are ""not so many consequences for posturing on the issue,"" Hurlburt said. But there are a lot more consequences for taking a vote on it.","Liberal members of Congress joining with conservatives to oppose strikes in Syria .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- Ghana's Supreme Court Thursday declared President John Dramani Mahama ""validly elected"" as the court dismissed all claims of voter fraud, mismanagement and irregularities in the West African nation's December 2012 presidential election. After the election, Ghana's Independent Electoral Commission declared Mahama the winner with 50.7% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a runoff with his main challenger, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. But challenges followed, with allegations of widespread mismanagement and voting irregularities at more than 10,000 polling stations. Akufo-Addo and two other officials of his New Patriotic Party sued and the case went to the Supreme Court. Mahama, from the ruling National Democratic Congress party, was sworn in as president, and Thursday's court ruling means he will retain the office. The Supreme Court dismissed all six claims alleging fraud and irregularities, with judges ruling unanimously against claims that certification forms had duplicate serial numbers, that votes from phony polling places were counted, and that there was duplication of polling station codes, meaning that votes from a particular voting station might have been counted twice or more. Akufo-Addo made a statement after the ruling was announced, saying he will not seek a court review of the decision, congratulating President Mahama and calling on Ghanaians to work out their ""differences, ease tensions between us and come together and build our country."" The famously easy-going people of Ghana had been on edge awaiting Thursday's decision by the court. Nine Supreme Court justices spent 48 days hearing the case, which had riveted the nation. The proceedings were broadcast live on Ghanian television and radio, the first time the court has allowed such broadcasts. They have been immensely popular. Ghana is one of Africa's fastest-growing economies. It is the world's second-largest cocoa producer, after Ivory Coast, and the continent's second biggest gold miner, after South Africa, according to the United Nations. But critics say that despite the rich resources that bring billions of dollars annually, the wealth is not trickling down to the rural poor who live on the land where the gold is mined. In March 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan European colony to declare independence from a colonial ruler, in its case, Britain. It endured four military coups in the first 14 years, after one of which, three former presidents were executed. Then, in the election of 2000, it had its first peaceful transfer of power between civilian presidents. The incumbent won a second term in 2004, but term limits prohibited him from seeking a third term in 2008. In that election, John Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress narrowly defeated Akufo-Addo. But Mills died in office last year, elevating his vice president, Mahama to the presidency. Last December, Mahama ran for a full term against Akufo-Addo, setting off the Supreme Court battle.","John Dramani Mahama was sworn in as president of Ghana after December elections .

"(CNN) -- On the day that Gareth Bale commanded headlines by joining Real Madrid in a big-money move, Lionel Messi made news by scoring a hat-trick for Barcelona in a 3-2 win against Valencia. Messi's treble was his 23rd in the league for Barcelona and handed the away side a 3-0 advantage within 41 minutes at the Mestalla. Barcelona then had to hang on at times after Helder Postiga netted a brace just before halftime. The home side also had a pair of penalty appeals waved away by the referee. ""We could have ended with a 3-3, 2-3 or 2-5,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website. ""Regardless of what could have happened I would leave here very pleased with how the team played. We found what we were looking for."" Cesc Fabregas set up Messi's first two goals after good work from holding midfielder Sergio Busquets, and summer signing Neymar linked up with the Argentine on the third. Brazilian forward Neymar and Messi started together for the first time in the league after neither found the net in the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup last week. ""There was concern about how Neymar and Messi were going to interact on the pitch after they played their first match together,"" Martino said. ""They fixed that in less than 24 hours."" Barcelona has won all three of its league games, like arch-rival Real Madrid. Several hours before Bale's deal was announced, Madrid defeated Athletic Bilbao 3-1. Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal -- Messi has five -- with a header from Angel di Maria's perfect cross. But it was 21-year-old Spanish international Isco and Bale's former teammate at Tottenham, Luka Modric, who earned praise from Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti. Isco, a summer arrival from Malaga, accounted for the two other goals and Modric impressed with his work rate in midfield. ""He was fantastic,"" Ancelotti told Madrid's website, referring to Modric. Switching to Isco, Ancelotti added: ""He is playing very well and he makes it look like he's been here for years. He has character and ability and that is very important for us."" Dortmund on a roll . Only one team in the Bundesliga remains unbeaten through four games -- and it's Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 thanks to a double from midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Mkhitaryan scored his first two goals for Dortmund after his $35 million transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk. It wasn't a vintage display by the Champions League runner-up but manager Jurgen Klopp wasn't arguing with the result. ""We have to play better football, there's no question,"" Klopp was quoted as saying by AP. ""I've seen a few weaknesses in our build-up play and ideally we need to defend better. Still, with 12 points after four games, this is complaining at a high level."" Defending champion Bayern Munich trails Dortmund by two points. In Ligue 1, Monaco moved atop the table with a 2-1 win over previously unbeaten Marseille. Marseille led 1-0 at home before Radamel Falcao and Emmanuel Riviere scored in the second half. Falcao and Riviere have already combined for eight goals this term.","Lionel Messi scores three first-half goals for Barcelona on the road against Valencia .

"Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the second of three exclusive reports. Part one looked at the violent rules gangs live by. The faithful leave this ""Holy Death"" statue offerings including cigarettes and cocaine, visible in the nose. CULIACAN, Mexico (CNN) -- A baseball cap dangles from a cement cross. The slogan on the hat reads ""power, money, respect."" On the brim there's the logo of the classic gangster movie ""Scarface."" Etched on the gravestone, the words: ""Jesus Guadalupe Parra. 12 December 1986 to 25 August 2008."" ""Lupito,"" as friends and family knew him, went down in a hail of bullets before he reached 22. Authorities said he died alongside three others in a gunfight with a rival drug gang high in the Sierra Madre mountain  range that is the backbone of Mexico's Pacific coast state of Sinaloa. A printed banner draped over his tomb offers a deeper insight. It shows a photo of him alongside a marijuana plantation and an AK-47 assault rifle fitted with a 100-round ammunition drum. The drab grave of this cartel triggerman, at the Jardines de Humaya cemetery in state capital Culiacan, stands in stark contrast to the mausoleums of dead capos, or drug bosses. Those are elaborate two- and three-story constructions, some perhaps 25 feet high, made of bullet-proof glass, Italian marble and spiral iron staircases. A bricklayer at work in the cemetery told me the fanciest cost between $75,000 and $150,000. He said grateful drug barons often pay for loyal hitmen to be buried here, the city's toniest graveyard. Like so many other people we've met over the last few weeks, he declined to give his name or speak on camera. ""I can't. El patron [the boss] would kill me,"" he said. Days later I track down Lupito's cousin, Giovanni Garcia, on the phone. He's an undertaker and by coincidence he took the call that Lupito had been shot. ""My cousin loved that way of life,"" Garcia said briefly before turning down a recorded interview. ""We can't talk. You must understand how things are around here these days. It's not a good time."" That Sunday, I linger at Lupito's graveside. Three young men show up. They look about the same age as the dead gunman, the same cropped-hair, one heavily scarred around his eye. In the breeze they struggle to light a dozen foot-high candles. I introduce myself. A few grunts later and I can see this conversation is going nowhere fast. ""We couldn't make it to the burial. This is the first time we've come to pay our respects,"" one of them explained. He never offered his name. Drug rivalries have been known to spill over at funerals so many mourners opt to stay away leaving only the closest relatives to bury their dead quietly and without public complaints. I stick around hoping to meet more talkative mourners. My wait is cut short. A fourth man appears between the tombstones some 20 yards away, apparently having seen me. As he talks into a phone I hear him say: ""Hey, take your chance. Go grab f**king baldy."" I look around. No other bald men in sight -- just me. Time to leave. At Jardines de Humaya and across town at the 21 de Marzo cemetery, rows of recently dug graves are filled with the young foot soldiers of Mexico's drug war. A crosscheck of their names in the obituary columns of the local newspaper reveal tales of men in their late teens and early 20s, gunned down in firefights, shot in cold blood on their doorsteps or killed in prison clashes. Jesus Gaston earns around $40 for every three graves he digs. But he can see the lure of easy money in the drug trade is little more than a mirage. ""The easy money lasts for just a few days because it's all about time before they kill you too. You kill somebody and somebody will come back for you,"" he said. ""Some how, some way they will find you."" When the reality boils down to kill or be killed, it's unsurprising the hitmen and the narco-traffickers want to improve their odds of survival. Most days, you can hear a brass band or a cowboy trio thumping out tunes in a small building on a Culiacan side street. It's a shrine to a highway robber called Jesus Malverde. In the century since he died he's become known as the patron saint of the drug trade.  Watch men pay respects to their narco-saint » . Men in cowboy hats and ostrich-skin boots duck in and out of view. Some try to conceal their faces behind a musician's trombone or tuba. The day I dropped in, one man was paying around $600 for a band to play for three hours. Off camera he told me it was his way of repaying a favor to Malverde. I asked him about that favor and he said he was celebrating a bumper harvest -- of beans and corn. He said he was shy about appearing on camera. I told another man, who gave his name as ""Rosario,"" that he looked like a stereotypical narco. He had the ostrich-skin cowboy boots and shaved head. Besides that he seemed to be spending a small fortune, by Mexican standards, on live music, foot-high candles and fresh flowers to place at Malverde's altar. Rosario laughed off my suggestion and laughed again in my face as he told me he was paying tribute to Malverde after a good few months working as a carpet fitter in Arizona. It was refreshing to find a straight-talking trombone player at the shrine, Jaime Laveaga. He makes his living playing music and he's clear about who his main clients are. ""It sounds bad to say it but Culiacan is a city with a big drug mafia. They like brass band music and they love to celebrate -- 15th birthdays, weddings, family birthdays. They even celebrate their dogs' birthdays,"" he explained. Needless to say, the Catholic Church takes a dim view of those who worship Malverde and another growing cult known as the ""Holy Death,"" which critics say is also popular among thieves and narcos. ""People are looking for easy solutions where they don't have to make any sacrifices. If they don't find any support for their killings or their drug trafficking from the Catholic Church then they look for other options,"" Father Esteban Robles, spokesman for the Culiacan diocese told me. ""They're looking for something that will justify their actions."" Tomorrow, Penhaul examines how the gangs dispose of their victims and what officials are doing to stem the violence.","Graveyards in Mexican town show tributes to gang leaders and hitmen .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The last time Thomas Hudner was in North Korea, he was fighting for his life. On Sunday, more than six decades later, he paid his respects to the ruler who led that fight against him and his fellow Americans. Hudner, a retired U.S. Navy captain, is leading a delegation to search for the remains of Ensign Jesse Brown, the Navy's first African-American aviator. Hudner and fellow Korean War veteran Richard Bonelli went to Pyongyang's Palace of the Sun -- the most hallowed site in North Korea -- on Sunday. Following protocol, each man stopped and bowed before the glass caskets of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder, and his son Kim Jong Il, who ruled for 18 years following his father's 1994 death. ""It was a matter of respect,"" Hudner, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his attempt to save Brown, told CNN. The visit comes ahead of the 60th anniversary of the armistice that ended three years of fighting in Korea on Saturday. Hudner, Bonelli and the rest of the group are scheduled to travel to North Korea's Chosin Reservoir, the scene of some of the most desperate fighting of the conflict, in search of Brown's remains. There was heavy rain in northeastern North Korea, the site of Brown's crash, making it impossible for travel. Bridges and roads were out from the rains. The Americans said they didn't plan to stay for the July 27 massive military parade on what Pyongyang calls ""Victory Day,"" but the meeting with the North Koreans seemed to go well. Hudner told CNN that he believes the discussion with the North Koreans, at which CNN was present, would work to help foster better diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea. The North Korean military said it would do everything to help Hudner and Bonelli track down the remains of their former colleague. In a promising sign for the recovery of Brown's remains, a senior North Korean colonel said at the meeting that North Korea wanted a joint recovery effort to continue. Hudner's biographer, Adam Makos, said the 88-year-old former pilot showed great dignity by paying respect to the North's former leaders, as protocol required. ""He wears the gold medal for bravery, but it also represents character,"" said Makos, who first suggested the trip to Hudner. ""Because when you study the action of how he earned that medal, it is about great character, risking his life to save a friend. And today, he put his ego aside and he said. 'You know, I'm going to show respect to a man once considered our foe.' And that's the ultimate sign of a warrior."" Brown's F4U Corsair crashed in December 1950 while providing air cover for American troops who found themselves battling Chinese forces near the frozen reservoir. Hudner, then a lieutenant junior grade, was his wingman. Hudner deliberately crashed his plane near Brown's to try to save him, but Brown was trapped in his cockpit and died shortly afterward. Hudner was awarded America's top military decoration for the effort, while the Navy named a frigate after Brown in 1973. ""It was very different,"" Hudner said of his first experience of North Korea. ""That time we were bitter enemies. And I hope that our trip here can foster relations, which will be good not only for our two countries but for the whole world to see this."" In the visitors' book at the newly renovated Palace of the Sun, Hudner wrote, ""It was a memorable experience."" He now knows more about the achievements of the Korean people, he wrote. Chosin -- known in North Korea as Jangjin -- Reservoir was one of the bloodiest battles of the Korean War. More than 3,000 American soldiers and Marines and an estimated 35,000 Chinese troops were killed during a two-week withdrawal under fire by U.S. and allied forces. Hudner and Bonelli, who was one of those badly outnumbered Marines, also saw two rooms filled with the leaders' medals, plus the train carriages used to travel around the country and beyond. North Korean officials said Kim Jong Il died in one of those coaches.","Retired Capt. Thomas Hudner received the Medal of Honor in the Korean War .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Pyongyang has agreed to South Korea's offer for working-level talks on reopening the suspended joint industrial complex at Kaesong, the South Korean Unification Ministry said. The talks are scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. Saturday (9 p.m. Friday ET) at Tongilgak, an administrative building on the North Korean side of the neutral border village of Panmunjom. Kaesong, which is a bellwether of North-South ties, was closed this spring -- a casualty of increasing tensions between the two Koreas after the North warned that war could erupt. Each side will have three-member delegations, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said, citing the Seoul government. ""The agreement came after North Korea, revising its earlier stance, did not insist that South Korean businessmen should be allowed to visit their plants in Kaesong at the same time or ahead of the government contact,"" Yonhap reported. ""South Korea maintained that government contact should precede any visit to Kaesong by South Korean businessmen."" The North wanted the talks to be held at Kaesong and with South Korean businessmen permitted to accompany the delegation, proposals the South rejected. Seoul's proposal for talks came a day after North Korea invited businessmen from South Korean companies to return to the zone to check on their facilities and equipment. The talks ""were in consideration of the damages to the companies operating in Kaesong after three months of suspension and the beginning of monsoon season,"" Kim Hyung-suk, South Korea's Unification Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing. ""The Kaesong issue can only be resolved through dialogue by government authorities."" The operation was completely shut down in May when the last remaining South Korean workers left the facilities, but work had been winding down for about a month amid heightened tensions. In April, North Korea restricted South Korean workers' access to the zone. Workers had to leave when supplies such as food, water and raw materials were cut off. The North-South tensions seemed to be easing somewhat after Pyongyang agreed to high-level talks with the South in June. Those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements over the level of the delegates who would represent each side. On Wednesday, North Korea also restored the Panmunjom communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months. ""North Korea is probably feeling an unprecedented level of diplomatic isolation with pressures coming from the international community. It is also fully aware of the value of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which provides a considerable amount of hard foreign currency,"" said Kim Tae-woo, former president of the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""But stirring tensions, then going back to dialogue, is part of North Korea's usual tactics. We don't need to attach too much weight to this easing of tension,"" he added. North Korea already had barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before May. In 2008, access was restricted after a human rights group distributed propaganda leaflets via balloon into North Korea. South Korean workers were blocked again in 2009 during an annual U.S.-South Korean military drill. Some $2 billion worth of goods have been produced in Kaesong between initial operations in 2005 and the end of 2012, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean ministry. North Korean authorities take about 45% of their wages for various taxes. CNN's Diana Magnay and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Talks set to be held at building on North Korean side of neutral border village .

"(CNN) -- A tiger mauled a caretaker who was cleaning its cage, clamping the woman's head in its mouth during the attack at an Indiana animal rescue shelter. The woman is in critical condition after the attack Friday at the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana. The facility confirmed an incident involving an employee and a tiger, but declined to provide specifics, saying it does not want to discuss the incident with the media. In a statement, the Clay County Sheriff's Office provided more details on the attack. The victim was cleaning cages when a worker nearby heard her screaming, Sheriff Rob Gambill said in a statement. When the employee ran over to help, she discovered the tiger had her head in its mouth. Joe Taft, the director of the facility, sprayed the 18-year-old tiger named Raja in the face with a hose to loosen its grip before it was eventually lured away with food. The victim, who is in her early twenties, was air-lifted to an Indianapolis hospital. Authorities said the tiger escaped its holding area because a door was not properly shut. Taft said the victim had ""a fair amount of experience"" working with cats and had previously interacted with that very tiger. It is one of about 130-140 tigers living at the facility.

"(CNN) -- Sailing around the world is one of the most grueling challenges on the planet, with muscle-bound skippers steering 20-meter yachts through everything from tropical cyclones to Antarctic storms. Forced to endure the most brutal conditions on the globe, sailors must not only be emotionally resilient -- but physical dynamos. Which raises the question: Are women -- the stereotypical ""weaker gender"" -- up to the task? Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade. This one's for you . It will be an emotional campaign by the 11-woman Swedish Team (SCA), who last month lost their coach Magnus Olsson to a stroke. ""People say it's the toughest race there is in the world but it's much more than that. It's big waves, icebergs, it's incredible team spirit. You want to win but of course you have bad days and sometimes you hate it,"" Swedish veteran sailor Olsson told CNN, before his death. ""This race is incredibly physical. The stronger you are the better it is -- you get an advantage over the others if you are stronger for sure."" Everest of sailing . The all-women team will be allowed three more sailors than their male counterparts, in their bid to win one of the toughest sporting competitions in the world. Dubbed the ""Everest of Sailing,"" the Volvo Ocean Race covers 72,000-kilometers in an epic nine-month journey across the globe. Launched in 1973, the race claimed three lives in the first year alone. ""It's very physical and it's definitely become a lot more physical over the years --the sails are getting bigger, the boats are going faster,"" three-time race winner, Brad Jackson, told CNN. ""It's just harder work, so the more big guys the better."" Women doing it for themselves . The last time an all-female crew took part was in 1997, finishing ninth out of 10 boats. This time around, the ladies are more determined than ever to cross the finish line first, and are busy training in Lanzarote, Spain, more than a year ahead of the race in October, 2014. Five of the crew have already been chosen, and include an elite line-up of former Olympic competitors and international world champions. Among them is Briton Sam Davies, who in 2008 finished fourth in the Vendee Globe -- a non-stop, solo circumnavigation renowned as the toughest sailing competition on the planet. The 38-year-old's most recent attempt at the Vendee earlier this year lasted just six days, after her mast collapsed. The crushing disappointment forced her to look for a new challenge. ""When something unexpected and unwanted happens it's really hard. You always have to learn from your mistakes and learn by your problems and come out stronger and so that's what I'm doing,"" Davies told CNN. ""The VendÄ—e Globe is my project, I'm my own boss and I do everything on the boat. There are so many things that I have been questioning -- such as whether I'm capable of getting into a project where I'm not the boss anymore,"" the mother-of-one added. From heartbreak to hero? Also in the crew is another yachtswoman reeling from professional disaster, and hoping to make good in 2014. A year ago, 33-year-old Annie Lush was training for the London 2012 Olympics with only one thing on her mind -- to win a medal. But her three-person-crew, who had won a world title in their Olympic build up, did not deliver, instead finishing sixth. ""I don't think I'll ever forget that moment,"" Lush told CNN. ""I had a lot of belief in the way we campaigned but it was one of our worst ever performances in a regatta. "" ""That disappointment will always be with me. I've chosen not to go back and try and settle that straight, but to do something new and this is something new."" Future females . One thing is for sure, win or lose, these gutsy ladies are throwing sailing stereotypes overboard. As SCA managing director, Richard Brisius, said: ""They are all very talented natural sailors -- gender does not come into it."" ""It would be great to think that we could engage a new generation of women to break into competitive, crewed offshore racing. A female team in this race should be the norm, not something unusual.""","First all-female crew in over a decade gears up for tough sailing race .

"(CNN) -- ""Lee Harvey Oswald shot"" ""Man vs. tanks in Tiananmen Square"" ""VJ Day in Times Square"" If these phrases immediately conjured a distinct image in your mind, you're in good company. Like you, untold millions of people pictured the same thing. That's what iconic means. These are the dramatic images that have are embedded in our culture. They have come to define a historical event, a famous person -- or maybe even an entire generation. They're the proud images you see on postage stamps, like the flag raisings at Iwo Jima and, later, Ground Zero. They are also the images that depict terrible tragedies, such as the Kent State shootings and the Hindenburg disaster. We see these photos reproduced time and time again. So what is it that makes them so iconic? How did they emerge and stand the test of time? Or more simply, what makes them so special? Learn more than you ever knew about ""The Flag"" ""I think the most important common denominator is that they strike us on a very deep emotional level, and the emotions are usually some of the deepest emotions that a human being can feel: heroism, fear, grief, joy,"" said Peter Howe, whose career has included stints as director of photography at Life magazine and picture editor at The New York Times Magazine. These images appeal to something we all feel, Howe said. ""If you take, for instance, Alfred Eisenstaedt's picture of the sailor kissing the nurse in Times Square on VJ Day: I think you could take that photograph to any country and any culture and you would get a similar sort of response to the joyfulness of it all,"" Howe said. ""Maybe some countries would not like a public display of a woman being kissed by a man in public, but there is a sort of joyfulness about that picture which I think is universally appealing."" Another important characteristic of iconic images is that they capture an exact instant and can't possibly be repeated, said John Loengard, a former Life magazine picture editor who has been taking photos professionally for more than 50 years. He said the two most iconic pictures from this century are the hooded prisoner at Abu Ghraib and the falling man from the World Trade Center. ""Those simply upset us to see. We see it immediately, we grasp its significance, it's an exact moment,"" Loengard said. ""The photographs could not possibly be repeated. ""And I think that's true of the Iwo Jima photograph that Joe Rosenthal took in World War II. It's true of photographs like Kent State, the guy who was shot and the girl kneeling over him, and ... in Vietnam, the burned girl running down the road and Eddie Adams' police chief executing a Vietcong prisoner. They're all pictures that are an exact instant."" Years after they were taken, iconic photographs can help us bring historical events into focus. They can help us to better understand the time period and what the prevailing sentiment was at the time. ""I think in Vietnam, it was opposition to the war,"" Loengard said. ""There were many great photographers in Vietnam taking extremely wonderful photographs of combat. But none of them are iconic, I don't think. ... It was these situations that you simply looked at in the morning and you said: 'That's not what this country is about. This shouldn't be happening. We shouldn't be involved in this.'"" Images can also define how we ultimately view historical figures. Marilyn Monroe's sultry legacy is often traced back to the shot of her dress blowing up in ""The Seven Year Itch."" And Yousuf Karsh's portrait of a scowling Winston Churchill -- reportedly caused by Karsh snatching Churchill's cigar -- cemented Churchill's reputation as a ""roaring lion."" ""It summed up the leadership qualities that he had in an amazing way and made Churchill even more famous,"" Loengard said. For decades, one would usually find these iconic images in a newspaper or magazine. But the digital age -- the rise of the Internet and cellphone cameras -- has changed things forever. ""I think there are probably more pictures being taken now than there have ever been taken in time,"" Howe said. ""You just walk around and you see people always taking pictures on their iPhone. There's a massive visual imagery that is being generated by the public."" That could be a good or a bad thing, depending how you look at it, Howe said. On the positive side, there is more opportunity now than ever for someone to capture an exact moment. And where there once was a significant time lag between when a photo was taken and when it was seen at the breakfast table, now it's instantaneous. But a potentially iconic photo, Howe said, could be drowned out today by the sheer volume of photos available. ""I think it's much more difficult now for any particular image to rise to the surface,"" Howe said, ""because we are so inundated with visual imagery nowadays. ... You are getting the image so quickly, and it's being followed up by so many more images afterward."" Before the Internet, media outlets had limited space and had to be more selective with photographs. The scarcity of photos usually gave people more time to absorb the images and put them into proper perspective. But with much more space online, the standards have lowered, said Carol Squiers, curator at the International Center of Photography. Now, it's not uncommon to see blurry cell phone pictures and poor amateur photographs published. And most cell phone photos still have a long way to go if they're to going to be considered anything near iconic. ""Right now, it's pretty hit or miss,"" Squiers said. ""It's pretty haphazard and it's very much focused on the personal. 'Selfies,' I'm sure, far outweigh any other pictures that anybody takes. ""But it's a process. We're all undergoing learning experiments with the digital, even though it's been around for so long."" Squiers cited the recent Boston Marathon bombings as an example when most amateurs and their cell phones fell short of delivering high-quality images. Many photos were taken on the run and came out blurry or crooked. ""It's very easy to take a picture; it is not very easy to take a good picture,"" Squiers said. ""And it is even harder to take a picture that lasts through time.""","Unforgettable photos often define an event, a person, or even a generation .

"(CNN) -- When the Manchin-Toomey background check amendment, a modest gun restriction by any reasonable measure, was defeated, President Barack Obama called it a ""shameful day in Washington."" But as anyone who watches Congress knows, it has more than its share of shameful days. There the deck was stacked against not only this bill, but against any bill that would restrict the proliferation of guns in any way. If those seeking sanity in our gun laws want to succeed, they'd better prepare themselves for a difficult journey. Many people thought that the Newtown massacre changed everything about the gun debate in America, and that new legislation was inevitable. The first part of that belief is still true; the second part is not. The bill was doomed for a number of reasons. The Senate is an extraordinarily undemocratic institution, where outsized power goes to the small, rural states with strong support for unlimited gun rights. The 57 million Americans who live in California and New York get four votes in the Senate, all of which were in favor of background checks. But the 1.3 million Americans who live in Wyoming and North Dakota also get four votes, and they were all opposed. And that's not to mention the filibuster, which allows the minority to thwart the majority's will. You might not have realized it if you watched the coverage, but this background check bill was supported by a majority of the Senate. And even if it had passed the Senate, the bill would have likely died in the House, which is tilted in favor of Republicans, mostly because the way Americans are distributed. More Americans voted for Democrats than Republicans in the 2012 House elections, but Republicans enjoy a 31-seat advantage, meaning their leader controls the agenda and can kill any bill he and his caucus dislike. Opinion: One way to fight guns . So does this mean the NRA still inspires the same fear it long has among lawmakers? Not really. The truth is that most of the people who threatened to filibuster the background check bill aren't afraid of the NRA. They're on its side. They don't need to be intimidated or even persuaded. Take Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who many years ago was known as a straightforward, even moderate fellow, but who at some point decided that if he didn't like a bill, the best thing to do is to simply lie about what it contained, stoke fears or both. He did it when he spread the ""death panel"" lie during the debate over health reform, and he did it again this time, telling people falsely that the Manchin-Toomey amendment would mean a national registry of every American who owns a gun. He then warned darkly, ""when registration fails, the next move will be gun confiscation."" For the record, the Manchin-Toomey amendment specifically forbade the government from creating a gun registry, which is why Obama and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- a guy from a state Obama lost by 27 points in 2012, who got elected to the Senate with an ad showing him firing a rifle shot through a piece of legislation while the announcer trumpeted his NRA endorsement -- accused the NRA and its supporters of lying about it. But Grassley and others spread the lie, knowing it would energize the paranoid and influence the more cowardly of their colleagues. As one gun lobbyist gloated after the bill was defeated, ""The gun registry defined the battle over universal background checks."" We shouldn't have been too surprised. But one of the salutary effects of this debate is how it has brought to wider public attention the kind of unhinged conspiracy theorizing, paranoia and outright hate most Americans wouldn't know about if they hadn't been attending NRA meetings or reading pro-gun Web sites in recent years. The insanity of some of those who opposed this bill was captured by the Minnesota radio host who said to the Newtown families, ""I'm sorry that you suffered a tragedy, but you know what? Deal with it, and don't force me to lose my liberty, which is a greater tragedy than your loss."" That's right -- having to get a background check when you buy a gun at a gun show is worse than having your child murdered. For good measure, he added that if he had the opportunity to meet those families, ""I would stand in front of them and tell them, 'Go to hell.' "" Opinion: Loved ones lost to bullets . Most gun owners would hear that and be disgusted, just as most gun owners think universal background checks are perfectly reasonable. So now, gun safety advocates have to change how they think of their cause. It would have been nice if we could have made our gun laws a little more sane in this first try, but sometimes, change takes longer. But change is already underway. For 15 years, the debate on guns in America was no debate at all. One side would scream, ""They're coming for your guns!"" and the other side would respond, ""Can't we talk about something else?"" Now we actually have a debate with two sides. Democratic politicians (and a few Republicans) are no longer so afraid to say that the right to bear arms is not infinite; like every other right in the Constitution, it's subject to reasonable limits. The money from the gun manufacturers and the NRA will be met with an equally well-funded campaign -- and maybe more well-funded -- from Michael Bloomberg. In fact, this defeat may be just what the gun safety movement needs to energize its supporters. Talk to liberals a day after the vote, and you'll hear anger, frustration and disgust at the craven senators who couldn't stand up to the gun lobby. Those emotions are exactly what spur people to become involved. If they want to succeed, in the coming months and years, they'll need to make sure their voices are as loud as those of the NRA and its supporters. A number on a poll, like the 90% of Americans who support universal background checks, isn't politically meaningful unless it inspires some fear in lawmakers. This time around, they obviously weren't afraid enough. But if support for new gun measures can become an actual movement again -- with letters and phone calls and contributions and door knocking and an unmistakable message to candidates that there will be a price to be paid for going against it -- then next time around, they may be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Background check failure another shameful day for a cowardly Congress .
Senate undemocratic, he says; small rural states have outsized power .
He says Sen. Chuck Grassley spread lies to kill legislation .

"(CNN) -- Country music fans are loyal and they don't like to see their legends fall. Randy Travis, one of the genre's most revered traditional singer-songwriters, was arrested this week after being found naked, smelling apparently of alcohol and lying on a remote roadway in northern Texas, authorities said. In a genre largely led by artists who can achieve chart-topping tunes and high-grossing concert tours, industry consultants and radio station personalities say Travis, 53, faces significant challenges ahead and should first address whatever issues may have led to this incident. Country's unique ""cradle to the grave"" fan base will likely stick with Travis, one industry expert told CNN. ""Country music fans are notorious for their loyalty,"" said Wade Jessen, senior chart manager for Billboard in Nashville. ""They tend to live the artist's lives with them -- good, or bad, (but) only up to a point."" Country singer Travis arrested, accused of DWI . Some say Travis may have reached that point Tuesday evening. Travis was driving his black 1998 Pontiac Trans Am, which went off the north side of a highway just west of Tioga, Texas, where he resides, and struck several barricades in a construction zone, said Texas Highway Patrol Trooper Mark Tackett. Travis was found naked, Tackett said. When the singer was brought to Grayson County jail at 3 a.m., after a hospital visit, he still didn't have clothes, Sgt. Rickey Wheeler said. ""He was given a paper suit, which is a jail uniform made out of paper,"" Wheeler told CNN. Travis was charged with driving while intoxicated and felony retaliation, after allegedly threatening to fatally shoot highway patrol troopers who responded to a concerned caller who notified authorities of ""a man lying in the roadway"" Tuesday. The incident happened just six months after he pleaded no contest to public intoxication in another case. The singer's camp has not responded to CNN requests for comment. Travis, of course, isn't the first country star to run into problems. Hank Williams and George Jones were known for their tumultuous lifestyles and drinking. Jones even earned the moniker ""No Show Jones"" because he missed so many performances. ""The difference is George Jones had his clothes on,"" said country radio consultant Joel Raab. And it's certainly not the first time a celebrity from any genre has found himself in the middle of a personal and public relations challenge. R&B star Chris Brown worked his way back up the charts after he was convicted three years ago of assaulting ex-girlfriend Rihanna. Former ""Two and a Half Men"" star Charlie Sheen is back on television after a very public firing and meltdown. Susan Keel, a Nashville-based publicist who has represented country singers, said Travis should postpone his current tour and issue a statement indicating he is getting help. ""He should apologize to the officer, the public, friends and fans to indicate he will get his life back on track,"" said Keel. Travis burst onto the country music scene in 1986 with ""Storms of Life."" The North Carolina-born singer's debut album sold nearly 4 million copies and made him a star of the ""new traditional"" scene. Travis was in his heyday from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, recording such classics as ""Diggin' Up Bones"" and ""Forever and Ever, Amen."" His baritone voice and songs and even his retro wardrobe harkened to a traditional country style. Julie Stevens, now program director at KRTY in San Jose, California, said Travis and George Strait came in like a breath of fresh air during the mid-1980s, when country radio stations were suffering low ratings. ""It was horrible,"" said Stevens. ""We were just coming out of John Travolta and the whole 'Urban Cowboy' thing."" Travis ran out a string of successful songs and albums. ""The two of them together saved the format,"" Stevens said. ""I don't know why George endured and Randy didn't."" Travis eventually moved toward gospel music and today he largely plays smaller venues, including casinos. Strait, meanwhile, is still bringing large crowds to arenas. While he has a predictable sound, according to Billboard's Jessen, Strait ""is very adept at making it sound fresh from album to album."" ""I don't think we can blame Randy Travis' decline on the format,"" Jessen said. Long time since a hit record . Observers point out that Travis hasn't had a top-selling record for a decade. Finding one now could give him a needed boost. ""He has to make a hit record that will work on country radio with today's country fans,"" said Raab. ""You would be hard-pressed to find a Randy Travis song on a contemporary country radio station today."" An estimated 2,000 stations, most of them ""contemporary,"" are considered the primary marketing vehicle for country music, Jessen told CNN. Listeners ages 25 to 54 are the key demographic, and successful musicians keep the songs coming. ""If you take it in general terms, Randy Travis is considered a veteran artist,"" said Jessen. ""Randy doesn't have singles on the radio all the time. Current artists have a new single on the radio all the time. They tour and record. They tour and record. They tour and record."" Still, Travis has won seven Grammy Awards, five Country Music Association awards, 10 Academy of Country Music statuettes, 10 American Music Awards, seven Music City News awards, and eight Dove Awards from the Gospel Music Association, according to his website. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1986, according to his website. Travis' last major hit came in 2002 with ""Three Wooden Crosses,"" a song about faith and redemption. There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway, . Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows. I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you, . It's what you leave behind you when you go. Travis ""was able to tell it with sincerity and it was a hit,"" Jessen said. Jess Wright, program director and on-air personality at WFRE in Frederick, Maryland, said her station plays some traditional country songs favored by the likes of Travis. ""If it is not the right song, it is hard to find the right place to play it,"" Wright told CNN. Raab provides consultant services to 27 stations, a few of which are ""classic"" -- meaning they play songs from the 1950s to the 1990s. He spoke Thursday with an individual at one such station. While they discussed Travis' most recent incident, they never discussed whether his songs should be taken off the air. ""I don't think the legacy of his music is necessarily tarnished by what he did,"" said Raab. Difficulties include lawsuits . The past two years have been difficult ones for Travis. He divorced his longtime wife in 2010. According to a lawsuit filed earlier this year, Elizabeth Travis remained his personal manager until she terminated the agreement in 2011 -- without proper notice, the suit alleges. Randy Travis countersued in May, contending Elizabeth Travis divulged confidential information about him in order to damage his reputation and career. He did not provide specifics. In February, the legendary performer was arrested for public intoxication while sitting in his car in front of a church in Sanger, Texas. ""I apologize for what resulted following an evening of celebrating the Super Bowl,"" Travis told CNN in a statement after that arrest. ""I'm committed to being responsible and accountable, and apologize for my actions."" With fewer songs on radio, Travis primarily reaches his fan base by touring, said Jessen. ""An old rule in country music, men like to be sung about and women like to be sung to. Randy has done both."" ""His diehard fans are going to stay with him through this,"" Jessen said. ""They will wish him well and stay tuned to the news."" ""Country music fans don't like to see their legends fall."" Keel said the country music industry still considers Travis a legend. ""This is a very supportive community and a forgiving community,"" she said. Comments: How did such a talented guy end up with a mug shot like that? CNN's David Ariosto and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Randy Travis faces charges after traffic incident .

"(CNN) -- Popular apps for the iPhone and iPad, some of which usually go for up to $20, were being offered for free in Apple's online App Store on Monday, possibly in conjunction with the store's fifth anniversary. Popular games were in abundance on the list, with ""Infinity Blade II,"" ""Where's My Water?"" and ""Tiny Wings"" among them. The steepest discount appeared to be Traktor DJ, a suite of tools for mixing and recording music that usually goes for $19.99. MapMyRide+, photo-text app Over and recipe app How to Cook Everything also were among the apps being offered for free Monday. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the free apps. In May, the App Store passed a staggering 50 billion downloads, according to Apple. It seems likely that the apparent promotion will be part of an effort to commemorate July 10, 2008, the day the App Store went live as an update to iTunes. It increased the appeal of the iPhone, and later the iPad, and created a sales model that has been adopted by rivals like Google, Microsoft and BlackBerry in the years since. That's led to Apple to trademark the term ""app store"" in an ongoing effort to protect the term. In 2011, Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon, which rolled out the Amazon App Store along with its entry into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire. Last month, the two companies failed to come to an agreement after new rounds of negotiations. Apple argues that Amazon infringes on its trademark by calling its store that sells apps an ""app store."" Amazon argues that the words constitute a generic description. The term ""app,"" as applied to computers, dates at least to the 1980s. Google's app store, for users of its mobile Android operating system, is called Google Play. BlackBerry has BlackBerry World, and Microsoft's merely says ""Windows Phone"" at the top of its mobile store's homepage.","Top iPhone, iPad apps being offered for free .

"(CNN) -- Three decades ago Chinese leaders unleashed a series of economic reforms that helped lift millions of people out of poverty and transform the Asian country into an industrial powerhouse with a mighty foreign reserve arsenal. The transition, however, was far from smooth. ""Particularly the first 10 years, it was really tough and hard,"" explains Zhong Jianhua, China's special representative on African Affairs. ""So many businesses, factories, go (into) bankruptcy, millions of workers were being redundant or unemployed."" Before becoming today's economic behemoth, China was mainly an agricultural economy that boasted huge reserves of natural resources -- quite similar to many parts of Africa. So are there any lessons that African countries can learn from China as they bid to boost their economies and achieve their development goals? According to Zhong, long-term economic success doesn't come without short-term cost, and that is the message he is keen to get across to African leaders. ""When we introduce our experience to African countries, on one side we need to say what you should do and need to do, and probably on the other side we should emphasize what you could expect."" CNN's Robyn Curnow spoke to Zhong about trade, investment and what lessons can Africa learn from China's rise to a superpower. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What can China teach Africa? Zhong Jianhua: I can tell you a lot of things about what happened in China, what we have learned and what we experienced. Personally I think that probably for the last few years when we try to impress people that we are successful with this open reform policy, we emphasize too much on what we have achieved. Obama's goal in Africa: Counter China . This is good because you need to prove you are successful but I think a little bit thing that's being ignored is how much we've paid for that. And if you are ignoring the price you pay for this kind of success, and particularly for African countries, if they understood that 'you Chinese have some tricks, teach me the trick and then I will be as rich as you are' and then we, particularly myself, look back and say ""Geez, these 30 years how did we experience that?"" Particularly the first 10 years it was really tough and hard; so many businesses, factories, go (into) bankruptcy, millions of workers were being redundant or unemployed. So probably when we introduce our experience to African countries, on one side we need to say what you should do and need to do, and probably on the other side we should emphasize what you could expect. CNN: Do you think African leaders are ready, willing and able to make those sacrifices? ZJ: I will not answer on their behalf; I would rather let them to answer that. But what we can contribute is to share what we have experienced. This could possibly happen anywhere if you want to have a reform. I think African countries, if they want to reform the structure of the economy, want to come forward and to become developed, this kind of challenge probably will come to them sooner or later. Read this: Can China transform Africa? CNN: China in many ways is part of this reform in Africa, a relationship that is becoming more criticized. Nigeria's Central Bank governor wrote, for example, recently that China's relationship with Africa whiffs of colonialism. ZJ: I fully understand him. I think he has the reason to be anxious, sometimes be angry. But I say that don't jump to the conclusion so easily. Colonialism is a heavy word; when I think about colonialism I think about the six cents a barrel of oil being exported from this continent, leaving this continent with only poverty. But now what's happening is changing this whole continent. Because with the commodity trade with the world, it can generate its own development and foundation for infrastructure. This is the change, it's happening. Read this: Obama 'plays catch up' in Africa . But I really admire the governor for his courage to say in his article that ""we need to compete with China."" This is something I see as a very bright point in his article because I think eventually African people should be confident enough to stand up, to compete with any country of the world. Without that kind of competition Africa can never develop itself and I always say that there is no loser in this competition; everyone benefits from this kind of competition because this competition means development. I think the same thing will happen in Africa. I'm glad to see that; our opportunity is to help them to compete with us, to help them win this competition. That's the future; it's called a win-win situation. CNN: So what does China want from Africa? ZJ: We want a more prosperous world; without that China cannot develop itself. What the more prosperous world means is to lift this continent out of poverty. Repeat what happened in China; [a] repeat [of] what happened in China benefits Africa, and China itself will also benefit from that.","Zhong Jianhua is China's special representative on African Affairs .

"(CNN) -- Russell Armstrong complained before his apparent suicide that his estranged wife's reality show was going to ""crucify"" him in its upcoming season, his mother said Wednesday. John Ann Hotchkiss said Armstrong and his wife Taylor, a cast member on Bravo's ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,"" had been happy before they agreed to join the reality show. Once it aired, ""I watched it slowly destroy their marriage,"" she told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" ""Before the new season even started, before he took his life, he said, 'Mom, they're just going to crucify me this season,' "" Hotchkiss said. ""He said, 'I don't know what to do. I'll never survive it.' I thought he meant businesswise or something,"" Hotchkiss said. ""Perhaps there was a double meaning there. I don't know."" Russell Armstrong was found dead at a home in the hills above the Los Angeles suburb of Bel Air on Monday, police said. His wife had filed for divorce in July, telling People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage. Hotchkiss said her son was upset by the criticism of other cast members and complained that ""All the network cares about are ratings."" ""I know it hurt him deeply, because he would talk to me about it -- never criticizing Taylor, of course,"" she said. ""I know it brought him down."" Bravo did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. In a statement posted on the network's website, Executive Vice President Andy Cohen said the network was ""still trying to process yesterday's very sad news"" and trying to figure out what to do with the upcoming season of the show, which had been set to premiere September 5. Armstrong's lawyer, Ronald Richards, said the allegations of verbal and physical abuse stemmed from ""drunk arguments"" between the couple. Meanwhile, Armstrong was financially drained, had been defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and his credit cards had been suspended -- all pressures Richards said were made worse by the show. ""He takes a lot of time, doing a lot of events for the show, and he starts supporting an increasingly more expensive lifestyle,"" Richards told HLN. ""So he ends up being in a very vulnerable position financially, because he's totally distracted now, supporting the show. And then these constant press reports about negative things about him hurt his capital business."" Richards said the couple should be edited out of the upcoming show, ""and he should rest in peace.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a $2.75 million civil penalty against Boeing Co. on Friday for allegedly using certain parts in 777 construction that did not meet standards and repeatedly missing deadlines to address related quality control issues. ""Safety is our top priority and a robust quality control system is a vital part of maintaining the world's safest air transportation system,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. The FAA said Boeing's commercial aircraft division took more than two years after learning about quality control gaps involving fasteners in 777 construction to fully address the problem. Metal fasteners were used in a number of areas, including to attach the wing skin to the wing structures, the FAA said. The issue did not present an immediate concern for the safety of the plane but manufacturers agree to follow rigid FAA standards when a plane is certified, and that includes rules on parts. A workhorse aircraft, the twin-engine 777 -- or ""Triple Seven"" -- is flown by airlines worldwide. Problems began in 2008 when the FAA said Boeing discovered it had been installing fasteners that did not meet government standards on the long-haul jets. It stopped using them immediately, but some of the underlying manufacturing concerns persisted. The FAA said Boeing repeatedly granted itself extensions and then missed the deadlines, ultimately not acting on a comprehensive fix until 2010. ""Manufacturers must make it a priority to identify and correct quality problems in a timely manner,"" said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. This was the second major FAA civil penalty proposal against Boeing in as many years for missing deadlines. The agency proposed a $13.5 million fine in 2012 over the company's alleged failure to provide information to airlines about reducing fuel tank flammability. That case grew out of the mid-air explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800 in 1996. The FAA also grounded Boeing's 787 Dreamliners in January due to battery related fire risk. Boeing had to address regulatory safety concerns before those planes could fly again. The world's largest aircraft manufacturer said in a statement that it takes ""any concern about safety, compliance and conformity very seriously,"" but depicted the case raised on Friday as an old ""administrative issue"" that has been settled. Boeing said its response includes a robust database for tracking potential problems, additional management oversight and communication with the FAA to ensure that any concerns are resolved in a timely manner. ""We are working closely with the FAA to ensure we understand and address any remaining concerns with this proposed penalty,"" Boeing said, promising a formal response within the 30-day period allowed by the government. The term ""fastener"" in aviation describes any number of items, including bolts, rivets and other items used in assembling planes. The FAA did not specify the type of fastener in this case, but said the parts that did not conform with its standards were manufactured between 1993 and 2008. Aircraft manufacturers use hundreds of thousands of fasteners during construction.","Proposed penalty involves alleged shortcomings in quality control .

"(CNN) -- A landslide the size of a small town has killed at least 18 people and toppled 11 buildings in southwest China, state-run media said, citing local authorities. The disaster occurred in Sichuan province's Dujiangyan city on Wednesday, the Xinhua state news agency reported. By Thursday afternoon, the number of people reported missing had climbed to 107, from 21 the previous day. Rescuers continue to dig through 53 million cubic feet of dirt in search of them. The forecast calls for less rain, which should make the search easier. Flooding that triggered the landslide has affected 1.5 million people and inundated tens of thousands of acres of crops. The torrents have plagued the mountainous region since Monday, smashing bridges and knocking out power to thousands. They have washed away property worth more than $40 million, provincial officials said. Zhang Jiuchun is an interior designer living in Mianyang, the second-largest city in Sichuan. He told CNN in a phone interview that flooding, landslides and mudslides have paralyzed highway and rail services in many parts of the province. Zhang said suburban areas have been hit the hardest. ""I think it's the worst since 1998,"" Zhang said of the disaster, referring to major flooding sweeping across China over a decade ago.

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut State Police dive team was searching a lake in Bristol, Connecticut, Monday for an item linked to the case of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who is charged with murder in Massachusetts, a law enforcement source told CNN. Hernandez, though he lives in the Boston area, is a Bristol native. The lake is about a mile from his uncle's Bristol home, which police have searched several times while investigating last month's shooting death of Odin Lloyd. Law enforcement sources declined to say what was being sought in the lake. Authorities have accused Hernandez, a 23-year-old former New England Patriots player, of orchestrating the shooting death of Lloyd, the 27-year-old boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancÃ©e's sister. The former standout NFL tight end has pleaded not guilty to murder. He is being held without opportunity for bail. Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in the early morning of June 17. Surveillance cameras showed the car at an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Lloyd's body was found in the North Attleborough industrial park later that day. The Patriots released Hernandez, who had been one of their top offensive players, shortly after his arrest but before he was charged in court with murder. Authorities have said they've yet to find the gun they believe was used in the shooting: a Glock .45. The other men who were allegedly in the car with Hernandez around the time of Lloyd's death are behind bars as well. One of them, Ernest Wallace, has been charged with accessory after the fact to murder and has pleaded not guilty. The other, Carlos Ortiz, has pleaded not guilty to a weapons charge. CNN's Jason Hanna and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Lake is mile from Connecticut home of Hernandez's uncle .

"(Financial TImes) -- The Bank of Japan has lifted its assessment of Japan's economy, and underlined progress towards its price target by saying that inflation expectations ""appear to be rising."" In an upbeat statement following a two-day policy meeting, the BoJ said the world's third-largest economy is ""recovering moderately"", boosted by a pick-up in exports and investment in fixed assets by companies on the back of higher profits. Public investment is also rising, it noted, while the housing sector is looking stronger. As such, the BoJ kept its main policy settings on hold, as it has done every month since April, when governor Haruhiko Kuroda unveiled what he called a ""new phase"" of ""quantitative and qualitative monetary easing."" The aim is to hit a 2 per cent target for inflation by buying up huge amounts of assets, mostly longer-term bonds. This week the BoJ reported that Japan's monetary base expanded 42 per cent from a year earlier in August, to Y172tn ($1.72tn), marking an all-time high for the sixth straight month. Meanwhile, the balance of current accounts deposited at the BoJ more than doubled to Y84tn, as banks parked proceeds of bond sales. Analysts say that the BoJ is now at a delicate juncture in its easing programme, where it is hoping that so-called ""bad inflation"" caused by the drop in the yen since late last year is gradually replaced by ""good inflation"", signalling a virtuous cycle of demand. For now, the evidence is mixed. The Japan-style core measure of consumer price inflation, which excludes food but not energy, climbed to 0.7 per cent in July, its highest level in nearly five years. The US-style core measure, which strips out both food and energy, is also on a rising trend but is still negative, at minus 0.1 per cent in July. Prices for items such as housing, furniture and medical care all fell from a year earlier. Meanwhile, lending activity is still relatively subdued, with total loans rising 2.2 per cent in July. Base salaries are generally flat, or falling. However, prices are moving in line with the policy board's forecasts, which means that the BoJ is under little pressure to do more to try to force the index higher. The onus now shifts to the government, say analysts, as it prepares to address some of the structural reforms set out in the growth strategy of Shinzo Abe, prime minister. Abe wants to make Japan a more competitive place to invest and to do business, thus stimulating employment, incomes and consumption. ""[BoJ] policy board members are continuing to shun 'incremental easing'"", said Izumi Devalier, economist at HSBC in Hong Kong. She expects the BoJ to leave monetary conditions unchanged for the remainder of the fiscal year to April. ""With the central bank out of the hot seat for now, the focus is squarely on the government.""","The BoJ kept its main policy settings on hold, as it has done every month since April .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A car bomb apparently targeting the Egyptian interior minister's motorcade exploded in eastern Cairo Thursday, leaving four people injured, state media reported. The interior minister, Mohammed Ibrahim, is safe, according to the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper. Al-Ahram said no one was killed in the blast near the minister's residence in Nasr City. Egyptian state news agency EgyNews said four security personnel were injured, with one policeman having a leg amputated as a result of his injuries. An Interior Ministry statement said the explosion caused injuries to security guards and some bystanders. It occurred about 10:30 a.m. as the minister's convoy passed through Mostafa El Nahas Street in Nasr City, it said. Security agencies are investigating, the ministry added.

"(CNN) -- A compromise is putting rah, rah, rah back in place of no, no, no at a Florida school that had banned cheerleader skirts administrators said were too revealing for the classroom. The decision to prohibit cheerleader skirts during classroom hours had been ridiculed as short in spirit by some Countryside High School cheerleaders and parents. School leaders said the uniforms just weren't appropriate for classrooms and didn't fit into student dress codes. Under the compromise between Pinellas County Schools and the cheerleading team, the skirts will have to be lower than the cheerleaders' fingertip reach, and no sleeveless tops will be allowed, school district spokeswoman Melanie Marquez Parra told CNN Friday. Sophomore Jeana Fraser has been cheering since middle school, and she scored a spot on the Countryside High School Varsity cheerleading team this year. Before the compromise was announced, she told CNN affiliate WFLA that her ""shorter than mid-thigh"" skirt was a part of tradition: The football players and cheerleaders wear their uniforms each Friday during school on game day. Jeana said dressing up for game day is a way for students to get excited for the football game. Jeana's father, David Fraser, told CNN that some kids ""just don't wear as many clothes as they should,"" primarily because of the Florida heat. He said he understands administrators were in a tough spot, but he noted that cheerleading is part of Americana. Her mother, Norma Fraser, agreed, telling WFLA the ban was ""almost un-American."" Marquez Parra said all 16 schools in the district have a dress code, and have for some time, but Countryside is an example of a school that is increasing enforcement. The spokeswoman told CNN the emphasis should be on academics, and noted squads express their spirit during school hours at several schools in different ways. At one, cheerleaders wear their uniform tops, with sleeves, and matching bows in their hair.","A compromise allows cheerleader outfits in a Pinellas County, Florida, high school .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The recently resuscitated momentum toward Mideast peace talks has picked up even more steam, with the U.S. State Department announcing Sunday afternoon that initial meetings are planned for Monday night, in addition to previously anticipated meetings on Tuesday. The Israelis will be represented by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and Yitzhak Molcho, and the Palestinians will be represented by Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat and Mohammad Shtayyeh, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement, which said the prinicpals would ""formally resume direct final status negotiations. "" Ahead of the talks, the Israeli government on Sunday approved freeing 104 Palestinian prisoners, despite popular sentiment against such a release. Before his weekly Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged his government to vote in favor of the prisoner release, despite reservations. ""This moment is not easy for me. It is not easy for the ministers,"" he said. ""It is not easy especially for the families, the bereaved families, whose heart I understand. But there are moments in which tough decisions must be made for the good of the country, and this is one of those moments."" The measure passed 14-6 with two abstentions . Also at Sunday's meeting, the Cabinet approved the opening of diplomatic negotiations with the Palestinians and authorized a team headed by Netanyahu and four other top ministers to run the prisoner release. The votes were designed to build confidence and help kick-start the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The first of four waves of releases is slated to come after the negotiations get under way. Read more: Israelis, Palestinians to resume talks . Some observers see recent displays of goodwill, such as this vote, as signs that the upcoming round of peace talks could prove fruitful. Comments by top diplomats have sparked hopes as well. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated his praise for Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Sunday's statement, saying, ""Both leaders have demonstrated a willingness to make difficult decisions that have been instrumental in getting to this point. We are grateful for their leadership."" But it's not just in the hands of politicians. The Israeli Cabinet approved a measure stating that any agreement with the Palestinians will be submitted to the Israeli people for a vote. Also Sunday, Palestinian police in Ramallah, West Bank, clashed with marchers protesting the resumption of negotiations with Israel. The protesters said the talks indicate a ""willingness to concede, against the position of the Palestinian national consensus and even the decisions of the PLO institutions themselves"" and called the planned talks ""deeply dangerous to the Palestinian national cause,"" said the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian nongovermental organization. And Hamas, which governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, said in a statement that it ""rejects the Palestinian Authority return to peace talks with the Israeli occupation authorities.""","NEW: Peace negotiations set to start Monday night in Washington, says U.S. State Department .

"(CNN) -- It's been a long 100 days for Marc Fucarile, but he finally got to go home Wednesday. Fucarile is the last Boston Marathon bombing victim to be released from a hospital. He was discharged Wednesday morning from Boston's Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. ""It's definitely seemed like a lot longer than 100 days,"" Fucarile told reporters. He still faces additional surgeries, numerous follow-up appointments and hours of physical therapy daily. The 34-year-old from the Boston suburb of Stoneham, Massachusetts, was one of more than 260 people who were wounded by two bombs near the marathon finish line on April 15. One of his legs was amputated, and he also had shrapnel lodged in his body. He was surrounded by relatives and friends, his young son and his fiancee as he walked out of the hospital on crutches, looking forward to a home-cooked meal and a night with family. ""At times I've just wanted to check out, because I know how tough and hard it is for her or for him, not having me there,"" Fucarile said. ""You know, when he leaves, when he comes and visits and he's crying about wanting me to come home, it's been hard. It's been very hard."" He underwent multiple surgeries, staying 45 days at Massachusetts General Hospital before transferring to Spaulding -- a post-operation and rehabilitation facility -- for 55 days. In an earlier interview at Spaulding, Fucarile told CNN that in the frantic minutes after the attack, Boston police took him to a hospital in a detainee van because no ambulance was immediately available. The bombings killed three people. One of two people accused of carrying out the attack, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pleaded not guilty to federal charges and is awaiting trial. The other suspect, his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed during a gun battle with police. Fucarile admitted being angry about the attacks, but added, ""I'm more mad at what they did to the families that they took their children from. ""I'm more mad at that than at what happened to me,"" he said. ""I'm here. I'm lucky to be alive."" As for the bombers, ""They'll get theirs.""

"(CNN) -- If Saturday is any indication, Borussia Dortmund won't miss Mario Gotze. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, brought in to beef up the attack after Gotze was sold to rival Bayern Munich, netted a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut as the league and Champions League runner-up began by beating Augsburg 4-0. If he continues to impress, his $17 million transfer fee -- Aubameyang joined from Saint-Etienne in July -- will be considered a bargain. The Gabon international finished second in goals in Ligue 1 last season and was fifth in assists. He opened the scoring with a header in the first half and added two right-foot finishes in the second to become the sixth player to register a hat-trick in his Bundesliga opener. He thus stole the spotlight from sought after striker Robert Lewandowski, although the Pole contributed by setting up Aubameyang's third effort and completed the rout against the relegation contenders from the penalty spot. Dortmund's higher profile summer signing, midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan, missed the game against Augsburg because of a lingering ankle injury. ""Aubameyang was used to great effect,"" Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp told reporters. ""I am not surprised about what he has to offer, only the fact that most of his shots went in. ""It's a very good start from us."" Dortmund is seeking to reclaim the Bundesliga crown from Bayern Munich, which raced to the 2012/2013 title in record time by clinching top spot in early April. Bayern Munich beat Dortmund 2-1 thanks to a late goal in an entertaining Champions League final in May and completed the treble by capturing the German Cup a week later. Under new boss Pep Guardiola, Bayern lost the German Super Cup 4-2 to Dortmund but began the new Bundesliga campaign with a 3-1 home victory Friday against Borussia Moenchengladbach. Newly promoted Hertha Berlin outdid Dortmund by scoring six goals in a 6-1 hammering of Eintracht Frankfurt, which finished sixth last term. Colombian international Adrian Ramos and Tunisian international Sami Allagui each scored twice. Falcao on target . In Ligue 1, Radamel Falcao scored in his league debut as big-spending Monaco downed Bordeaux 2-0 away in its return to the top flight. Despite playing in the second tier last season, Monaco is expected to challenge for the Ligue 1 title thanks to several high-profile summer signings. Falcao was the highest profile of the bunch, arriving from Atletico Madrid in a transfer reportedly worth $80 million.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's high court has upheld a prison sentence for former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in a tax fraud case. The court Thursday said it supported a lower court's four-year prison sentence for Berlusconi. Three years of that sentence are covered in an amnesty aimed at cutting down on prison overcrowding, effectively reducing Berlusconi's sentence to one year. The high court also ordered a lower court to reconsider whether Berlusconi, 76, should be banned from public office -- a controversial issue that could play a key role in the country's political future. A lower court convicted Berlusconi of tax evasion last October, sentencing him to four years in prison and barring him from public office for five years. In May, an Italian appeals court in Milan upheld that decision. The former prime minister can't appeal the high court's decision in the case. But it's unlikely he'll spend time behind bars, because of his age and the shortness of the sentence. Berlusconi is a member of Italy's Senate and therefore enjoys immunity from any type of arrest. The Senate would have to vote to have his immunity lifted in order to serve any sentence. Berlusconi, who served on and off as prime minister between 1994 and 2011, is one of the most colorful and controversial figures in the lively history of Italian politics. A look at the life of Silvio Berlusconi . For years, he has been entangled in fraud, corruption and sex scandals that have often reached Italian courts. In June, a panel of judges sentenced Berlusconi to seven years in prison for abusing power and having sex with an underage prostitute. Berlusconi's attorney told reporters he plans to appeal that conviction. Undaunted by the court battles, Berlusconi has not only launched appeals, but in December made two significant announcements: his engagement to 27-year-old Francesca Pascale, and then, his political comeback. In Italy's February elections, the three-time prime minister appealed to Italian voters by denouncing the unpopular austerity policies of technocrat Mario Monti. For all his critics, Berlusconi won almost 30% of the vote in February and remains an influential figure in Prime Minister Enrico Letta's fragile coalition government. CNN's Becky Anderson, Peter Wilkinson and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","Berlusconi's conviction is upheld, but the impact on his political career is unclear .

"(CNN) -- Mumford & Sons bassist Ted Dwane received emergency treatment this week after doctors found that he had a blood clot on the surface of his brain. The Grammy-winning group postponed several shows, saying Dwane sought treatment after ""feeling unwell for a few days."" The clot required an operation. ""Ted is receiving excellent care and we are being assured that he will recover quickly from surgery,"" the group said on its website. In December, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also hospitalized for a blood clot that formed after she fell and suffered a concussion. Clinton's clot was in the vein in the space between the brain and the skull behind her right ear, officials said. While little is known about Dwane's clot and its location, Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chairwoman of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care, said in December that Clinton's type of clot was called a cerebral venous thrombosis and is relatively rare. A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found that cerebral venous thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep-vein thrombosis, a similar clot found most often in the leg. Clinton had a DVT in 1998. ""There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots,"" Cushman said. ""That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person."" Risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found that the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car, where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot. Blood thinners are considered standard treatment after a blood clot, experts said. ""The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot,"" Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at New York's Montefiore Medical Center, said in December. He was not involved in Clinton's care. ""Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment,"" he said. Often, patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure that the dosage is right. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nine children died in a suicide bombing Saturday morning near an Indian consulate in Afghanistan, a governor's spokesman said. The children apparently were students at a mosque near the consulate in Jalalabad. All three attackers died, said Ahmedzia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province. He said 23 people, including many children, were injured. On Saturdays, children typically go to the mosque for religious classes. The spokesman said the three attackers arrived in a Toyota Corolla about 100 meters from the consulate. Two began shooting. As security officials neared, the third detonated a bomb. Jalalabad is between Kabul, the Afghan capital, and Peshawar in Pakistan. The border region is rife with Islamic extremists. The consulate general of India condemned the attack in a statement, saying, ""This attack has once again highlighted that the main threat to Afghanistan's security and stability stems from terrorism and the terror machine that continues to operate from beyond its borders."" ""India will not be deterred from its commitment to assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction and development effort,"" according to the statement, which was posted on India's Ministry of External Affairs' website. ""This was clearly an attack not just against India but an attack against the efforts to help the Afghan people overcome the tragic hardships they have endured due to several decades of war.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. authorities are tightening up domestic security measures ahead of a possible U.S. military attack on Syria. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are warning of a higher risk of cyber attacks after months of similar disruptions by hackers known as the Syrian Electronic Army. One such attack brought down the website of The New York Times in recent days, and authorities say more attacks are likely. Warnings from Iranian officials that any U.S. attack on Syria could be met with retaliation has also prompted warnings of possible terror threats in the United States or its interests abroad, U.S. law enforcement officials said. FBI officials have asked agents around United States to focus on ongoing investigations related to Syria and the surrounding region, checking in with contacts and informants, and ""redoubling their efforts,"" as one official said. Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah have intervened in the 2-year-old Syrian civil war on the side of President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The United States has blamed al-Assad's regime for alleged chemical weapons attacks that have killed scores of civilians. Hezbollah is known to have extensive fundraising operations inside the United States, and authorities often worry those assets could be used for terrorism. Unlike previous U.S. military operations against Libya and Iraq, which prompted the FBI to conduct thousands of interviews with exiles living in the United States, FBI officials say the Syrian crisis isn't prompting such a move this time. Instead, law enforcement officials say they are trying to focus on cases already under way and working to develop any new information that signals possible retaliation against the United States. The Syrian diaspora in the United States amounts to fewer than 150,000 people with Syrian ancestry, according to 2010 U.S. Census estimates. Syrian immigrant communities in Pennsylvania, Illinois, New Jersey and elsewhere tend to be longstanding.","The FBI warns of a higher risk of cyber attacks .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The Chinese government is ordering outspoken artist Ai Weiwei to pay 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) in back taxes, a move Ai calls ""retaliation against a dissident."" Ai said that two representatives from the Beijing tax bureau visited him Tuesday and presented him with documents from the tax authority, ordering the company FAKE Cultural Development Ltd. -- registered by Ai's wife Luqing -- to pay the taxes within 15 days. Ai, who designed the distinctive ""Bird's Nest"" stadium for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, said he is not even the legal representative of the company, but that police warned him Monday that as the ""factual controlling person"" of the company, he'd better prepare the money and pay it himself. ""They told me that 'The country said that you evade tax, then you evade tax. The country won't change the verdict, so don't you ever think it will. There's nothing you can do,'"" Ai said. The artist was detained in April on grounds of tax evasion. However, his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his criticism of the Chinese government. Ai was released on bail in June for his good attitude and medical concerns, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers. According to the artist, authorities also declined their demand to publish the accounting records and other evidence that lead to the tax evasion charge. Ai told CNN he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of ""subversion of state power,"" but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion. ""This is against judicial law, and is unethical. How can a country use this way to try to silence dissidents?"" he asked. Ai said he'll consult with the lawyers on the next step, but so far there is no clear plan for him regarding how to pay the tax or if he is going to appeal. ""The verdict is not reasonable, but we have to obey,"" Ai said. ""If the government is not reasonable, no one can resist it."" ""China always uses tax issues to cover up political issues. If the government keeps taking revenge on its dissidents with the law, it will only lead the country to its opposite side,"" Ai said.","The artist created the ""Bird's Nest"" stadium for the Olympics .

"(CNN) -- As another Labor Day comes to pass, it's worth reflecting on the legacy of Detroit and its workers. Detroit's bankruptcy is a warning to other cities -- and even states -- that public pension systems are a ticking time bomb with potentially catastrophic consequences. Unfunded pension debt, which in Detroit stands at $3.5 billion and is roughly one-sixth of the city's total debt, is a national problem that has already put other city and state governments on the same road to insolvency. The problem is being ignored amid a rash of finger-pointing and blame-shifting. Few are calling for the kind of pension reforms that could prevent other places from encountering the Motor City's crisis. Quite simply, cities and states need to consider switching from the prevailing ""defined benefit"" pension plans to the ""defined contribution"" plans common in the private sector. This single fix could drastically change the course of a government's financial health by making retirement plan for public-sector workers affordable for taxpayers and predictable for actuaries. First, consider the illness. Detroit's pension debt pales in comparison to the hundreds of billions of dollars that other cities and municipalities owe their pensioners. Opinion: Detroit, the 'used to be' city . New York City, for instance, is much worse off than Detroit, with some $69.9 billion in pension debts. The only difference between the Big Apple and the Motor City is that it the former has a burgeoning economy that masks the looming crisis, keeping the tax bill at bay even as the pension debt grows larger. Worse yet, city pension debt is dwarfed by that of state pension debt. In Pennsylvania, the unfunded total in the state's two pension funds is $47 billion. Next door, New York faces pension debts of $133 billion, while Illinois' clocks in at $167 billion. California is the worst, with $370 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Combined, city and state unfunded pension debts amount to $4.6 trillion, according to an analysis published by State Budget Solutions, a conservative-leaning group. The crisis is recognized by many, but unfortunately, most of the proposed solutions are either shortsighted or just plain silly. In Illinois, for instance, Gov. Pat Quinn at one point suggested a federal bailout of the state's pension debt, a call that has been echoed by many for Detroit. Given the federal government's own fiscal problems, this proposal has been dismissed as irresponsible. Tax increases are another option. One analysis estimated that an average tax hike of $1,385 per household would be required to fix the debt. In my home state of Pennsylvania, we estimate that working families will soon need to contribute an additional $878 per year to pay rising pension costs -- a devastating blow to those still recovering from the recession. While the problem is already enormous, it will only get worse in the coming years unless governments transition to defined contribution systems, like the 401(k). RoboCop creator: Detroit shows the film's fictional future is upon us . Both defined benefit plans -- which purport to guarantee a set income for life -- and 401(k)-type plans carry with them some risk for public employees. In the case of defined benefit plans, Detroit shows that taxpayers may not always be able to pay what the government promises. As for the 401(k), individual retirement investments are subject to the ups and downs of the market, requiring more attention, planning and personal responsibility on the part of the employee. The private sector, being more responsive to market pressures, realized the dangers posed by defined benefit plans and the benefits of 401(k)s long ago and acted accordingly. From 1979 to 2011, the percentage of businesses offering defined benefit plans plummeted from 62% to a mere 7%. Over the same period, defined contribution plans more than quadrupled from 16% to 69%. Businesses made these changes because defined benefit plans are unpredictable, inefficient and too costly in the long run. But cities and states aren't so different: They can pass costs on to taxpayers and their children only for so long, until eventually --as in Detroit -- the bill comes due. Unfortunately, Detroit's public pensioners will likely pay this bill themselves when their pensions are cut in bankruptcy proceedings. They need only look to San Bernardino, California, which received court approval to do just that on August 28. Opinion: How Detroit can rise again . But other cities and states can still prevent the crisis from boxing their own public workers into a similar financial bind. If governments across the nation seize the moment and make the change to a defined contribution system -- as Pennsylvania is poised to do this fall -- they'll save their citizens from a fate like Detroit's, where opportunity and prosperity have been replaced by bankruptcy and hoped-for bailouts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Brouillette.","Matthew Brouillette: Detroit's pension mess is a warning to other cities and states .
Brouillette: Solution is to switch to 401(k) plans which is common in the private sector .
He says market risks of 401(k)s require more personal responsibility for workers .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Jellyfish stings and a summer storm haven't stopped Diana Nyad on her latest attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida, her crew said Monday. A sudden squall blew the swimmer off course Sunday night, according to posts on Nyad's blog. ""There is lots of lightning out there and the storm is blowing right on top of Diana,"" a blog post said early Monday, adding that the swimmer was safe and ""feeling strong."" The weather was calm Monday and there were almost no jellyfish sightings overnight -- a notable difference from the first night of her swim -- according to Mark Sollinger, operations director for the swimmer. In her first night on the water, Nyad was stung by jellyfish on her lips, forehead, hands and neck, her blog said. ""She did the Diana Nyad thing and powered through it,"" Sollinger told CNN on Monday morning. Nyad back in water for Cuba-Florida swim attempt . After jumping into the waters off Havana, Cuba, on Saturday afternoon -- a day earlier than originally planned -- Nyad had swum nearly 40 statute miles as of Monday evening, according to her GPS tracker. The full distance to Key West, Florida, is 103 miles, a trip that had been expected to take Nyad 60 hours if the 62-year-old is successful in her attempt -- her fourth. As of Monday evening she has been swimming 50 hours, the longest time invested in any of the four attempts. She lost six hours to the storm, according to her Twitter feed. Girl, 14, crosses Lake Ontario . She began the swim a day early because the water seemed to be ""fantastic,"" Nyad said at a news conference before beginning the swim. Her Xtreme Dream team ""has been brainstorming and thinking, 'We've got to get out there,'"" she said. Nyad's first attempt to cross the Straits of Florida was in 1978, when rough seas left her battered, delirious and less than halfway toward her goal. She returned to the effort twice last year. She was done in once by an 11-hour asthma attack and was later thwarted by jellyfish stings. Nyad insisted she was ready to try it again now, and acknowledged Friday, ""I'm feeling tremendous inner pressure that this has got to be it, this has got to be the last time."" Diana Nyad making fourth attempt at Cuba-to-Florida swim . She's in the water without a shark cage, relying on electronic shark repellent and a team of divers to keep the predators away. In the 1970s, Nyad won multiple swimming marathons and was one of the first women to swim around the island of Manhattan. She holds the world's record for longest ocean swim -- 102.5 miles from the island of Bimini in the Bahamas to Jupiter, Florida. Nyad says she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about the possibility of swimming across the Straits of Florida. At the time, she was in Cuba on a trip from her home in Florida in the 1950s, before Fidel Castro led a Communist takeover in Cuba and its relations with the United States soured. ""I used to stand on the beach and I said to my mother, 'I wonder if anybody could swim over there,'"" Nyad recalled saying, while pointing to the Keys. In her 60s, she says, she still feels ""vital (and) powerful"" -- and definitely ""not old."" A successful swim ideally will inspire people her age and older not to let their age hinder them, Nyad said. ""When I walk up on that shore in Florida, I want millions of those AARP sisters and brothers to look at me and say, 'I'm going to go write that novel I thought it was too late to do. I'm going to go work in Africa on that farm that those people need help at. I'm going to adopt a child. It's not too late, I can still live my dreams,'"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain called Monday for the United States to lead an international effort to protect the Syrian population by carrying out piloted airstrikes on Syrian government forces. ""Providing military assistance to the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups is necessary, but at this late hour, that alone will not be sufficient to stop the slaughter and save innocent lives,"" the Arizona Republican said in an impassioned speech in the U.S. Senate. ""The only realistic way to do so is with foreign air power."" The goal, added the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, should be to establish and defend safe havens, primarily in northern Syria, where opposition forces could organize their efforts. ""These safe havens could also help the Free Syrian Army and other armed groups in Syria to train and organize themselves into more cohesive and effective military forces, likely with the assistance of foreign partners,"" he said. McCain, a Vietnam War veteran, said that any such effort would require taking out Syria's air-defense systems. ""We're the only ones who can do that,"" he said. But he predicted that some kind of intervention will happen, even if the United States does not act. ""So the real question for U.S. policy is whether we will participate in this next phase of the conflict in Syria, and thereby increase our ability to shape an outcome that is beneficial to the Syrian people, and to us. I believe we must."" McCain's remarks came as opposition activists said another 26 people died Monday in the nationwide campaign by Bashar al-Assad's regime to crush the nearly year-old protests against his rule. The United Nations says at least 7,500 people have died in the crackdown, while opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000. McCain said that any effort must include other nations. ""We should seek the active involvement of key Arab partners,"" such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar ""and willing allies"" in the European Union, NATO and Turkey, he said. McCain acknowledged that his proposal is a risky one, that the opposition lacks cohesion and that the American public has wearied of war, but said that should not dissuade U.S. officials from moving forward. ""There are no ideal options in Syria,"" he said. ""We need to deal with reality as it is, not as we wish it to be."" He added, ""The Syrian people deserve to succeed. Shame on us if we fail to help them."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was noncommittal. ""The secretary is interested in exploring options that could help end the brutal violence in Syria, but he also recognizes that this is an extremely complex crisis,"" a senior Pentagon official said. ""Intervention at this time could very well exacerbate problems inside the country."" McCain's call to arms came as diplomatic efforts were moving. After days of trying to obtain permission from Syrian authorities to travel to the country, Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, will arrive Wednesday in Damascus, she said. Syria decided to permit the two-day planned visit. ""As requested by the secretary-general (Ban Ki-moon), my aim is to urge all parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian relief workers so that they can evacuate the wounded and deliver essential supplies,"" Amos said in a statement. Syria said Amos will arrive Tuesday evening. She will meet with Foreign MInister Walid al-Moallem and ""will pay visits to some areas in Syria,"" state-run news agency SANA reported. Amos was denied access last week by the government, which said it was not a ""suitable time"" to visit, Syrian state-run TV reported. Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general who is now special joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, will fly Saturday to Damascus, an Arab League official said. He will be accompanied by his deputy, former Palestinian Foreign Minister Nasser al-Kidwa. Their goal will be to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to stop the killing, the official said. SANA reported that Syria ""welcomes the visit of Kofi Annan, envoy of the U.N. secretary-general."" The announcement came as government troops broadened their lethal focus from the western city of Rastan, which was pummeled over the weekend, opposition activists said. Complicating the matter is the assertion by several Obama administration officials that the United States sees increasing involvement by and military aid from Iran in the attacks against opposition to the Syrian regime. They say they believe Iran wants to do whatever it can to ensure the survival of the regime of al-Assad, one of Tehran's closest allies. ""The aid from Iran is absolutely on the rise and is of very real concern,"" a U.S. official told CNN. ""Tehran has supplied equipment, weapons and technical assistance -- notably computer monitoring tools -- to help suppress unrest."" Iranian officials have traveled to Damascus to deliver the aid, the official said. A second U.S. official told CNN the assistance includes money and training, as well as weapons and riot gear. Neither of the officials would be identified due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence information. Syria's military has been reduced only slightly by defections to the opposition, U.S. officials say. The latest U.S assessment is that as many as 10,000 Syrian troops may have defected, but that represents fewer than 2% of Syria's more than 600,000-man active-duty and reserve force. The news of diplomatic movement came as the body count continued to mount. At least 19 people were killed on Monday, including two children, according to Local Coordinating Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Most of the dead were in Homs, where 11 people were killed, the LCC said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said families forced to flee during the month-long siege of the city were returning home ""after authorities restored stability and security"" to the neighborhood of Baba Amr, the heart of the uprising. It said security forces had seized a factory for makeshift explosives and rockets, as well as tunnels ""used by the terrorists to smuggle weapons."" Residents of the devastated neighborhood endured another day with scarce or no access to running water, electricity and medical supplies, as the humanitarian toll of the nearly year-old Syrian conflict escalates. Carla Haddad Mardini, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said Monday that aid workers still were not allowed to enter Baba Amr. Mardini said the ICRC and the Syrian Red Crescent were delivering food and hygiene kits in two neighborhoods adjacent to Baba Amr -- al-Tawzee and al-Inshaat. ""We were supposed to be there yesterday but we were not allowed,"" Mardini said. ""A convoy of aid materials arrived today to Homs from Damascus and it contains food supplies to cover the needs of several thousand people."" Another two were killed in Idlib, two more in Daraa and two in the suburbs of Damascus, with one death each in Aleppo and Hama, another flashpoint in the ongoing struggle, the LCC said. CNN cannot independently confirm reports across Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But the vast majority of reports out of Syria indicate al-Assad's forces are slaughtering civilians in opposition hotbeds in an attempt to wipe out dissidents. The Syrian regime has consistently blamed violence on ""armed terrorist groups"" and portrayed its forces as trying to protect the public interest and security. The Syrian government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence, including 12 ""martyrs"" it said were buried Monday. The Syrian regime has ramped up raids and arrests across the country, detaining hundreds of civilians in the past two days, the network said. It said Syrian journalist and blogger Rafaa Masri was among those recently detained. The U.S. Treasury announced Monday it was identifying the Syrian General Organization of Radio and TV as subject to sanctions imposed against Syria in August. ""The General Organization of Radio and TV has served as an arm of the Syrian regime as it mounts increasingly barbaric attacks on its own population and seeks both to mask and legitimize its violence,"" the director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, Adam Szubin, said in a statement. ""By taking this action today, Treasury is sending a clear signal that it stands with the Syrian people. Any individuals or institutions supporting its abhorrent behavior will be targeted and cut off from the international financial system."" As many as 2,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon since Sunday, according to Dana Suleiman, spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR in Beirut. They came from Homs province, she said. Explosions and gunfire could be heard Monday in the Jib Jandali neighborhood of Homs province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Rebel forces said they drove out the army from Rastan -- but acknowledged that most of their fighters had retreated from the besieged area, which is located between the flashpoint cities of Homs and Hama. Capt. Ammar al-Wawi said the Free Syrian Army's withdrawal from Rastan ""was strategic to save the people's lives."" ""We don't want to give the regime any excuse to kill more civilians,"" Wawi said Monday. ""It was a tactical withdrawal in order to create better circumstances and to get ready for the next step."" Though they are outnumbered and out-armed by the Syrian military, members of the Free Syrian Army managed to attack an air force intelligence building in Harasta, near Damascus, with machine guns Sunday night, FSA deputy head Malek al-Kurdi said. Wawi said a growing number of defections from Syrian troops are affecting the government's tactics. ""The regime is avoiding direct confrontations with the FSA fighters, so they attack and bomb the cities using artillery ... and rockets because when they fight us on the ground, we always end up getting more defectors joining our sides,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A man from Uzbekistan living in Alabama has pleaded guilty to charges related to a plot to assassinate President Barack Obama, prosecutors said Friday. Ulugbek Kodirov, 21, faces up to 15 years behind bars after he sought help to either shoot the president or kill him with explosives in a suicide attack, according to a government affidavit. Kodirov pleaded guilty to supporting terrorist activity, threatening to kill the president and illegal possession of an automatic weapon. Lance Bell, his court-appointed attorney, said Kodirov had initially intended to enter a not guilty plea at his arraignment. A source whom Kodirov contacted for help with his plot told authorities that Kodirov supports Islamic extremists, the affidavit says. Authorities say Kodirov stayed in the United States illegally after his student visa was revoked. He was arrested on July 13 at a motel in Leeds, Alabama, after he obtained a machine gun and four disassembled hand grenades from an undercover agent, the Justice Department said. In an affidavit filed that day with a search warrant request for a room at the extended-stay motel -- Kodirov's apparent home -- U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Todd Matney said Kodirov contacted ""an FBI confidential reliable source"" on July 9 and 10 and ""made inquiry regarding possible ways to kill President Obama, including shooting the president from a long distance,"" and asked for help. Not knowing the person he was speaking to was a confidential source for the authorities, ""Kodirov specifically provided information ... pertaining to long-range sniper rifles"" and also asked about using explosives, saying ""that he did not care if he lost his own life killing President Obama,"" Matney said in the affidavit. ""On or about July 11, Kodirov"" told a second confidential source that he wished to kill Obama and asked for help. The second source ""knows Kodirov to be a very strict Muslim, who has previously expressed support for Islamic extremists,"" the affidavit says. The source knows that ""Kodirov views jihadist websites and Internet content"" on a laptop in his residence, the affidavit said. Items to be seized at the residence included computers, mobile phones and documents, the affidavit said. ""There is probable cause to believe"" that documents -- including information about ""possible co-conspirators,"" as well as ""sniper rifles and other long range weaponry, assault rifles, hand guns, explosives, weapons training and tactic manuals, documentation related to assassinations, Jihadist manuals and training manuals"" -- were at the premises, the affidavit said.","Ulugbek Kodirov faces up to 15 years behind bars .

"(CNN) -- Donny Moore watches at least part of every NFL game, every week, every year. After all, it's part of his job. You may not have heard of him. But while Moore is watching the best football players in the world, they're watching him, too. ""I get a lot of feedback from Twitter,"" said Moore, the so-called ratings czar for ""Madden NFL,"" the uber-popular video game franchise that rolled out its 25th annual edition on Tuesday. ""Guys like (Seahawks cornerback) Richard Sherman, (Cowboys wide receiver) Dez Bryant -- these guys all follow me and make sure to give me feedback. ""They always want to know ahead of time: 'What have you got me at?' "" That's because it's Moore's job to come up with the numerical ratings -- from 1 to 100 -- that determine how skilled players, and by extension their teams, are at various facets of the game. It's a unique challenge. Although there are shooter games that emulate real-world weapons and military units, only sports games require their creators to assess, and then re-create, real-life humans as virtual avatars. That's bound to rankle some folks -- if not the NFL players themselves, then ""Madden"" gamers who are often their most rabid fans. By most accounts, though, Moore and his team at EA Sports, publisher of the ""Madden"" series, do a good job. ""EA is not just pulling numbers from a hat,"" said T.J. Lauerman, host of That Sports Gamer Show. ""Gamers are uptight about their favorite team's ratings because ... they see their team's running back make one great spin move that completely fakes out a defender, and when they try it in a game, they fail. They look up the player attributes and realize he has a 64 Spin Move, then they get angry and tweet Donny Moore."" That's all part of the job, says Moore. ""If you're a Falcons fan who was mad some Falcons were underrated, we're probably doing our job,"" he said. ""Everybody can't be a 99."" Moore has a lot of raw data to work with. In addition to on-field stats, there are 40-yard-dash times, scouting-combine scores for rookies, injury reports and the like. And a whole host of websites have sprung up to hyperanalyze performance, breaking down stats into super-specific categories, like ""downfield passing completion percentage."" But football is also a game of intangibles. Sometimes it takes watching a player accomplish things on the field that the raw data don't show. Moore is thankful for Madden's weekly online updates (a feature that earlier versions obviously didn't have), which let him tweak player stats based on their performance throughout the season. He cites Alfred Morris, the lightly regarded sixth-round pick out of Florida Atlantic University who ended up tallying 1,613 yards and 13 touchdowns last year for the Washington Redskins. ""There was not a whole lot of buzz around him, really; he ran a terribly slow time at the combo,"" Moore said. ""Then, he started blowing up."" Morris started the season on ""Madden"" with a 65 rating. By the end of the year, thanks to weekly updates, he'd risen to an 89. ""We were wrong about him to begin with, but the whole league was,"" he said. ""(Redskins head coach) Mike Shanahan was probably surprised. Pleasantly surprised."" After actually watching on-field performance, Moore said, his best tool for adjusting player ratings may be those same fans who argue with him online. He adopted a stock response to fans who thought a player on their favorite team should have his numbers moved up. He says "" 'OK, give me five up and five down,' "" he said. ""When you made the fans give you the guys who should go down, that was some of the best feedback ever."" But it's always more amusing when it's the players themselves complaining, especially when it's over something relatively ridiculous. Every player gets a rating in every category, meaning kickers are rated for Trucking -- the ability to bull over defenders -- and 300-pound defensive linemen get Spectacular Catch scores. But that didn't sit well when New York Jets defensive back Kerry Rhodes saw his Throwing Power rating of 21 and 23 for Throwing Accuracy -- a full 17 points behind Nick Mangold, a Jets offensive lineman. Rhodes played some quarterback in college and high school and posted a good-natured video titled ""WTF Madden!"" In it, he and Mangold go through a series of passing drills, in which he predictably beats his 307-pound teammate. And it worked. ""After that, I bumped up Kerry Rhodes' power to way outdistance Mangold,"" Moore said. ""But it was still terrible. You'd never play him at quarterback."" That's a silly example, but illustrates a bigger point: There are a lot of eyeballs on the best-selling ""Madden"" game series. Moore has worked at EA since 1999, when he was hired for the ""Madden"" testing group after winning an ""NCAA '99 Football"" tournament. He says that, for him, making the game as close as possible to the real thing is serious business. ""I treat it with a lot of pride,"" he said. ""I know what's at stake here. I just want to get it right."" CNN contributor Larry Frum contributed to this report.","Donny Moore is the ""ratings czar"" for ""Madden NFL 25""

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal watchdog took a bite out of military hospitals this month, warning it is impossible to tell if some doctors are licensed, properly trained and evaluated in their specialties. ""Army oversight and physician credentialing and privileging requirements were not sufficient to assure that MTFs (Medical Treatment Facilities) fully complied with existing requirements or completely documented information needed to support credentialing and privileging decisions,"" said the new General Accountability Office report. ""Specifically, Army Medical Command's oversight of individual MTFs' reviews of physicians' applications for privileges was insufficient to identify the instances of noncompliance and incomplete documentation,"" the report added. In some cases the military had failed to check properly on the legitimacy of doctors' licenses to practice medicine, the report alleged. ""Some credentials files we reviewed lacked complete documentation to show that MTFs had primary source verified all of the physician's state medical licenses, including seven instances involving a physician's only active medical license,"" the report says. Primary source verification of credentials means they are verified with a specific credential's source. Congress called for the report in the aftermath of the Fort Hood, Texas, shooting in November 2009, for which an Army psychiatrist is charged with 13 murders. Congress and the military have examined how Maj. Nidal Hasan was trained, evaluated and promoted as a military physician. Nine military officials, including doctors, were disciplined for their actions or failures in the Hasan case. He faces a court-martial, with a possible death penalty, in March. The GAO report cast a wider net and urged the Defense Department to speed up its efforts to revise and standardize reviews of doctors' credentials. And it singles out the Army for problems at its facilities. ""Based on our review of 150 credentials files at the five Army MTFs we selected for our review, we found that none of the five Army MTFs fully complied with certain Army physician credentialing and privileging requirements,"" the GAO report said. ""Specifically, we found that the selected MTFs did not fully comply with the Army's requirement to primary source verify all state medical licenses at the time of privileging and at renewal."" In a response included in the report, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Jonathan Woodson wrote the department is progressing with standardization and centralization of credential files and improving how doctors can apply for and renew privileges to practice at military hospitals. But the military warned that its centralized system would be delayed ""without adequate funding."" The report cited over-reliance of so-called peer reviews, especially in cases where coworkers might have only a limited familiarity with a doctor. ""In one file we reviewed, both peer recommendations were from individuals who indicated they had limited knowledge of the physician's clinical competence,"" the report says. ""The department chief later told us that this physician was terminated within the first three months due to issues with the physician's competence and professionalism."" In another instance, a doctor had problems with errors in prescriptions, above what the hospital allowed. However, this was not reflected in the doctor's file. And the physician's department chief ""was not aware of the negative prescription days but was 'not at all surprised' because there were current concerns about this physician,"" the report said.","Congress called for the General Accountability Office report after the Fort Hood shootings .

"(CNN) -- Two children died Saturday in the suburbs of the Syrian capital -- not because of guns, bombs or other weapons, but because of malnutrition, activists and an opposition group said. The two boys suffered from marasmus, a type of acute malnutrition that can very quickly lead to death if not treated, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Ibrahim Khalil was 4; Ammar Arafa was even younger, but his exact age wasn't known, opposition activist Ahmed Al-Muadami said from the town, Moadamiyet al-Sham, in the Damascus suburbs. Moadamiyet al-Sham was one of the areas affected by the alleged chemical weapons attack August 21. It was the first town United Nations inspectors visited this week to gather evidence about the attack and speak to the wounded. Al-Muadami said the town has been under siege by Syrian troops since last November and that the situation there is ""disastrous."" ""We ran out of food supplies and we cannot get anything into the town,"" he said. Doctors lacked the medicine and necessary nutrients to treat the children because of the siege, the Syrian Observatory said. ""We haven't seen a piece of bread for six months now,"" said another resident, Abu Alnour. ""We went through our food supplies, local produce and cattle."" He said government checkpoints and snipers are blocking all the roads leading into the town and are not allowing anything in or out. The Syrian government typically calls rebels ""armed terrorists."" ""The Red Crescent tried to send an aid shipment into the town in early July but the government forces denied them access, and that was the last aid shipment we heard about,"" Al-Muadami said. The barrier and checkpoint at Moadamiyet al-Sham is well known in the region and is staffed by security forces, militiamen and regime loyalists, the opposition Syrian Network for Human Rights says. Some 12,000 people in the town are now in desperate need of food items and medicine, he said. Those who are seriously injured or sick are trapped. Attack at Syria funeral: 'Children's bodies were maimed and burnt,' witness says . The town has been without power for 10 months, and residents are suffering water shortages because shelling has destroyed water pipes, he said. ""If we were able to get those two children out of the town to be treated in a hospital, they would have been alive now,"" Al-Muadami said. Videos purportedly showing the boys shows their ribs protruding and their limbs stick-thin. One video is said to show Ibrahim while still alive, on respiratory support; two others show Ibrahim and Ammar lying dead on their hospital beds. Al-Muadami said activists in the town filmed the videos and posted them online. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos or reports of violence, as the Syrian government has restricted access to international journalists. The International Committee of the Red Cross on Thursday reported acute shortages of vital medical supplies, food and water in a number of areas that have been sealed off for months, where the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have not been given access. ""In large parts of rural Damascus, for example, people are dying because they lack medical supplies and because there are not enough medical personnel to attend to them. They also go hungry because aid can't get through to them on a regular basis,"" said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC's delegation in Syria. The group said more than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed since the fighting began more than two years ago. Hundreds of people die every day, it said. Across the country Saturday, 39 people died amid shelling, air strikes, cluster bombs and missiles, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Ten children were among the dead, the group said, but it wasn't clear whether that number included the two boys in Moadamiyet al-Sham. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Activists and an opposition group say they died of malnutrition .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A U.S. government panel listed 13 countries Friday as ""egregious"" violators of religious freedom.

It recommended that the Obama administration designate them as ""countries of particular concern"" or CPC. The group has issued a watch list that includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela, countries that don't rise to the level of a CPC but need to be monitored. ""Unfolding events in Pakistan make clear the relevance of this theme to the 2009 Annual Report. At the time of writing, emboldened Taliban-associated extremists had advanced to within 60 miles of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad,"" the report said.

"(CNN) -- Yemen says al Qaeda was behind a suicide bombing Sunday that killed four South Korean tourists, according to the Daily Yemen Post. The city of Shibam is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

"(CNN) -- British cycling chief Brian Cookson announced Tuesday he would challenge Irishman Pat McQuaid for the top job at the UCI -- promising to clean up the sport in the wake of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal. Cookson, 61, told CNN that he was standing for election as president of the world governing body because he was unhappy with its failure to deal with the issues raised since Armstrong made his public admission of guilt last year. ""We are still mired in controversy from the Lance Armstrong era,"" said Cookson. ""We need to clean that up and deal with historic accusations."" Cookson has been credited with turning around the fortunes of the British federation, which he rescued from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s. Latterly, riders such as reigning Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish and the track cycling team led by the now retired Chris Hoy, have catapulted British cycling to worldwide prominence. Cookson, while quick to give credit to others for recent triumphs, believes that record will strengthen his claims come the election at the UCI annual congress in Florence, Italy in September. ""I'm very proud of the success we have achieved with British cycling and not in a way which generates conflict which seems to the UCI's modus operandi for the last several years,"" he said. ""I believe there is a massive appetite for change from people out there who are dissatisfied with the way the international cycling union (UCI) is running the sport."" Cookson, who has sat on the UCI management board with McQuaid since 2009, said he had no qualms about opposing him now. ""I've supported Pat in the past, but I haven't undermined him and now we are in an election period you need to stand up and be counted."" Cookson acknowledged that progress had been made since McQuaid took over the presidency in 2006, but was impatient for further reforms. ""I want to see an organization fit for a modern era which is accountable and which people can trust."" McQuaid and the Swiss-based UCI has come under intense spotlight since the publication of a damning report from the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) last October, which laid bare the doping culture of Armstrong and other leading riders. Armstrong was forced to own up in a live television appearance with Oprah Winfrey and was subsequently stripped of his seven Tour de France wins. Question marks were also raised about the UCI's role during Armstrong's era of domination and allegations have been made it was complicit in covering up positive tests. It has also been at loggerheads with the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) over the establishment of an independent commission, which would have attempted to get full disclosure of the extent of doping in cycling, but was disbanded by the UCI before it could report. Cookson said his first priority would be to restore confidence and credibility in the sport. ""We must also urgently carry out a fully independent investigation into the allegations of corruption in this area which have so damaged the UCI's reputation,"" he said in his official supporting statement on the British Cycling website. Despite the controversies, the 63-year-old McQuaid has put himself forward as president for a third time and was formally nominated by the Swiss federation last month. In a statement released at the time, McQuaid said he stood by his record: ""I put myself forward to serve another term as UCI president on my record of developing the sport throughout the world and on combating the scourge of doping in cycling,"" he said. ""I have received a wealth of letters from national federations all around the world urging me to stand for president again."" McQuaid and Cookson are the only two publicly declared and nominated candidates at present, but former Tour de France champion Greg Lemond -- a fierce critic the current president -- has also hinted he may run for the job.","Battle ahead for top job in world cycling .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Republican congressman who unexpectedly participated in President Obama's health care speech in 2009 by heckling the chief executive says he will be flanked by two Democrats on Tuesday night to show his willingness to work with the opposition party. Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted ""You lie!"" during the president's address on health care in September 2009. The chief executive had just denied that illegal immigrants were covered in his proposed health care plan. Wilson apologized for his outburst that night, but came under widespread criticism from both parties for what was seen as disrespect. In a written statement at the time, Wilson said, ""This evening, I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill."" Wilson's statement continued, ""While I disagree with the president's statement, my comments were inappropriate and regrettable. I extend sincere apologies to the president for this lack of civility."" On Monday, Wilson spokesman Neal Patel told CNN that the congressman will be flanked during this year's State of the Union address by Democratic Reps. Susan Davis of California and Madeleine Z.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After years of struggling with depression, Nikki de Toledo killed herself with a prescription drug overdose when she was 27. She didn't leave a suicide note, but she did leave her 8-year-old son, Kevin. Kevin's grandparents, Ginette and AndrÃ© de Toledo, immediately took over custody, because Kevin's father lived abroad and had never been a part of his life. It wasn't an easy transition, though. ""It was a very difficult time for my parents because they weren't able to grieve,"" said Nikki's sister, Sylvie. ""They were immediately responsible for raising an 8-year-old who also was grieving in his own way. And it was different than the way my parents were grieving. It was a pretty tough time for our family."" It's often the grandparents who step up when a parent dies or is unable to take care of a child for other reasons, such as incarceration, abuse or mental illness. In 2011, there were at least 2.7 million grandparents raising a grandchild in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. But the sudden shift in responsibility can be incredibly stressful. Grandparents may be living on fixed incomes, and the additional dependents can cause costs to soar. There's also an emotional adjustment when an empty nest is no longer empty. ""When that call comes ... your whole life changes,"" Sylvie de Toledo said. ""It's turned inside out and upside down."" De Toledo said she watched her parents, then in their mid-50s, struggle with their new responsibilities. It affected their marriage and their health. Also, like many children who lose a parent, Kevin had emotional issues that followed him into his teenage years. ""Kevin was a difficult teenager,"" said de Toledo, a 58-year-old social worker. ""The trauma and grief and loss of a parent abandoning you, so to speak ... it's a huge, huge loss."" Around the same time, de Toledo started noticing more of her work clients -- children and grandparents -- dealing with similar challenges. ""The most common thread was that they all felt alone and isolated,"" she said. ""They didn't know anyone in the same situation that they were in."" Determined to bring some of these families together, de Toledo began holding a support group for about 10 of them. When attendance began to skyrocket, she started her own nonprofit, Grandparents as Parents, to help more people cope with the process. Today, more than a quarter-century later, there are 20 support groups across Los Angeles, and the nonprofit works with more than 3,000 families a year, providing them with financial assistance, legal advice and emotional support. More than 90% of the caregivers are grandparents, but the nonprofit also assists aunts, uncles, siblings and close friends who have stepped up to care for children when their biological parents can't. ""We are a one-stop shop for relative caregivers,"" de Toledo said. ""So many times, the families are completely overwhelmed. The kids come to them with a dirty diaper and a T-shirt that's way too big for them."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . When someone calls for help, de Toledo is usually the first person they talk to. She listens to their story and then helps them prioritize their needs so the situation isn't so overwhelming. ""It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle,"" she said. ""You have to figure out how to put the pieces back together to build a whole, happy, healthy individual child."" Lourdes Aguylar called seven years ago when her daughter dropped off three children ages 3, 9, and 10 months. Aguylar received immediate assistance -- food, toys and clothes -- and with the group's help she later became legal guardian of the children. Over the years, the group has also helped provide the children with psychological, educational and medical support. But perhaps most importantly, Aguylar said, they have become part of a larger family -- a group of caregivers and children who back each other. ""You know you're not the only one,"" she said. More on CNN: Grandparents get tech-savvy to keep in touch . In addition to weekly support groups, there are monthly picnics for families and friends as well as opportunities for the families to attend events together, such as the theater, amusement parks and sporting events. The nonprofit gets its money through grants, private donations and corporate sponsors, but it also helps grandparents apply for government assistance. de Toledo said many grandparents don't realize there are special programs that may be available to them. ""We have seen countless families who have maxed out credit cards and used all of their savings before they even ask for help,"" she said. Even if they do know there is help out there, many don't know how to navigate the system and may need help using online systems or filling out paperwork. So de Toledo and her staff or volunteers will walk them through the process. Louise Reaves, 60, got in touch with de Toledo to help her navigate the court system and get custody and benefits for her young granddaughter. Six years ago, Reaves' daughter dropped the baby off at her house, promising to return when she got back on her feet; she hasn't come back. ""Sylvie was able to walk me through everything that I needed,"" Reaves said. ""I was able to get medical assistance for (my granddaughter). I was able to get clothing for her ... rent. They helped me get on my feet where I could help myself."" She credits the group with keeping her family together. ""Without me joining (the group), I don't know where we would be,"" she said. ""I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know if (my granddaughter) would be in a group home or a foster home or what. It was rough."" More on CNN: Caregiver lives rerouted, enriched by aging parents . De Toledo said her group has kept thousands of children from entering the foster care system, and they've also kept siblings from being separated. ""We've literally saved families,"" she said. But the true heroes, she said, are the caregivers. ""It's really the grandparents and the relatives who are doing this that deserve the recognition for putting their own lives on hold,"" she said. ""I just was able to plant a seed with something that happened in my own family. ... ""From a family tragedy, something wonderful has happened."" Want to get involved?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's life began on August 29, 1958, as the seventh child in a family crowded into a tiny home in Gary, Indiana. His mother remembers ""a sweet little child"" who showed unusual empathy for others and who was born to sing and dance. Katherine Jackson, 83, shared intimate stories about her son's early days when she testified earlier in the trial of her lawsuit against AEG Live, the concert promoter she accuses of liability in his death four years ago. Her lawyers are asking a juror to award Jackson's mother and three children at least $1.6 billion to replace the lost income they argue he would have earned touring the world if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts on June 25, 2009. Jackson would have just completed a world tour of his ""This Is It"" shows and likely would have begun making movies with his children Prince, Paris and Blanket if he had lived to see this 55th birthday Thursday, according to testimony in the trial. Nurse details Michael Jackson's fatal search for sleep . Michael Jackson's humble start as the son of a steel mill worker in a large family is a remarkable contrast to the pop icon who spent lavishly, but also set world records for giving to charity. Their first home had just two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a small utility room for the washing machine and freezer. Michael and his four older brothers slept in stacked bunk beds in one bedroom, the parents in the other, while the daughters slept in the living room, the Jackson matriarch testified in an earlier court session. The mother made some of their clothes, watched newspapers ads for sales and visited the Salvation Army store for shoes. ""We made it that way,"" living pay day to pay day, she said. When father Joe Jackson was laid off from his steel mill job he would go out of the city to farms to pick vegetables that his wife would can and store. ""Every year we would buy a quarter of a cow or half of a cow and keep it in the freezer,"" she said. ""And that's how we survived."" Young Michael saved his ""little pennies and nickels"" to buy candy and cookies, but he wouldn't eat it all, his mother said. ""He liked to play 'store man.' He would take it and put it and set up a little store, and all the kids in the neighborhood would come and buy from him, and he felt like he was the store man."" When older brother Marlon became ill, 3-year-old Michael held his hand and cried, she said. Michael's musical talents were obvious at a very early age. ""He was born that way,"" she said. ""When all the kids were dancing around, he was in my arms, and he couldn't be still. He was dancing, too, to the music. And when he started to walk, he would still dance."" She's told the story of Michael's interaction to her ""old, rickety washing machine, a Maytag."" ""It would make a rhythm noise, like 'squeaky, squeaky, katum, katum,' something like that, and he would be down there dancing, sucking his bottle to the squeaking of the washer,"" she said. ""And I knew he was going to be -- he just loved music, and he loved to dance."" The family's old television set helped bring the brothers together as a singing group, she said. ""Sometimes it would break down,"" his mother said. And sometimes they would not have money to get it repaired. ""And that's when the children first started singing. We would sing together, sing old country songs, folk songs."" Michael was five when he joined his brothers in talent contests at local high schools. ""They had got so that they won all the contests -- every time there was a contest,"" she said. When their group needed a name for an advertisement, their mother came up with ""The Jackson Brothers 5."" But the woman who was writing the ad suggested she ""cut that a little short and name it 'The Jackson 5,'"" she said. ""And I thought it sounded better."" Michael's first solo performance was when he sang ""Climb Every Mountain"" in a kindergarten program when he was five, she said. ""I was so nervous when he walked out on the stage, because he was always shy. He started singing the song, and he sang it with such clarity and didn't miss -- not flat or anything."" His paternal grandfather, who was in the audience ""cried like a baby, looked around, and I was crying, too,"" she said. ""He got a standing ovation for his performance and he wasn't nervous. I was shocked. I think he must feel more at home on stage."" Older brother Jermaine was the Jackson 5's lead singer from the start, but their mother told her husband it should be Michael. ""I told him Jermaine needed help, and I told him Michael could help him,"" she said. ""He didn't believe me, so I forced him to listen. And that's how Michael got the job."" The boys rehearsed in their living room. ""We would push all the furniture back on the walls, and they would dance and set up the drums and things and rehearse right there,"" she said. Instead of moving to a larger house as the family grew, they used any extra money to buy musical instruments. Katherine Jackson made their performance costumes. Michael was nine when Motown signed the Jackson 5 to a recording contract and moved the boys to California, she said, . While much is made about Michael Jackson missing out on a normal childhood because of the constant touring and recording, his mother's stories suggest he always found a way to have fun. Jackson recorded the title song for the 1972 film ""Ben"" -- a story about a young boy and his rat friend.""He liked that song because he liked rats,"" his mother said. ""I can remember a story that we went to Beverly Hills to have dinner and we were eating. Michael kept pulling his coat up and putting crumbs into his pocket. I said 'What are you doing?' and he held it up and he had a rat in his pocket. He was feeding it. I was really upset with him."" Katherine Jackson was not in court Thursday to hear the day's testimony because she was in Gary for her son's birthday celebration.","Katherine Jackson shared stories of her son's early days in testimony earlier in the trial .

"(CNN) -- Kremlin critic and Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been convicted of misappropriating $500,000 worth of state-owned timber. A court freed him from detention on July 19, pending an appeal of the court's ruling against him. Navalny has been campaigning for the Moscow mayoralty -- officially registering as a candidate the day before his conviction -- and there have been allegations his trial has been politically-motivated. Russian authorities insist that is not the case. LATEST: ""I'll win Moscow,"" says Navalny . Who is Alexei Navalny? Navalny is a corruption fighting lawyer who famously branded the ruling United Russia party -- founded by President Vladimir Putin -- ""the party of crooks and thieves."" He has been a prominent organizer of street protests and has attacked corruption in Russian government, using his blog and social media. In a 2011 article entitled ""Russia rising: The Blogger Who Is Putin's Greatest Challenger,"" TIME magazine's Simon Shuster said before 2010 Navalny had been known ""only to a fairly small online community."" But in November 2010, Shuster said, Navalny ""blew the whistle"" on what he said was a $4 billion embezzlement scheme at the state-run oil pipeline operator Transneft -- a claim vigorously denied by the head of the company and Russian president Vladimir Putin. In January 2011, Transneft's boss branded the claims inaccurate, according to Reuters news agency. And in September that year, state-run news agency RIA Novosti quoted President Putin as saying no crimes had been committed by Transneft. ""The leaked documents he presented as evidence, which he posted on his blog, caused a sensation in the Russian and international press, and Navalny soon became known as Russia's top crusader against corruption,"" wrote TIME's Shuster. OPINION: Putin a hypocrite on Snowden, Navalny . In 2012, TIME included Navalny on its list of ""The World's 100 Most Influential people."" Russian chess legend and opposition activist Garry Kasparov wrote the entry on Navalny -- then 35 -- saying he was -- ""at the vanguard"" of data dissidents. How much of a threat does he pose to Putin/Kremlin? CNN's Moscow correspondent Phil Black said Navalny's passion, charisma, fierce language and commitment to fighting corruption inspired many to join him in protesting on the streets. Maria Lipman, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank, said during the 2011 and 2012 protests over alleged fraud in Russia's parliamentary and presidential elections Navalny was ""by far the most popular figure."" ""Navalny quite bravely took on some of the very influential people in Russia,"" she said. Lipman said Navalny was a fearless and very talented public politician who had managed to ""beat the system that Putin built"" to keep outsiders out of the political framework. Navalny presented ""a serious political challenge as a result of his unique personality and his amazing energy,"" she said. ""He was able, as a result, to build a following."" ""He's become a popular figure but he cannot be described as the leader of the opposition,"" she said. ""He is the most prominent civic figure."" What are the details of his case? A court in the city of Kirov on July 18 found Navalny guilty of misappropriating about $500,000 in a lumber deal when he was an adviser to the Kirov region's governor. It sentenced him to five years in prison. Was the verdict expected? The day before his trial began in April this year, Navalny told CNN's Phil Black he knew he would be convicted and that it was likely he would be jailed. ""I've been investigating corruption in state-run companies by government officials for the last six years. These people steal billions. I'm making it harder for them to steal and they understand my anti-corruption work is a threat."" Asked if he believed he had any chance of winning the case he replied: ""Of course not. They didn't fabricate this case to allow that and it's obvious for me it's going to be a guilty verdict."" Why would he be jailed unless he was guilty? The court found Navalny guilty but his lawyers are appealing the verdict. Russian law forbids convicted criminals running for political office. Talking to Phil Black before the trial began, Navalny said: ""It's true one of Putin's goals in this trial is to stop me from being involved in politics but this law only exists in Putin's system and our goal is to destroy Putin's system."" Lipman said she also believed the verdict was politically motivated. ""The government is using law enforcement and judiciary machines to lock up a man who is a political challenge. There is hardly any doubt that the verdict in the courtroom was not made by the judge himself,"" she said. ""There is every reason to suggest that the verdict announced on July 18 in Kirov was a decision made somewhere very high in the Kremlin executive."" Russian authorities have always insisted Navalny's prosecution is not political. But a senior investigator recently admitted his colleagues had fast tracked their work in Navalny's case because of his criticism of Russia's political system. ""The suspect is doing his best to draw attention to himself; one could even say he is teasing the authorities,"" said Vladimir Markin, the spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, in April, according to the Washington Post. ""So interest in his past grew and the process of bringing him out in the open naturally sped up."" President Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told CNN that Putin had not followed Navalny's trial. So then why has he been released? When Navalny arrived in court the day after his conviction, he found the prosecutor who had argued he should be sent to prison arguing instead for his release pending appeal, so that he could continue campaigning for the Moscow mayoralty. Navalny quipped that the court needed to establish the identity of the prosecutor because he may have been replaced by a double. Lipman described Navalny's release as an ""amazing twist."" She said that his release was unlikely to have been as a result of protest action after the verdict was announced. The protest hadn't been nationwide and involved just a few thousand people, she said. ""It was not enough to force the authorities to retreat. Also, the prosecutors' request that he be released ... was filed even before there was a big crowd in the streets. It's really hard to believe. ""It could be the result of some sort of intrigue -- rivalries, tensions at the very top of the Russian political elite."" But she said any political involvement would be denied by the government. ""Their response, invariably, is, it's up to the court to decide,"" she said. ""Of course they would never admit how they interfere."" RIA Novosti reported that the trial judge ""repeatedly rejected claims over his partiality and denied several motions to have him replaced."" Will the conviction affect his bid to become mayor of Moscow? Lipman said that if Navalny's conviction was upheld by a higher court, his name would be unable to appear on an electoral ballot. However, she said he could campaign in the meantime. ""After his release yesterday he can continue running. The idea is that now he is at large up until his lawyers send in an appeal in a higher court re-examine his case. He remains at large and his verdict is not effective,"" she said. She said there was ""good reason to predict"" that the high court would uphold the verdict before the end of the campaign for the September 8 election. ""He is still on a hook. In a theory, this higher court could make a ruling even earlier and effectively terminate his campaign."" Speaking to reporters outside court after he was released, Navalny said he would return to Moscow to discuss his next steps with his staff, RIA Novosti said. ""Regarding my participation in the elections, I am not some kind of a kitten or a puppy to whom they first say it can't participate in the elections and then they say, 'let's release him for a while so he can participate in the elections,'"" he said. Once in Moscow, he will decide whether to boycott the election or continue his campaign, he said, according to the news agency. ""We'll discuss it with the staff and with the volunteers. For now, I will stay a candidate, I am not retreating."" How has Navalny's conviction been received in Russia? Lipman said Navalny's conviction was not likely to cost Putin any support. ""I don't think it will affect his standing in the eyes of the conservative majority. The status quo is suspicious of any troublemaker,"" she said. ""The minority of more modernized urban Russians -- people who resent the government for being lawless -- people likely to sympathise with Navalny -- I think they will be even angrier. ""The rift between them and the government will become even broader, but we are talking about a minority."" What about the rest of the world? The day Navalny was convicted, the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, called the trial a sham. And former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement saying the case ""unfortunately confirms that we do not have an independent judiciary."" Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division, said she was not surprised by the guilty verdict but was shocked by the five-year prison sentence. ""Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger,"" she said. Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, John Dalhuisen, said, ""This was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial. The case was twice closed for lack of evidence of a crime, before being reopened on the personal instruction of Russia's top investigator."" But Lipman pointed out the world had also expressed outrage over Russia's crackdown on protesters in 2011 and 2012. ""I don't think it has an effect. Not on previous occasions and not this time.""","Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been convicted of misappropriation .

"(CNN) -- Entering this season Petra Kvitova had reached the quarterfinals at every grand slam except for the U.S. Open. She memorably won Wimbledon in 2011 to open her account at majors, sweeping past Maria Sharapova in the final, and achieved semifinals at the Australian Open and French Open last year. Her drought, however, in New York persists after the Czech managed just three games in the third round against little-known American Alison Riske and exited 6-3 6-0. The outcome was better for another Wimbledon champion, Rafael Nadal, who cruised in straight sets against Ivan Dodig. Kvitova has found it difficult playing in hot and humid conditions in the U.S. in the past because she suffers from asthma and this week the lefty revealed she had been battling a virus and fever. Following a close first set, Kvitova claimed a mere 15 points in the second. ""My body wouldn't let me fight,"" Kvitova told reporters. Riske, ranked at a career-best 81st, reached the fourth round at a grand slam for the first time, much to the delight of her home crowd. Her best results previously had come on grass, advancing to the semifinals at a tour event in Birmingham, England in 2010 and 2013 -- both times as a qualifier. But she was in good form ahead of the meeting with Kvitova, upsetting former Wimbledon semifinalist Tsvetana Pironkova in the first round and German Mona Barthel in the second. Christina McHale almost joined her compatriot Riske in the fourth round, serving for the match against former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic. But Ivanovic broke back and prevailed 4-6 7-5 6-4. Second-seed Victoria Azarenka dropped the first set to France's Alize Cornet in a tiebreak before going through 6-7 6-3 6-2. Simona Halep, whose four titles in 2013 place her second behind only Serena Williams on the WTA tour, produced the most emphatic score in the women's draw Saturday when she thumped former top-10 player Maria Kirilenko 6-1 6-0 in under an hour. Kirilenko wasn't only disappointed with her performance -- she didn't like having to provide a sample to drug testers post match. ""I just can (laugh) about my game today!"" Kirilenko, engaged to National Hockey League superstar Alex Ovechkin, began on Twitter. ""Going to the doping control, maybe I have something after a 0-6! Haha sick of it!!! 1000 times doping doping."" Nadal lost on hard courts to the big-serving Dodig in Canada two years ago but wasn't broken in his 6-4 6-3 6-3 win Saturday. In remaining unbeaten on hard courts in 2013, he moved closer to a potential quarterfinal showdown with Roger Federer. Nada's fellow Spaniard, David Ferrer, was slumping before the U.S. Open but the tenacious fourth seed progressed to the fourth round after a four-set win over Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan.","Petra Kvitova, the 2011 Wimbledon champion, won three games in the third round .

"(CNN) -- With Amazon unveiling its much-anticipated Kindle Fire tablet computer Wednesday, we may finally have a real tablet war on our hands. In the nearly 18 months since the iPad went on sale, tablet rivals have come and gone. But Apple's device has remained dominant. Amazon's new entry, though, might be different. Instead of crafting an iPad carbon copy and asking consumers to choose between them, they've pushed out a stripped-down and simplified device that sells for much less than the iPad 2 while skimping on some of that tablet's features. If you're in the market for a tablet, though, here's the real question: Which one, if either, is right for you? We can't say for sure, since we haven't gotten our hands on one yet. (Amazon didn't let reporters demo them at Wednesday's launch event.) Here's a look at how the two devices stack up in some key areas. Price . Apple's higher prices make the Fire's price tag look like, well, a fire sale. At $199, the Kindle Fire will be a full $300 cheaper than the lowest-priced iPad 2. That's possibly an easier entry point for folks who are intrigued by the iPad but can't justify spending $500 for a portable computer when they already have a smartphone and a laptop. One reason iPad competitors have had a hard time catching on is that, to make a profit, they're priced about the same as Apple's hit device, which costs $499 to $829, depending on storage capacity and 3G capability. That being the case, the majority of consumers have stuck with the market leader. For evidence of the power of a lower price point, though, look no further than HP's ""dead"" TouchPad tablet, which the company announced it was discontinuing last month. The company slashed prices to $99 for a 16GB model and $149 for a 32GB one, and they suddenly flew off the shelves (so much so that HP actually made more to fill the demand). The Fire's $199 sticker may appeal to parents who want to get their child a tablet but hesitate at shelling out $500 or more for something that might get dropped into a puddle. Screen size . There's a pretty clear difference here. The iPad has a 9.7-inch display, compared with a 7-inch screen on the Kindle Fire. That screen size is probably a big reason Amazon can offer its tablet at $199 -- touchscreens are expensive to make. But with smartphone screen sizes inching ever-bigger (the just-announced Samsung Galaxy Note will clock in at 5.3 inches) the Fire ends up being a bit of a ""tweener."" That's probably no big deal for some users. But if watching movies or playing games is a big reason you want a tablet, bigger is clearly better. On the flip side, the Fire is smaller and 50% lighter than the iPad, and Amazon says it's ""easy to hold in one hand."" This may appeal to some users who want to take their tablet on the go. Features . The Kindle Fire is definitely scaled back from the iPad 2 in several ways. The Fire doesn't have a camera. For shutterbugs, that might not be such a big deal, as many folks find it easier to shoot photos on smartphones than tablets anyway. But it also means apps like Apple's video chat service, FaceTime, won't be replicated on Amazon's offering. The Fire also doesn't have a microphone, so voice recording and Skype-style chat are out. And the Fire is Wi-Fi-only, which means users will be able to surf the Web and download content (like books from Amazon) only when they have a connection. The iPad also comes in 3G models, albeit at a higher price. (The 3G version of the low-end 16GB iPad 2 jumps to $629, not including the monthly data plan). The Kindle Fire promises eight hours of battery life, as opposed to 10 hours for the iPad 2. Finally, the Fire has only 8GB of storage (compared with the iPad 2's bottom end at 16GB) but makes up for it by offering free cloud storage on Amazon's gargantuan bank of servers. Apps . The Fire will run on a modified version of Google's Android operating system. That means users will have access to several thousand apps in Amazon's app store for Android. The iPad, of course, has access to more than 425,000 apps in the Apple Store. So, advantage iPad on this one. Amazon has, of course, optimized the Fire for its own content, like streaming movies, e-books and music. It also will come with a 30-day free look at Amazon Prime, the company's premier service that offers free two-day shipping of products from Amazon.com and free streaming from a library of more than 11,000 movies and TV shows. Bottom line . On the surface, both tablets appear to be good options for people who just want a basic portable computer for light Web surfing and content consumption. The iPad has a proven track record and more bells and whistles, although that $199 Kindle Fire price is sure to tempt consumers. The Fire doesn't go on sale until November 15, so you'll have plenty of time to read reviews of the device by then.","Amazon unveils its Kindle Fire tablet, a rival to Apple's iPad 2 .

"(CNN) -- It may have been a vicious murder or the unintentional result of a lover's quarrel. Either way, the death of a Texas college professor stands out for the weapon the killer allegedly used: one of her own stilettos. Ana Lilia Trujillo, 44, is charged with murder for striking Alf Stefan Andersson ""with a deadly weapon, namely a shoe,"" Houston police say in the official complaint against her. Andersson, a research professor from the University of Houston, had 10 puncture wounds on his head -- some as deep as an inch and a half -- and 15 to 20 puncture wounds along his face, arms, and neck, prosecutors say, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. Trujillo remains in jail, with bail set at $100,000. When police arrived at Andersson's apartment on Sunday, Trujillo, who had recently worked as a massage therapist, answered the door with blood on her clothes and hands; Andersson was lying in the hallway face up, with a stiletto by his head, KTRK reported, citing court records. Trujillo had recently moved in with Andersson, and she told investigators that he grabbed her, and a struggle followed, KTRK reported. An official cause of death has not been determined, the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences told CNN. It was not immediately known who Trujillo's attorney will be. CNN could not immediately reach a relative of Trujillo. Trujillo has said in the past that ""if anybody ever messed with her,"" she'd get them with her shoe -- ""a big stiletto heel,"" Jim Carroll, former manager of a motel where Trujillo lived, told KTRK.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Jared Lee Loughner, accused of a mass shooting in which he allegedly tried to assassinate U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, isn't competent to stand trial, a federal judge ruled Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said he based his decision on two recent court-ordered mental evaluations of Loughner at a federal hospital in Springfield, Missouri. ""The defendant was not able to comprehend the charges,"" Burns said. Loughner has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia by two experts who examined him, Burns said. A 52-page evaluation by psychologist Christina Pietz and a 43-page evaluation by psychiatrist Matthew Carroll both concluded that Loughner isn't fit for trial because he cannot assist in his defense due to mental illness. Both evaluations were recorded, but they weren't shown in court. Burns said he agreed with Carroll's evaluation that said Loughner is ""clearly illogical and confused."" The judge said Loughner wasn't masquerading a mental illness and noted that he had been acting bizarrely for the past two years. The judge also said that Loughner doesn't like being labeled mentally ill. ""He scoffs at the idea,"" Burns said. Loughner, 22, of Tucson, Arizona, has no rational understanding, an ""irrational distrust of his lawyers"" and ""has delusions that prohibit him from considering legal defenses,"" the judge said. The U.S. attorney general will take custody of Loughner for a period not to exceed four months, during which he will be taken to a hospital for further evaluation to determine if he will become competent to stand trial. Prosecutors said Loughner could be readied for competency through proper medication, and this practice has proved successful in other cases. The next court date for Loughner is scheduled for September 21. He has pleaded not guilty to the 49 charges he faces, including murder and attempted murder, related to the January 8 mass shooting in a grocery store parking lot in Tucson. He is accused of killing six people and wounding 13, including Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, who was holding a meet-and-greet with constituents at the time. Authorities say Giffords was the target of the attack. Giffords' office declined to comment on Wednesday's ruling. During his hearing, two marshals forcibly removed Loughner from the courtroom after an outburst in which one reporter heard him say, ""Thank you for the freak show. She died right in front of me,"" and ""You're changing ..."" Loughner's parents, seated in the courtroom, were clearly upset. After a 15-minute recess, Burns asked Loughner if he wanted to watch the remainder of the proceedings on a television monitor. Loughner said yes, and he was removed from the courtroom. Loughner entered the courtroom Wednesday no longer bald and clean-shaven, as he was depicted in his mugshot shortly after the shootings. He now has a full head of hair, along with facial hair. He is accused of killing John M. Roll, a federal district judge; Gabriel M. Zimmerman, a staff member for Giffords; Dorothy J. Morris; Phyllis C. Schneck; Dorwan C. Stoddard; and 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green. Giffords, shot through the head and brain, is recovering from surgery that implanted a synthetic bone and a shunt in her skull, her doctors said last week. She was in attendance last week when the space shuttle Endeavour was launched with her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, in command for a 16-day mission. NASA spokeswoman Kylie Clem said Wednesday she was unsure whether Kelly would be informed of the Loughner ruling and, if so, in what manner. She said there are forms of communication that allow private conversations, such as between crew members and their families. Among those attending Wednesday's hearing was Susan Hileman, 58, who was wounded in the shooting, and her husband, Bill. Susan Hileman brought Christina Green to the supermarket to meet Giffords. Christina has often been remembered as the child victim who was born on September 11, 2001. Also attending were friends and co-workers of Judge Roll, whose courtroom was in the same courthouse as Wednesday's hearing, and Mavy Stoddard, 75, who was wounded in the attack and whose husband, Dorwan, 76, a retired construction worker, died trying to shield his wife from the bullets.

"(EW.com) -- Things haven't been going great for Paula Deen the last few days: She's been dropped from the Food Network, QVC is ""reviewing the relationship,"" and her biggest defenders so far have been her sons â€” and their examples left a lot to be desired. But Deen has got at least one public figure in her corner: Anne Rice. The vampire author took to her own Facebook page to defend the chef, but her comments (first discovered by Jezebel) are likely to just cause more controversy. Rice first posed the question to her readers by saying: ""What's happening with Paula Dean? Is it fair? I never heard of her until today, and wow, this looks like a crucifixion. Opinions, thoughts welcome....aren't we becoming something of a lynch mob culture?"" QVC is 'reviewing business relationship' with Paula Deen . She then decided that the ""opinions, thoughts"" needed were her own, and had quite a bit to say in the comments, including, in part, ""...This woman is just what you said. She's an old southern lady, and she never made these unwise remarks of hers to a black person. We have no evidence at all that she has ever personally insulted or injured any black employee or friend."" No evidence, of course, except Deen's own sworn deposition about the offense level of jokes. ""I can't, myself, determine what offends another person,"" Deen said before going on to explain how she wanted to hire ""all black waiters for her brother's 2007 wedding."" Paula Deen releases statement after being dropped from Food Network . Rice continued her defense in the court of public opinion, via Facebook: ""It's so easy to persecute an older, overweight, unwise, crude, ignorant woman who may very well be a good person at heart who has achieved a great deal in her life. So easy to vilify her and hate her and try to destroy her life. Woe to anyone today who is not slender, young, clever and politically correct."" Paula Deen will finally be giving her own side of the story on the ""Today"" show Wednesday. A rep for Rice did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment. See the original story on EW.com.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)   -- The employee who wore what some said was a racially insensitive Halloween costume to a party hosted by a top immigration official is being directed by the Homeland Security Department Secretary to take administrative leave. Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called the man's costume ""offensive."" The employee's leave will continue while a Department inquiry is conducted, according to Secretary Michael Chertoff. The employee wore a striped prison outfit, dreadlocks and darkened skin make-up to the party hosted by Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Myers was on a three-judge panel that originally praised the prisoner costume for ""originality."" After some employees complained, Myers apologized for ""a few of the costumes,"" calling them ""inappropriate and offensive."" She said she and other senior managers ""deeply regret that this happened."" A department photographer took a picture of Myers with the man, but the photograph or photographs, originally posted online, were deleted after it was determined the costume was offensive, ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. Asked about the controversy at a press conference Tuesday, Chertoff said Myers was ""right to apologize for having this proceeding take place"" and said she is reaching out to members of Congress and others to make sure ""they understood her unwavering commitment to equality and fairness."" ""Here is the bottom line: People do dumb things,"" Chertoff said. ""I get very perturbed when there is anything that is done that suggests that with respect to the enforcement of the law, we are anything other than even-handed. I have zero tolerance for racism or discrimination in the area of law enforcement. We have to be tough but we have to be fair. ... The idea that you are going to come and impersonate someone of another ethnic group, I think, is completely unacceptable."" Between 50 and 75 people attended the party, which was a fund-raiser for the Combined Federal Campaign, a federal government collection of charities. Nantel said one employee, whom she declined to identify, was wearing a black-and-white striped prison outfit, dreadlocks and a skin ""bronzer"" intended ""to make him look African-American."" But, she said, it was not immediately apparent that he was wearing the make-up. ""Most people in the room didn't realize he was wearing make-up at all,"" she said. ""It was unintentioned. The employee did not mean to offend although there were some employees that were rightfully offended by it,"" Nantel said. ""There were a couple of people who were offended,"" Nantel said. ""When it was confirmed through a conversation with the employee that he was wearing make-up"" the employee was counseled and Myers sent out a note to employees apologizing. ""The photo was deleted because there was a determination that the costume was inappropriate,"" Nantel said. In a November 2 email to ICE employees, Myers said, ""It is now clear that, however unintended, a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive. While we were all thrilled to be a part of the CFC fund-raising effort, I and the senior management at ICE deeply regret that this happened."" She reminded all employees to be compliant with the department's diversity training requirement. Myers has served as head of ICE since January of 2006 but is still awaiting Senate confirmation. An ICE congressional liaison said ICE officials briefed congressional staffers about the costume party this week as a courtesy. But at least one congressional staffer said they approached ICE after receiving an anonymous fax about the incident. Myers called House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, about the incident and is expected to meet with him before the end of the week, a Thompson spokeswoman told CNN. Myers also contacted the National Association of African-Americans in the Department of Homeland Security. In a letter to NAADHS members, the group's vice president, Sjon Shavers, said the group ""appreciates (Myers) reaching out to us so quickly in order to keep us apprised of the matter and we commend her on moving so swiftly toward appropriate corrective action."" As head of ICE, Myers heads the law enforcement agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation's interior. It is the second largest investigative agency in the federal government, with more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 investigators. Chertoff ""supports the actions that Assistant Secretary Myers has taken,"" DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner said. ""We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior at DHS. ""The secretary has asked for an inquiry into the facts surrounding the incident. Once the facts have been determined, we will take all necessary and appropriate actions.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal agents watched in horror as an unknown male in an internet photo appealed for stomach-churning advice -- how to rape the child beside him. The girl was in pajamas and the man appeared intent on abusing her sometime soon. Homeland Security agents knew they were in a race against time to save the girl. In a narrow, windowless office outside Washington, DC, Special Agent Jim Cole sits at a bank of computer screens. The room is modest but the technology Cole is using is second to none. He showed CNN's Freedom Project how Homeland Security Investigations agents chase down child pornographers. The tone in his voice changes when he begins to tell us about the 11-year-old girl and the special case, which the agency has termed ""Sunflower."" ""This Sunflower series [of photos] was being posted by an individual who was looking for information on how best to rape this little girl and get away with it."" Cole, who has daughters of his own, says he began scanning the photos being posted online for any clues that might give away their location. And he knew, he didn't have much time. ""The advice he was getting online ranged from drugging her to brutally attacking her,"" says Cole. ""It was progressing so we were extremely concerned for her welfare."" The agent noticed a blurry highway road sign in the window. It was his first, and best, clue. He and his colleagues set to work. The road sign looked like a sunflower logo -- a clue that led agents to Kansas where the sunflower is the state flower. And the first number on the sign was surely a 2. But the other numbers were too blurred to be sure which road it was. ""We began looking at the road sign. It really looked to most of us like a highway 203, and there was a highway 203 in Kansas, [but] when we got there, got off the plane the agent from Kansas said ""it's not 203, we just drove the whole highway, the sign's not there."""" So Cole and the other agents got back on the road and started driving every highway in Kansas that starts with a 2. ""At the very end of the highway where it teed into another highway, we found the sign. I jumped out of the vehicle on a very busy highway and almost got hit by a car."" Knowing the approximate location, Cole called the local sheriff's department, who recognized a backyard swimming pool in another one of the photos. They conducted a raid; arresting the suspect before the exploitation could escalate to the point of rape. ""When we went in that morning, [the 11-year-old girl] was still wearing those same pajamas as depicted in the images."" An ICE spokeswoman said the girl is now safe and living with her parents. She added the suspect turned out to also be a minor --16 years old -- who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve 48 months in a juvenile facility. Former ICE Director John Morton, speaking in January, touted the success of this raid and subsequent ones -- named Operation Sunflower after the Kansas case -- that rescued 123 children, reminded Americans that while there was good news to report, the dangers that children face online and elsewhere remain. ""As satisfying as the arrests in Operation Sunflower have been, today is obviously a day of mixed emotions because this operation is ultimately a tale of the perverse, pervasive and violent exploitation of children - very young children to satisfy the dark pleasures of a group of twisted adults,"" said Morton. ""Sadly, some of the children were very young. For example, some of the children we rescued were between the ages of two and three. Nine children were between the ages of four and six."" Already in the first six months of 2013, HSI agents have rescued 337 child victims, and they've taken 964 alleged child predators off the street.","Federal agents raced against clock trying to save girl in internet image .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week, seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city. Pakistan has deployed paramilitary troops to a district taken over by the Taliban. A Pakistani government official said the militants fully withdrew from the Buner district on Friday, although other officials cast doubt on the extent of the pullout and how long it would last. Buner is only 60 miles outside Islamabad. The situation is particularly concerning because Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state. The Islamic republic is believed to have between 30 and 40 nuclear warheads, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Those warheads, however, are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban, several analysts said. iReport: Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan? Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands. But Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said that the situation is not as dire as Clinton described. ""Yes, we have a challenge,"" Haqqani told CNN. ""But, no, we do not have a situation in which the government or the country of Pakistan is about to fall to the Taliban."" Analyst Michael Krepon said while the news out of Pakistan is ""disturbing,"" the real concern is what happens if Pakistan decides to move the weapons components, which are closely guarded by its army. ""The nuclear weapons are the most well-guarded inanimate objects in the country,"" said Krepon, co-founder of the Stimson Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. ""When they're not in motion, they're not going to be subject to hijacking or being overrun by the Taliban."" Krepon, who studies Pakistan's and India's nuclear programs, said tensions between those two countries could prompt Pakistan to move its weapons components. ""If there's a crisis with India ... odds increase greatly that weapons could move around, and when weapons move around, it is very worrisome,"" he said.  Watch a former CIA official view » . However, Pakistani political consultant Hasan-Askari Rizvi downplayed the threat of the Taliban insurgency to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. ""The threat to nuclear weapons is not so imminent because they are far away from those places and secondly, they are under control of the army,"" Rizvi said. ""Only a few people in the army know about it,"" he said, noting that the Pakistani army would defend their control of the nuclear weapons until the end. ""It's a source of power,"" Rizvi said. ""Whoever controls the weapons will dictate to the Pakistani government."" Commentators and politicians in the West have long harbored concerns that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could be stolen by Islamic militants. A month after suspected Islamist extremists assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, top Pakistani security officials held a special briefing with Western journalists, insisting that the country's nuclear arsenal is secure from Islamic extremists. The January 26, 2008 news conference took place a few weeks after IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei warned that Pakistan's ""many internal problems"" put the country's nuclear arms at much greater risk. At the briefing, Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai -- head of the army division that controls Pakistan's nuclear sites and weapons -- said the country's weapons were protected by a ""fool-proof"" security system. Kidwai said there are 10,000 troops assigned to guard the country's nuclear facilities, including special agents who report directly to the country's intelligence services. He stressed that Pakistani military sites were equipped with security cameras; biometrics and access control; bullet-proof vehicles, high security walls; and quick reaction forces. Around 2,000 scientists working with sensitive materials and information at the sites had to undergo extensive background checks before being given security clearances, he added. ""In Pakistan we have been extremely conscious of our responsibilities and obligations in this regard and we have instituted command and control structures and security measures in a manner so as to make these fool proof,"" Kidwai said. CNN's Tricia Escobedo in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Concerns over Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as Taliban make advances .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a lawsuit challenging the federal no-fly list, a U.S. District Court in Oregon has ruled that passengers have a constitutional right to fly internationally, but it has yet to decide if the government's procedures are enough to deny that right due to security concerns. The 13 plaintiffs, including four U.S. military veterans, sued in 2010 after being stopped from traveling in aircraft. They say they believe they are on the federal no-fly list. They also say they were prevented from traveling overseas to make religious pilgrimages, visit family and attend school, since other means of travel, such as boat trips that would have lasted more than a month, were impractical. The American Civil Liberties Union, which supported the case, hailed the partial decision as a victory. ""This is the first federal court decision to recognize that when the government bans Americans from flying and smears them as suspected terrorists, it deprives them of constitutionally protected liberties and must provide these Americans a fair process to clear their names,"" Nusrat Choudhury, a staff attorney for the ACLU who argued the case, told CNN. The Justice Department would not comment on the case. The plaintiffs also say the government violated their right to due process when they were put on the list with no notice or meaningful way to fight the inclusion. About 20,000 people were on the no-fly list as of 2012, according to a counterterrorism official, including about 400 Americans. U.S. officials will not confirm who is on the no-fly list or various other terrorist watch lists complied by the F.B.I. and used by the Transportation Security Administration, airlines and other countries. The judge has asked both the government and the plaintiffs' attorneys for more information about the redress process before deciding if the procedures are enough to prevent people from flying. There is a process for removing a person's name by submitting information to the Department of Homeland Security. If would-be passengers aren't happy with the results, they can take the government to court. The plaintiffs said that process is not adequate, since the government never holds an administrative hearing, acknowledges if a person's name is on the list or if it has been removed, or tells why the name was on the list in the first place. The government argued in court documents that it can't tell people if they are on the no-fly list because that would reveal classified information that needs to be ""shared across the government to maximize the nation's security, without fear that such information will be disclosed whenever anyone cannot travel as he or she might choose."" The next court date is set for September 9. CNN's Rene Marsh and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","13 plaintiffs, including four U.S. vets, sued in 2010 after being stopped from traveling in aircraft .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs cannot deny benefits to the wife of a lesbian military veteran, a U.S. district judge in California said in a ruling that in part cites this summer's Supreme Court invalidation of a key Defense of Marriage Act section. The case involved former Army Sgt. Tracey Cooper-Harris, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who sued the department last year after it denied dependency benefits to her wife -- whom she legally married in California -- because the federal government didn't recognize same-sex marriages. While Cooper-Harris' case moved through the court system, the Supreme Court in June rejected the part of DOMA that denied federal benefits to same-sex partners, even those legally married. That left Title 38 of the U.S. Code, parts of which ban veterans' benefits for same-sex spouses. In Thursday's ruling, Judge Consuelo B. Marshall, after noting the DOMA rejection, ruled that the government couldn't use Title 38 to deny benefits to Cooper-Harris' wife, Maggie Cooper. Marshall cited defense experts who argued veterans' benefits are an essential promise to service members, helping retention and recruiting. Married same-sex couples gain equal tax benefits . ""The denial of benefits to spouses in same-sex marriages is not rationally related to any ... military purposes,"" the judge wrote.

"(CNN) -- Earth Day is the time of year to hear the usual polarized debates between liberals who lament humanity's reckless use of natural resources and conservatives who deny any human role in climate change and echo Sarah Palin's call for industry to ""drill, baby, drill."" This division is familiar, but it hasn't always been this way. After all, it was President Nixon who established the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act. Long before that, social conservatives were in the vanguard of environmental activism in the United States, in part because of their traditional views about women. Lydia Adams-Williams, conservationist and writer, summed up a widely held belief when she proclaimed in 1908, ""Man has been too busy building railroads, constructing ships, engineering great projects and exploiting vast commercial enterprises to take the time necessary to consider the problems which concern the welfare of the home and the future."" It fell to women, she declared, ""to educate public sentiment to save from rapacious waste and complete exhaustion the resources upon which depend the welfare of the home, the children, and the children's children."" The General Federation of Women's Clubs was a leader in the fight for resource conservation. Founded in 1890 and officially nonpartisan, it was made up almost exclusively of full-time homemakers who rejected feminism, accepting marriage and motherhood as women's highest calling. The General Federation maintained that ""conservation in its material and ethical sense is the basic principle of womanhood."" ""Woman's supreme function as mother of the race gives her a special claim to protection,"" it said, ""not so much individually as for unborn generations."" And in 1911, Ladies' Home Journal reminded it readers that, as housekeepers, ""you have been practicing conservation all your life, doing on a small scale what the Government is beginning to do on a huge one. ... The Government is in a way the good mother of us all."" Such ideas were inculcated into millions of girls when they joined the Girl Scouts of America, established in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low. According to the organization's original handbook, a Girl Scout's first duty was to ""Be Womanly,"" for ""none of us like women who ape men."" Among the tasks of a good Girl Scout was to ""have children of your own"" and ""teach them to be good, hardworking, honorable citizens in our big growing country."" Girls were told that they were the natural leaders in conservation: ""Women and girls have it infinitely more in their power than men have to prevent waste. ... The real test of a good cook is how little food she wastes."" Girls were also urged to apply to natural resources the principles of conservation practiced at home, recognizing that ""in this United States of ours we have cut down too many trees and our forests are fast following the buffalo."" Their innate maternal qualities left them uniquely qualified -- and obligated -- to conserve, protect and defend parks and forests. This notion that women's natural role as homemakers and mothers gave them a responsibility to act as nature's housekeepers led many socially conservative women to take up environmental activism, campaigning to protect the nation's bird population, which was being decimated by the feather trade, and promoting conservation education in their children's schools. Most men dismissed women's environmental concerns as sentimental and frivolous. The Chicago Record Herald reported that the God who made coal ""knew that smoke would be a good thing for the world."" Women like naturalist Ella Higginson fired back, charging that men were so obsessed with profit that they wanted to ""tear down our forests, rip open our mountain sides, blow out our stumps with giant powder, (and) dam up our water ways."" For decades, socially conservative women joined groups like the Audubon Society, working in unison with more socially liberal members. Suburban homemakers joined with college students to make up the core of the new environmental movement of the 1970s. Under the leadership of Lois Gibbs, the protests at Love Canal were led primarily by full-time homemakers who rejected much of the burgeoning feminist movement. They welcomed, however, the assistance of liberal activists in their campaign for a safe, nontoxic environment. In recent years, liberals who reject traditional social values have come to dominate the conservation movement. But for a time, there was a joint involvement in resource protection that provides a model of how people with opposing social views can come together in support of the environment that we all share. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nancy Unger.","Nancy Unger: On Earth Day, liberals and conservatives show polarization on conservation .
But conservative women were early conservation supporters because of role as mothers .

"(CNN) -- You'd be forgiven for not knowing, but the end of April marks a very important date in the Swedish calendar. ""Walpurgis Eve"" celebrates the transition from winter to summer. Every year bonfires are lit, songs are sung and it's not unheard of for parties to go on late into the night. Why such jubilation? Because the Nordic winters are dark, cold, long and cruel. Meanwhile, the summers -- while hardly exotic -- are bright and full of opportunities that are otherwise prohibited by the fearfully inhospitable climate. Nowhere is this truer than in the far north of Sweden, where temperatures range from minus 40 C (minus 40 F) in the winter to plus 30 C (86 F) in the summer. Along with a portion of neighboring Finland, the area is more commonly known as Lapland, and while the region retains an association with flying reindeer and a jolly bearded man, it is in fact home to a flourishing indigenous people called the Sami, as well as a magnificent parade of scenic treats that truly come alive in the summer. If you're not convinced, read on for four reasons to plan your summer vacation in Lapland. The midnight sun . Due to its location north of the Arctic Circle, Lapland is bathed in sunlight around the clock, non-stop for two precious months a year. This geographical quirk means that -- throughout June and July -- visitors can enjoy the rare spectacle of the midnight sun, where notions of day and night are quickly forgotten. The dim pink midnight light lends the landscape an unearthly dimension, and permits the novel experience of midnight forest hikes and even 24-hour golfing sessions. Indeed, the excruciatingly picturesque ""Björkliden GC"" -- the northernmost golf course in Sweden, is a favorite among midnight golfers, nestled discreetly as it is between Sweden's mountain borders and the icy clear Lake Torneträsk. Here, the fairways and greens are designed to showcase the scenery and, halfway through the course, players can reflect on their performance over a cup of hot coffee inside a traditional Sami tent.

Unlike most European ski resorts, however, Riksgränsen doesn't really get going until the sun starts hanging around for longer at the beginning of March. By June, it is sometimes warm enough on the slopes to ski in shorts and a t-shirt. Factor in a midnight-sun ski run, and you've a unique proposition by anybody's standards. Novices be warned though -- while Riksgränsen has some world-class facilities and a range of 17 slopes that it says are suitable for all abilities, the resort is principally renowned for it's off-piste action, which is both technically challenging and, with a mountainous climb back up, physically demanding. Summer hikes . With its great forests, wild rivers and ominous mountains, Lapland has acquired the moniker of ""Europe's last wilderness."" Here, the mountain range drops towards Norway and curves into Finland, forming the backbone of Sweden, and there are around 2,000 mountains and caves that can be explored throughout the region. But while the winter months are dark, treacherous and shrouded in a white uniform of snow, summer brings with it the chance to see this part of the world in all its green grassy goodness. The magnificent ""King's Trail"" -- one of Sweden's most popular trekking routes -- opens up in June. The 440 kilometer footslog from the botanical wonderland of Abisko National Park in the north, to the pretty backpacker's town of Harnavan in the south, taking in the giant Kebnekaise -- Sweden's highest mountain - is divided into four portions that represent roughly one week of hiking each. Wooden huts are dotted along the trail, spread over distances a walker should expect to cover in the course of day (about nine to 22 kilometers). Those on a tight budget -- or with a penchant for roughing it -- can pitch a tent outside and use the facilities. Summertime ""Ice Hotel"" Lapland is also home to the world's first and largest ""Ice Hotel"" -- where guests bunk down on a bed of ice blocks and a reindeer skin-covered mattress. In fact almost everything, from the chandeliers to the tables and chairs, is made from ice and snow. First built in 1989, in the remote village of Jukkasjärvi, when the founders of an ice-sculpting course invited some of their students to stay the night, the Ice Hotel has for years been a winter-only operation. But now, for the first time, the hotel will open its frosty doors in the summer. As every year, the latest incarnation has been crafted from scratch by a team of sculptors using blocks of frozen water from the nearby Torne River. The founders describe it as both boutique accommodation and ""ephemeral art project"" -- as the fruit of their labor vanishes in the sun as each season comes to an end.","The sub-Arctic region of Lapland is not as unusual a summer destination as it might seem .

"(CNN) -- The goals President Barack Obama set out Tuesday in his Climate Action Plan -- including cutting pollution from coal plants and aggressively pursuing clean energy alternatives -- won't solve all the challenges of climate change, but they are a big first step in protecting the planet from its worst effects. Getting serious about solutions is critically important, especially now and especially for the United States. Why the rush? Climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat-trapping gases, especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide, which have been pumping out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. How much? Through 2012, that total is about 1,700 billion tons of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion and cutting down forests. In 2012, carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. were 19.4 tons per person or about 750 pounds per person per week. Per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. may be lower now than they were in 1990, but the average American still emits three times the global average. Global annual carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow rapidly, with emissions in 2012 more than 50% above 1990 levels. Recently, and for the first time in more than 2 million years, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere climbed above 400 parts per million, 37% higher than in 1800. The resulting global warming, about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit, will persist for at least 1,000 years. With every passing year, the pool of total carbon dioxide emissions grows bigger, causing more warming -- and more warming leads to greater damages from climate, weather extremes like heat waves, heavy rainfall, and coastal storm surge, as well as altered crop yields, threats to human health, and increased risks of wildfire. The first step? Address the root of the issue, and this is why the action Obama outlined is smart. The plan recognizes the breadth of the problem and focuses on a wide range of emissions sources. It also recognizes that not all the damages can be avoided and that building resilience needs to be a part of the package. Taking action now is also cost-effective. Slowing and eventually stopping emissions will take time. The global energy system producing most of the carbon dioxide emissions is massive, and includes thousands of power plants and more than a billion vehicles. The components of the energy system are long-lasting: Cars are driven for one to two decades. Power plants are designed to run for up to a half-century. Buildings, which use energy for heating, cooling, lighting, and running equipment, can stand for a century or more. As things stand now, these realities commit us to continuing emissions into the future. Each new coal-fired power plant that goes online or inefficient vehicle that hits the road extends that commitment. In principle, we can retire existing infrastructure -- like energy-inefficient buildings and carbon-intensive power plants -- early, but such a rapid transformation of an entire energy system would be exorbitantly expensive, essentially because it involves scrapping equipment that has not lived out its useful life. Building the energy system for the 21st century ambitiously but gradually, starting now, controls the costs by building for the long run and by enabling markets to innovate and drive down costs. Why is U.S. leadership so important? First, the United States has the necessary skills in science and technology, the tradition of innovation, and the mature capital markets to boldly seize opportunities. Building the energy system of the 21st century is perhaps the greatest business opportunity of the era. It will involve a wide range of technologies that emit little or no carbon dioxide, with greatly increased energy efficiency in vehicles, buildings, and equipment. Second, the U.S. is the only nation that can truly focus the world's attention on the climate problem. When the U.S. hangs back, it is easy for other countries to question goals or get tangled in internal politics. U.S. leadership is critical in supercharging the international effort. Today is the day to start. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Field.","Chris Field: U.S. urgently needs to heed Obama's Climate Action Plan .

"Lexington, Kentucky (CNN) -- In the 1950s, when Dr. Andy Moore's father was the first plastic surgeon in town, many residents didn't have health insurance. But Dr. Andrew Moore Sr. believed that medicine was about service. ""He would accept all kinds of things in payment. People would bring chickens or a bushel of apples or a piece of furniture that they'd made,"" his son recalled. ""He wanted them to be able to maintain their dignity."" Moore says he inherited his father's conviction, as well as his love of medicine. Moore, who shares a plastic surgery practice with two of his four brothers, started a program that provides outpatient surgical care to Kentucky's uninsured -- for free. On the third Sunday of each month, Surgery on Sunday opens its doors at the Lexington Surgery Center. Since 2005, when Moore persuaded a hospital to donate space and recruited volunteer staff members from across the state, SOS has treated more than 3,100 patients. ""In this economic time, the people that need this are our friends, neighbors and family,"" said Moore, 61, a Lexington native. ""They can't wait till we get some sort of solution from the national government. They need this health care now."" Volunteers arrive bright and early -- the first surgery is at 7:30 a.m. -- and leave in the early afternoon. On an average Sunday, the group cares for 25 to 30 patients. Volunteers include anesthesiologists, nurses, receptionists and other surgeons. Most cases are gallbladders, hernias and colonoscopies, although SOS offers a wide range of surgical procedures. Different surgeons perform procedures depending on their specialties. ""The joy for me is not only taking care of the patients but to see my volunteers getting a lot out of what they're doing,"" Moore said. For the Moores, medicine and service are family traditions. All three surgeon brothers -- Andy, Woody and Michael -- participate in Surgery on Sunday, and their mother is one of the program's official greeters. Surgery on Sunday clients are the ""working poor"" who don't qualify for federal programs and can't afford insurance. ""It's our duty to help people that fall between the cracks in the health care system,"" Moore said. ""This is what I went into medicine for. ... It's about taking care of people and not necessarily expecting something in return for it."" When he started out as a plastic surgeon 26 years ago, providing free care to patients was simple, Moore says; it just required a phone call to the hospital. Over time, hospitals agreed to help less and less, and the growth of insurance and computers added to the complexity. But patients still needed treatment. According to the Census Bureau, 46.3 million people in the United States are uninsured. In Kentucky, the fifth poorest state in the nation, 33 percent of working-age adults lack health insurance, according to a University of Cincinnati poll. Moore says he won't stop fighting for the uninsured to get the care they deserve. ""Knowing that you've made a real difference in their lives, at the other end, is the thing that keeps you going,"" he said. Moore hopes to expand the program nationally. In March, the group is starting its first satellite program in Dallas, Texas, which will be operated by local volunteers using a template provided by Moore and SOS. In Lexington, costs are covered by donations and private foundations, and patients are referred to SOS by hospitals and free clinics. People are seen based on the urgency of their medical need, and about 1,500 people are on a waiting list. Michael Weyls had to wait more than a year for his second SOS surgery. A California native, Weyls, 52, was an avid surfer who worked construction for years. He was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 30 and had it removed, but it reappeared 20 years later. At that point, Weyls was uninsured and couldn't afford the surgery, so his skin cancer advanced. By the time he first got to SOS in the fall of 2008, half of his nose had to be removed. The surgery may have saved his life, but it also left Weyls disfigured and in a deep depression. ""My face was tore up. I kind of lost hope,"" Weyls said. ""But Dr. Moore gave me hope."" A year later, Moore helped reconstruct Weyls' nose. It took two Moore brothers and four hours of surgery to give Weyls a new start at life. ""What they did is awesome, and I'm grateful,"" Weyls said. ""It's a wonderful program."" Want to get Involved? Check out the Surgery on Sunday Web site and see how to help.","Surgery on Sunday provides free outpatient surgical care to Kentucky's uninsured .

"(CNN) -- The Communist Party leaders inside the Zhongnanhai compound in Beijing may have found solace in the Obama-Romney debates: Though China was mentioned 53 times, both presidential candidates avoided harsh rhetoric toward China. Despite Romney's repeated avowal to label China a ""currency manipulator"" and Obama's branding of China as ""an adversary,"" both sounded moderate and called China a partner, which leaves the door open for building a good working relationship with China's new leaders. The candidates traded jabs on how they would deal with the trade and currency issue but skipped other major controversial topics such as human rights, Tibet and censorship. To Beijing's relief and to American conservatives' disappointment, the highly anticipated ""China bashing"" was absent from the debates. Also missing was the big picture -- America's relative decline, China's rapid rise and the ensuing power restructuring in the global system. Is the United States ready to cope with an increasingly powerful, confident and yet non-democratic China? The real issue is not whether China is a currency manipulator or not -- after all, the yuan has appreciated more than 11% since 2010 and more than 30% since 2005. Obama's and Romney's narrow focus on trade and currency when mentioning China, which is understandable due to America's lackluster recovery, and their dodging of other major problems between the two countries may be misinforming Americans who, as a result, do not fully understand the nature of this complex relationship. This is a multifaceted relationship, strong but difficult at times. The biggest challenge the two countries face is the power transition between them, as China continues to gallop ahead and is expected to surpass the United States as the largest economy within a decade. Both countries are struggling to deal with the new power structure in the international system. In fact, China is rising so rapidly that it has difficulty adjusting to its newfound power and sometimes behaves clumsily in international affairs as evidenced in China's perceived forcefulness in the recent Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute and South China Sea controversy. U.S. politicians are used to speaking from a position of dominance. Both Obama and Romney claimed they would push China to ""play by the rules."" Such a condescending approach will not work with today's more assertive and nationalistic China. The United States must play by the rules first. For example, Huawei was recently singled out by Congress as a company threatening U.S. national interests and was essentially declared unwelcome in the U.S. The telecoms giant has businesses globally, including a recent Â£1.3bn investment in the United Kingdom which would create 500 jobs. In September, Obama issued a rare presidential order instructing Ralls Corp., whose owners are Chinese, to divest itself of four Oregon wind farm projects near a military base, citing a national security threat. But firms operated by other foreign owners in the same area are apparently conducting business as usual. Where is the level playing field? The United States still maintains some Tiananmen-era sanctions against China, including the ban on exports of high-tech equipment and products to China. One wonders how the United States can narrow its trade deficit with China, if it only sells apples and oranges to China? Is China friend or foe? This often-asked question misses the central point that the United States and China are so interdependent that they no longer have the luxury to make such a choice. The two countries are separated by huge gaps in political systems and cultural values, which can be a major cause of conflict. The two governments still deeply distrust each other. Since the Obama administration's implementation of its ""strategic rebalancing"" toward Asia in 2010, the U.S. government has failed to convince China and many other countries in Asia that its purpose is not to counter China's growing power. America's deployment of more forces in the Asia-Pacific region and beefing up its alliances with China's neighbors smack of a policy of encircling China. Of course containment will not work in this day and age, and Asian countries do not want to be drawn into a great power conflict. It has become politically incorrect to say anything good about China during America's elections. Candidates tend to compete over who is tougher on China. It has become an accepted norm to blame China for America's domestic woes. Such practices may help a candidate to win an election, but they are very harmful to U.S.-China relations in the long term. The United States is at the risk of creating a resentful China during the Asian power's transition to a more diverse and open society. Nothing is wrong with focusing on economic issues now, but Americans should never lose sight of the big picture. As a global leader, the United States has the moral responsibility to help promote democracy, human rights and rule of law in the world. With China in transition, the United States has a great opportunity to help shape the future of a nation with which it will be politically and economically intertwined for generations to come.","Obama and Romney mentioned China 53 times in the U.S. presidential debates .

"(CNN) -- Just over a week ago, they were two little boys living with their grandparents and the family dog, Nati, in Tampa, Florida. That was then. First, police say Chase and Cole Hakken's father broke into the home and tied up the boys' grandmother before whisking the two children away -- one day after he and the boys' mother officially lost their parental rights. The 2- and 4-year-old boys ended up sailing to Cuba with their parents, triggering an international manhunt that ended this week. Chase and Cole are now back in Tampa, trying to resume their life with Nati and their grandparents. ""Right now, we're just looking forward to sitting, getting them in our arms, hugging them and being with them and getting them home where they will be safe again,"" the boy's maternal grandfather, Bob Hauser, said overnight Tuesday, just hours before being reunited with the boys. The boys' mother and father, meanwhile, could be calling prison home for some time. Josh and Sharyn Hakken spent most of Wednesday in Hillsborough County jail. They're set to make their first court appearance Thursday morning, on charges of kidnapping, auto theft and child neglect. Josh Hakken faces an additional charge of false imprisonment. Florida abduction: A libertarian washed ashore in the worker's paradise . Given Florida sentencing guidelines, a conviction on the kidnapping charges alone could mean the Hakkens will spend the rest of their life behind bars. Police: Parents talked of 'journey to the Armageddon' The Hakkens' ordeal began last June when Josh and Sharyn and the their two sons were staying together in a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana. Responding to a call, police officers found the parents ""acting in a bizarre manner,"" Slidell police said in a statement. Inside the room were their two boys, as well as narcotics and weapons. ""They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon',"" police said about Josh and Sharyn Hakken. Louisiana authorities took Chase and Cole from their parents following that incident. About two weeks later, their father showed up at a foster family home ""with a firearm demanding the return of his children,"" Slidell police said. Josh Hakken fled after the foster parents called 911. Over the subsequent months, Josh and Sharyn Hakken ""did not participate in the system,"" Hillsborough County, Florida, Sheriff David Gee said late Tuesday, without offering much detail. ""As a result of that, the authorities in Louisiana gave custody to the grandparents,"" the sheriff added. That transfer became official April 2, when a Louisiana judge terminated Josh and Sharyn Hakken's parental rights. The next day, at 6:30 a.m., Patricia Hauser told police that Josh Hakken saw his boys once again -- when he entered her Florida home, tied her up, then sped away with Chase, Cole and the family dog in a silver 2009 Toyota Camry. They met up with Sharyn Hakken, who was waiting in a pickup truck, sheriff's investigators said. They drove to a parking garage, and eventually ended up on a 25-foot sailboat named Salty. Josh Hakken had purchased that boat from a person, who later tipped off authorities after word got out about the brothers' abduction. That's the boat they took south -- leaving their Florida port just ahead of a storm that challenged authorities looking for them. ""A small boat in a big ocean, it's really tough,"" Gee said. It was at the Hemingway Marina, on Tuesday, that CNN found the family -- hunkered inside the boat, under the watch of Cuban security forces. That morning, U.S. officials in Havana told CNN that they were afraid Cole and Chase could be in danger from their parents. Armed Cuban security agents, meanwhile, watched over the Hakkens most of the day -- until the family was led away, peacefully, that afternoon. Boys' 'fine, happy and sleepy' on return to U.S. Cuba and the United States are divided by far more than the Straits of Florida. But this week, on this case, U.S. officials repeatedly expressed their appreciation for the Cuban government's ""extensive cooperation."" The Cuban foreign ministry said the Hakkens' boat pulled into a marina just west of Havana in bad weather on Sunday. ""From the first moment,"" the two governments began exchanging information. To that point, FBI spokesman Dave Couvertier said the U.S. State Department learned about the Hakken family's whereabouts from Cuban authorities. That all led to the return of Hakkens, and the family dog, to the United States. But this time, they flew -- and were accompanied by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office detectives, as well as U.S. federal and state law enforcement authorities. U.S. diplomatic officials waited with the family at Havana's airport until a plane carrying American law enforcement officials arrived to bring them all back to Florida. Checked out by a medic, Chase and Cole were ""fine, happy and sleepy"" as they boarded the plane, the sheriff's office said. The aircraft touched down around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday at Tampa International Airport. Some time later, the boys and dog were reunited with the grandparents. Their parents, no longer on the lam, are being held away from the general population of the Florida jail. CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Kim Segal and John Zarrella contributed to this report.","NEW: Sheriff says parents ""did not participate"" as courts weighed child custody .

All the attacks occurred in predominantly Shiite areas. No group claimed responsibility for the attacks.

"(CNN) -- Journalism and national security have survived decades of lies; both can handle a little unexpected truth. Giving government secrets and classified documents to a nation's enemies or even its allies is certainly against the law. We've always called it spying. Now the equation is changed and people who approve giving purloined documents to the wide electronic world call it transparency. Others, who oppose WikiLeaks' release of diplomatic cables Sunday, are calling it an act of terrorism to be met with full government sanctions. The sober side of me knows that putting the entire archive of a quarter-million State Department documents online can be harmful and potentially dangerous for national security. Yet the news reader -- the citizen -- in me also finds it immensely satisfying to learn what government leaders are really saying compared with the official statements, releases and communiqués that often masquerade as government information. Knowing that Saudi leaders, behind a false front of regional solidarity, are fretting about Iran seems a bit refreshing. I do appreciate knowing that our DEA knows that an Afghan vice president visited the United Arab Emirates last year carrying $52 million in cash. Even if I feel chagrined that our diplomats are getting blackmailed by other nations into taking Guantanamo Bay prisoners off our hands, I'd rather know the truth than the pretend explanations. The real danger, it seems to me, is not the revelation of assorted classified material but our tendency to overreact, either to actual security threats such as the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber or, in this case, to a massive information dump. We've become so reactive to security concerns -- and, at the same time, apathetic to threats to our own civil liberties -- that we might, as a result of the WikiLeaks release, allow government agencies to step on the universal reach of the Internet or find ways to create exceptions to First Amendment freedoms. Official ire may be aimed at WikiLeaks and its founder, but there's a real current of anger at the media for providing a printed and organized outlet for these documents. Without the printed media, however, the information would be presented in such a helter-skelter fashion, it would be difficult to analyze or even know what is true and which documents are bogus. Since the earlier two massive releases by WikiLeaks of low-level Defense Department documents relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I have yet to find a person who has actually read more than a tiny sampling of the actual leaked documents. Many say the electronic information age has done away with traditional or mainstream journalism, but here it is evident that the journalists at The New York Times, The Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel magazine and the Spanish daily El Pais are still doing the legwork -- sifting through information, confirming, editing and presenting it to the public. Over many weeks, the above publications have also cooperated with their governments and with WikiLeaks in vetting the material and removing information that clearly might be harmful to people in other countries. We all understand how illegal it is to reveal state secrets, even those that are classified secret for no good reason. We also know that over the years, governments have lied to the American people in the name of national security, whether about preparations for war or dealings with our allies and enemies. Journalists take comfort in the saying about sunlight being the best disinfectant, and usually that is true. Abraham Lincoln expressed the same sentiment this way: ""Let the people know the facts and the country will be safe."" I know there is risk in having these illegally obtained insights into government discussions and calculations, but we should not allow others to use this to attack a free media or to create more government secrecy. During a conversation with my journalism class on the WikiLeaks controversy yesterday, the graduate students considered both overreactions as potential dangers -- that these leaks will provide an excuse to curtail our constitutional freedoms and that government will become even more duplicitous. And that would be a real crime. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy McNulty .","Timothy McNulty says journalism, national security survived lies, will survive WikiLeaks truth .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Beijing is a city where history and culture are almost tangible. They sprout, grow and bloom in unexpected places, around glittering new skyscrapers, in subway tunnels and in parks. And yet, despite their prevalence, history and culture in Beijing always seem to be teetering on the verge of extinction. No doubt, the Chinese capital has its iconic landmarks that have been around for centuries and will likely endure for centuries to come. There is the Forbidden City, which is the ancient imperial palace where dozens of Chinese emperors ruled the country for 500 years. There is also the Summer Palace, a massive imperial garden built in the 18th century that is on the outskirts of the city. And outside of Beijing, there is, of course, the Great Wall of China. Tourists flock to these landmarks to get a glimpse of the city's ancient imperial past. Yet, the problem for many other places that are emblematic of an old Beijing is that, in 21st-century China, they are caught in the middle of a collision between history and modernity. In most cases, modernity prevails. Countless ""hutong,"" as Beijing's traditional courtyard housing is called, have been knocked down and replaced by skyscrapers, shopping malls and apartment buildings. In Qianmen, a district south of Tiananmen Square once home to Qing Dynasty scholars and opera singers, old hutong were demolished and replaced by renovated hutong that now house stores ranging from Starbucks to Zara. Yet, visitors to Beijing do not have to go too far off the beaten path to find dingy alleyways lined by what remains of the old courtyard homes that exist in clusters, like islands on the verge of being swallowed by the tidal wave of new China. Further north of Qianmen is a neighborhood called Gulou that is home to the historic Drum and Bell Towers, which have helped Beijing mark the time of day for centuries. See also: Ballet star takes inspiration from Chinese dance . The fate of the hutong in this area remains uncertain. Some have been destroyed. Yet for those that are left standing, there is a charm that endures. Numerous cafes, boutiques and galleries are hidden along the narrow lanes. Peter Tan operates a coffee shop called Kaffa Cafe in a hutong called Guowang. Across the street from Tan's store is the hutong of a family that has lived there for three generations. Tan says he knows other families who have lived in the neighborhood for even longer. He adds that his neighborhood, and many others around him, are popular spots for travelers looking for a less-commercialized side of the city. Tan says that the destruction of the old neighborhoods reduces Beijing into city that is ""just like anywhere in the world."" About a 10-minute walk from Kaffa Cafe is the Bamboo Garden Hotel, which is located in courtyard homes that were once the residences of the postmaster general of the late Qing Dynasty. There are numerous other hutong that have been converted into hotels, offering travelers an authentic alternative to the dozens of international hotels throughout the city. See also: Five top tips for China first-timers . Further outside of Beijing, situated on a broad tract of land that was once the grazing grounds for the imperial stables, is Caochangdi, an urban art village that also has an uncertain future. The village was started about a decade ago by Ai Weiwei, the now globally famous contemporary and controversial Chinese artist who was recently arrested, and later released, by the Chinese government. In 2010, artists and gallery owners in Caoghangdi received official notices from the local government that their studios were on a demolition list. Two years later, nothing has happened, and Caochangdi is flourishing. Caochangdi PhotoSpring, the village's annual photo exhibition held every April, now attracts photographers and tourists from around China and from around the world, while more artists are moving to the area from 798, another nearby art district, because Caochangdi is considered less commercial and more conducive to creative work. Aside from occasional Ai Weiwei spottings (the artist still uses his studio in the village), other notable artists have studios interspersed between housing units mostly occupied by migrant workers and their families. The artists include Mo Yi, a Chinese artist from Tibet who once played professional soccer and now is known for his installations, performance art and photography both at home and abroad, and Wu Wenguang, an internationally renowned documentary filmmaker. While Caochangdi is more rugged than the 798 Art Zone, which attracts thousands of tourists annually, it is becoming an increasingly popular destination for travelers seeking a glimpse of China's burgeoning contemporary art scene. It takes around four hours to walk around the dozens of galleries that occupy the grounds. Some notable places to visit include F2 Gallery, which houses work from both Western and Chinese contemporary artists, as well as Galerie Urs Meile, which is housed in a complex designed by Ai Weiwei, and Three Shadows Photography Art Centre. Despite Caochangdi's rise, there are still worries that one day that bulldozers might arrive and that it could fall. ""The people who live and work out in Caochangdi and the art community are optimistic about it and want it to be preserved and to be around,"" said Jillian Schultz, international program manager for Three Shadows Photography Art Centre, in Caochangdi. ""But it is beyond our control."" Everyday in a park in western Beijing called Purple Bamboo (in Chinese its name is Zizhuyuan) groups of Chinese gather who are intimately aware of cultural loss that is beyond their control. They are mostly retired and in their 50s and 60s, generations whose coming-of-age experience was during the Cultural Revolution, a traumatic and complicated period in Chinese history when all things cultural, from art to dance to music to literature, were all but erased from society from the mid-1960s until the mid-1970s. In Purple Bamboo and in parks across Beijing these groups gather together to dance the tango, the waltz, the cha cha cha, the foxtrot, mambo and salsa. In all corners of the park loud speakers can be found blaring music while couples, groups, individuals simply dance. The dancers are perhaps one of Beijing's most charming, and undiscovered, tourist attractions. They are not hard to find, and they are worth watching because they prove that culture in China's capital is, above all, resilient. ""Before 1980, no Chinese knew how to dance,"" said a man whose last name is Li (he declined to provide his first name) who stood on the sidelines of around a dozen couples dancing under snow-covered trees on a recent morning in Purple Bamboo. ""They come here to dance because it makes them happy.""","Beijing is a city rich in culture, but its history is threatened by modernization .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- A convoy of more than 100 vehicles left Islamabad, Pakistan, on Saturday on a march toward South Waziristan to protest U.S. drone attacks. Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan is leading the march, which includes about 35 members of the U.S. anti-war group Code Pink. The group traveled to Pakistan last week to join the march, group representative Mirza Shahzad Akbar told CNN. ""We are here to say, on behalf of those Americans with a conscience, that we apologize to the people of Pakistan for the killing and suffering,"" Medea Benjamin, a founder of Code Pink, said at a news conference Thursday. American activists in Pakistan to protest U.S. drone strikes . The U.K. advocacy group Reprieve and former Prime Minister Tony Blair's sister-in-law, Lauren Booth, are also part of the convoy. But senior government officials warn that the participants will not be allowed into South Waziristan. Opinion: A dangerous new world of drones . ""We have already informed the convoy that we will not allow the participants to enter due to security reasons,"" Shahid Ullah, a senior government official, said. ""The situation in the tribal areas is comparatively good but not suitable for any gathering there,"" Tashfeen Khan, another government official, said. ""Visiting South Waziristan with foreigners would not be advisable. It can create problems,"" he said. While the government has given no assurances for the safety of the march, the Pakistani Taliban has also voiced concern at the convoy entering the volatile region. ""We haven't given any kind of guarantee for the safety of the so-called Peace March planned to visit South Waziristan,"" said Ihsanullah Ihsan, spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban. Opinion: The folly of drone attacks and U.S. strategy . The counterterrorism drone strike program in Pakistan has long been controversial, with conflicting reports on its impact from the U.S. government, Pakistani officials and independent organizations. American officials insist that the choice and execution of the strikes -- begun under President George W. Bush and ramped up under President Barack Obama -- meet strict standards and that cases of civilian deaths or injuries are extremely rare. But a study released last month by Stanford Law School and New York University's School of Law said the drone attacks have killed far more people than the United States acknowledges, traumatized innocent residents and been largely ineffective. Civilians account for a significant portion of those killed, the study said. Meanwhile, fliers were distributed in the city of Tank on Friday from a militant splinter group claiming that Imran Khan was a Jewish American agent and that he would be endangering his own life and those who were traveling with him if he entered the tribal areas. Convoy participants hope to reach South Waziristan on Sunday and hold a demonstration against drone attacks in northwest Pakistan.

"Iquitos, Peru (CNN) -- Nearly 21 years ago, Patty Webster landed her dream job as an adventure tour guide in the Peruvian Amazon. But as she shared the area's beauty and culture with tourists, she realized there was a darker side to the rainforest paradise. ""I saw how poor they were and realized that people were dying because they didn't have medical care,"" Webster said. She started sharing her supplies with the locals and soon began waking up to find people waiting outside her mosquito net to ask her for medicine. At one point, Webster -- who had no medical training -- gave someone stitches, following instructions from a book. ""It was kind of scary,"" she recalled. ""If they're depending on me for their health care ... we're all going to die."" That's when she decided to stay and do something more. Since 1993, Webster has been bringing medical relief to some of Peru's poorest and most remote areas through her nonprofit, now known as Amazon Promise. Webster -- described by a visiting doctor as ""sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and Mother Teresa and Susan Sarandon"" -- and her volunteers have provided free health care and education to more than 55,000 people. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . It's hardly the life one could have predicted for this Detroit, Michigan, native, but she's never followed an ""ordinary"" path. The daughter of postal workers, Webster headed to New York after high school graduation and worked as a model, a Radio City usherette and an ASPCA adoption counselor before going to Peru for a wildlife internship. When she was offered a job as an adventure tour guide, she jumped at the chance and has never looked back. Today, she runs Amazon Promise from Iquitos, considered the most populous city in the world that can't be reached by road. It's in the northeastern corner of the country, in the middle of the rainforest, and is the capital of Peru's largest and most remote region. Nearly half of the area's population lives in poverty, and one-third of residents lack access to basic medical care, according to Peru's National Institute for Statistics and Information Technology. Some might go their entire lives without seeing a doctor. That's what Webster is working to change. She organizes several expeditions to these underserved areas every year. Each trip is staffed by adventure-seeking medical volunteers from the West -- often from U.S. medical schools -- and Peruvian health professionals. A traditional shaman, or healer, frequently accompanies them. Dr. John Glick met Webster while on a trip to the slums of Belen, near Iquitos, for the Gesundheit! Institute, Dr. Patch Adams' health organization. ""She's an amazing person. She is sort of a cross between Indiana Jones and Mother Teresa and Susan Sarandon,"" Glick said. ""She is a unique and focused individual who is serving the health needs of some of the (poorest) people in the world."" Financed largely by the volunteers' trip fees, Webster's teams travel around the region for up to four weeks at a time, holding free clinics for the local people. Getting to these remote areas is Webster's biggest challenge. Many of the villages take days to reach, often requiring travel by bus, helicopter and boat. Large portions of these trips are made on the area's winding rivers -- no easy feat when traveling with 30 to 40 containers of medical supplies. ""Sometimes we're in dugout canoes ... and we'll encounter major rapids,"" Webster explained. ""When that happens, you just need to get in and close your eyes."" In the villages, the volunteers provide preventive services such as prenatal checkups and general exams, but most of their time is spent treating a wide range of ailments like malaria, TB, pneumonia, diarrhea, animal or snake bites, and parasites. Teams usually see several hundred patients during each expedition. Webster also strives to empower the local population by training village health workers and educating villagers about HIV prevention, hygiene and sanitation. The group also works in some of the region's most destitute urban areas. ""We often see people that are even sicker right in the city than in the jungle,"" she said. Webster hopes to build a permanent clinic in Belen, a slum on the outskirts of Iquitos. She envisions providing services to the city's poor, training for health workers and housing for villagers who come to the city for treatment. The government has donated land for the project, and Webster is working to raise the funds for construction. In the meantime, the group has built a simple structure where it will hold clinics twice a month. After 17 years, Webster still has yet to collect a salary for her work, and she lives in the group's offices in Iquitos. But while life on a shoestring budget isn't always easy, knowing that she's having an impact keeps her motivated. ""Regardless of whether it's getting to one person or 30 people or 300 people, you make a big difference,"" she said. ""Anything I can offer them that is going to help them ... it's just a real gift."" It's a gift she plans to keep giving for as long as she can. ""I've found my purpose,"" she said. ""It certainly wasn't what I had planned for my life, but you can't go against these forces of nature."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- You know it will happen someday: Zombies are chasing you down the street, groaning for your blood. You've been holed up for a week, and there's spotty cell service. It sure would be handy to request an emergency ammo drop from the black-helicopter guys. No? OK, maybe there's a major blizzard. The power in your part of town goes out for days. Your landline is knocked out too. But there's still a faint cell signal from a couple of miles away. It would be no trouble to traverse that distance if there weren't eight feet of snow piled outside your door. You're running out of food and firewood. How do you call for a rescue? So maybe the zombie apocalypse thing is a wee bit unlikely. But for emergencies, it still helps to have a simple, small, hardy backup phone that can make calls, send or receive text messages, and hold a charge for a very, very long time. Yes, wireless networks often go down during disasters, but they also can come back online (at least in spots) before power has been restored to buildings. Or sometimes, voice service goes down, but text messages will still work. (During Hurricane Katrina, text messaging saved lives and was a key coordination tool for NOLA.com, according to Online Journalism Review.) Or sometimes, wireless carriers or emergency personnel can set up temporary emergency cell towers within a few days. But the battery on your regular cell phone may not hold a charge that long. So your nasty neighbor who won't share his drinking water might be chatting away to his daughter in Seattle while you're kicking yourself for not powering down your phone two days before. A low-end, energy-efficient backup phone also can come in handy during smaller-scale emergencies -- if your car breaks down or if you just can't find your regular phone anywhere. On the August 14 Engadget Mobile podcast (time stamp 50:35), co-host Myriam Joire (aka Tnkgrl) recommends the Motorola Motofone F3 as her preferred ""zombie apocalypse survival phone."" This handset was designed primarily for users in the developing world, where access to cell signals and electricity can be very unreliable. It's available in the U.S. from many online retailers, in the $20 to $25 price range for an unlocked version -- one that operates on multiple wireless networks. This makes it an affordable part of anyone's emergency preparedness kit. Joire's co-host Chris Zeigler advised Engadget podcast listeners, ""Instead of spending $20 on a pizza tonight, go buy this phone."" Joire noted, ""It's very refreshing to have a phone in your car that can only do three things: make calls, do text messages and set alarms. That's it! And the text messages are all lower case."" The Motofone F3 is a very thin (about 9mm thick) candy bar-style phone with a small e-ink display -- a technology with extremely low power requirements, since it mostly draws power only when the screen changes. The handset weighs just 68 grams (2.4 ounces). The charger is also very small. Joire especially likes this phone's voice-prompting feature: ""When you plug in a SIM card, it tells you to pick from three languages. When you pick a language, it asks you whether you'd like voice prompting. You should say yes, because then, for pretty much everything you do, you'll get walked through by voice. That's helpful because this visual interface is very minimal. The segmented OLED display is mainly just icons baked into the e-ink, hard to interpret."" According to Joire, the phone's lithium ion battery ""lasts for a month or more on standby, with something like 200 hours of talk time."" A 2007 GearDiary review of this phone reported the battery life as about two weeks. Neither estimate had been confirmed. Joire was planning to take her ""zombie apocalypse"" phone to the Burning Man gathering (August 30-September 6 in the Nevada desert). While there's no official cell service in remote Black Rock City, some attendees may set up ad-hoc wireless networks. (Last year, a cell tower installed on private land near the festival proved highly controversial.) Joire tweets at Twitter/tnkgrl, and you can tweet via text message, so it's possible she may tweet from Burning Man via her F3. Also, she plans to blog about her zombie apocalypse phone when she returns. Whichever phone you choose as your emergency backup, get it ready to go. Put a SIM card in it -- and if prepaid, top it off with enough credit to cover lots of talking and texting. When you first charge it, condition the battery by letting it drain completely, then recharge it completely. Make sure you top off the charge at least weekly. Store the phone with its charger in an easily accessible place, and maybe put some reflective tape on it so you can find it better with a flashlight. Consult local, state and federal emergency preparedness agencies to find out which numbers you should program into the phone, for both calls and texting. Also, program in numbers for your family communication plan. And of course, program in the numbers of your zombie apocalypse phone tree. Better to give them a head start early than a head shot later.","A low-end, energy-efficient backup phone can come in handy during emergencies .

"Vershire, Vermont (CNN) -- Armed with a law degree, an SUV that serves as a mobile office and her own harrowing personal history, 58-year-old trucker-turned-lawyer Wynona Ward navigates the back roads of rural Vermont. Her mission: to aid victims of domestic violence. Ward is the founder of Have Justice Will Travel, a group that works to end the generational cycle of abuse by giving free legal representation and support services to isolated -- and often desperate -- low-income people and their children. ""For domestic violence victims in rural areas, it can be very devastating,"" Ward said. ""They're out there on these back roads, with no access to in-town services. Many do not have telephones; some do not have a driver's license or automobile. So we go to them."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . In 1991, Ward was a 40-year-old truck driver with no college degree. She was also harboring a past full of horrific sexual and physical abuse. Then, one phone call from a family member changed everything. ""My husband and I were driving a tractor trailer unit across the country and [learned that] a child in my family revealed that she had been abused by my brother,"" Ward said. She says the same child had been sexually abused by her grandfather -- Ward's father -- years before. ""I knew what she was going through. It took me back to my own childhood where I was abused in a very similar way. I just said, you know, I've got to go home. This can't happen anymore."" Ward's own childhood was marked by extreme poverty, violence and abuse. Her father raped her before she was 3, and the abuse continued throughout her childhood, Ward said. Her father also beat Ward's mother and siblings. ""When my father sexually abused me, it was very traumatic,"" Ward said. ""But what was much more traumatic for me was when I watched him beat my mother, choke my mother, throw things at her. ""Many times, I wondered why she didn't die, because the abuse was so bad."" Ward said that this type of in-home abuse is not uncommon in many rural areas and that not only is it generational, it's also frequently ignored -- and often unreported. ""Very often, when the neighbors heard screaming coming from our home, they just turned their heads. And when we heard screaming coming from their homes, we turned our heads, too, because it was an accepted way of life."" School was Ward's salvation and safe harbor. A good student, she began dating a classmate named Harold at age 13. She left home at 17, married Harold when she was 18, and tried to put her past behind her. But when the recurring pattern of sexual abuse surfaced in her family again, Ward was moved to action. ""I decided I was going to go and hang all the sex offenders that there [were],"" Ward said. ""But instead, I learned that I could be more helpful working in family law, where women and children really needed the help and where I could be there for them on a daily basis."" Ward became a volunteer victim's advocate and worked with her family members to convict her brother for abusing the child in her family. Along the way, she realized she had a passion for law. At 44, Ward became the first person in her family to graduate from college. She went on to Vermont Law School, graduating when she was 48. ""At that point in time, I didn't feel 48,"" she said, laughing. ""I was just ready to go to work."" With the help of a grant, Ward established Have Justice Will Travel at her kitchen table. Since 1998, the group has provided nearly 10,000 victims with legal and social services. ""[We] work with these women so they can become strong and independent and self-reliant and be able to support themselves and their children,"" Ward said. Ward works closely with victims' advocacy groups to help provide a ""complete package,"" including shelters, hot line information, housing, clothing and legal support. Her group's services include transportation to and from court hearings and free legal representation. Ward divides her time among client visits, grant-writing and fundraising. She sees hundreds of clients each year, driving more than 30,000 miles annually in her truck -- which is equipped with a radio, scanner, cell phone, computer and printer. Some of her clients don't have electricity. Driving herself into the most remote areas of Vermont, Ward said she's been able to reach victims who otherwise wouldn't have access to support services. Asked what keeps her going, Ward said, ""I think about my mom sitting at our kitchen table, trying to figure out how to make the last 10 cents last to feed us all. ""[Have Justice Will Travel] would have ... said to my mother, 'Yes, you are being abused, and it is not OK. You do not have to put up with this. You do not have to be a submissive wife. And you do not have to put up with having someone beat you. We can help you. We can help you to get out.'"" Want to get involved?

"Castalia, Ohio (CNN) -- Mona Rutger got the call in October: A bald eagle was flopping around on an airport runway after it had been clipped by a private jet. Unfortunately, it's something she sees all too often, with all types of wild animals. ""Everyone says, 'Let nature take its course,' "" said Rutger, a certified wildlife rehabilitator. ""But 90% of these animals' injuries are human-related. That's not nature. It's us."" Rutger sent a team to collect the injured bird and bring it to her rehabilitation center in Castalia, Ohio, where it was stabilized and then taken to a veterinarian. The eagle had three pins placed in its wing and is now building up its strength and agility with the help of Rutger and her nonprofit, Back to the Wild. Since 1990, Rutger says, she has rescued more than 42,000 injured, orphaned and displaced animals. About 60% of them have recovered sufficiently to be released back into their natural habitats. ""Each animal that we help can somehow make a difference. ... Each animal has a role to play in the food chain,"" Rutger said. ""If just one link breaks, the whole chain falls apart."" Rutger became a licensed wildlife rehabilitator more than 20 years ago when she realized that no one in her area was legally able to care for injured wildlife. She took it on in addition to her full-time secretarial job, envisioning that it would be a hobby of sorts that she'd run from her backyard. ""I thought, well, I'd do it on the side and get 20 to 30 animals a year,"" she said. ""But once people found out there was somebody in the area licensed, the phone never stopped ringing."" Her backyard sanctuary now runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and her group rescues more than 2,500 animals a year. The group has seen all sorts of wounded wildlife, including birds injured by power lines, turtles hit by trucks and bobcats declawed by people wanting to make them pets. Pelican, gull freed from beer can collars are recovering . The sanctuary has an impressive maze of state-of-the-art enclosures and aviaries, and it also includes an indoor education center where tens of thousands of people a year -- most of them schoolchildren -- learn about living in harmony with the natural world. Since Rutger started doing this work, more than 1 million people have visited her facility. ""We're counting on the children, our future adults, to do a better job taking care of the planet than we have in the past,"" Rutger said. ""I desperately want them to feel the excitement and the thrill that I find every single day in nature. And I know that they don't (often) get that chance."" Many of the animals at Rutger's sanctuary have physical limitations that are too great for them to live out in the wild, so they live permanently at the sanctuary and participate in its daily education programs. ""These powerful ambassadors can do more for wildlife than I can do without them,"" Rutger said. ""So even though this is sad that we are unable to release them, we feel that they have a new job, a new role. ""But we explain to (visitors) we are a hospital for wildlife, not a petting zoo. ... And we don't give (the animals) names, because they don't belong to us. They belong to the wild."" When possible, Rutger tries to save more permanently disabled animals by finding them ""educational jobs"" at other local zoos, reserves and nature centers. If this can't be done, then the animals must be humanely euthanized under Ohio's wildlife regulations. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Rutger's organization depends entirely on private donations. She and her husband have poured their life savings into the endeavor, even refinancing their home to continue the work. ""We have animals come in all hours of the night,"" Rutger said. ""It can be draining. It can be exhausting. ... But I don't feel that it's really work, you know? I'm doing something I love."" While the rehabilitation center is full of reminders about humanity's carelessness, Rutger's overarching message is lined with optimism. During the summer months, the sanctuary hosts free camps for underprivileged children who are unlikely to be exposed to nature where they live. The center also voluntarily participates in expensive research protocols when local animal populations are threatened by disease. ""The children and adults that leave here don't feel like it's too late. We want them to have hope for the future,"" she said. ""There's many species improving and coming back, and it's because humans have gotten involved and done positive things."" Survival of injured baby golden eagle called 'amazing' The bird injured on the runway last year is one of eight bald eagles at Rutger's center. She hopes it will be able to fly by the end of the year. ""We feel pretty confident that she's doing very well,"" Rutger said. ""We want to keep her exercising and hope every day she gets a little stronger, until she has enough stamina and ability to survive in the wild."" Rutger said that when the time comes, she plans to share the thrilling moment with the community. ""Goosebumps just go from your head to toe when that eagle or hawk or owl flies from your hand and you know that it doesn't have to live in a cage tonight,"" she said. ""I've done it thousands upon thousands of times, and it never gets old. It is still the most exciting, exhilarating experience I can share. Gets me every time."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- In the spring of 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to join sanitation workers seeking better pay, fairer treatment and the right to form a union. I was with Dr. King as he stood with workers, all African-American, all fighting years of labor repression and wages that relegated them to poverty. Dr. King was assassinated on that trip to Memphis. His death, just as the images of workers carrying signs reading, ""I am a man,"" is forever seared in my memory. Today, August 28, marks the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the site of Dr. King's historic ""I Have a Dream"" speech. As tens of thousands prepare to commemorate our nation's progress toward racial justice, it's worth remembering a central meaning of that march: economic opportunity. Opinion: Did we really learn the lesson of the March on Washington? The state of economic opportunity today is a far cry from Dr. King's vision. Increasingly, American workers are struggling to make ends meet. Each day they are forced to make impossible choices between feeding their families and keeping the lights on, paying for gas or buying a coat. Income inequality has grown exponentially in recent years, as middle-class jobs that pay a decent wage have been replaced by part-time, low-wage work following the recession. All the while, corporations and CEOs rake in unimaginable sums. Nowhere is this two-tiered capitalism more dire than within the hidden workforce employed by federal contractors. According to a recent study by Demos, a public policy think tank, nearly 2 million private sector employees working on behalf of America earn wages too low to support a family, making $12 or less per hour. These are Americans who sweep the floors of our nation's capital, stitch our soldiers' uniforms and ensure quality care for the elderly and disabled, and yet they cannot afford necessities like food, housing and health care. Like the sanitation workers of Memphis, they are the backbone of our economy, and are in turn treated like second-class citizens. Throngs mark 'I Have a Dream' anniversary . Dr. King stood with those on the picket line because he knew that struggles for racial and economic equality were inextricably bound. He championed economic opportunity and jobs knowing that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. In this way, the urgency of the current economic crisis must be understood as a civil rights imperative. People of color disproportionately occupy the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, mirroring the lack of opportunity that pervaded the mid-20th century. Just as Dr. King looked toward leaders in the nation's capital to better living standards, so too can workers turn their attention toward Washington. At the height of racial tension and mass mobilization in the '60s, the federal government took the lead in advancing equality. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson went beyond the Civil Rights Act of 1964, effectively ending racial discrimination in government contracting with the signing of an executive order. President Barack Obama ought to respond to the crisis of inequality in similar fashion. He could -- today -- sign an executive order requiring government contractors to pay their employees higher wages. With a sweep of the pen, President Obama could honor Dr. King's legacy -- and help fulfill his dream -- by mandating fairness and justice. It's fitting that the protests by low-wage workers spreading across the country adopt many of the same tactics as the Memphis sanitation workers, including the potent ""I am a Man"" message. Were Dr. King here today, I have little doubt he would join with the striking workers of federally contracted companies, fast-food giants and Wal-Mart. The struggle for labor rights and decent pay was central to the conviction that animated his life. 10 signposts on America's race journey . President Obama has promised to take executive action to improve the economy, circumventing a gridlocked Congress and raising the boats of millions of families. There is no better place to start than with working standards of federally contracted companies. More money in these workers' pockets will yield greater consumer spending, accelerated job growth and a more robust economy. And there is no better time to do it. On the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, and at a time of record levels of economic inequality, President Obama should follow in the footsteps of his civil rights predecessors. When he speaks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he should outline an executive order that would raise standards for low-wage employees working on behalf of our country. Doing so is no panacea for continuing racial and economic discrimination, but is an important step toward realizing Dr. King's unfulfilled dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Lucy.","William Lucy was with MLK in Memphis supporting living wages for sanitation workers .

"(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong is ready to cooperate with an international ""truth and reconciliation commission"" digging into doping in professional cycling, but not -- for now and perhaps longer -- with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which expedited his downfall, his lawyer said Friday. USADA, designated by Congress as the country's official anti-doping organization for Olympic sports, had reached out to Armstrong's representatives, asking the former champion cyclist to talk to them at length by February 6 about his past. In a letter dated Friday, Armstrong's lawyer Timothy Herman acknowledged the USADA request but said that ""logistically, it is simply not possible"" to do in the next two weeks ""due to preexisting obligations."" Furthermore, Herman wrote that Armstrong is more inclined to cooperate with international sports authorities -- specifically the Union Cycliste Internationale, which recently announced its intention to set up a ""truth and reconciliation commission"" in conjunction with the World Anti-Doping Agency. The lawyer reasoned USADA has limited jurisdiction over the sport, since it has focused on the U.S. Postal Service team once led by Armstrong, but not the vast majority of professional cycling teams that have raced in recent decades. 7 lessons from Armstrong's confession . ""USADA has no authority to investigate, prosecute or otherwise involve itself with the other 95% of cycling competitors,"" Herman said. ""Thus, in order to achieve the goal of 'cleaning up cycling,' it must be WADA and the UCI who have overall authority to do so."" U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart, in a statement to CNN, challenged Armstrong's claim he did not have sufficient time to arrange his schedule so he could talk to his organization. Tygart said the two sides met last month, at which time his agency asked Armstrong to work with them and ""be part of the solution."" ""Mr. Armstrong has already been provided well over a month since our meeting in December to consider whether he is going to be part of our ongoing efforts to clean up the sport of cycling,"" Tygart said. ""Either way, USADA is moving forward with our investigation on behalf of clean athletes."" Last October, the USADA detailed its investigation that found Armstrong played a central role in what it called ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" That in-depth report hastened the once iconic Armstrong's demise, including his being stripped of his 2000 Olympic bronze medal and seven Tour de France titles. As he had for years, Armstrong continued to vehemently deny cheating during his stellar run -- until this month, when he confessed to Oprah Winfrey that he'd used performance-enhancing drugs and had illicit blood transfusions. In the interview, Armstrong admitted being a ""bully"" at times, but insisted he didn't feel like he cheated because others in his sport were doing the same. 10 alternative steps to redemption for Armstrong . ""I viewed it as a level playing field,"" the athlete said. Armstrong told Winfrey he was open to talking with anti-doping agencies, including USADA, to address what he called a pervasive ""culture"" of breaking the rules to get ahead. That said, there's a long history of bad blood between the two sides -- including pointed back-and-forth barbs between Armstrong and Tygart. In his recent interview, Armstrong had admitted some of USADA's findings had merit, but rebutted others, such as its claims he cheated when he returned to professional cycling for the 2009 and 2010 Tour de France competitions. Tygart said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" set to air in full Sunday that, even if others also took performance-enhancing drugs, Armstrong ""was on an entirely different playing field"" given how much ""inside information"" and ""special access"" he had. The anti-doping chief blasted Armstrong's claim in his Winfrey interview that he didn't think he was cheating -- saying even a kindergartener could recognize that ""it's breaking the rules of the game."" ""No real athlete has to look up the definition of cheating,"" Tygart said, according to excerpts of the interview posted online. ""It's offensive to clean athletes who are out there, working hard, to play by the rules that apply to their sport."" Herman expressed ""disappointment"" about this interview, which he expected would contain ""more criticism of and attacks on Lance, despite no shortage of that following his recent revelations."" ""Lance's commitment to the truth and reconciliation process is firm, despite the attempt at piling on through more appearances by Mr. Tygart on '60 Minutes,'"" the lawyer wrote. Why we cheat .

"(CNN) -- A 3-year-old adopted boy -- whose death in West Texas has drawn stern criticism from Russia -- had more than 30 bruises, cuts and other marks on his body soon after he was pronounced dead, according to a report from a Texas medical examiner obtained by CNN. Along with his 2-year-old brother, Max Shatto arrived in the United States with his adoptive parents in November 2012. Just more than two months later, his adoptive mother told authorities that she found him unresponsive in the family's Gardendale, Texas, backyard. He was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at a nearby hospital. Soon after Max's death on January 21, Russia's top child rights advocate tweeted that the boy had been ""killed"" or ""murdered."" Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov later acknowledged he might have spoken too soon -- though he has remained highly critical of the U.S. handling of the case. Russia slams Texas prosecutors for not charging parents . The documents were obtained Thursday from the medical examiner's offices for Ector County and Tarrant County. They offered more details from the account by Laura and Alan Shatto about the boy's time in America as well as the condition of his body at the time of his death. Russia's consul general in Houston has received the report, said Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman with Russia's embassy in Washington. Russian officials will review the findings, but until then they have no comment. An investigator with the Ector County office who examined Max's body externally soon after his death documented 31 bruises, abrasions, scratches and other issues from head-to-toe, according to the death investigative report. Both parents in the report claimed that the boy -- who they and a doctor said was born to an alcoholic mother -- would try to hurt himself in various ways. Russia concerned over adopted boy's cause of death . ""They stated that (Max) was displaying behaviors such as banging his head on the bathtub, throwing himself down, holding his breath and clawing himself,"" wrote investigator Sondra Woolf. A Denton, Texas, doctor told authorities that after examining the child's deteriorating condition during a second visit and listening to the parents' accounts, he prescribed the boy Risperidone, an antipsychotic medication. The Shattoes said they first gave Max the drug on January 15 but stopped on January 18, concerned it was affecting his ability to swallow, the report said. Laura Shatto told authorities that she last saw Max outside, believing he was about to go on a slide, just before she went inside to use the bathroom. She came out to find him prone on the ground, and she called his name and shook him vigorously before calling 911. The documents also included a preliminary autopsy report conducted by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office, completed on January 23. Medical Examiner Lloyd White wrote to his colleagues in Ector County, ""Based on the findings at this point, I suggest laceration of small bowel mesentry due to blunt trauma to (the) abdomen as the cause of death. I'll leave the manner of death up to you pending investigation. ""On the whole, there appears to be a strong likelihood that this death was accidental, probably the consequence of a fall from playground equipment in his yard."" The Ector County medical examiner later concluded that Max Shatto's death was accidental, finding that the bruises and other issues were consistent with a ""self-inflicted"" injury, District Attorney Bobby Bland said March 1. Astakhov had accused the adoptive mother of killing the boy and giving him ""psychotropic substances,"" Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But toxicology reports came back negative, and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child's death. Soon after the news came out that Max's death had been deemed accidental, Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concerns and noted it did not receive the information from U.S. officials but rather from the media. It asked the United States to give Russian consular representatives the relevant forensic documents, including a death certificate. A few weeks later, Astakhov again slammed Texas authorities -- this time after they decided not to charge the adoptive parents. Bland announced March 18 that a grand jury had declined to indict Laura and Alan Shatto, adding that they'd found no evidence to charge the people and stating the boy died of a ""tragic accident."" The Russian child rights advocate responded to that development with a tweet, reported by a RIA Novosti, claiming the district attorney hadn't done enough to the investigate the death of the boy also known as Maxim Kuzmin. ""The Texas prosecutors' position in the case of Maxim Kuzmin is upsetting because they refused to scrutinize the circumstances of his death,"" Astakhov wrote. The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. That law bans adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to State Department figures. Though the number has dropped in recent years, Russia remains the third-most popular foreign country after China and Ethiopia for U.S. foreign adoptions.","A 3-year-old Russian boy adopted by a Texas couple died in January .

"Washington (CNN) -- Days after Anthony Weiner admitted to lewd chats with women online, his campaign manager quit, Weiner and his campaign said Sunday. Danny Kedem's departure is the latest sign Weiner's New York City mayoral bid is struggling amid allegations of online sexual impropriety. After the chats and photographs became public Tuesday, a poll showed him dropping to second place among Democratic candidates for mayor and his favorable numbers plummeting. ""Danny has left the campaign,"" Weiner told CNN affiliate NY1. ""He did a remarkable job."" Praising the ""excellent staff"" remaining in his organization, Weiner said more volunteers had flocked to his bid in the last few days than at any point since his campaign began. ""This isn't about the people working on the campaign, it's about the people that we're working for,"" he said. Kedem, a 31-year-old operative who previously worked for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declined comment in an e-mail to CNN. Weiner first acknowledged Tuesday that he did not stop sending raunchy online chats to women when he left Congress in 2011. That resignation was prompted by allegations from several women that Weiner had sent them lewd photographs of himself. Speaking at a news conference Thursday, the Democrat said he couldn't say for sure how many more women might come forward. ""There are a few. I don't have a specific number for you,"" Weiner said. Pressed to provide a guess as to how many online relationships occurred after his resignation, Weiner said, ""I don't believe I had any more than three."" He has resisted calls from his rivals to withdraw from the mayor's race, saying the decision of whether he's trustworthy enough for the job should be up to voters. His chief rival for the Democratic nomination, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, stopped short of calling for his withdrawal from the mayor's race Sunday but lambasted his actions as generating further distrust in government. ""I think it's become very clear that former Congress member Weiner has a pattern of reckless behavior, an inability to tell the truth and a real lack of maturity and responsibility,"" Quinn said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I don't think he should be mayor, and I think voters, if he stays in the race, will make that very clear."" On Friday, Weiner indicated he may stop answering questions altogether about his online relationships. ""There's going to reach a point fairly soon that I'm going to say I think I've said enough about it, and I'm going to keep just talking about other things,"" he told reporters on Staten Island. CNN's Chris Kokenes and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Campaign manager's departure is latest sign Weiner's mayoral bid is struggling .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Republican congressman spearheading a House probe of alleged Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative political groups accused the head of the IRS on Tuesday of obstructing his panel's investigation. California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, warned acting IRS chief Daniel Werfel that if ""the IRS continues to hinder the committee's investigation in any manner, the committee will be forced to consider use of compulsory process."" Issa did not elaborate on exactly what steps his panel's Republican majority may be prepared to take, though he noted that impeding congressional investigators could result in a prison term of up to five years. ""Obstructing a congressional investigation is a crime,"" Issa stressed in a letter co-signed by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""Despite your promise to cooperate fully with congressional investigations, the actions of the IRS under your leadership have made clear to the committee that the agency has no intention of complying completely or promptly with the committee's oversight efforts,"" Issa said. ""The systematic manner in which the IRS has attempted to delay, frustrate, impede, and obstruct the committee's investigation raises serious concerns about your commitment to full and unfettered congressional oversight,"" Issa wrote. Responding to Issa's claim, an IRS spokeswoman told CNN the agency is ""aggressively responding to the numerous data requests we've received from Congress."" ""We are doing everything we can to fully cooperate with the committees, and we strongly disagree with any suggestions to the contrary,"" Michelle Eldridge said. Among other things, Issa claimed the IRS has handed over only 12,000 of the more than 64 million pages of documents initially identified as potentially relevant to the investigation into the alleged unfair targeting of conservative outfits seeking tax-exempt status. ""This incredibly slow pace of production has been an unnecessary attempt to frustrate the committee's oversight efforts,"" he said. Edridge, in turn, argued that ""while the volume of raw data collected ... is quite high, it is a misleading figure to use in order to determine the volume of material the IRS will ultimately produce."" ""The vast majority of it is completely unrelated to the congressional investigations,"" she said. ""Once the data is limited to the time period in question, and the issue in question, we expect the final tally of produced documents will be far lower -- in the neighborhood of 460,000 documents or fewer."" Eldridge said 70 of roughly 1,500 attorneys in the IRS chief counsel's office are currently working full time to respond to congressional inquiries into the matter. It is a ""time and labor intensive review process,"" she said. For his part, Issa also complained that documents produced by the IRS ""contain excessive redactions that go well beyond those necessary to protect confidential taxpayer information."" Furthermore, Issa asserted that a senior IRS official -- Cindy Thomas -- had been ""affirmatively prevented"" from providing congressional investigators with relevant documents in her possession. Additionally, the chairman blasted the IRS for allegedly trying to ""carefully orchestrate the public release"" of information contained in a 30-day review of the matter back in June -- before providing the information to the committee. Issa and other Republicans have insisted for months that after President Barack Obama was first elected, the IRS started unfairly targeting conservative outfits seeking tax-exempt status. Democrats, however, argue the IRS improperly scrutinized groups on both the left and right as part of a clumsy attempt to administer vague election-related tax laws. IRS inspector general: Liberals also on target list . At a speech in his home state of Illinois last week, Obama ripped what he labeled Washington's ""endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals."" The controversy has been the subject of numerous congressional hearings. And on Monday, Issa and Jordan argued for a new investigation -- this time into alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups that already have tax-exempt status. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on Issa's panel, called the information underlying the new assertion ""partial and incomplete,"" and designed to fit a pre-existing ""political narrative."" House GOP leaders have indicated they intend to keep publicly pressing on the issue this week, voting on a proposal to prevent the IRS from implementing or enforcing any provisions in the president's health care reform law. Top House Republicans have also suggested their members highlight the matter during the upcoming August congressional recess.","IRS spokeswoman says agency is doing everything possible to comply with congressional investigation .

"(CNN) -- Drone technology is spreading rapidly. As many as 50 countries are developing or purchasing these systems, including China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and Iran. Even non-state actors are involved. Hezbollah reportedly has deployed an Iranian-designed drone. Iran is developing a new drone aircraft with a range of more than 600 miles. These systems are used mostly for surveillance, but it is not difficult to equip the aircraft with missiles and bombs. Recently in Massachusetts, a man was arrested for plotting to place explosives on a drone aircraft and fly it into the Pentagon or the Capitol building. Private contractors are getting into the business as well. We now have companies offering drones-for-hire. What kind of a future are we creating for our children? We face the prospect of a world in which every nation will have drone warfare capability, in which terror can rain down from the sky at any moment without warning. Military planners are developing technologies for autonomous drones, aircraft that are supposedly ""intelligent"" and can make their own decisions on when to unleash lethal force. Will we give machines the power to kill people? The development of drone weapons raises profound moral questions about the future of war. U.S. officials are fond of drone weapons because they are inexpensive and seem to make the waging of war less costly. They allow leaders to conduct military operations without risking the lives of U.S. soldiers or drawing public disapproval. They give the false impression that war can be waged with fewer costs and risks. Any development that makes war appear to be easier or cheaper is dangerous and morally troubling. It lowers the political threshold of war. It threatens to weaken the moral presumption against the use of armed force. The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. We should know better by now. After 10 years of combat in Afghanistan the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever. May 2011 was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since the U.N. began keeping records in 2007, the agency's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported. June's death toll was almost as high. Terrorism is essentially a political phenomenon. It cannot be defeated by military means. The RAND Corporation's 2008 report ""How Terrorist Groups End""shows that the most effective tools against violent extremism are political processes and police operations. The U.S. government claims that drone strikes are an effective tool against al Qaeda leaders, but most of those being killed are low-level militants. Many important legal questions have been raised about drone strikes. The U.S. government arguably has legal authority to conduct military operations in Afghanistan, based on the original congressional authorization adopted after 9/11. It is questionable, however, whether this authority extends to Pakistan, a country that is supposedly an ally of the United States. Nor do we have legal authority to launch military strikes in Yemen, Somalia and other countries where the United States is not officially engaged in armed hostilities. Force may be used by soldiers against combatants in legally authorized armed conflicts, but this right does not extend to civilians. The U.S. covert counterterrorism drone campaign is managed and operated by the CIA, an agency notorious for its past policy failures and violations of the law. Those who are conducting these raids operate in secret beyond the restraints of military discipline and are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Drone weapons are very precise, but they do not eliminate the problem of civilian casualties. White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan claimed in June that no civilians have been killed in Pakistan in the last year because of drone strikes. The White House quickly backed away from that outlandish claim, but administration officials continue to insist that so-called collateral damage is very low. Precise information about civilian casualties is impossible to obtain, but a new report from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK sheds important light on the subject. Their figures show that civilian casualties occur in about one fifth of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan. Since the drone war began in Pakistan in 2004, more than 2,000 people have been killed in these strikes, with as few as 386 and as many as 775 civilians among the dead, including as many as 170 children. Drone weapons raise many troubling security, legal and moral questions. Rather than pushing ahead to develop more of these systems, our government should pause to consider the consequences of this new revolution in military technology.

"(CNN) -- With more than half the world's population living in cities, there's never been a more important time to consider sustainability. Sydney has been at the forefront of this since establishing the ""Sustainable Sydney 2030"" vision. If cities are to thrive, we can't continue to allow accidental growth. A clear plan supported by residents, workers, businesses, visitors and backed by strong political leadership is what we need. In Sydney, this has been our warmest winter in 150 years with the average daily temperature rarely dropping below 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). Last summer we had our hottest day on record, hitting 114.8 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius). Looking forward, we are bracing for another scorching summer of heat waves, drought and fire. The City of Sydney (CoS) has set some ambitious targets by aiming to cut 70 percent of our carbon emissions by 2030 (on 2006 levels of 5.4 million tonnes per annum). We've looked into a number of clean tech solutions over the years, many of which we're already putting into place. This includes installing Australia's biggest program of building-mounted solar panels -- with 5,500 solar panels on 30 buildings. Not only have we rolled out LED streetlights that emit half the carbon, but we've also retrofitted 45 council owned properties to reduce energy, water and waste. To go green, CoS are working to increase the urban canopy by 50 percent by 2030. This includes planting 8,900 trees since 2005. With a warming of two degrees - and projections show we are headed for a four to six degree change -- we risk catastrophic climate change. While Sydney is moving towards a more sustainable future, climate change demands we do more. Last week a study released by the Australian Energy Market Operator found the cost of moving Australia to 100 percent clean energy would be roughly equal to sticking with coal. That's one of the reasons we're working on plans for local and clean energy. Gas-fired trigeneration - a technology that uses heat from energy production making it more than twice as efficient as coal power stations --is one of the tools we're using to end our reliance on coal-fired power and generate 30 percent of our energy needs from clean, renewable sources. As far as transport goes, cities like New York and London have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay-sayers, Sydney has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010. But to give residents an efficient transport option that gets them out of their cars, we are completing a 125-mile cycling network. As Sydney becomes a greener and better connected place, our long term ""Sustainable Sydney 2030"" plan is designed to make sure the city works for everyone, now and in the future. To make that happen we'll need to make bold decisions and test new ideas and that's exactly what we're doing in Sydney.","Combating climate change is at the heart of ""Sustainable Sydney 2030"", says Sydney's Mayor.
From investing in solar panels to LED street lights, Sydney is exploring ways to cut energy.
The city also set some ambitious targets to cut 70 percent of carbon emissions by 2030."
"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan authorities have arrested two suspects accused of shooting U.S. officials in a strip club earlier this year. Prosecutors charged Carlos Mejias Blanco and Windy Fabiani Mejias with attempted murder, alleging that they got into a fight with two U.S. embassy officials at the club and opened fire, ""leaving them wounded,"" Venezuela's Information Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Police said the May shooting occurred in the early morning hours at the Antonella 2012 club, located in the basement of a mall in northeast Caracas. Mall security said the establishment is a strip club. In May, the U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details. The injured officials worked with the embassy's defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.","Two suspects face attempted murder charges in shooting at Caracas strip club .

"(CNN) -- Last week, federal immigration authorities seized more than a dozen 7-Eleven stores in New York and Virginia. Authorities charged that the stores' franchisees ""brutally exploited"" more than 50 undocumented immigrant workers. The workers allegedly worked up to 100 hours a week, for as little as $3 an hour. They were forced to live in housing the employers owned and controlled, authorities said. For many, it was a shock. An iconic American corporation was allegedly profiting from what the U.S. attorney's office called a ""modern-day plantation system."" Prosecutors are seeking $30 million in forfeiture, not only from the franchisees but also from the 7-Eleven parent corporation. The real shock should be how common cases such as this have become. Millions of immigrant workers are uniquely vulnerable to abuse, because employers can threaten them with retaliatory firing and deportation to silence complaints. In this context, the allegations that 7-Eleven ran a ""plantation system"" for 13 years sounds more plausible. Consider: In March, workers from several nations filed federal complaints describing similar exploitation at McDonald's restaurants in central Pennsylvania. The workers, students who had come to the United States with J-1 visas to work under the Summer Work Travel Program, reported brutal conditions, wage theft and shifts of up to 25 hours straight with no overtime pay. They said they were made to live in substandard housing owned by the employer, and faced threats of deportation when they raised concerns. In June 2012, another group of immigrant workers alleged forced labor at a Louisiana Walmart supplier called C.J.'s Seafood. Supervisors threatened to beat them with a shovel, they said, to make them work faster, and when they spoke up, the boss allegedly threatened violence against their families. Recent debate on the Senate floor also recalled an emblematic 2011 case of exploitation at a Hershey's Chocolate packing plant in Pennsylvania. There, immigrant guest workers said in a federal complaint that they earned subminimum wage take-home pay and faced constant threats of firing and deportation. Among the many similarities in these cases, most striking is that all four came to light because immigrant workers defied threats and blew the whistle. When they did, they stood up not just for themselves, but for U.S. workers as well. In a recent national survey of 1,000 registered voters by CAMBIO (a coalition of pro-reform groups of which the National Guestworker Alliance is a member), 75% agreed that ""if employers are allowed to get away with mistreating immigrant workers, it ends up lowering wages and hurting conditions for American workers as well."" Eighty percent agreed that ""immigrant workers who blow the whistle on abusive employers are helping defend workplace standards, and should have the opportunity to stay in the U.S. to work toward citizenship."" Right now, protections for immigrant whistle-blowers are weak. Immigration and Customs Enforcement routinely ignores a memorandum from its director, John Morton, allowing it not to pursue deportation against whistle-blowers. In New Orleans, 26 workers who helped expose exploitation in the Louisiana home elevation industry were arrested in an immigration raid in August 2011, and most are still fighting their deportations today. Across the country, workers who have been the victims of exploitation -- and have come forward to stop it -- are treated as disposable. Immigration reform needs to change that. First, as the bill moves through the Senate and on to the House of Representatives, it needs to include provisions that deliver dignity at work to the more than 7 million immigrant workers in the United States -- and that keep the floor from falling for the 150 million U.S.-born workers who work alongside them. A bill called the POWER Act would provide the key protections to both. It needs to be included in the immigration reform bill. Second, immigration reform must deliver equal rights to all immigrant workers, so that unscrupulous employers can't pick and choose the most exploitable workers to undercut the competition. All immigrant workers who come to the United States through future guest-worker programs must have strong whistle-blower protections and the right to change employers as freely as any worker on American shores. Raising the floor for the immigrant workers at the bottom of the U.S. economy means building a stronger, more secure economy for all workers. That's why protecting immigrant workers doesn't just matter for immigrants. It matters for every worker in America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Saket Soni.","Saket Soni: Authorities seized some 7-Eleven stores, saying immigrants exploited .

"(CNN) -- A West Virginia state judge pleaded not guilty to federal conspiracy charges Wednesday for allegedly plotting to frame his secretary's husband in crimes, after the secretary broke off an affair with the judge. Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury, 57, was arraigned Wednesday on two counts of conspiracy against rights, according to a federal indictment based on grand jury findings. According to allegations in federal documents unsealed last Thursday, the alleged five-year vendetta included plotting to plant drugs under the husband's car, recruiting a state trooper to arrest the man on bogus theft charges, and persuading a police officer to arrest him on groundless assault and battery charges, the documents say. ""Judge Thornsbury set off on a campaign to persecute his secretary's husband, his romantic rival. In the process he corrupted the system of Justice in Mingo County for his own nefarious purposes,"" U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said. His trial date was set for October 15, and he was released on a $10,000 bond. Thornsbury's attorney, Stephen Jory, declined to comment on the charges. Thornsbury, who had ""engaged in intimate physical contact"" with his secretary, according to the indictment, asked her to leave her husband in 2008. She refused. Michael Callahan, who represents the secretary and her husband, on Friday called the incidents that led up to the indictment a ""terrible abuse of a public office."" Callahan represented the husband in two criminal cases allegedly conjured up by Thornsbury. The charges were dismissed in both cases. ""I represent both RW and KW as they begin the process of putting their lives back together and seek their own justice. At this time, my clients are unwilling to make any public statements or do any interviews,"" Callahan said in a statement to CNN. The secretary and her husband were identified in the indictment only by their initials, K.W. and R.W., respectively. West Virginia state judge faces federal conspiracy charges . When the federal charges against Thornsbury were announced, West Virginia's highest court, the Supreme Court of Appeals, voted to suspend the judge without pay, and also voted to suspend his law license, according to an official news release from the high court. According to the indictment, the conspiracy charges stem from three alleged incidents: . â€¢ In 2008, Thornsbury allegedly tried to have a friend plant illegal drugs in a metal box under the husband's pickup truck. The friend agreed to do it but never went through with it, according to the indictment. As part of the scheme, the judge had ""purposely cultivated a relationship"" with a state trooper, apparently to have the trooper investigate after the drug plant was done, according to the indictment. â€¢ Thornsbury ""repeatedly insisted"" that the same state trooper get an arrest warrant for the husband, for supposedly stealing ""scrap mine bits"" from the coal company where he worked and selling them. The husband was subsequently arrested, but charges were dismissed. Callahan, the attorney for the husband, said not only did the man have permission to take and sell the scrap bits that were ""refurbished,"" then sold back to his company, the company approved of the practice. â€¢ Thornsbury allegedly seized upon an argument between the husband and some of his relatives to cause the arrest of the husband a month after the argument. A family dispute in 2012 led to one of the husband's relatives pulling a gun outside a convenience store, according to the indictment. The husband called police, and even though investigating officers saw a store videotape of the incident and they concluded the relative was the aggressor, Thornsbury allegedly persuaded another officer to arrest the husband weeks later on charges of assault and battery. Charges were later dismissed. Thornsbury has been Mingo County's sole circuit judge since 1997, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office. Thornsbury was first appointed to the state bench by the then-governor to fill a vacancy 1997, according to Jennifer Bundy, public information officer for the state Supreme Court of Appeals. Thornsbury subsequently was elected to serve as circuit judge.","Michael Thornsbury, 57, is arraigned on two counts of conspiracy against rights .

"(CNN) -- Brendan McDonough, a lookout for his elite 20-man Arizona wildfire-fighting crew, saw Sunday's blaze change directions and warned his team by radio from his hilltop perch. The new conditions, he told them, also were forcing him to leave that spot, officials recalled Tuesday. He did as he was trained, officials said. And because he did, McDonough might have escaped his own death by seconds. McDonough was trying to go to another lookout point when the Yarnell Hill fire killed 19 members of Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots, Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward said. The incident, part of a fire that has burned more than 8,400 acres since Friday, produced the deadliest day for firefighters since the 9/11 attacks. ""He [McDonough] was doing what he was supposed to do,"" Ward told CNN. ""The crew was doing what they need to do. This is why they call this kind of thing an accident."" Honoring the fallen . Ward, who confirmed McDonough's name and job Tuesday, said McDonough is having a hard time dealing with his comrades' deaths and wasn't ready to talk. In a statement released through a fire official Tuesday, McDonough said he was grateful for the public's ""outpouring of support towards his organization,"" and he asked for privacy for his family and his comrades' relatives. ""Everyone can appreciate that he's working though the process of dealing with this loss, and that could last for some time,"" said Bob Orrill, a regional incident commander helping the fire department. Opinion: When heroes face down fire -- and fate . 'His lookout had already burned over' McDonough was overlooking his teammates when he told them the ""weather was changing rapidly,"" and winds moved the fire in a different direction, Wade told reporters Tuesday. Wade didn't have particulars, but he said the changes amounted to a ""trigger point"" -- previously agreed conditions that would require him to go to another spot. McDonough, as prescribed, told the crew he was leaving, and that ""he would contact them and they could contact him if they needed anything,"" Wade said. He went down the hill and met a supervisor of a different hotshot crew. Hotshot crews such as McDonough's are elite teams that are called to get close to the blaze, dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it. McDonough turned around. He apparently left just in time. ""The location that he was at at his lookout had already burned over,"" Wade said. ""He got in (a) vehicle (with the other team's supervisor) and was taken to a safety zone."" Perhaps a mile or two away from McDonough's original location -- Wade didn't know Sunday's particulars, but he said that's typically the distance between lookout and crew -- the fire overcame the 19. The deaths are under investigation, but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters, blankets meant to protect against flames and heat, as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them. Wildfire battle shadowed by losses . 'You cannot immediately drop somebody in another position' One Prescott official, speaking with Wade at the news conference in Prescott Tuesday, told reporters that it was protocol to have a hotshot lookout in place at all times. The officials there said they didn't know whether another lookout was in place when McDonough moved. Either way, Wade said, McDonough ""was doing his job and the hotshot crew was doing their job."" ""You cannot immediately drop somebody in another position,"" Wade said. ""There are lookouts in the air ... as well as other lookouts. He left his post based on protocol, and we was moving to a new position."" The Prescott community has taken the deaths hard. Many attended a memorial service at the city's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University campus Monday. A tribute outside Prescott Fire Station No. 7 grew that day, with flowers, American flags and signs placed on or near a fence that separated the station from a road. The tokens also included 19 bottles of water, arranged in a circle. On Monday, the Prescott fire chief also told reporters -- without identifying McDonough at the time -- that the 20th member was struggling. ""Unfortunately, we have very few words to express that kind of sorrow, but we understood each other,"" Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo said Monday. ""When you take a person in your arms and you hug them, you don't have to say too much."" How to help .","NEW: Lookout warned his team, then left post as prescribed, officials say .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Baby showers herald the transition to motherhood. Roses, greeting cards and invitations to lunch, celebrate mothers every May -- well at least in most parts of the world. In Africa by and large the story isn't so rosy. Every 90 seconds, somewhere in the world, a woman dies from a pregnancy-related complication; for them and their families there will be no Mother's Day ever. On this glorious day, I want to put a spin on what we are all celebrating and ask each woman to take a moment to think about the thousands of women across Kenya and millions across Africa who may never celebrate Mother's Day. The process of becoming a mother --pregnancy - can be difficult and sometimes life threatening. We don't like to talk about these difficulties and dangers. After all Africa is a continent of strong women. Myths and tales are told about how we give birth in the bush and minutes later we are on our feet going to fetch firewood or water. I think what's even more startling is the fact that when these women pass away, no one remembers them or eulogizes them. You will be hard pressed to find an obituary item that says ""she lost her life, giving life."" For these women and their families, there is no Mother's Day. That's why this year, I ask you to heed my call and that of Amref and stand up for African Mothers, wherever they may be. According to the World Health Organization's Trends in Maternal Mortality Report: . • Every 90 seconds a woman dies from a pregnancy related complication, that's 1,000 women a day . • 90% of these deaths are preventable . • 99% of maternal deaths that took place in 2008 (most recent data from 2010 study) occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (57%) and South Asia (30%) • 50% of all maternal deaths take place during the first 48 hours after delivery. The causes for these astounding figures are not limited to the inability of women to access a health facility due to transportation costs; only 10% of women deliver at a health facility where a skilled birth attendant is present. Read more: African women need a hand-up not a hand-out . In most African rural areas, expectant mothers are mostly taken care of by traditional birth attendants at their households, rather than at hospitals. The typical and entrenched mentality is that ""since my mom and mom's mom delivered at home, why can't I?"" But the harsh truth is that poorly equipped with merely a kanga (garment) and razor blade, even the most experienced midwife in the village will find it impossible to handle deadly labor complications such as hemorrhage and high blood pressure. Another reason behind the high maternal mortality in Africa is women's inferior social status. African women's perceived inferiority to men leads to school dropouts and forced early marriages. A woman without proper education would not be self-protective in terms of reproductive health and a girl barely into her teens forced into early marriage risks her unprepared body in intercourse, both of which may raise the maternal death odds. To reduce maternal mortality and strengthen the poorly functioning health system a holistic strategy is necessary to be implemented. Without political will and good stewardship to revamp the health care system women will continue to die needlessly. It's up to you and I to stand up for African Mothers. No woman should die while giving life. Every year 1.5 million African children are left without a mother. For them, there will be no Mother's day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Caroline Mutoko.","Kenyan radio presenter Caroline Mutoko highlights maternal mortality in Africa .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Six years ago an ad in the Sunday paper changed a young Pakistani woman's life and made aviation history. Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country's F-7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far. The ad read: ""Pakistan Air Force recruiting females cadets."" Back then Ambreen Gul was 20-years old and living in Karachi. Her mother wanted her to be a doctor. She remembers her reaction when she told her she wants to fly. ""She was like: 'You're a girl,'"" says Gul. ""How will you do it? How will you fly?"" The following day Gul took the first step in proving her mother wrong. She was among the first in line at the recruitment center. For nearly six decades it was only men who had flown Pakistan's fighter jets. Today Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan's F-7 supersonic fighter jets. ""This is a feeling that makes you proud and makes you humble also,"" says Gul. Humility doesn't mean lack of confidence. ""We can do everything better than the men,"" explains cadet Nida Tariq. ""We're more hardworking, more consistent and more patient,"" adds cadet Anam Faiq. To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Pakistan, where the halls are lined with grainy black-and-white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force. The training is often intensely physical. Here, equal opportunity means equal treatment. If they are not good enough as per their male counterparts, we don't let them fly,"" says commanding officer Tanvir Piracha. Some of Pakistan's female pilots wear hijabs. Others prefer to go without the Muslim headdress. Most say changing the misconception of Muslim women is just as important as serving their country. ""Islam gives equal opportunity to females. Whatever we want to do we can,"" says pilot Nadia Gul. ""To tell you the truth I've been given equal opportunity or I suppose more than men have been given,"" says Air Force cadet Sharista Beg. Air Force officials say fighter pilots are playing a vital role in the fight against the Taliban. They're training in counterinsurgency, collecting aerial intelligence and targeting militant strongholds in the treacherous mountains of Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Ambreen Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat. ""I would give my life for my country,"" she says. But women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it's never been done in Pakistan. It's another barrier Gul plans to break.","Ambreen Gul is one of seven women trained to fly F-7 supersonic fighter jet .

"(CNN) -- Teresa Heinz Kerry left a Boston rehabilitation hospital Saturday nearly three weeks after she experienced a seizure at her Nantucket, Massachusetts, home. The 74-year-old wife of Secretary of State John Kerry walked out of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and is expected to fully recover at home ""after some limited outpatient treatment,"" said Glen Johnson, a spokesman for the secretary. She has returned to routine family activities ""and looks forward to the same with her civic works after a period of rest,"" he said. ""It was amazing, a miracle,"" Heinz Kerry, 74, said of her care and caregivers, according to the statement. ""They are the kindest people, who love what they do and do it superbly well."" Heinz Kerry suffered the seizure on Nantucket on July 7, underwent tests at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and was then moved to Spaulding. Born in Mozambique, Heinz Kerry worked for the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations in the 1960s when she moved to the United States. Her first husband, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, died in a plane crash in 1991. Heinz Kerry spoke to CNN's Larry King in 2010 about her battle with breast cancer. He asked her whether she was frightened.

"(CNN) -- A group of 20 tourists, including two Americans, who were trapped at sea on a drifting ice floe in the Canadian Arctic are now safe after a stroke of luck. Their sheet of ice bumped into another one early Wednesday, the Canadian coast guard said. The second ice floe was touching land. ""They were able to walk from one ice floe to the other to land,"" marine coordinator Christian Cafiti said. ""Everyone is safe and sound."" A rescue plane dropped survival kits onto the 3Â½-square-mile frozen sheet Tuesday, after the expedition alerted authorities to their plight. The kits included satellite phones, inflatable rafts and food rations. The plane kept an eye on them while they waited for helicopters to arrive. When the copters arrived early Wednesday, bad weather prevented them from hoisting the group on board. They are standing by to airlift them to an Arctic station. ""We are having regular conversations with them through satellite phone,"" Cafiti said. The tourists do not appear to be in danger of exposure. They are dressed warmly and have been able to remain dry. Camping surprise . The tourists were camping on the ice when the frozen sheet -- three times the size of New York City's Central Park -- broke free early Tuesday, carried off by the tide. ""Ice breaking off is a very common thing at this time of year,"" Canadian air force spokesman Steven Neta said. The floe drifted two miles away from land and appeared to start to crumble, Neta said. Had it fallen apart, the three rubber rafts were more than large enough to hold the whole group. The cold also was not too harsh. Even that far north, daytime highs in June often rise well above freezing. More than 220 rescued from ice floes off Latvian coast .

"(CNN) -- An SUV slammed into a Cadillac, sending it through the front wall of a Kansas City day care center Tuesday, seriously injuring three children in the building, officials in the western Missouri city said. The three children and an adult -- identified by police as the driver of the SUV -- were taken to hospitals with serious but non-life-threatening injuries, city communications director Danny Rotert said. The crash left a gaping hole in the front of Christian Academy Child Care, where about 40 children were when the Cadillac punched through around 1 p.m. (2 p.m. CT), Kansas City police Capt. Tye Grant said. The driver of the Cadillac, which for a time trapped two children in the building, ran from the scene, Grant said. However, James Garrett, with the Kansas City Fire Department, later said that the Cadillac was unoccupied. It was parked, he said. The incident started, police say, with the SUV rear-ending the car outside the child care center on 27th Street in central Kansas City. The Cadillac was propelled into the gray one-story building, coming to rest inside, Grant said. Aerial video from CNN affiliate KMBC showed the SUV, its front crumpled, just outside the front of the building, along with a huge hole and debris scattered on the sidewalk. Workers on Tuesday afternoon were trying to shore up the front of the building to ensure it wouldn't collapse, Rotert said. They then planned to take the Cadillac out of the facility. Officials believed that all children have been accounted for, ""but we are still searching,"" Grant said Tuesday afternoon.

"(CNN) -- For his victims, Thursday was roughly a decade in coming. That's when Ariel Castro learned his fate for abducting and raping three women -- Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus -- over a period of approximately 10 years. He pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts in a deal that eliminated the possibility of the death penalty. For a man who sought to control the lives of others, the sentencing hearing was a stark reminder of how fortunes can change. Castro, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, sat handcuffed at the defendant's table. He was told he would spend the rest of his life behind bars. In contrast, his victims -- one of whom addressed the court and two of whom did so through representatives -- spoke about their new-found freedom. The script was flipped. Here's a look at five extraordinary moments from court: . 1. Castro gets millennium in prison; judge hails victims who ""have persevered"" Judge Michael Russo did not mince words when he handed down Castro's sentence, amounting to life in prison plus 1,000 years. ""Sir, there's no place in this city. There is no place in this country. Indeed, there is no place in this world for those who enslave others,"" he said. Contrary to the defendant's testimony, Russo characterized Castro as a ""victimizer,"" not a victim. ""You made them slaves and you treated them as if they were not people, that they were just sex objects,"" the judge said. ""You don't deserve to be out in our community. You're too dangerous because in your mind, you're a victim, again, as opposed to those who actually did suffer."" Castro interrupted Russo periodically to argue certain points. He took issue with being described as a ""violent sexual predator."" Russo claimed Castro was capable of choosing who he victimized, and elected to take advantage of young women. ""You felt you were dominating them but you were incorrect. You could not take away their dignity,"" he said. ""Although they suffered terribly, Ms. Knight, Ms. DeJesus and Ms. Berry did not give up hope. They have persevered. ""In fact, they prevailed. These remarkable women again have their freedom, which is the most precious aspect of being an American. ""Mr. Castro you forfeited that right. You now become a number with the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. You will be confined for the remainder of your days."" 2. Knight speaks defiantly, eloquently: ""Years turned into eternity"" Knight was the only one of Castro's victims to speak directly in court. Flanked by her attorneys, she painted a damning portrait of her former captor and rapist, and touched on the time she spent under his roof. ""I cried every night. I was so alone,"" she said, wiping tears from her face. ""I worried about what would happen to me and the other girls every day,"" Knight said. ""Days never got shorter. Days turned into nights. Nights turned into days. Years turned into eternity. I knew nobody cared about me."" She called Castro a hypocrite for going to church and coming home to abuse her and the other women. The death penalty would be too easy, Knight told Castro, who sat stoically behind her as she spoke. ""I spent 11 years in hell. Now your hell is just beginning,"" she said. Knight said she could forgive Castro, but that she will never forget. She hopes to help other victims of abuse. ""I know that there is a lot of people going through hard times, but we need to reach out a hand and hold them, and let them know that they're being heard,"" Knight said. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard. And it's liberating."" 3. Castro: ""I don't know why"" For the first time at length in court, Castro spoke, offering a window into how he thinks. His roughly 16-minute statement was rambling. He spoke of what he considers his sexual addiction, and defended parts of his personality. He said he is a ""happy person inside."" Finally, Castro apologized. ""These people are trying to paint me as a monster, and I'm not a monster. I'm sick,"" he said. Castro told the court he was a victim of sex abuse as a child and struggled throughout life with addiction. He compared his behavior to that of alcoholics. ""I did not prey on these women. I just acted on my sexual instincts because of my sexual addiction, and God as my witness, I never beat these women like they're trying to say that I did,"" he said. Captives' hellish live inside Castro's home . Castro described taking his first victim. ""When I got up that day, I did not say, 'Oh, I'm going to get up and try to find some women,' because it just wasn't my character. But I know it's wrong,"" he said. ""I'm not trying to make excuses here. I know I'm 100% wrong for doing that."" Castro apologized to Berry, Knight and DeJesus, and asked for their forgiveness. He became emotional and his voice broke. ""I am truly sorry for what happened. To this day, I am trying to answer my own questions. I don't know why,"" he said. ""I just hope they can find it in their hearts to forgive me. Because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home."" 4. ""She loves and she is loved,"" spokeswoman says of DeJesus . Sylvia Colon, a family member and spokeswoman, addressed the court on behalf of DeJesus. ""Today we will close this chapter of our lives,"" she said. Colon asked for privacy for her family and for DeJesus, who she said is thriving. ""She laughs, she swims, she dances, and more importantly she loves and she is loved,"" Colon said. ""She lives not as a victim, but as a survivor. Her insurmountable will to prevail is the only story worth discussing."" Colon addressed Castro directly at one point. She turned to face him and spoke in Spanish, asking that God have mercy on his soul. She also addressed members of the Castro family, saying that her family does not blame them. ""We are saddened that you are burdened with this horror and will unfortunately forever be tied to these atrocities,"" she said. ""Please know that we do not hold you accountable and pray that you can one day be whole again."" Colon continued: ""Our family recognizes it is not for us to judge or determine any punishment. Only our higher power can do that."" 5. Berry's sister: ""Amanda's concern is that her daughter will hear about things"" Castro's third victim, Berry, was represented in court by her sister, Beth Serrano. Her statement was short and to the point. Like the spokeswoman for DeJesus, she asked for privacy and said that her family member is getting stronger by the day. ""She is strong, beautiful, inside and out, and is doing better every day,"" Serrano said, describing her sister as her best friend and the best person she knows. She said Berry does not want people to talk or write about what happened. Her sister wants to protect her daughter, Serrano said. ""Amanda's concern is that her daughter will hear about things, or read about things, said by the wrong people, the wrong way, at the wrong time -- before Amanda thinks the time is right to tell her daughter."" Berry had no control over anything for a long time, said Serrano. ""Please let her have control over this, so she can protect her daughter.""","Ten centuries in prison for Castro, a speech of defiance from his victim .

"(CNN) -- As speculation grows over Edward Snowden's path to freedom, WikiLeaks teased that his ""flight of liberty"" campaign starts Wednesday, promising further details. But so far, WikiLeaks has not lived up to the Twitter promise to provide more details. And the questions are piling up. Is the future of the U.S. intelligence leaker, grounded at Moscow's airport for more than two weeks, no longer up in the air? Not so fast. It's unclear whether Snowden has accepted anyone's offer of asylum. And if he has, how does he intend to get there? Speculation centers on Venezuela, which was the first to offer asylum. With both sides expressing interest, it only appeared to be a matter of time before it is confirmed. Venezuela extended the asylum offer to Snowden last week, and on Monday President Nicolas Maduro received a formal asylum request from Snowden. Just who is Edward Snowden? There were flurries of information Tuesday after a tweet by a Russia lawmaker announced that Snowden had accepted Venezuela's offer of asylum. But the lawmaker who sent the tweet, Russian parliamentary spokesman Alexei Pushkov, deleted the message. WikiLeaks, which has been assisting Snowden in his asylum bid, denied the report in a Twitter post. ""The states concerned will make the announcement if and when the appropriate time comes,"" WikiLeaks said. ""The announcement will then be confirmed by us."" If Snowden does accept, it resolves one issue in the saga, but sets the stage for the next chapter: How will he get from Moscow to Caracas? Creative maneuvering . The trick would seem to be avoiding U.S. airspace or the airspace of nations friendly to the United States. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who faces espionage charges, would be wise to take a chartered jet on a route that goes over water the entire time, former CIA analyst Allen Thomson told Foreign Policy. ""Leave Moscow,"" he told the Foreign Policy. ""Fly north to the Barents Sea, thence over to and through the Denmark Strait. Continue south, steering clear of Newfoundland until getting to the east of the Windward Islands. Fly through some convenient gap between islands and continue on to Caracas."" Kirk Koenig, president of Expert Aviation Consulting, told CNN that such a route would probably work, as it avoids the airspace of any countries that may try to ground the plane. ""That would probably be his only choice,"" he said. Such a flight would not come cheap -- about $200,000 -- Koenig said. ""Where it gets more interesting is if they try to put him on an Aeroflot Russian Airlines flight nonstop to Havana, Cuba,"" he said. ""The smart move would be to put him there as a passenger and hope nobody notices."" Would other countries make a commercial passenger jet land if they believe Snowden is on board? Given what happened to Bolivian President Evo Morales, it's possible, Koenig said. Opinion: Why we're all stuck in the digital transit zone with Snowden . No place to fly . Last week, several European countries wouldn't let Morales' plane fly through their airspace, allegedly because of rumors that Snowden was aboard. The presidential aircraft instead made an unscheduled stop in Vienna, Austria, which became a sore spot for Morales and sparked outrage throughout Latin America. On Tuesday, members of the Organization of American States passed a resolution condemning the incident, calling for France, Italy, Portugal and Spain to formally apologize. The United States and Canada dissented. Security Clearance: No end in sight for NSA leak fallout . As speculation swirled about Snowden's next move, Maduro took the United States to task in a speech to military academy graduates, accusing Washington of persecuting Morales and threatening his life. ""Under those circumstances, several Latin American countries have decided for dignity and as a clear message to the empire, that we're not afraid of it, that the children of Bolivar do not fear the empire,"" Maduro said in a speech broadcast Tuesday on Telesur, a TV network based in Caracas. Obama administration keeps close watch . Officials in national security agencies and on Capitol Hill were watching closely Wednesday for any signs that Snowden was preparing to leave Moscow for asylum in Venezuela. Some are questioning Maduro's motivation, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information involved. U.S. officials believe Maduro's decision to offer asylum to Snowden is aimed more at boosting the Venezuelan president's standing at home rather than engaging in any direct anti-American effort, according to an assessment by the Obama administration that the officials described to CNN.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney won the Republican caucuses in Washington state, according to unofficial results early Sunday, giving the former Massachusetts governor a shot in the arm heading into Super Tuesday contests. With 99% of the vote in, Romney had 38%. Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 25% and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum had 24%. They were trailed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at 10%. At stake in the contest are 40 delegates. ""We're in a good second place, but the good news is we're doing very, very well in getting delegates,"" Paul told supporters in Seattle, when about half of the vote had been counted. ""The enthusiasm for the cause of liberty continues to grow exponentially."" Washington's caucuses come just three days before Super Tuesday, when 10 states hold primaries and caucuses. And because of that, all four major GOP presidential candidates campaigned in the state, hoping a strong finish would carry over to Tuesday. State GOP chairman Kirby Wilbur predicted a large turnout and estimated between 500 and 1,500 did not vote in Kennewick city because of overcrowding. ""The leadership might have been unprepared for the turnout, but I don't know what else they can do when you rent the largest facility in the county,"" he said. Even as caucuses began Saturday in Washington, the focus was shifting to Super Tuesday states. Romney campaigned in Cincinnati, where he took aim at President Barack Obama. ""He's out of ideas. He's out of excuses. And in 2012, we're going to make sure he's out of a job,"" he told a cheering crowd. Romney got a boost earlier this week from wins in Arizona, Wyoming and Michigan. His win in Washington would be his eighth this election cycle. Santorum similarly campaigned in the Ohio town of Blue Ash. ""This was the industrial heartland of the country,"" he said. ""They now refer to it as the Rust Belt. After ... I take the corporate tax for manufacturers, eliminate it, cut it to zero -- we're going to be the stainless-steel belt across this country."" But in the days before the caucuses, the attention was on Washington state, as all four candidates made the long trip to the Pacific Northwest. ""This is the first time any one GOP presidential candidate has paid attention to us in recent memory, and my memory goes back to the 1970s,"" Wilbur said. ""We used to be the ugly sister invited to the dance, but no one asked to dance. Now we are the princess."" Wilbur said that the state's contest used to follow Super Tuesday, when in most cycles the battle for the nomination was basically over. Santorum, campaigning Thursday in Pasco, told supporters, ""You are the voice that is going to speak very loudly before Super Tuesday and put this race on a whole other plane."" Romney, who campaigned in Washington on Friday, sounded a similar theme. ""There are a bunch of states that are going to make up their minds on Tuesday, but you guys are first, and so your voice is going to be heard,"" Romney said at a campaign event in Bellevue. Paul campaigned in Washington two weeks ago and was back in the state Friday and Saturday. He was also running campaign commercials in Washington, as was Gingrich, who made a swing through the state last week. The caucuses are open, meaning independent voters and Democrats can take part in the GOP contest. While some smaller caucus meetings were held in private homes, most gatherings were larger and held in public places, such as schools, and included multiple precincts. Besides voting for delegates, caucus-goers voted in a nonbinding GOP presidential preference straw poll. While delegates to the GOP convention in Tampa, Florida, won't be determined until later rounds of voting this spring, major news organizations, including CNN, will make proportional delegate estimates based on Saturday's presidential straw poll results. The state GOP projected that 40,000 to 60,000 people would take part in the caucuses, up from the 12,616 who participated in the 2008 Republican caucuses. There was also a primary on the Republican side four years ago, with around a half million voters casting ballots.","NEW: State GOP chairman says between 500 and 1,500 did not vote in Kennewick city .

"Washington (CNN) -- A typo kept President Barack Obama from signing legislation designed to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays, a congressional source told CNN. But the fix is going into effect anyway, and the system will be back to normal by Sunday, the FAA said. The holdup was caused by an ""s"" missing from uses of the word ""accounts."" The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts to prevent having to furlough controllers. But the way the Senate version of the bill read would have limited the source of funds to an ""account."" The House fixed the typo in the version it passed Friday, and the Senate plans to fix it Tuesday, a senior House GOP aide told CNN. The FAA ""is not impacted,"" the source said. The FAA issued a statement Saturday, saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and that ""the system will resume normal operations by Sunday evening."" Read more: House OKs measure designed to end controller furloughs . The story was first reported by ABC News. In rare bipartisan accord, normally quarrelsome U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as delays snarled traffic at airports. The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts. It also allows authorities to protect 149 control towers at small- and medium-sized airports that are slated for closure for budgetary reasons. Five things to know about FAA furloughs . Since Sunday, more than 3,000 flights had been delayed because of the furloughs, the FAA said. The furloughs were unavoidable, the agency said, because it lacked the flexibility to avert them without action by Congress. The furloughs affected some 15,000 FAA air traffic controllers. Cost-cutting measures such as the furloughs and the planned closures of towers that are privately run or overseen by federal aviation regulators have become part of the debate on government spending. They have been highlighted by many to illustrate a clear nationwide consequence of the $85 billion in government-wide cuts that took effect in March and may otherwise not be apparent to the public. Many Democrats miffed FAA cuts were reversed without concessions . CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Obama can't sign the bill until a missing ""s"" is fixed .

"(CNN) -- A photographer suspected of taking topless vacation pictures of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, last year was placed under formal investigation in June, a spokeswoman for the Nanterre prosecutor said Friday. A second photographer is also expected to be placed under formal investigation ""soon,"" the spokeswoman said. The editor of the French edition of Closer magazine, Laurence Pieau, was placed under formal investigation in July for having published the photographs last September, according to the prosecutor's spokeswoman. The latest developments in the case had not been made public until now. The decision by the French Closer magazine to publish the photographs of Catherine, taken while she was on vacation with Prince William last September, sparked a debate over privacy -- and legal action by the royals. Mondadori France, the magazine's publisher, was placed under investigation earlier this year, as were an unnamed female photographer and La Provence, a regional daily newspaper which also published the photographs. The grainy topless pictures, shot from a distance, were snapped while Catherine was sunbathing in private during a vacation at a chateau owned by William's uncle in Provence, southern France. Closer was fined last September for publishing the topless photographs and ordered not to distribute the magazine in print or online. A French court also ordered the magazine to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling. The photographs subsequently appeared in outlets in other countries, including Denmark, Italy and Sweden. No media outlet in Britain published the images. The Duchess of Cambridge made headlines for a different reason this week, having given birth on Monday to a son, Prince George. The royal baby, whose arrival was greeted with great fanfare by the media, is third-in-line to the throne.

"WASHINGTON -- President Obama said Thursday he intends to nominate a top Los Angeles International Airport police department official to head the Transportation Security Administration, the agency charged with protecting airplanes and other forms of transportation from terrorists. Erroll Southers has served as the state's deputy director of homeland security and a special agent with the FBI. Erroll Southers currently is the department's chief of homeland security and intelligence. His name had been floated for the federal job earlier this year and was warmly received by unions and airport screeners, who say Southers will embrace collective bargaining for screeners. Now ""the question of bargaining rights at TSA is not a matter of 'if' but 'when,' "" said John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, in a statement applauding the choice. ""We are confident that the appointment of Mr. Southers as administrator will help put that matter to bed."" Screeners had an often hostile relationship with the Bush administration, which opposed unionization, saying it would hinder the agency's ability to quickly respond to emergencies. The airport's police department, which Southers has helped manage since early 2007, is the largest such operation in the country, with approximately 1,200 employees. His new job would give him much greater responsibilities, managing the TSA's roughly 50,000 employees. Those employees include some 45,000 screeners, known as transportation security officers, who provide security at 450 airports nationwide, and an undisclosed number of federal air marshals -- plainclothes officers tasked with preventing or interrupting hijackings. ""Sorry to see him go, actually,"" said Marshall McClain, president of the Los Angeles Airport Peace Officers Association. ""Out of the new management team, I would say he was the most well-received and most well-liked."" McClain said Southers brought more weaponry to the department's tactical team, increased the focus on intelligence, and had the team train with security forces from Israel's El Al Airlines. ""Some of the things that the Israelis do may just shock the consciousness of the U.S., but they are second to none,"" McClain said. ""He did step up the game quite a bit."" Obama's announcement sets in motion a confirmation process that will begin with the Senate Commerce Committee collecting background information on Southers. A confirmation hearing will come later, after Southers is formally nominated. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Thursday praised Obama's choice, saying Southers' ""expertise in counterterrorism and airport security will be a great asset to the department."" In addition to serving as assistant chief of the Los Angeles Airport Police, Southers is associate director at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events at the University of Southern California. Previously, he served as the state's deputy director of homeland security, and as a police officer with the Santa Monica Police Department and special agent with the FBI. The administration said Southers is a senior fellow at the University of California-Los Angeles School of Public Affairs and holds a bachelor's degree from Brown University as well as a master's degree from the University of Southern California, where he is currently pursuing a doctorate in policy, planning and development.","Erroll Southers is chief of homeland security of airport's police department .

"Moscow (CNN) -- At least 141 people have died as floodwaters surge through southern Russia's Krasnodar region, state-run media reported Sunday, citing Russia's Interior Ministry. Of those killed, 130 are in the Krymsk district, nine in Gelendzhik district and two in the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, the ministry said, according to Russia's RIA Novosti news agency. The flash floods follow heavy rains since Friday. Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the affected areas, meeting with local officials and surveying damage from the air. The Krymsk district is a mostly rural area with many one-story homes, Russia's state news agency Itar-Tass reported. Devastating India floods leave 95 dead, millions homeless . Floodwaters rose 7 meters (23 feet) overnight in Krymsk, the news agency said, flooding homes while most people were still asleep. Others were rescued by police after seeking refuge on roofs and in trees, it said. The death toll has climbed steadily through the day as the waters have gradually subsided, allowing police to find more bodies in flooded buildings in Krymsk. Television footage from the Krasnodar region showed scenes of flooded streets, stranded vehicles and people wading through torrents of knee-deep muddy water outside homes. The state-run Ria Novosti news agency said dozens of passenger trains have been diverted in the region as the water level remains 19 inches above the tracks. Krasnodar also suffered deadly flooding in October 2010, when torrential rains in mountainous areas caused rivers to overflow, flooding villages nearby.

"(CNN) -- When Joseph Altuzarra sent a model down the runway in an enormous black-and-white intarsia fox fur coat on Saturday, Elle's Anne Slowey tweeted,""(Cruella de Vil) eat your heart out."" This, oddly enough, would not be the only time a ready-to-wear look would be compared to the pelt-wearing villain's wardrobe during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. As fashion week faded to black Thursday with the final shows by Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs, the stylish affair ended exactly the way it started -- with fur, fur, everywhere, from fox to raccoon to mink. On opening day, BCBG Max Azria showed off a collection inspired by Istanbul's architecture and the gypsies of southern Europe. Amid the layers of chunky knit sweaters and patterned tunics were knee-length, patterned fur vests and cropped fur jackets. It's not only real pelts prancing the catwalk. Designers such as Anna Sui, Jeremy Scott and Christian Siriano accented their offerings with faux fur elements. ""This is almost the golden age in fur,"" said Charles Ross, the Head of International Marketing for Saga Furs. ""Our skin prices are going up 20-30% every year."" All this fur fervor raises the question: Is using real animal hide worth the potential controversy? After all, it's difficult to forget the great raccoon incident of '96, in which an animal-rights activist served Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour a dead raccoon at her lunch at the Four Seasons. We haven't seen a paint-splashed mink in the headlines lately. Is it possible the moral outrage over the use of animal skin is over? Veteran furrier Dennis Basso celebrated his brand's 30th anniversary with a runway collection of dazzling gowns and statement furs. And relative newcomer Brandon Sun, who previously worked in the fur departments for J. Mendel and Oscar de la Renta, displayed 20 ensembles, incorporating Blackglama mink and fox fur. Non-fur-centric designers, like BCBG, played with fur collars, hats, capes, stoles and detailing. There was fur in natural hues, as well as dyed. There were even furry boots. Photos: Fashion Week in a flash . ""Fur is the most luxurious thing you can use down the runway,"" said Lubov Azria, chief creative officer for Max Azria designs, and Max's wife. Lubov said the brand uses both real and faux fur in its designs, but the runway entices artistic extravagance. Mathieu Mirano's fall presentation was pelt-heavy, including a nude tulle gown with black fox fur panels. For Mirano, an upstart in the business at just 21, the appeal comes from fur's versatility. ""You can use it on a coat, a jacket, or even a dress,"" Mirano said. ""You can pair it with leather, sequins, wool."" Mirano said his brand is all about specialty, luxury fabrics, and fur matches that particular mindset. The furry look is right on trend for fall and winter of 2013, according to fashion forecaster WGSN. Meanwhile, around the tents, many attendees cloaked themselves in fur to keep warm amid the historic snowfall that buried the Northeast in the middle of Fashion Week. Industry experts like Ross attribute the fur frenzy to its newfound accessibility -- no longer associated only with the rich, grandmotherly set, it has caught on with a younger, hipper crowd. Fur is also more widely available to consumers. It's not exclusive to specialty fur boutiques like Dennis Basso's Madison Avenue store. High-end department stores now carry scads of the fluffy stuff. But the fur-lined autumn and winter collections are a sharp contrast to Vaute Couture's presentation last Wednesday, which was billed as the first all-vegan independent fashion house to show during New York Fashion Week. Vegan couture: Faux meets fabulous . The label's founder opted for organic cotton velvets and velveteen, colorful faux fur and soy fiber knits. Joshua Katcher, who crafted the animal-free men's shoes for Vaute's presentation, said the use of leather and fur is tough to rationalize now because of the technological advances of faux products. Saga's Ross disagreed: ""The studies have shown that faux fur is an environmental nightmare. That it's a non-biodegradable product made from petroleum whereas fur is very biodegradable and has a long shelf-life."" But Ross also contends that designers now feel more confident using the real deal after examining the chain of production and finding it humane. According to the European Fur Breeders' Association, the E.U. is the world's largest producer of factory farmed fur. Farms like Saga's are governed by E.U. farming regulations. China is the second largest worldwide producer of fur pelts, but the country is often lambasted for its lack of regulation. Fur farming is currently banned in the United Kingdom, Croatia and Austria. ""Fur is not for everybody,"" Ross said. ""For people that have made the decision not to use fur, we certainly respect that. But, other people should also respect the right for a designer to use it."" Saga's fur auction house, located in western Finland, supplies fox, mink and Finn raccoon to more than 400 designers globally, many of which are showing at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Another reason for the fur boom is that companies like Saga are wooing and supporting young designers. Saga operates a research facility in Copenhagen, the Saga Design Centre, and invites established and emerging designers to visit and experiment with new techniques. In the case of anticipated newcomers who might not have the capital to purchase the high-end product, Ross said the Design Centre will make an investment in their first collection by providing a couple of pelts. More than 25,000 fashion industry workers have visited the center since it opened in 1988, according to Saga's website. As for faux fur, designers say imitation is the best form of flattery. ""I think the use of real fur vs. faux fur is up to the designer and the wearer. I prefer real fur, it's more luxe,"" designer Mirano said. ""A woman should have options and I think a lot of people do buy synthetic furs,"" Lubov said, adding that he thinks the product still needs further development. Still, staunchly anti-fur designers argue it's as simple as changing the perception of luxury -- and the definition of cool. ""In the fashion world, being a villain is definitely a sought after aesthetic and that's a problem for ethical designers because we come across as the do-gooders,"" Katcher said.

"(CNN) -- Fans of ""Dancing With the Stars"" know how grueling the competition can be. Contestants practice for hours a day, and almost every season some celebs are brought low by injury. So how in the world will Valerie Harper, who just months ago announced that she had a terminal form of cancer, go for that mirror ball trophy? Apparently with the same spirit that caused the ""Rhoda"" actress to offer this up for fans: . ""I hope you dance! I hope you dance,"" Harper told CNN on Wednesday. "" And that's what I'm saying to everybody, that's just my message. Dance."" 'DWTS' thinks big for 17th season cast . Harper announced in March that she had been diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a condition in which cancer cells spread into the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. But Harper told CNN that she does not have brain cancer. ""I have lung cancer,"" she said. ""It is situated in the lining of the brain; it's not even in the brain."" Her husband, Tony Cacciotti, encouraged her to sign on with the hit ABC dance competition, she said. He runs the couple's production company and had been considering her participation for a few years. The actress said she initially resisted the idea. ""I said, 'Give me one good reason,' "" Harper recalled. ""He said, 'You have cancer! Get up there, and show people that you can dance and do -- and the doctors said it's fine to exercise. Encourage people to move, to exercise, to do all the things that will be good for them, and mainly not to sit in the house and glower and worry and feel sorry for yourself because you have this disease and anything else.'"" Exercise is generally encouraged for patients, according to the American Cancer Society. ""At one time, patients with cancer, especially in the advanced stages, were often told by their doctor to rest and limit their exercise,"" the organization's website says. ""But newer research has shown that exercise is not only safe and possible during cancer treatment, but that it also can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life."" Actress Valerie Harper lives in the moment after cancer diagnosis . Harper, 74, said she has been responding well to treatment, though she disputed reports she is in remission. Thinking about death makes everyone fearful, she said, ""and we gloss it over; we pretend it's not happening, that it's over there."" ""This death sentence made me look it in the eye, and then once you do it, it's a great freedom,"" she said. The show's host, Tom Bergeron, said Harper is in great spirits, even joking with him that ""Hey, I'm past my expiration date!"" ""I think arguably we have some of the (most) poignant story lines of all this season, particularly with Valerie,"" he said. Harper's dance partner for the show, Tristan MacManus, said the actress' participation goes beyond her being ill. ""It's not about someone who's sick doing something,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- What happens on social media doesn't always stay on social media. That may be the unfortunate lesson for those who've recently had private photos accessed and shared due to a privacy gap on the photo-sharing website Photobucket. Nude, explicit, and R-rated images uploaded on the social media site were in some cases made available to view on public Web forums dedicated to exploiting Photobucket's privacy settings. The breach was first reported last week by BuzzFeed. The breach of privacy ""is a very rare occurrence that has affected only a small number of Photobucket's users,"" said Photobucket spokesman David Toner. But the forums, some filled with stolen racy pictures and others with instructions on how to access more, have drawn thousands of viewers. While users who post unencrypted photos on Photobucket can make their albums password protected, individual photos, even in a private album, can be shared with others through a direct web link or URL. Hackers versed in Photobucket's privacy settings can access unencrypted pictures in password-protected albums by using software that deduces the direct web link, a practice commonly known as ""fusking."" With a Photobucket username and a list of common titles for photos, fusking software can extract images from private albums by finding patterns in the posted pictures. For instance, if an album has an image titled IMG_03, hackers may deduce that there is an IMG_06 and IMG_07. They can then access the images by guessing the direct link, even if the photos are in a password protected album. Photobucket says it's aware of fusking and has made efforts to limit the number of accounts hacked. ""Scrambled URLs have been an option for the past two years and will be the default for all new uploads,"" Toner said. ""The company is in the process of reminding users about the option to scramble URLs to prevent fusking."" The scrambled URLs make it more difficult for hackers to guess sequences of images and find those meant to be kept secret. But if users have not applied the encryption, photos may remain vulnerable. ""There are additional technical flags and safeguards in place when we suspect that fusking is being attempted; however, we have also taken several actions that will plug any existing holes that allow this activity,"" Toner added. ""Privacy settings on social media sites just can't keep up with how fast technology is adapting,"" said Ethan Wall, a social media attorney in Miami. ""As sites get more private, hackers and people who want to get more information will continue to get more sophisticated."" The responsibility, however, ultimately rests with the user. ""What you say and do on social media can be used against you and it can be found,"" Wall added. ""If you don't want someone else to see it, don't post it.""","Some private photos on Photobucket were improperly accessed and shared .

"Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- Somber organ music filled a cathedral in northwestern Spain Monday at a memorial Mass for the 79 passengers who perished in last week's train crash. Santiago de Compostela Archbishop Julian Barrio offered prayers for victims and their families, and praised neighbors who lived near the tracks for rushing to help those in need. On a day last week when residents were preparing for a large regional celebration, he said, ""news of the rail accident overwhelmed our souls."" ""Our brothers lost their lives ... when they had so many plans. It is not easy to understand and accept this reality,"" he said, ""but I say to you, let our pain not be wasted. Everything has meaning in our lives. We are not shouting in a vacuum. Our faith tells us that our pain and suffering, joined with that of Christ and the cross, carries us to salvation."" Along with relatives of some of the victims, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and members of Spain's royal family were among those who attended Monday's Mass. Passengers in last week's crash came from near and far -- Europe, Latin America, the United States -- and had almost reached their destination of Ferrol on the northwestern coast when the train careened around a curve and derailed, hurling carriages into a concrete bridge support structure. Five days have passed since the disaster, but many questions remain: What caused the train to derail? Was the train going too fast? And what did the conductor do in the moments before the crash? The driver . The driver of the train, Francisco Jose Garzon, was charged Sunday with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness. A court granted Garzon conditional release, but his license to operate a train has been suspended for six months. He also surrendered his passport and must report to court weekly. Many have questioned how fast the train was traveling when its wheels left the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz told reporters Saturday there are ""rational indications"" that the crash was the fault of the driver. But pressed on what those are, he declined to provide details. Police now have the data recorders from the train. A somber task . Over the weekend, relatives of victims embarked on the grim but necessary task of picking up the luggage left behind. A solemn parade of mourners wheeled bags away from the police station in Santiago de Compostela. The suitcases had been recovered from the wreckage scene, their owners either dead or badly injured. About 70 people injured in the crash remained hospitalized Sunday, including 22 in serious condition, a representative for the regional health department said. Identifying the bodies . Forensic police say all 79 bodies have been identified. The dead include at least 63 from Spain, said Maria Pardo Rios, spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court. Some of the other victims came from the United States, Latin America and Europe. Myrta Fariza was one of the two Americans killed. She and her husband were on their way to a Catholic festival; he was injured and later released from the hospital. ""Myrta was our loving wife, mother, sister, mother-in-law, aunt and friend, and words cannot express our sense of loss,"" her family said in a statement. ""To all who knew her, Myrta provided irreplaceable love, compassion, courage, friendship and support. We will miss her dearly."" The other American was Ana-Maria Cordoba of Arlington, Virginia. Forensic experts said Saturday there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known. Going too fast? The driver of the train has said it was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (120 mph), the Spanish news agency Efe and the national daily El Pais reported, citing sources within the investigation . But a spokeswoman for the national railway Renfe did not disclose the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can go as fast as 250 kph. But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the ""tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast"" -- but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol, on the Atlantic coast, when the crash occurred, the state railway said. Firefighter Miguel Angel Bello said the first four minutes after he arrived on the scene were a desperate race against time. He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames. A young girl in the wreckage called out to him. ""She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home,"" he said. ""But she died."" 'It felt like a roller coaster' Elder Stephen Ward of Utah was headed to the coastal Spanish town, ready to start a two-year Mormon religious mission. The last thing he remembers from the train was flying sideways out of his seat. ""We had been going around some pretty sharp turns. We finally came to one more sharp turn, and the train, like, completely lifted up,"" he said. ""It was leaning sideways. It felt like a roller coaster."" Ward, 18, blacked out when his car slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. ""I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood,"" he said. ""They've scrubbed most of it off me now, but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least."" Ward was discharged from the hospital Thursday, wearing a neck brace because of a cracked vertebra he suffered in the crash. Lacerations on his face are stapled shut, and there's a huge bruise on his leg. Once he recovers, he plans to return to his missionary service. CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Santiago de Compostela and Holly Yan from Atlanta. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo, Laura Smith-Spark, Al Goodman, Bob Hand and Jonathan Helman contributed to this report.","NEW: A memorial Mass at Santiago de Compostela's cathedral honors the 79 killed .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- For many U.S. veterans it's a trip they thought they'd never take; returning to South Korea, the land where so many of their brothers-in-arms lost their lives. A mist hangs in the surrounding hills of the South Korean National Cemetery as dozens of returning veterans gather to honor the dead. It's a difficult but necessary journey for most of them as they commemorate the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the fighting in the Korea War. ""I was in the Pork Chop Hill in July 1953 and I remember the sounds of artillery and fighting. That is not something that you will forget. I never intended to come back to Korea. It's not like I didn't like the country but just didn't need to see it,"" says U.S. veteran Danny Peters. Almost two million Korean civilians lost their lives during the war as well as more than 200,000 South Koreans and about 36,000 American soldiers by the time the ceasefire was declared in 1953.

A lone bugler plays taps as men in their 80s, many dressed in military regalia complete with medals and ribbons, march towards an altar of incense and flowers to honor the dead. Some veterans now need canes and wheelchairs to help them complete the 40-meter stretch. Sixty years on, they aren't the strapping teenagers they once were, the years show in the wrinkles crisscrossing their faces but the memories are still fresh. ""The Korean War was very dangerous and I lost a lot of friends,"" says veteran Daniel Arthur. ""I remember all the battles I was in. I lost a lot of friends and saw a lot of people wounded."" For infantryman Philip DiMenno it's a journey he wanted to share with his two daughters, son and granddaughter. For him, it was about closing a chapter in his life, but for his children it was a chance to understand what the war was like. It's DiMenno's first time back since he left the peninsula in 1954. Long gone are the dirt roads and huts. Asphalt and high-rises have taken their place. But the memories of a young, scared 18-year-old rush back among the tombstones.

When I'm saying do the real thing that was just a figure of talk at that time, because in all fairness I was a very, very scared kid and I had a lot of fear in me,"" says DiMenno. The lively 81-year-old widower's memory doesn't fail as he recalls in descriptive detail to his family the two years he spent in South Korea. ""To be with him here now...

His daughter, Renee DiMenno-Zepezauer, added: ""The great connection and almost a closure for my father to see a country in such despair and to see a country again with such prosperity.""

""Don't tell the veterans that the war was nonsense,"" says DiMenno with a sense of defiance and pride. ""It stopped the spread of communism in Asia."" The ceremony honoring the dead doesn't last long, less than a half hour.

"(CNN) -- Syrian rebels have received heavy weapons -- including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles -- from ""brotherly nations that support the Syrian revolution,"" a rebel spokesman said Friday. Free Syrian Army political and media coordinator Louay Almokdad told CNN during a phone call from Istanbul that Free Syrian Army leaders believe the weapons ""will be a turning point"" in the war against government forces ""and will definitely change the rules of the war on the ground."" Interactive: War not only about Syria . The issue of providing military assistance to Syrian rebels is expected to be further addressed Saturday at a ""Friends of Syria"" meeting in Doha, Qatar, which will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The White House has not publicly specified what steps it would take to support members of Syria's opposition, though sources have told CNN that small arms, ammunition and possibly anti-tank weapons would be part of the assistance package. Syrian rebels have long sought anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, saying they are outgunned by President Bashar al-Assad's military. The White House announcement this month that it was increasing the ""size and scope"" of its material support to Syrian rebels came after months of political debate over the U.S. role in the conflict. Great Britain and France were strong backers of the May decision to end the European Union arms embargo on Syria, and all three countries have asserted that al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons. Al-Assad has denied the assertion. In recent weeks, the rebels have suffered a series of devastating setbacks, including the loss of the stronghold of Qusayr near the Lebanon border. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","The weapons are from ""brotherly nations,"" a rebel spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The circus has come to town and the villagers are in a frenzy. The light fantastic opening, the displays of super-human strength, the heroes born under the united roar of the crowd. Who can deny the intoxicating beat of the Olympic drum? Well, quite a few actually. Was it really wise spending $14 billion in these times of austerity? Surely it was heavy-handed to install missiles on residents' rooftops? The recruitment shambles involving security company G4S suggested embarrassing unpreparedness? Yet it seems from the moment Danny Boyle took us on a whimsical journey through British history in the opening ceremony, that cynicism has melted away. Opposing voices, which a year ago appeared the norm, are now labeled killjoys and whingers. Even London Mayor Boris Johnson told them to ""put a sock in it"" and support the greatest sporting show on earth. But those skeptical voices continue to murmur, with not everyone falling under the Olympic spell. This charming man . ""Has England ever been so foul with patriotism?"" former Smiths front man Morrissey asked during the Games. The flags draped over the shoulders of sobbing medalists were nothing short of ""blustering jingoism"" in the British rocker's eyes. Those moments that had us gathered in fervor around the water cooler -- Michael Phelps' record medal haul, Usain Bolt's historic 100m and 200m runs, gold after gold for Team GB -- were positively perverse, according to the 1980s rock icon. ""It is lethal to witness. As London is suddenly promoted as a super-wealth brand, the England outside London shivers beneath cutbacks, tight circumstances and economic disasters,"" he said. ""Meanwhile the British media present 24-hour coverage of the ""dazzling royals"", laughing as they lavishly spend, as if such coverage is certain to make British society feel fully whole."" The other Olympics . Part of the reasoning behind the Olympic torch route was to make Britons feel part of the Games. But as it made its way from Athens to the stadium in Stratford, another very different flame was winding across London. The Counter Olympics Torch, passed on from protesters at the Vancouver Winter Games, arrived at Leyton Marsh in Hackney to a small gathering of demonstrators. The homemade cone bore the banner ""End Poverty"" and represented ""hope for all those for whom the Olympics has become a symbol of repression, eviction, greed and arrogance,"" according to organizers The Counter Olympic Network. This was not the flame accompanied by David Beckham on a speed boat and sprinted into the roaring Olympic Stadium before a television audience of 900 million. ""I'm sure there will be a lot of euphoria during the Games. But when the TV isn't showing images of people winning medals it will be a very different story."" Julian Cheyne, spokesman for The Counter Olympics Network told CNN. ""It claims to deliver lots of things such as tourists, inspiring people to take up sport, regenerating east London. But that's not the case. ""People have lost their homes, others have gone to jail, local businesses aren't going to get anything out of this."" Cheyne has reason to be angry. In 2007 he was moved out of his home on the Clays Lane Estate in Newham, east London, to make way for the site of the Olympics. A tenant for 16 years, Julian now lives in social housing in neighboring borough Tower Hamlets. ""Some people didn't mind moving. But I'd been living there since 1991. I was happy there,"" he said. Jailhouse rock . Now the impressive Olympic Park is finally built, it is easy to forget what was on the site before. But the compulsory use of land has been a sore point for some east Londoners. In April protesters camped for four weeks outside the building site of a temporary basketball court in nearby Leyton Marshes, Hackney. The demonstration finally ended in a standoff with police, with four of the protesters arrested and jailed for five days. One of them, 29-year-old Simon Moore, was handed an Anti Social Behavior Order (ASBO) and ordered to not to go within 100m of any Olympic venue or activity. ""The local people weren't consulted about a site that's very important to them,"" said Moore. ""People walk their dogs there, run there, picnic there. It was almost like the Olympic juggernaut created this thing that just had to be done at any cost."" Despite his anger, Moore makes an important distinction between the athletes competing and the management of the Olympics. ""There are moments I've been caught up in the atmosphere. But let's have an Olympics that respects the community and leaves a lasting legacy. Let's have an equitable Games that's more than just a television experience,"" he added. Brand London 2012 . It is a sentiment shared by former Olympics sustainability commissioner, Meredith Alexander, who quit her role earlier this year after Dow Chemicals was awarded a major sponsorship deal -- including a fabric wrap around the stadium. Campaigners argue Dow holds responsibility for the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India, in which at least 15,000 people died in a gas leak -- a claim which the company denies. Dow bought Union Carbide -- the company which ran the pesticide plant -- 16 years after the disaster and argues it has no responsibility for Bhopal. But for Meredith, the evidence was too damming to ignore. ""I think the Olympics belong to all of us -- it's supposed to be about celebrating our common humanity. But when you look at the sponsors, I find it impossible to see how the International Olympic Committee can square that with the ethics of these companies,"" she said. Shot down . Away from the Park, Chris Nineham's looks out his kitchen window in east London to see anti-terrorist missiles perched on neighbors' rooftops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Olympic skepticism is still rife for people living beneath these constant reminders of diabolical terror. ""The way the media is presenting the Olympics as a success just isn't reflective,"" said Nineham, spokesman for Stop the Olympic Missiles. ""When they change the concierge they consult you. But when they place weapons of mass destruction on top of your house there's zero consultation."" Boom times? Before the Games started, Londoners had been told to prepare back-up plans for getting into work, lest they be swallowed by the swarms of tourists clogging peak-hour Tubes. Likewise, businesses were assured of a recession-busting boom. But the capital has been eerily quiet as Londoners fled on holiday and tourists appeared to side-step the Olympic town. There will be a slight boost from the Games -- the economy is expected to grow by 0.6% immediately afterwards -- but the glow will fade. ""Once the games are over, the problems facing the UK economy will still be there,"" said Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight's chief UK and European economist. He predicted ticket sales and a spurt in temporary work would help nudge the economy, but ""GDP is likely to be only flat at best overall in 2012,"" added Archer. And the economy could even take an extra hit from everyone watching the Olympics on TV instead of working, he warned. Well, not quite everyone.","As London 2012 comes to a close, not everyone has fallen under the Olympic spell .

"(EW.com) -- It's season 17 and I for one am still feeling aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive! Sort of. That's a lot of i's. The Dancing With the Stars cast won't be announced 'til Wednesday morning on Good Morning America (look for the complete list on EW.com's Inside TV), but of course the rumors are spinning faster than Val Chmerkovkiy's sparkly bolero in a shirtless Argentine tango. ABC will not confirm any casting rumors, but as usual, TMZ has been busy reporting on them anyway. So who's supposedly on board? Valerie Harper would probably be the biggest story, as the star of Rhoda and The Mary Tyler Moore Show had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in January. Doctors say she may be nearing remission, but the idea of ""dancing for your life"" would be a huge deal. I'd trust DWTS to make her journey a celebration of life rather than a looming cloud of doom â€” but when contestants regularly drop out due to injury and suffer near-breakdowns due to emotional exhaustion, you have to wonder... is this wise? I'd personally be most excited to see former Saved by the Bell stars Leah Remini (The King of Queens) and Elizabeth Berkley reunite on network TV. I've already started searching for evidence of dramatic struggles between Stacey Carosi and Jessie Spano, but you'd be surprised how little footage there is on YouTube of the Malibu Sands summer. (No, you wouldn't.) Remini recently broke away from the Church of Scientology and should be eager to latch what will become a lifelong devotion to the Festivus of Fringe â€” which lasts 24-7 and is year-round if you really want to commit and have the right mentality about it. I've started coming up with a collection of Showgirls moves Elizabeth Berkley should do on Dancing With the Stars... and I'm wondering if that famous shot of her licking the stripper pole would work best for the rumba or the marathon mambo. It's going really well so far. Also rumored for season 17: Glee's Amber Riley, NFL star Keyshawn Johnson, Christina Millian, Snooki, mother to us all, and a ""yogurt spokesperson"" â€” I'm hoping John Stamos but maybe DWTS super fan (and former Jennifer Grey supporter) Jamie Lee Curtis a.k.a. Enthusiastic Activia Lady (EAL) is more likely? Again, NONE of this is official. But what do you think, so far? I honestly never put much stock in DWTS casting because surprise dance ability and the camaraderie established a few weeks down the line are what will ultimately keep people tuning in.

"(CNN) -- No amount of economic growth will land you a job if you get unfairly snagged in the FBI's faulty background check system. And you can lose your job because of the FBI file inaccuracies, too. After working without incident at a Philadelphia port for 33 years, Russ F. was told he was out of a job when a newly required post-9/11 security clearance check found an arrest dating back to 1971. Charges were never filed, and Russ was never prosecuted. But the nearly 40-year-old arrest was reported on his FBI background check with no additional information, and Russ needed months to track down documentation to prove he had never been convicted or even charged with a crime. Only then could he regain his job. A National Employment Law Project report found the FBI ran a record 16.9 million employment background checks -- a six-fold increase from a decade ago -- for jobs ranging from child care to truck driving, port workers to mortgage processors. Although background checks can contribute to workplace safety, inaccuracies in the FBI database mean that these checks are blocking about 600,000 Americans a year from jobs for which they may be perfectly qualified. This unfair barrier to employment can and must be fixed. The glitch is that FBI records often fail to report the final outcomes of arrests. The case might have been dismissed or the charges reduced, but a prospective employer might not know it from the FBI background check. Roughly one-third of all felony arrests don't result in conviction, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and many more are reduced to misdemeanors. By the Justice Department's own count, roughly 50% of FBI background records are incomplete and don't include the final outcome of an arrest. In the face of such errors, only a fraction of job seekers successfully correct their FBI records -- and then only with great effort and expense. Those unable to correct their reports are often trapped in a cycle of poverty that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decried in a recent speech. Raquel Vanderpool, a nurse's aide in Newport, Michigan, with nearly a decade of experience, was fired when an FBI background check inaccurately reported a youthful conviction that had been dismissed and sealed. Vanderpool was fired and unable to find employment while she struggled -- for four years -- to clear her record. During that time, she exhausted her unemployment benefits, relied on food assistance to feed her children, lost a family vehicle and was forced to short sale her home after entering foreclosure. Now re-employed, Vanderpool will have to spend years digging out of the financial hole that the FBI's inaccuracies left her in. The burden of these errors comes with sharp racial disparities. Just as African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately affected by the criminal justice system, so are they disproportionately harmed when records are incomplete. Denying employment based on faulty records puts more African Americans and Latinos out of work for longer while they struggle to clear their name. What can be done? The FBI, which gathers records from the states, must provide accurate and up-to-date information when potential employers come asking for them. A successful and well-established federal precedent for this exists in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the federal program for firearm background checks. Under the Brady Act, when the FBI receives background check requests for gun purchases, it contacts the appropriate federal, state and local agencies to get any missing disposition information and is able to clean up two-thirds of faulty records within just three days of the request. The system is quick, efficient and accurate. If a similar system were applied to employment background checks, we estimate that 390,000 workers a year would be assisted -- able to get a job -- because of the timely, accurate information. Employers and licensing agencies would benefit from clean records, too. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia,  introduced a bill to clean up incomplete FBI background checks for employment. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, has also introduced the Accurate Background Check bill, specifically focusing on federal employment. These bills are coming not a moment too soon. In addition to these critical legislative fixes, the FBI can do a lot immediately to address this problem, including accepting updated records from fellow federal and state agencies. The seal of the FBI is intended to mark these records as official, legitimate and trustworthy. Until they are made so, the records pose an unacceptable barrier to employment for thousands of Americans. That's something our economy and our workers cannot afford. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Madeline Neighly.","Madeline Neighly: Employers use FBI background checks, but half the information is wrong .
She says 600,000 are turned away from potential jobs because database isn't updated .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge Monday approved a deal dismissing a lawsuit against celebrity chef Paula Deen. The lawsuit, filed by a former employee who leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment, was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning it cannot be filed again, according to a court filing. Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin this summer after her deposition in the lawsuit, in which she admitted using the ""N-word"" in the past, was released. In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. Fans: 'We're sticking with Paula' U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. in Savannah, Georgia, signed off on the deal, which requires both parties to pay their own court costs and attorney fees. It was not immediately clear whether there was a settlement. Earlier this month, Moore dismissed a portion of the lawsuit that contended former employee Lisa Jackson was a victim of racial discrimination. Jackson alleged that Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five years of employment at The Lady and Sons, and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House -- two Savannah, Georgia, restaurants run by Deen and her family. Savannah is where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. When news of the deal to dismiss the lawsuit first spread last week, Deen released a statement, saying she believes ""in kindness and fairness for everyone."" ""While this has been a difficult time for both my family and myself, I am pleased that the judge dismissed the race claims, and I am looking forward to getting this behind me, now that the remaining claims have been resolved,"" she said.

"New York (CNN) -- Five of six Democratic candidates vying to become the next mayor of New York City took to the airwaves Tuesday night in the last of three debates. The hourlong televised debate continued for another half hour online, one week before the primary. Unlike the last debate, during which the city's stop-and-frisk law enforcement policies dominated the discussion, the Democratic candidates answered questions on everything from immigration and labor contracts to education. Hours before the debate, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed Progressive candidate Bill de Blasio grabbing the support of 43% of likely Democratic primary voters, with Bill Thompson at 20%, Christine Quinn at 18%, Anthony Weiner 7% and John Liu at 4%. A sixth candidate, Sal Albanese, is polling at 1%. The rest of the respondents were undecided. During the debate, de Blasio came back numerous times to his proposal to tax anyone making more than $500,000 and put the money toward education. ""This is a city which has always believed in big, bold ideas,"" de Blasio said in response to a question from Thompson. Other candidates stressed the importance of early education, with Thompson noting the importance of an ""intensive curriculum"" and help with ""professional development."" The front-runner also fended off attacks from other candidates on his changing position on term limits and accusations regarding his record with a worst landlords list. According to a New York Daily News article on Sunday, de Blasio, who created the list in 2010 in his role as public advocate, ""went to bat"" for one landlord with a ""rash of violations"" when the landlord steered donations his way. Quinn cited the ""horrible conditions"" of some of the buildings on de Blasio's list, claiming some people in the buildings complained of still living in ""squalor."" De Blasio cited the ""300 buildings"" that were fixed, saying, ""I'm proud of what we did."" Moderators from WNBC News, which broadcast the debate, Telemundo and The Wall Street Journal asked each candidate a specific question, including how much each candidate earned per year. When asked about using a slush fund, Quinn said it was a practice that has been dropped. Thompson was asked why he has not taken a stronger stance on stop and frisk, to which he forcefully replied he believed the policy had been misused and abused and people were targeted for ""who they are and what they looked like."" Weiner was asked about his credibility as a candidate. Calling himself ""an imperfect messenger,"" Weiner indicated he would still be effective if elected mayor. Liu, who spoke over the allotted time limit more than once during the debate, called for a comprehensive plan from childhood to high school and ""restoring a learning environment"" when answering on education. The New York Democratic mayoral primary will be held on Tuesday, September 10. If a candidate does not cross the 40% threshold, there will be a runoff between the two top contenders on October 1. On the Republican side, candidates Joe Lhota, John Catsimatidis and George McDonald faced off August 28 in a debate. The GOP primary also will be held on September 10.

"(CNN) -- As has frequently been the case in the last two-and-a-half years, I found myself this past weekend caught in an intense conversation about the ongoing civil war in Syria. This time it was with a supporter of the al-Assad government. He was relentless, insisting that there was no choice but victory, at any cost, especially since the government has been facing foreign fighters from ""83 countries."" It's a common refrain I've heard in different variations from all sides of the conflict -- there is no choice but victory. As the world debates the efficacy of a military strike against the al-Assad government in response to its use of chemical weapons on civilians, the fighting on the ground shows no signs of abating. It is clear that the Syrian people are caught between a zero-sum political game being played by the regime and rebels, and their respective backers. Despite lofty rhetoric from a number of countries, diplomatic efforts towards a political solution could have been more vigorous. Opinion: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges . Calling for an immediate cease-fire on all sides is the only path towards peace. But will the United States and other key players go down that road? The Syrian uprising began in March 2011, partly in response to the imprisonment and brutal treatment of teenagers in the southern city of Daraa, who had tagged some buildings with anti-government graffiti. Initially, the protesters avoided mentioning dictator Bashar al-Assad by name. But the demonstrations quickly intensified in the face of continued government crackdowns. By August of the same year, over 2,000 Syrians had been killed and the security apparatus of the regime was out in full force, attempting to crush any dissent, peaceful or otherwise through the dastardliest of means. It was no surprise then that the standoff turned violent, as ragtag militias formed to contest government forces. Soon, there was an influx of weapons from neighboring Iraq and distant Libya, as well as foreign reinforcements on the side of the fragmented rebel fighters. By the spring of 2012, the conflict had clearly transformed into a civil war. Since then, the violence has only escalated and the death toll climbed, as the battles have moved from city to city across the country. Entire neighborhoods in Homs, Aleppo, Hama, and elsewhere have been destroyed to rubble. Four questions for backers of Syria mission . The al-Assad government ultimately bears responsibility for the conflict and most of the deaths. However, both sides have committed crimes against humanity. With over 100,000 Syrians dead and millions more displaced internally or as refugees in neighboring countries, the United States, Britain, Russia, China and others have mostly looked on. Instead of bringing the contesting forces to the table to force them to a solution, the United States and Russia and their regional allies continue to send money and arms into the conflict. When was the last time President Obama called for an immediate cease-fire? When was the last time that the U.S. and Russia said simply and with integrity: Stop the violence. Opinion: A U.S. strike would be self-wounding . This call has been missing for fear it could undermine the rebels (or for Russia, the regime). Nowhere was this more apparent than in the battle for Qusayr, which unfolded in front of the world's eyes earlier in the summer, with Hezbollah forces buttressing the al-Assad regime on one side and foreign fighters helping the opposition on the other side. The United Nation envoys, including Kofi Annan and Lakdar Brahimi, have tried to facilitate talks, but with little result, mostly because they were sent to Syria with their hands tied behind their back. Without the political backing from the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, what authority could their initiatives have? We cannot give up on the political process and negotiations, even if the U.S. carries out a military strike, even if there are countless bombings in coming weeks, and even if we can only achieve a brief reprieve from the violence. Opinion: On Syria, Obama must show strong grip . We need to revisit the Geneva discussions, which began in 2012 and outlined roughly a ""transition plan."" There's also the oft-touted Geneva 2 meeting -- which has yet to be scheduled -- where a future power-sharing agreement in Syria would be discussed. The Geneva 2 meeting would bring together key constituents, including the rebels and the regime. While this process, held under the auspices of the U.N., is far from perfect and may well be a long shot, it offers the best chance towards a political solution to the Syrian conflict. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Taufiq Rahim.","Taufiq Rahim: The world is debating whether military action in Syria makes sense .
Rahim: Calling for an immediate cease-fire on all sides is the only path to peace .
He says the Geneva 2 meeting would bring together the rebels and the regime for talks .

"(CNN) -- Standing near the coffin of one of her closest friends, Patty Hill made a promise that would forever change her life. Patty Hill says losing 135 pounds through weight loss surgery  still took discipline, planning and hard work. Her friend, Gail, had died from a blood clot just a week after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to make her stomach smaller. Hill was scheduled to have the same surgery and believed it was the only way to end her lifelong struggle with obesity. Tipping the scales at 280 pounds and standing 5 feet 5 inches tall, Hill says she was depressed, moody and always defensive. The 47-year-old mother from Weymouth, Massachusetts, was morbidly obese, and after her friend's death, she was beginning to lose hope. ""That was the end of the gastric bypass for me,"" remembers Hill. ""At her wake, I promised everyone that I would not go ahead with surgery."" Hill wore a 26/28 dress size and had heart problems. Now, not only was she afraid that she couldn't lose the weight, but she was even more afraid she'd die, leaving her daughters, ages 23 and 14, to grow up without her. Just when she'd lost all hope, her cardiologist asked if she had ever considered Lap-Banding -- a less-invasive form of weight-loss surgery. Hill immediately started researching the procedure, in which an adjustable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to restrict the amount of food the stomach will hold. According to MayoClinic.com, the band creates a small pouch opening to the stomach. The amount of food your stomach will hold is controlled by injecting or removing fluid from the band. Even though gastric banding restricts the amount of food, it does not reduce the absorption of calories or nutrients. In the United States, where two-thirds of the population is either overweight or obese, weight-loss surgeries have increased in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the surgeries are successful at helping people lose weight and reduce their risk for hypertension, diabetes and other chronic illnesses -- patients have to carefully weigh the benefits of the procedure with the serious risks, side effects and even death in some cases. Some of the more common side effects of weight-loss surgery can be difficulty digesting starchy foods and protein, which can lead to other physical conditions including hair loss, fatigue, swelling and muscle weakness.   Once she did her homework on gastric banding, Hill says she knew the procedure was for her. She sought treatment at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The program required six weeks of pre-operation behavior-modification classes and monthly support meetings. On February 28, 2005, Hill's Lap-Band surgery was a success. She immediately started losing weight, dropping 20 pounds the first month, and continued to lose 10 to 15 pounds a month. Six months later, at the end of August, she had dropped 75 pounds. As the second anniversary -- or ""Bandiversary"" -- of her surgery approached, Hill had lost 130 pounds and reached her original target weight of 150 pounds.  CNN I-Reporters share their weight-loss photos » . That's when she began exercising and keeping track of her daily food intake via the Web site FitDay.com. ""You don't realize how many calories you're taking in until you start keeping track,"" said Hill. Ultimately, Hill surpassed her original weight loss goal and lost another 10 pounds. She currently weighs 145 pounds and, after dropping 10 dress sizes, now fits perfectly into a size 8, she says. Despite the rapid weight loss, surgery wasn't an easy way out. Hill says she still has to plan her meals and eat properly, and one of the biggest downsides is that she has difficulty digesting some starchy foods. ""I can't eat bread, potatoes, rice,"" says Hill. ""I have to cut up everything into pencil eraser-size [pieces] and chew, chew, chew."" Still, the surgery has restored her life, Hill says. One of the biggest perks of losing weight is traveling with greater ease. She doesn't have to ask for a seat belt extender and no longer feels like she's spilling into her neighbor's seat. ""I went to Cancun last July, and I was able to go horseback riding without hurting the horse,"" jokes Hill. She's also discovered something else. ""I'm actually petite,"" Hill says excitedly. ""I can buy stylish clothes. Before surgery, I just bought clothes that fit me. Now I can buy clothes that look good on me."" When she's shopping, Hill says, people make eye contact with her more often and wait on her right away. When she was obese, Hill says, she felt almost invisible, and even though she didn't want to believe it, people ignored her. ""Men actually flirt with me; it cracks me up, but freaks out my daughters,"" says Hill. ""I have a boyfriend with a Harley. I love riding on the back of [his bike]."" The weight loss has also inspired Hill to take acting classes, and she's even appeared as an extra in several movies. Earlier this year, she attended her first Boston Red Sox game and was elated to discover that she could fit into the seats. Best of all, Hill says, she has a lot more energy and self-confidence, and she's healthier. She says the surgery is the best thing she's done for herself. ""I am so happy with the way I look and feel,"" says Hill, ""I never want to go back to the way I looked before. It sounds very superficial, but it's the truth.""  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will have an opportunity to speak ""on the margins"" of the G-20 summit in Russia, a White House official said. The development is a significant departure from what senior administration officials had said previously about Obama's trip to the international forum in St. Petersburg, noting that there would not be an information meeting. The president left Washington on Tuesday night. The United States and Russia are currently squaring off over the bloody civil war in Syria. Obama has sought congressional authorization for a limited military strike to punish President Bashar al-Assad's regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people earlier this month. Russia, a Syrian ally and major trading partner, has expressed doubts about whether those weapons were used at all. The Syrian regime denies it launched such an attack. Russia, along with China, would be expected to block any call for any military action against Syria by the U.N. Security Council. Obama also plans to meet formally with Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as French President Francois Hollande at the summit, the official said. Secretary of State John Kerry hinted at a Senate hearing on Syria on Tuesday that Obama and Putin would have an opportunity to talk at the G-20. ""He will have ample opportunity to hear firsthand from President Putin,"" Kerry said in response to a question about Russia's involvement in Syria. ""I am confident they will have a discussion about it."" The White House last month formally canceled a formal Obama-Putin meeting that was to have taken place in Moscow during this trip, citing a lack of progress in relations since Putin regained the presidency a year ago. The decision came shortly after Russia decided to grant temporary asylum to Edward Snowden, the admitted leaker of U.S. surveillance secrets. Although the White House acknowledged at the time that Snowden's asylum was a factor, a senior administration official told CNN that the meeting probably would have been canceled regardless. Obama on Friday will meet with Russian civil society leaders to discuss human rights and tolerance, a White House official said. Also invited to that meeting are groups representing human rights, the environment and LGBT rights. CNN's Jim Acosta, Dan Merica Jake Tapper and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Russia and the United States at odds over Syria, which allegedly used chemical weapons .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams underlined her status as the overwhelming favorite for the women's U.S. Open title with a crushing ""double bagel"" win over Carla Suarez Navarro in the quarterfinals of the New York grand slam. The defending champion, bidding for a fifth singles triumph at Flushing Meadows, beat the Spanish world No. 20 6-0 6-0 to become the first woman since Martina Navratilova in 1989 to win a women's U.S. Open quarterfinal without losing a game. ""I played well -- I played really well,"" world No. 1 Williams told the WTA's official website. ""I was just more focused than anything. ""I like to believe there is always room for improvement though. I haven't really thought about it yet, but off the bat, I think it was very difficult to hit a big serve today because of the winds, and I didn't get my serve up as much as I wanted to.

The six-time grand slam champion wrapped up a 6-3 6-0 6-0 win in just one hour and 19 minutes. The world No. 1 was delighted with his performance as he bids to erase the memory of an agonizing five-set defeat to Andy Murray in last year's final. ""I had some great matches in the past that I can compare with this one today, but definitely today, second and third set have been some of the best tennis that I've played on Arthur Ashe in my career,"" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website. ""It's a fantastic feeling when you're playing this well. You love spending time on the court and experiencing such great zone where you are at that moment.""

"(CNN) -- Three years ago Sharon Twitchell was miserable. Sharon Twitchell lost 110 pounds and went from wearing a size 22 to a size 2 in 10 months. Carrying 227 pounds on her tiny 5'2"" frame, the 51-year-old mother and wife could barely squeeze into her plus-size clothing.  Twitchell is the first of eight CNN.com I-Reporters who shared their weight loss stories with CNN. They revealed their secrets and reflected on the defining moments that motivated them to lose a combined total of 1,167 pounds and how the weight loss has changed their lives.  ""I was wearing a size 22 and getting my clothes at stores where the biggest size was a 24. I asked myself, 'Where are you going to buy your clothes after you get bigger than a size 24?'"" said Twitchell. Adding to her misery, Twitchell says her ballooning weight was also wreaking havoc on her 31-year marriage. ""We were literally just co-existing together, like roommates,"" recalled Twitchell. ""Friends asked my husband to e-mail them a picture of us. Later, I discovered that he had sent them an old photograph taken when I was much smaller. Even though he loved me, he was embarrassed at how much weight I had gained."" Afraid she would have to purchase clothing from online stores catering to larger women, Twitchell told her husband she'd had enough and was ready to make a change. Initially, Twitchell made an appointment with her physician in hopes that he would write her a prescription for a pill to help her lose weight. Instead, she says she saw the ""w"" begin to form on his lips and knew he was going to recommend she try Weight Watchers. Uncomfortable with the thought of going to actual meetings, Twitchell lost 30 pounds on her own and eventually joined the online Weight Watchers POINTS program on October 26, 2004. She also bought an elliptical machine and a recumbent bicycle and started working out six days a week. The pounds melted off. Ten months and another 80 pounds later, she reached her goal weight on August 26, 2005. Twitchell says she hasn't been this size since before her first daughter was born. She now weighs 117 pounds and wears a size 2 or 4, depending on the store. How has this changed her life? ""I have a marriage again,"" says Twitchell, who recently retired and relocated with her husband from New Jersey to their new home in the mountains of western North Carolina. ""When I finally reached my goal (weight), my wedding ring was two sizes too big. I had already had it resized twice and the jeweler was hesitant that I might lose more weight. Rather than resize it, my husband bought me a new beautiful diamond ring and when he gave it to me he said this was a renewal of our wedding vows,"" she recalled. Twitchell says her husband keeps telling people that he's got his wife back. This August, the couple will celebrate their 33rd wedding anniversary and they couldn't be happier. ""If I can lose 110 pounds, anyone can,"" says Twitchell.  iReport.com: Have you lost weight? Share your story, photos and video.

"Washington (CNN) -- Like a partisan version of the proverbial blind men touching the elephant, members of Congress have starkly differing views of the scope and magnitude of the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status that dominates headlines and committee hearings. Depending on their party, legislators offer particular takes on the controversy based on which part of the IRS elephant they are describing. Republicans portray the controversy uncovered by an inspector general's report last month as another example of big government gone wild under President Barack Obama. ""It is his administration, it is the Obama IRS, and we intend to try and get to truth here as to what exactly happened and get to the facts,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, told reporters on Tuesday. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said after a hearing on Tuesday with victims of the targeting that the scope of the problem was larger than first thought. ""This is a nationwide, systematic approach targeting people and groups of conservative beliefs,"" Camp declared. As part of their messaging for next year's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote, some Republicans try to draw parallels to the Watergate scandal of the 1970s that led to GOP President Richard Nixon's resignation. ""We will not tolerate another political enemies list,"" House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said Monday in a clear reference to the Nixon administration. ""We've been there before. Having an enemies list harkens back to a dark page in our past, and the arrogance of power that we've seen from those involved in this instance is deeply, deeply disconcerting,"" Rogers said. Democrats say they are equally outraged that the IRS unit based in Cincinnati that handles requests for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status used a list of criteria including group names that included ""tea party"" and other conservative labels to assess the level of scrutiny applied. However, they argue, no evidence of an administration-wide conspiracy has emerged so far, with the inspector general's report that revealed the problem blaming poor management and stating there was no known political motivation. ""There is no smoking gun,"" said Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York at Tuesday's hearing, while his party colleague Rep. John Lewis of Georgia added that similar targeting of liberal groups occurred under GOP President George W. Bush. ""Where was the outrage then?"" Lewis asked. Some Democrats said tougher scrutiny of groups seeking tax-exempt status was warranted after the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in the Citizens United case that removed limits on some campaign spending by corporations and unions. Rep. Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat, told the panel of witnesses representing conservative groups who underwent greater IRS scrutiny that the issue involved a gray area of potentially political organizations seeking tax-exempt status. ""Each of your groups is highly political,"" McDermott told the panel that included organizations opposed to gay marriage and abortion. ""You all are entrenched in some of the most controversial political issues in the country."" By applying for tax-exempt status, ""you're asking the government to help fund that,"" he added. Republican Rep. Paul Ryan took exception to McDermott's point, telling the panelists ""welcome to Washington"" after his Democratic colleague completed his comments. ""You're to blame, I guess is the message here,"" Ryan said, noting that there was no evidence presented to the committee that liberal groups received the same extra scrutiny and delayed responses as the conservative organizations. On Monday, the new head of the embattled IRS was asked how he would restore public trust in the agency after the targeting scandal and a new report on Tuesday that described wasteful spending. ""It is going to be a difficult process,"" acknowledged Daniel Werfel, a career public servant appointed by Obama last month to clean up the mess dominating the early months of his second term. Werfel described a process of identifying what happened, who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what Republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused the constitutional rights of conservative groups. 'Liar' charge a step too far for some Republicans . At Tuesday's hearing, the fifth so far on the controversy with another scheduled for later this week, witnesses from conservative groups targeted by the IRS described themselves as shocked by what happened and fearful over what it meant. Becky Gerritson of the Wetumpka Tea Party in Alabama declared that additional questioning and other IRS delays over her organization's application ""was a willful act of intimidation to discourage our little group."" ""They think they are our master, and they are mistaken,"" she said, her voice quavering with emotion. ""I want to protect and preserve the America that I grew up in. I am terrified it is slipping away."" John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, accused the IRS of leaking this organization's confidential donor list in violation of felony law. He took issue with a statement by a Democratic panel member that the IRS targeting was inadvertent, saying the agency ""deliberately provided our donor list to a political adversary who had been seeking it for a long time."" Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon argued that Eastman's description of the Human Rights Campaign as a political foe raised questions about whether his group was devoted to social welfare, as required for tax-exempt status. That prompted another witness, Kevin Kookogey of Linchpins of Liberty, which describes itself as a conservative education group for young people, to criticize Blumenauer for political bias. ""Some of the Democrats on the committee implied that what's social welfare to them is social welfare, but what's social welfare to us is negotiable,"" he said to applause from the public gallery in the hearing room. On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee will examine the wasteful IRS spending reported by a separate inspector general's report made public on Tuesday. It showed that the IRS spent about $50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012. One of those, an August 2010 meeting for 2,600 employees in Anaheim, California, cost more than $4 million for everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos. The audit notes that a large chunk of that money - about $3.2 million - came from unused funds allocated for hiring. This was in the same year that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax-exempt status, in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle increased applications that year. In response, the IRS said it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87% since 2010. ""The expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the IRS or the spending that has occurred over the past several years,"" wrote Pamela LaRue, the agency's chief financial officer. At the same time, LaRue defended the need for large-scale conferences at the time, noting that nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced, and the agency faced added concerns about security after a Texas man crashed his plane into the IRS office in Austin, killing himself and two other people. ""Although the average cost per employee was reasonable, the IRS recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources,"" LaRue wrote. IRS faces new battle on overspending . Meanwhile, the IRS targeting also is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Treasury inspector general's office and Werfel in his new capacity. A former Office of Management and Budget official, Werfel took over from former IRS Commissioner Steve Miller, who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged. Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington . Republicans at Tuesday's hearing expressed frustration with what they called a lack of government accountability so far, as well as the need for more information on who was responsible for the targeting. ""For anyone to suggest that these individuals' rights should be limited because of political differences is discrimination,"" said GOP Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois, adding that there would be no question of wrongdoing if the bias involved ""white versus black"" or ""Jews versus Christians."" Democrats sought a legislative solution, saying the lack of clarity over what constitutes political activity left IRS bureaucrats in the position of having to make that assessment. Read IRS watchdog's report . By the Numbers: Internal Revenue Service . The IRS controversy has provoked an increasingly bitter dispute between the White House and congressional Republicans that included harsh accusations by both sides last weekend. White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to comment directly Monday on the accusation by House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa that he was a ""paid liar."" On Tuesday, Cantor dodged questions about whether he agreed with Issa's insult. IRS investigation takes nasty turn . When asked by reporters about Issa's comments, Cantor instead deflected the issue back to the White House, saying ""there's been an abuse of trust on the part of this administration towards the American people. We're going to remain committed to getting to the bottom of this and let the truth come out."" Meanwhile, Cantor's Democratic counterpart blasted Issa, calling the comment about Carney ""outrageous"" and saying an apology was in order. ""He ought to retract that statement unless he has specific evidence which I don't believe he does,"" said House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. ""I think it was a reckless statement and undermines his presentation as someone as a judicious leader of oversight."" Hoyer added that such ""wild accusations"" indicated ""real political bias"" on the part of Issa, making it difficult to trust him to conduct an investigation of the IRS targeting and other issues. Other Democrats have accused Issa of dirty tactics in previous investigations, including one into the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-walking operation that led to House Republicans citing Democratic Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in a dispute over access to documents.

"(CNN) -- Rarely seen by outsiders, the daily life of a regional Taliban commander named Dawran and his militant fighters is dominated by extremes: love and war, attack and retreat, life and death. For nine days in October 2009, Norwegian journalist Paul Refsdal was behind the lines with the Taliban, embedded as no Western filmmaker before him. And he was there to witness firsthand the jarring juxtapositions in Dawran's life, at turns -- directing an attack against U.S. forces in Afghanistan's treacherous mountains -- then hours later at home, a father playing with his children. To capture these intimate and unprecedented images, Refsdal risked his life to embed with Dawran and his fighters in Kunar Province -- the northeastern region where al Qaeda is active and Osama bin Laden was once rumored to be hiding. Q&A: Kidnapped by the Taliban . Refsdal said he doesn't know the number of militants under Dawran's command, but included in their ranks is another of Dawran's sons -- a boy 12 or 13 years old. The son carries a machine gun nearly as large as he is, Refsdal said. ""For Dawran ... it's not something bad to send your ... son out to fight,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper, because Dawran believes that ""... his son will come to heaven when and if he dies in this war."" There are many different groups that make up the Taliban, and they are fighting for many different reasons. Dawran says he and his men joined the Taliban to drive out foreign forces from his district. ""We fight for our freedom, our religion, our honor and we fight for our land,"" Dawran tells Refsdal. Commanding his forces from a house built of stone and clay, he says he relies on contributions to fund his operation. Firm casualty figures for both sides in the decade-long war are hard to come by. It's not known how many Taliban forces have been killed fighting U.S.-led coalition forces. According to the Pentagon, more than 2,200 coalition troops have died in Afghanistan since U.S. forces invaded in response to the 9/11 attacks. More than 1,400 Americans are among those coalition deaths. As he urges his fighters to battle, Dawran questions coalition motives. ""For what purpose are they fighting us?"" asks Dawran. ""Are they oppressed? Have they been treated unfair? Are they living in a dictatorship?"" Oppression is an accusation critics have aimed at the Taliban for decades. They rule their lives by an extremely strict interpretation of Islam. In places under their control, women shroud their faces and bodies in burqas and girls are forbidden to attend school. ""There is nothing that Islam does not have the solution for,"" Abdul Rahman, a local Taliban judge, explains to Refsdal. ""If a person cuts off another person's hand, then according to Islamic law, you have the right to retaliate and cut his hand off. It's the same with the ears, the teeth the eyes and the nose."" The Taliban government ruled Afghanistan -- and gave safe harbor to al Qaeda terrorist training camps -- from the mid-1990s until 2001. Leaders refused to extradite bin Laden, prompting the U.S. invasion which toppled the Taliban government and made way for national elections. A decade later, Dawran's fighters march through Kunar's difficult terrain with heavy firearms and bandoliers of ammunition slung across their shoulders. Some wear traditional Afghan clothing and others dress in camouflage military fatigues as they trudge across canyons dotted with rocks, small trees and scrubby vegetation. As Refsdal films, Dawran directs an attack on U.S. troops, coordinating the operation by hand-held radio from a mountain perch overlooking a valley road hundreds of feet below. Eighty holy warriors are participating in this assault, Dawran says. They've taken positions in eight different places in groups of ten men each. ""Attack, attack, with the help of God!"" Dawran shouts into his radio. ""You hit the vehicle, you hit it!"" But did the fighters damage a vehicle or kill coalition forces as they thought? The answer seems to be no. Apparently, the attack wasn't even worthy of a report. CNN contacted coalition headquarters. A U.S. press officer searched through 1,800 reports from October 2009 and said, ""To be clear: we have no reports of any Taliban attacks in that area during the timeframe given."" As the attack ends, the sound of gunfire echoes across the valley, a plume of smoke rising in the distance. ""Taliban are like most Muslim insurgents,"" said Refsdal. ""When they have spare time, they read the Quran. They don't train. From what I could see from the firing they were not very accurate."" He acknowledges that he expects criticism for being embedded with fighters trying to ambush coalition forces. ""I understand that this is very emotional for people -- especially people in the armed forces,"" Refsdal told Cooper. ""I'm a journalist, I just film what happened."" The war has become ""routine"" for this band of Taliban fighters, said Refsdal. ""They do an ambush and then spend the rest of the day sitting around gossiping on the radio. They sit, they drink a lot of tea and they have some games they are playing."" One of the games is a simple rock throwing contest. Standing in a relatively flat clearing, the men square off to see who can throw heavy rocks the farthest. Most use a two-handed thrust-from-the-chest technique. In the end, the commander wins. ""This is everyday life,"" Refsdal told Cooper. ""This is the Taliban."" One day, Refsdal notices Dawran is nervous about a suspicious plane flying over the Taliban fighter's hideout. The commander orders Refsdal to remain inside. Later, Refsdal hears gunfire. Dawran knocks at the door telling Refsdal to get out immediately. ""Leave your things,"" the commander says. ""Run."" ""We found an old abandoned shed and we slept there during the night"" as the gunfire continued, said Refsdal. By daybreak Refsdal is told that a dozen people -- including Dawran's top lieutenant -- had been killed in a Special Forces raid. Refsdal finds Dawran ""crying like a kid"" over his lost men. Later, Dawran flees with his family, fearing for his life. Refsdal knows that the images he captured will be surprising to many -- and disturbing to some. But he feels confident that the images are authentic, not an attempt at propaganda. If the Taliban wanted to create propaganda, they would demonstrate a show of strength -- not their softer side, he said. ""Showing them[selves] as humans, they don't understand any purpose of that.""","Norwegian journalist Paul Refsdal embedded with the Taliban last year to capture daily life .

"(CNN) -- Rem Koolhaas, the world famous architect, was walking down the street one day when the realization hit him like lightning: ""I thought, 'I should become an architect,'"" he recalls. He was 25 at the time and ""wasting time"" writing film scripts. ""I am so unbelievably happy that I wasted time,"" he says, ""because wasting time enabled me to have a more open relationship with the world. Scriptwriting also taught him something about architecture. ""If you write a script, you try to stitch episodes together so that, at the end, you have a sort of suspense to a conclusion or a climax,"" he says. ""Architecture is very similar: You create a series of spatial moments and find a way to relate them to each other with the same purpose. An architect writes scripts also, but for people, not for actors."" Conjuring film scenarios ""felt very exciting, but not deeply serious,"" he says. His epiphany came when he realized that architecture was a way to do for serious reasons what he had been doing for frivolous reasons. View a hi-res gallery of Rem Koolhaas' buildings . It would be 18 years before he would build his first commission, the Netherlands Dance Theater, in 1987. ""I started very late [but] it meant that, at my age now, I am not an exhausted wreck ... I still feel relatively fresh,"" he said. Koolhaas currently has a new, experimental performing arts center in Taipei under construction. He has designed shops and catwalks for Prada and a Bahamas summer house for sculptor Anish Kapoor. His 2004 library in Seattle is acclaimed as a Bilbao for libraries and his Casa da Musica in Portugal won him the 2000 Pritzker Prize. But Koolhaas' favorite project is a 54-floor anti-skyscraper that critics consider ""the most breathtaking building of his career"" and perhaps even ""the greatest work of architecture built in this century."" His tower for China Central Television, known in Beijing as ""The Big Pants,"" is intended as a demonstration of how, in reaching for tallness, skyscrapers ""reach a kind of redundancy."" Read more: Ma Yansong's 'Marilyn Monroe' towers . Depending on your vantage point, it can resemble a Z-shape or a loop and is ""a building that is constantly mutable and that emanates creativity,"" Koolhaas says. ""I think I can genuinely claim there has never been a building with that many identities."" Koolhaas says it's also significant that the building was rubber stamped in ""a part of the world where stability is prized above everything else and where identities are supposed to be immutable."" The decision to compete for the CCTV commission over the World Trade Center redevelopment was controversial. Koolhaas says, while it was ""wrenching"" to be criticized for his choice of client, ""the moment we started the competition, I was convinced that China, no matter how it's evolving, is on the way to become a modern country."" Besides which, he argues, ""we all have a stake in the outcome of China."" Photo gallery: Mexico's shimmering shrine to art . Of course, coming up with a hot idea is only one part of an architect's job. The other, less celebrated but no less important part, is getting the thing built. Beyond its unusual shape, Koolhaas says CCTV is his favorite building because he is proud of its arduous route to fruition. ""It took 10 years to realize, and I have been in Beijing once every month. You can imagine the degree of engagement that implies,"" he says. ""The total amount of diplomacy that was necessary, the constant negotiation with a different political environment, a different language, a different symbolism ... it required an unbelievable effort."" He is ""unambiguously"" pleased with the outcome, which houses administration, production and broadcasting facilities for 10,000 workers. While designing new headquarters for Universal Studios in Hollywood in the 1990s, he had noticed how alienation and paranoia percolated when everyone was working in small, separate bungalows. ""Since this was China, we felt we could introduce a different mode there -- namely, a building that asserted that the company was a connector, where everyone was connected to everyone else, and each component part of a single hierarchy and a single integrated system. In a sense, it was a deliberate assessment of what would be possible in a Socialist country,"" he says. Koolhaas notes that exploring other cultures is a relatively new requirement for architects. ""One generation ago, an architect would expect the largest part of his oeuvre is built in an environment he knows very well,"" he says. ""We are part of a unique generation where, for the first time, it's likely that most of the buildings you do are in countries that you don't initially know. Therefore, there is an enormous amount of anthropological interest that you have to develop, in order to be precise enough to do justice to those opportunities."" One of the first foreign cultures that fascinated Koolhaas was ancient Rome. ""They had a relatively limited repertoire of things -- temples, housing, ports, shops -- and they replicated that repertoire in many parts of the world in completely unique conditions."" ""I also have an affinity with Roman architecture because it's not religious, it's not mystical. It's efficient and interested in how things perform, more than how things appear,"" he said. His favorite example is the Pantheon in Rome, which he first visited on a solo trip to Italy as an 18-year-old. ""It's really part of the city, but once you are inside, you're immediately transported to another world -- which is, as I said, not mystical, not religious, but somehow you feel elated."" Koolhaas still visits the Pantheon every time he is in Rome, and still finds variations. ""There are days that I don't even look at the Oculus. I simply discover the detail of the perimeter.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A leading human rights official known for her expertise on the Rwandan genocide was traveling on the Newark-to-Buffalo flight that crashed into a house, killing all 49 people aboard the plane and one person on the ground. Alison Des Forges died in the crash of Flight 3407 outside Buffalo, New York, on Thursday night. Alison Des Forges, senior adviser for Human Rights Watch's Africa Division for almost two decades, was on Flight 3407, the group said Friday. ""Alison's loss is a devastating blow not only to Human Rights Watch but also to the people of Rwanda and the Great Lakes region,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the humanitarian organization, said in a statement. Des Forges, who lived in Buffalo, spent four years in Rwandadocumenting the 1994 genocide and had testified about that atrocity and the current situation in central Africa before U.N. and congressional panels, the group said. Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, said she was ""best known for her award-winning account of the genocide, 'Leave None to Tell the Story.' "" ""She was truly wonderful, the epitome of the human rights activist -- principled, dispassionate, committed to the truth and to using that truth to protect ordinary people. ""She was among the first to highlight the ethnic tensions that led to the genocide, and when it happened and the world stood by and watched, Alison did everything humanly possible to save people. Then she wrote the definitive account. There was no one who knew more and did more to document the genocide and to help bring the perpetrators to justice."" The group notes Des Forges' even-handedness in the Rwandan conflict. She insisted that the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the group that toppled the ""genocidal regime,"" be held to account for its killings during and after the slaughter. She was banned from Rwanda last year after Human Rights Watch highlighted problems with its legal system. ""She never forgot about the crimes committed by the Rwandan government's forces, and that was unpopular, especially in the United States and in Britain,"" said Roth. ""She was really a thorn in everyone's side, and that's a testament to her integrity and sense of principle and commitment to the truth."" She most recently was working on a report about killings in eastern Congo. Human Rights Watch said Des Forges was born in Schenectady, New York, in 1942 and was a historian by training. The statement issued Friday said she graduated from Radcliffe College in 1964 and in 1972 received her Ph.D. from Yale. She wrote her thesis on Rwanda. Her husband, Roger, is a professor of history and a China expert at the University of Buffalo. She is also survived by a daughter, a son, and three grandchildren.","Alison Des Forges, top adviser for Human Rights Watch's Africa Division, killed .

"(CNN) -- Citizens of South Korea chose their 18th president this week -- Park Geun-hye, who will be the nation's first female leader. Park, 60, was the candidate of the ruling conservative New Frontier Party, also known as Saenuri. To some observers' surprise, Park's campaign had repeatedly highlighted her gender as a marker of her superiority to her rival, Moon Jae-in, a 59-year-old candidate of the opposition Democratic United Party, who is currently a member of the National Assembly. For example, her television advertisements promoted Park as a prepped woman president who understands feminine leadership that is responsible and subtle. Park also made pledges appealing to women in workplace and family. She even equated the birth of a woman president with political cleanup and innovation in South Korea. Looking at Park's future presidency from afar without considering its historical and social context, it is rather tempting to celebrate it as a sign of positive social change in the conservative Asian country -- women have finally arrived. Or have they? Certainly, there is an affirmative note in the conservative party's calculation that they need to woo women voters and promote feminine leadership as a positive alternative to a male leadership soiled by corruption and power struggle. We can appreciate its significance even more when this change is juxtaposed with the 1990s when many pregnant women in South Korea aborted female fetuses to ensure that they would have at least one son among one or two children they were willing to bear. The positive meaning of feminine leadership is also a step forward from older generations of women leaders in South Korea and elsewhere, who either downplayed their gender or ignored it altogether to avoid any negative consequence for their political career. However, looking into it, the gender politics of Park's candidacy is replete with contradictions and ironies. Here are a few examples. First, her political career, including her prominence in national politics since the 2002 presidential election, has been propelled and maintained by her father's posthumous political fortune. She is the daughter of Park Chung-hee who ruled the country with a repressive iron fist from 1961 to 1979. Her father came to power through a military coup d état and his rule ended when he was assassinated by his own Korean CIA director. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis (1997-1998) and disillusionment with civilian presidents who were democratically elected, a growing number of Koreans became nostalgic about her late father whose collective memory had been largely negative. In multiple national surveys conducted at the turn of the second millennia, an increasing number of respondents chose her father as ""one of the greatest leaders"" or even the greatest leader in Korean history. Park began her political career in 1998 when she was elected to be a National Assembly member representing the city of Daegu through a special election. Conservative Koreans have adored her as the daughter of the national hero. In fact, during the later years of her father's presidency, known as Yushin Dictatorship (1972-1979), young Park played the role of the first lady because her mother was assassinated in 1974 by a North Korean agent who intended to kill her father. This experience shaped her views on major historical and current issues in South Korea that often echo her father's. To progressive Koreans, her father's specter looms too large to consider Park as a symbol of new feminine leadership. Second, evaluating her record as a politician in her own right without reducing her to her political pedigree, there is little to celebrate. She lacks a track record of practicing such positive feminine leadership and supporting policies to promote gender equality and empower social minorities in general. On the contrary, she is known for her inability to communicate with people spontaneously and her lack of empathy for difficult lives of grassroots populace because of her privileged position throughout her life. Her admirers praise Park for her composure and discipline, but these positive qualities are not specifically related to her feminine leadership and commitment to empowering women and other social minorities. Therefore, the vociferous emphasis on these issues in her presidential campaign was nothing but expedient rhetoric to win the presidential race. Third, comparatively speaking, the rise of Park's political star echoes the ironic situation of women politicians elsewhere (such as Margaret Thatcher, Golda Meir, Megawati Sukarnoputri and Sarah Palin), promoted by conservative or leftist parties that have rarely prioritized or supported gender equality in their policy making and implementation. Park also conforms to the recurring model of female political leader who is a daughter, a wife, or a sister of a powerful male leader. This reveals that high social status overrides female gender in many societies and especially in a patriarchal society. Women politicians in such situation may conjure up a powerful illusion that women are also individuals (like men) with equal right to run for public offices at all levels. Their presence also reflects a popular sentiment for gender equality that has spread globally in recent decades. Yet such women politicians are more likely to be window dressing to garner public support than agents of progressive social change toward equality and empowerment of women and other social minorities.

"CINCINNATI, Ohio (CNN) -- ""Would you rather just sit there and cower underneath a desk when someone executes you or would you rather have a chance to defend your life? That's what it really boils down to."" Michael Flitcraft says students should be allowed to protect themselves from potential killers. Michael Flitcraft, a 23-year-old sophomore at the University of Cincinnati, has become a leading advocate for college students to carry weapons on campus. He's an organizer for Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, a grass-roots organization that was formed after last year's Virginia Tech massacre that left 32 college students and professors dead. The group boasts more than 25,000 members. Standing on the Cincinnati campus, Flitcraft calmly explained he is licensed to carry a weapon in Ohio. He wants to carry his gun on campus to defend himself from potential killers, but by law he can't. ""To me it makes no sense that I can defend myself legally over there,"" he said, pointing to the city streets. ""But I am a felon if I step on the grass over here.""  Watch a growing movement for guns on campus » . The issue of guns on campuses has intensified over the last year in the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings and picked up again after the more recent killings at Northern Illinois University. Lawmakers in at least nine states are considering legislation to allow guns on campus. Other states have struck down legislation. Utah is the only state to allow weapons at all public universities. Colorado allows students at universities to carry weapons, except the main university campus in Boulder. In Virginia, Blue Ridge Community College allows students with a proper concealed-weapons permit to be armed.  See the status of guns on campus » . For many, allowing college students to carry a gun is a tricky and complex issue. ""I don't think the answer to bullets flying is to send more bullets flying,"" said Gene Ferrara, the police chief at the University of Cincinnati. ""My belief is we ought to be focusing on what we do to prevent the shooting from starting."" Ferrara was a Cincinnati cop for more than a dozen years before he became chief of police at the university. He also said that there are practical concerns from a law enforcement perspective: If you're responding to the scene of a shooting, how do you sort out who is the bad guy and who is the heroic student with a permit? ""The other side of that, I shoot everybody with a gun who doesn't have a uniform on and I then I end up shooting somebody who was a citizen with a carry permit,"" Ferrara said. He says education and outreach are key and that providing students with safe and anonymous ways to report suspicious behavior can go a long way in preventing violence. ""All of the research shows someone knew before the shooting started that the shooting was going to happen."" At the University of Cincinnati, most of the students who spoke to CNN said the idea of guns on campus scares them. ""I think that it is completely absurd,"" said senior Jacob Metz. Freshman Lauren Reams added, ""It shocks me."" Security officials insist that young adults are safer on campus than just about anywhere else. Since the so-called Texas Tower shootings at the University of Texas in 1966 when 17 people were killed, there have been about a dozen shootings at colleges or universities. At Weber State University in Utah where students can carry concealed weapons, professor Ron Holt said a weapon provides added protection from potential gunmen. ""I see carrying a concealed firearm as a kind of life insurance policy; 99.99 times you will never need it,"" he said. Flitcraft and other students across the nation who support gun rights say they won't give up. Students for Concealed Carry on Campus has established a page on the social network site Facebook. They don't want all students to be armed; what they're pushing for is for students 21 and older who are licensed gun owners to have the right to carry guns on campus. The group is busy planning a protest for later this month in which students who support guns on campus will come to school wearing empty holsters. ""What is a better situation: Someone coming in and shooting in a classroom [or] someone in that classroom having a chance to defend their life and take out that threat?"" Flitcraft said.

"(Mental Floss) -- With South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford dominating the news, let's look back at a five other so-called virtuous figures who became embroiled in sex scandals -- and this list just scratches the surface. Jim Bakker admitted to cheating on his  wife Tammy Faye Bakker. 1. Aimee Semple McPherson . By the mid-1920s, evangelist McPherson was packing them in at her Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, preaching hope and warning against the sinful life. But in 1926, she disappeared while swimming at a local beach. She turned up a month later with a fantastic story about being kidnapped and taken to Mexico. Unfortunately, the evidence said otherwise: It appeared Aimee had been shacked up with a married man. The evangelist was charged with perjury, but she stuck to her story and was eventually acquitted. Her popularity waned after the scandal, but you gotta hand it to her for chutzpah: instead of apologizing to her confused flock, McPherson bobbed her hair, bought some short skirts, and began dancing and drinking in public. 2. Jim Bakker . Simple people with a simple dream, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker started out hosting a children's religious puppet show. By the mid-1970s, however, the fabulous Bakker duo had become the toast of televangelism. They pulled in millions of dollars in contributions to their PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry, and even built a sort of fundamentalist Disneyland called Heritage USA in South Carolina. Mental Floss: Proposing the presidential way . But Jim had a couple of dirty little secrets. He had paid a former church secretary named Jessica Hahn to keep quiet about a sexual encounter they had in 1980. But when the scandal broke in 1987, questions began to be raised about Bakker's financial dealings. In 1989, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison for fleecing his flock of $158 million. In the end he only served five, and moved forward with his life, eventually opening a new ministry in a restaurant in Branson, Missouri. Mental Floss: 10 great love affairs in history . 3. Jimmy Swaggart . Swaggart was one of Jim Bakker's fiercest critics when the Bakker scandal broke, telling an interviewer he himself had never even kissed a woman other than his wife. Maybe not. But the bombastic and fantastically successful television preacher -- and cousin to rock-and-roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis -- was doing something with that prostitute in a cheap New Orleans hotel room in early 1988. Swaggart's tearful, televised confession kept his $12-million-a-year, 10,000-employee religious empire together -- until he got caught with his pants down again. That's right, Jimmy Swaggart was linked to (brace yourself!) another hooker in 1991. A couple of lost lawsuits, an IRS tax lien, and that was the end of the line for Jimmy Swaggart. Well, not exactly. He's still hurling rhetorical fire and brimstone on TV, radio and online, albeit on a much smaller scale. Mental Floss: 10 aphrodisiacs around the world . 4. Amrit Desai . A onetime art student, Amrit Desai came to the United States from India in 1960. He began giving yoga lessons on the side and ended up training several thousand people, who in turn became yoga instructors around the country. With his followers calling him ""guru dev,"" or ""beloved teacher,"" one of the things Desai taught at the yoga center he founded in Massachusetts in 1972 was that celibacy was spiritually mandatory for unmarried people. Desai even took a vow of celibacy himself in 1974, despite being married with children. No wonder it was something of a shock (perhaps greatest to his wife) when in 1994, the beloved teacher admitted to having affairs with three of his followers. The scandal forced Desai to resign his $150,000-a-year post. He eventually moved to Florida, but kept up the yoga. 5. Paul R. Shanley . In the 1970s, Shanley was known as ""the hippie priest""; he was a Roman Catholic clergyman whose specialty was ministering to kids struggling with their sexual identity. By 2002, however, Shanley was a central figure in the greatest scandal ever to hit the Catholic Church in the United States. Shanley was accused of molesting more than two dozen boys over a 35-year span. Subsequent investigations into other allegations in the Boston archdiocese resulted in the Church paying $85 million in 2003 to 552 people who claimed to have been abused by priests. It also triggered similar probes, and similar results, in other areas of the country. In 2005, at the age of 74, Shanley was sentenced to 12 to 15 years in prison.

"MARTINSBURG, West Virginia (CNN) -- Hardly a day that goes by that you won't find Tracey Wygal working out at the gym. Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a ""clean diet,"" keeping a food journal and exercising. The 30-year-old middle-school teacher does cardio exercise, strength trains and follows what she calls a ""clean diet."" That's quite a change for a woman who tipped the scales eight years ago at 295 pounds. Wygal first started gaining weight in her early teens. A fast-food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds, and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds. ""It was my first year out of college, and that number, along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese, was very frightening,"" remembers Wygal. ""I went to several doctors, trying to get them to prescribe a weight-loss pill."" But none of her doctors would give her the quick fix she was looking for. Instead, a physician handed her a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet and told her to start moving. At first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive. Even though her weight was rapidly approaching 300 pounds, she believed she had a pretty good diet and an active lifestyle. As her weight crept up, Wygal grew more frustrated, and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life. She started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought.  Watch more from Tracey Wygal on her weight loss success. » . ""I was amazed by how many calories I was eating,"" Wygal said. ""The food diary showed me that I really needed to get my food intake under control and helped me maintain my diet realistically."" She also started exercising. At first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment. ""It was all I could do at first. I didn't give up, though,"" she said. ""Gradually, my endurance improved. After losing about 30 pounds, I decided to join a small gym."" Several months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step. She hired a trainer and began a short strength-training program. That's when something clicked. Instead of feeling intimidated, Wygal started to love her workouts and the physical changes taking shape with her body. Ready to take the next step, she joined a larger gym, began researching different workouts and got into weight training. Over the next three years, she lost 120 pounds and dropped seven dress sizes. Wygal, who's 5 feet 10 inches tall, says the fear of gaining weight motivates her to stick to her diet and exercise regimen because she never wants to look like she did at 295 pounds. Now comfortable with her weight, which she says fluctuates between 170 and 180 pounds, Wygal works out at least five to six days a week. She says the key to losing weight and keeping it off is being honest about what you eat, writing it down and staying consistent. She wants people to know they can do it, but there are no quick fixes or easy outs -- just hard work. ""It won't happen overnight,"" Wygal advises. ""Know that it will take time but it is worth it in the end."" iReport.com: Have you lost weight? Send your story, photos and video .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A search-and-rescue team on Monday found the body of a missing hot air balloonist who had crashed in Georgia three days earlier. Acting on a tip from a witness who saw an object falling Friday, authorities dispatched a helicopter in the direction she described and quickly found the body of Ed Ristaino of North Carolina, according to Ben Hill County Sheriff Bobby McLemore. ""We were relieved that we found him,"" McLemore said. ""But that still leaves recovery."" Teams made up of state patrol officers, forestry units, neighboring sheriff's department personnel and volunteers scoured areas east of Fitzgerald in south-central Georgia, where the balloon basket went down. At least seven helicopters and planes and more than 100 people on the ground participated in the difficult search, McLemore said. Ristaino had taken five skydivers up in his hot air balloon around 6:45 p.m. Friday when he noticed the wind picking up and realized he was driving the balloon toward a large incoming storm system, McLemore said. ""The storm was pulling the balloon closer towards it, so he asked the skydivers to bail out. He had them jump from about 5,000 feet."" While the five skydivers landed safely and were picked up, Ristaino and the balloon continued heading southeast and rose another 2,000 feet, McLemore said. ""He went up into the clouds and had radio contact with his ground crew and told them it was hailing on him, there was lightning and rain and heavy wind,"" he said. An updraft carried Ristaino up to about 17,000 or 18,000 feet above ground before a downdraft collapsed the balloon and sent him plummeting. Ristaino stayed calm and talked to his ground crew on the radio the entire time he was falling. ""I'm in trouble. I'm falling. I don't have anything above my head,"" McLemore recalled from accounts told to him. The balloonist said he was falling at 2,000 feet per minute, but an altimeter reading says he may have been falling as quickly as 60 to 90 mph, McLemore said. ""As he was falling, he did a countdown. He couldn't see anything because he was in the clouds. But when he broke through the clouds, he said, 'I see trees,' and that's the last thing they heard."" A friend of Ristaino's called him an ""accomplished balloon pilot"" who had logged ""many hours of safe balloon operation."" ""He was very much a gentleman and it doesn't surprise me at all that he managed the situation and had his skydiver passengers get out of the balloon for their own safety,"" said Bob Tettman, a fellow balloon pilot.

"(CNN) -- Congress is about to decide whether to renew unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless. Unless it acts by December 31, millions who have been unemployed for more than six months will begin losing benefits. With unemployment at nearly 9% and likely to remain high for the next few years, cutting off benefits for the long-term unemployed would have severe consequences for them and our economy. Several members of Congress, and a few policy analysts and pundits, argue otherwise, saying that eliminating benefits for the long-term unemployed will force millions of Americans back to work and reduce unemployment. But overwhelming evidence refutes these observations. Let's review some other myths and facts about unemployment insurance: . Myth: All unemployed workers receive it. Fact: Two-thirds of America's 14 million unemployed are not receiving benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While laid-off workers may apply for state-funded benefits, typically lasting up to 26 weeks, those who did not work long enough or earn enough before losing their jobs are ineligible, including millions of low-wage workers. And only those who are out of work for more than six months and live in states with high levels of unemployment are eligible for federally funded programs that may last up to 99 weeks. Myth: Unemployment insurance payments are close or equal to a person's former income. Fact: Unemployment benefits typically amount to only a fraction of a worker's previous income. Maximum payments are capped well below most recipients' prior wages. In mid-2011, the national average benefit was $1,200 a month. The average family spends more than that -- nearly $1,400 per month -- just on housing. In Mississippi, average monthly benefits are less than $800. The Heldrich Center for Workforce Development's national survey of unemployed workers found that almost half described their financial condition as flat-out ""poor,"" with most reporting reduced spending on essentials such as food, health care, and transportation. Unemployment is not a ""paid vacation"" for those receiving benefits because payments are too small to stave off financial stress. Most long-term unemployed workers have exhausted other strategies, such as borrowing money or drawing down savings. Myth: Unemployment insurance benefits discourage recipients from looking for work . Fact: The jobless who received benefits more actively sought work than those who did not receive them, the Heldrich Center's national survey found. Recipients were more likely than other unemployed workers to apply for jobs, search newspapers and online job boards, contact friends or family members about a job or reach out to potential employers by phone or e-mail. Myth: Unemployment Insurance recipients are waiting for the perfect job and turn down job offers to collect benefits. Fact: Two out of three (69%) unemployed respondents in the Heldrich Center survey, and 80% of those who received benefits, said they would be willing to take a pay cut to get a new job. While state-funded unemployment benefit programs permit job seekers to pass up job offers if they are unrelated to their past work experience during the first few months of unemployment, they set time limits on the recipient's ability to reject lower-paying job offers. Those receiving extended support from the federal government are required to accept reasonable offers of employment . Myth: Unemployment insurance benefits increase unemployment. Fact: Research conducted by Jesse Rothstein, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and former chief economist at the U.S. Labor Department, found that benefits have a negligible impact on the unemployment rate. In a report published in October, he concluded that extended benefits may raise the re-employment rate of long-term unemployed workers by encouraging them to continue an active job search. There is one other benefit to consider in extending unemployment benefits: When the stimulative economic effect of benefit spending is taken into account, payments lower the unemployment rate because the money people receive from benefits is spent on necessities such as food, clothing and housing. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, estimates that every $1 spent on unemployment insurance benefits generates $1.61 in economic activity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carl Van Horn.","Carl Van Horn: Ending benefits for long-term jobless would have severe consequences .

"London (CNN) -- She didn't even know she had produced one of the most dramatic goals in U.S. women's football history until the crowd and her teammates went crazy. With the match between the United States and Canada just seconds from going to penalty kicks, American Alex Morgan outleaped a Canadian defender and headed a Heather O'Reilly cross over goalkeeper Erin McLeod to give the U.S. a thrilling 4-3 extra time victory on Monday. ""I didn't even see it go in,"" Morgan said. ""I just try and be in the right position."" Three times, the Canadians took a one-goal lead, as their star Christine Sinclair scored in the 22nd, 67th and 73rd minutes. But Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. netted twice and Abby Wambach scored a penalty kick after a disputed call to send the match into extra time. ""We are unwilling to give up and that says a lot about who we are as a team, what our goals are,"" Wambach said. ""Even when Canada scored their third goal there was something in me that knew that we had more, that we could give more. I know that this team has belief in itself, even when the going gets tough."" The Canadian players said the referee helped the U.S. win. ""She actually giggled (when awarding the penalty) and said nothing,"" Sinclair said. ""Classy! In an important match it's a disappointment that the referee had such an impact on it. We feel cheated."" The U.S. will meet World Cup winners Japan in Thursday's final at Wembley Stadium, a rematch of last year's Cup final in which Japan won the penalty-kick shootout 3-1. The Americans have won three of the four previous gold medal matches. At Beijing, the U.S. beat Brazil 1-0 on an extra time goal. The U.S. men's basketball team pulled away from Argentina in the third quarter and won 126-97 to set up a quarterfinal match against Australia, which finished fourth in its group. Kevin Durant led the Americans with 28 points. LeBron James had 18, including the first seven U.S. points of the third quarter. The Americans only led 60-59 at halftime, but outscored the Argentines 42-17 in the third period. While the Olympics continue for Team USA and the American women, a legend's career has come to an end. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, said Monday that he really means it when he says he is retiring. ""I'm done. I don't know if people really believe me, but I am actually finished. I'm retiring,"" he told CNN's Becky Anderson. ""D-O-N-E. Done,"" she pressed. ""Yes -- I'm done,"" he insisted. Phelps, the U.S. swimmer, not only shattered the record for the most medals ever won by a single person at the Olympics -- with 22, including 18 golds -- but also made history as the first swimmer to win gold in two different events in three consecutive Olympics. On Monday, he also defended the gold medal-winning swimmer Ye Shiwen, who has been suspected -- without proof -- of doping after her remarkable victories. ""It's kind of sad that people have a great swim and that's the first thing they say,"" Phelps said of the Chinese 16-year-old. ""People who work hard -- it shows. There are people who just jump to that conclusion sometimes, and it's not right."" American gold medal gymnast Gabby Douglas was back in action Monday on the uneven bars, but turned in a disappointing performance and came eighth. ""It was an amazing finals with so many great competitors,"" she said. ""Coming into bar finals was a big challenge for me, and I made a little mistake. Even if I would have hit a solid routine, I know I have a lower start value than the other competitors."" Hometown favorite Beth Tweddle took bronze in the event, behind Russia's Aliya Mustafina, who claimed gold, and Kexin He of China, who earned silver. ""I'm very happy that I'm following on with the Russian traditions,"" Mustafina said. ""When I won the bronze medal (in the all around), I became more confident that I could overcome my (2011 ACL) injury and do better."" At Olympic Stadium, site of track and field events, Jennifer Suhr of the United States cleared 4.75 meters (15 feet, 7 inches) to win the women's pole vault. Silver medalist Yarisley Silva of Cuba cleared the same height but had more misses in the competition than Suhr. Two-time champion Elena Isinbaeva of Russia was third. ""It's something that's so emotional I can't even describe it,"" Suhr said. ""To work so hard for four years, to have injuries. My husband (and coach) and I got through this. To have faith and to have it all come together and to achieve what we dreamed of, it's amazing."" Kirani James of Grenada won the men's 400 meters and gave Grenada, which competed in its first Olympics in 1984, its first medal ever. The 19-year-old thanked God, his coach and his family. Of his family he said: ""They're probably having a street party; everyone's having a good time."" In the 400-meter hurdles, Felix Sanchez of the Dominican Republic, with a picture of his late grandmother underneath his name bib, won the gold medal, fulfilling a promise he made after he learned she had died while he was racing at the 2008 Olympics. ""When I got on the podium it was raining and it was as if my grandmother was crying tears of happiness, crying for all the sacrifices I have made,"" he said. Pavlos Kontides earned the first medal for Cyprus ever -- a silver -- in the Laser class sailing competition. ""It is really amazing. For me and my country, it is a historic day,"" he said. ""I suspect my name will be written in golden letters in Cyprus."" It was another tense final shot, and another awful one for American Matt Emmons but he still managed to finally get a medal in the men's 50-meter rifle three positions. Going into the last round, Emmons sat in second. He had to be thinking about the previous two Games when he was in gold-medal position with one shot to go. But each time before he had blown it, once shooting at the wrong target and once his rifle went off before he had lined it up with the target. Those times he not only lost gold, he lost any medal. This time, he scored 7.6 on his final shot, his worst score of the day, but it was enough to stay ahead of Cyril Graff of France for a bronze. ""Any time you stand on an Olympic podium is not a loss, it is a pretty cool thing,"" Emmons said. His wife, a shooter whom he met after his disappointment in Athens, said her husband was extremely nervous before the final shot. ""He couldn't hold still, so he just took the shot as best he could,"" Katy Emmons said. ""This time the luck was on his side."" It was a sixth medal for the family -- Katy has three for the Czech Republic and Matt has previously won a gold and a silver medal in the 50-meter prone event. A gold medalist found himself at the center of another controversy Monday as Kenyan police confirmed that steeplechase winner Ezekiel Kemboi was under investigation on suspicion of trying to stab a woman on a date before he left for the Games. Olympics Infographic: The numbers behind London 2012 . The woman accused Kemboi of making sexual advances, said deputy police spokesman Charles Owino, without naming the alleged victim. Kemboi is a police officer himself, according to Owino. Kemboi said that he was the victim of attempted extortion and that police had not given him a fair hearing, Owino said. And the International Olympic Committee announced that it disqualified American judoka Nicholas Delpopolo from the men's 73-kg judo event for a doping violation. It stripped the 23-year-old of his seventh-place finish after he tested positive for a cannabis byproduct.

"(CNN) -- International soccer star Lionel Messi has paid €10 million ($13 million) in taxes to cover the tax period 2010-2011, prosecutors in Barcelona, Spain, told CNN Tuesday, but efforts to prosecute him for alleged tax fraud from 2007 to 2009 are still going ahead. Messi's payment does not affect the existing investigation into the alleged tax fraud, said Jose Miguel Compan, a spokesman for the Barcelona prosecutor's office. Messi's lawyer, Cristobal Martell, is not taking any calls from journalists, his office said Tuesday. Compan said Messi's lawyers had not approached prosecutors about making a deal to settle the earlier tax claim. Any deal would have to involve Messi admitting guilt, paying the amount he owes, and a fine of two to six times as much as the outstanding amount. That could total €12 million ($15.7 million) to €28 million ($36.7 million). Messi and his father, who is also a target of the investigation, are due to appear in court on September 17. The four-time world player of the year and his father Jorge Horacio Messi are suspected of defrauding Spanish tax authorities of more than $5 million between 2006 and 2009. They deny the charges. The 26-year-old is was listed as the 10th highest-paid athletes in the world by business magazine Forbes with earnings of $41 million. Messi took to his Facebook website page to deny the charges earlier this month. ""We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities,"" read the statement in Spanish and English. ""We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement. ""We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation.""","Lionel Messi has paid $13 million in taxes for period 2010-2011 .

"(CNN) -- An American family and their friends lost at sea have, at the very least, hope on their side. After three weeks with no signs of life from them, their relatives and the people searching for them refuse to let go of it yet. Two days of scouring an area of open ocean the size of the Mediterranean Sea has turned up no clues to the whereabouts of their sailboat, the Nina. So on Friday, New Zealand's airborne searchers shifted their gazes. Three observers are buzzing over beaches and islands in the country's north in a twin-engine propeller plane, looking for a life raft or the seven crew members who may have washed ashore. Or for debris, in the tragic event that a storm tore the white schooner with two masts apart. It was built out of wood in 1928, but it's tough, says Cherie Martinez. Her brother, David Dyche, is the Nina's owner and its captain. ""Nina always comes back to port. She might get disabled, but she always comes back to port,"" she says. Martinez has faith in her brother's strong sailing abilities. Dyche has firmly handled the Nina's rudder on the high seas for decades. Twenty years ago, they crossed the Atlantic Ocean together. But the consistent bad news weighs heavily on her. ""It's been a real roller coaster, a very tough time."" Shipwreck survivor recounts drama on high seas . Fateful weather . The weather dealt Dyche and his schooner an ill-fated hand, after they left the port of Opua in northern New Zealand, with his wife and their teenage son. Four friends were sailing with them -- one from Britain, the other three from the United States. Not far into their planned 1,200-mile tour across the Tasman Sea, the waters picked up fury. Evi Nemeth, a revered computer scientist, was among the crew. On June 3, she called a meteorologist by satellite phone. She reported 60 mph winds and 18-foot waves and asked him for an escape route. Head south, he told her. But brace for a storm. The next day, he received text message: ""ANY UPDATE 4 NINA?...EVI."" It may have been the last anyone heard from the schooner. Dyche's mother did receive a fuzzy phone call that sounded like it was coming from overseas sometime after the seven crew members set sail. She heard her name, then the line clicked out. The storm . The tempest must have been a mean one. ""Records show that conditions at the last known position for the vessel, on 4 June, were very rough,"" Maritime New Zealand said. Winds of 50 mph with gusts of 70 mph had to have battered the 70-foot sailboat, while 26-foot waves tossed it around. The Nina went incommunicado while running from raging seas, 400 miles north-northwest of New Zealand. The sailing yacht is well-equipped, with a tracking device, a satellite phone and an emergency buoy, which is meant to deploy automatically when a ship takes on water. But not a single signal has come from the boat for more than three weeks. Nail-biting wait . Family members alerted maritime authorities in New Zealand in mid-June that the Nina was missing, after wondering for days why they had not heard anything from Dyche. Rescuers put out a notice to all ships in the Tasman Sea, requesting reports on any sightings of the ship. None came in. The search from the air began, and it continues. ""While we have grave concerns for the crew on board Nina, we have not given up hope of finding survivors,"" mission controller Neville Blakemore said Friday. The three airborne observers began focusing their lenses on New Zealand's beaches at 10:45 a.m. local time Friday (6:45 p.m. ET Thursday). They have yet to see any sign of the Nina, the Dyches or their friends.

"(CNN) -- Two-time major winner Rory McIlroy showed glimpses of the form which shot him to the top of the world rankings by hitting a five-under-par round of 67 to share the lead after the opening round of the Wells Fargo Open. McIlroy, who has struggled to produce his best golf since signing with Nike in January, shares the top of the leaderboard with six American players. ""I felt like I played really well,"" the world No. 2 told the PGA Tour's official website after a round which included seven birdies and two bogeys. ""I feel a lot more comfortable with my swing and a lot more comfortable with where my game is at. That's always going to make it easier."" McIlroy won this event in 2010 and is playing for the first time since tying for 25th at the Masters in April. ""I love this golf course,"" added the 23-year-old, referring to the Quail Hallow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I always seem to play well here, so that's an added benefit. ""I took the best part of two weeks off after Augusta and didn't touch a club. Flew back out to Florida last Friday, had three or four really good days' practice, and I feel good about my game. ""I knew if I could just take that from there to here, I'd do OK."" Alongside McIlroy are the six Americans Ryan Moore, Nick Watney, Robert Garrigus, Derek Ernst, Daniel Summerhays and Nate Smith. Four-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2007 Masters winner Zach Johnson are part of a six-strong group one stroke further back on four under. ""I really like this golf course,"" said Mickelson, who is looking for a first career win at this event. ""I think from tee to green it's one of the best I've ever seen. I really enjoy playing here. ""I've had some good finishes, but you're right. I haven't been able to break through and get a win. This year, hopefully, it will be different because I am playing well and I do really enjoy it here.""","Rory McIlroy shares the lead after first round of the Wells Fargo Open .

"(CNN) -- Hail stones the size of fists pummel the small sailboat lurching violently in the Pacific Ocean. Blanketed in darkness, Nik Brbora desperately tries to steer his 18-strong crew through 50-knot hurricane winds and waves three-storeys high. As dawn approaches, a monster wave flips the yacht, ripping out the steering and smashing Brbora against the deck. Falling in and out of consciousness, the 29-year-old is rescued by U.S. coast guards who take him to the closest hospital -- 900 kilometers away in San Francisco. It's a terrifying and ultimately death-defying moment for the IT engineer from London. Yet now, as he looks back three months after completing the year-long Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, Brbora says the journey was also the greatest experience of his life. He was one of 500 amateur sailors racing ten yachts 64,500 kilometers across the globe, battling everything from hurricanes in the Caribbean to the dreaded doldrums of South East Asia. It may seem like the sort of grand adventure only the most hardened sailor would be capable of. But in an unusual twist, the majority of people on board have never sailed a boat in their lives. The event organizers are now recruiting for next year's clipper race. Those who enter face the prospect of saying goodbye to their jobs, family and friends for a 12-month voyage on the high seas. Setting sail in July 2013 from Southampton in the UK, the 70-ft yachts will visit 15 ports on all six continents. The journey is made up of eight legs, with sailors able to join for one of these, or the full circumnavigation. Founded in 1996 by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston -- the first person to sail solo, non-stop, around the world in 1969 -- the Clipper Race revolves around the notion anyone can circumnavigate the globe, regardless of their experience. The only selection criteria is people must be over 18, pass a three-week sailing course and be physically fit enough to complete the epic voyage. At Â£43,000 ($69,000) per person for a full year-long voyage, it's not simply a huge physical undertaking, but a significant financial one. ""A lot of people thought I was crazy. They said: 'You could be using that money to put a deposit on a house or a luxury holiday around the world,'"" said Brbora. ""But they're such boring, standard options. I saw this as a personal investment."" Australian Lisa Blair, who also completed the full circumnavigation on a different yacht, raised part of the money for her trip through a sponsored 1,300 kilometer cycle ride from Sydney to the Sunshine Coast. After being selected from almost 800 applicants, the 27-year-old novice sailor quit her retail assistant job, packed up her house and moved to Britain for an intensive sailing course. Within months she was bunking down with 17 other strangers in a clipper headed for their first stop -- Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. ""You're living with guys and girls in an open room with two rows of bunks on either side,"" Blair said. ""Shifts are four hours long, so when you're up on deck you're steering the boat, dealing with rigging, making repairs. By the time you get into bed you might only have two hours sleep,"" she added. With limited access to phones and internet, the crew is essentially cut off from the outside world. ""We only heard about the volcanic ash which shut down airports in Mexico because we were sailing past it,"" added Blair. ""Instead, you learn a lot about the people on board -- it's human interaction on a really deep level,"" she said. Throughout last year's race, participants ranged from 18 to 73-years-old, hailing from 40 countries across the world. They included a NASA scientist, ballet teacher, TV weather girl, farmer, undertaker and London cabbie driver. For Brbora, the biggest challenge came just two months before the end of the race when his vessel was almost destroyed in a storm 900 kilometer off the coast of San Francisco. Brbora was flung against metal railing in the accident, suffering a strained hip, while fellow crew member Jane Hitchens, 50, also from Britain, broke her ribs. ""The deck looked like a warzone. There was no steering left and everyone's life jackets had popped open,"" Brbora said. ""I had a sharp pain in my hip -- I thought 'this is what it must feel like to be hit by a car.' They initially tried to airlift me and Jane out with a helicopter but it was too dangerous with the mast swinging about."" The boat, still miraculously in one piece, was repaired in San Francisco, and the crew went on to finish sixth in a field of 10. But along with the challenges came moments of joy. ""You might be sitting up on deck and hear this whistling sound and it's a pod of dolphins or whales or giant sea turtles,"" Brbora said. For self-confessed ""ballsy"" sailor Blair, her favorite memory was of gliding down waves the size of four-storey buildings in the Southern Ocean. ""It's agony because it's so cold; around 3 degrees Celsius (37 Farenheit). But here you are surfing down the face of these mountains of water,"" she reminisced. The clipper race was a life-changing adventure for both Blair and Brbora. After all, why stress about a late train or rainy weather when you've survived the most brutal waves on the planet? ""Not many people can say they've sailed around the world,"" Brbora said. ""It's made me realize you shouldn't be afraid of things and it's definitely given me more confidence."" Blair, whose boat won the race, now teaches sailing professionally and hopes to again sail around the world -- this time on her own. ""I've started living my life by the quote: 'Just do, because the world is changed by doers,'"" she said. ""You're not going to change the world by sitting on the couch watching TV.""","500 sailors, majority with no previous experience, will circumnavigate world .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Kerry Swift stands in the kitchen of her Georgia home, warming food and setting out cutlery for her guests. Another humid summer day in the South nears its end. She is hosting a dinner party tonight with numerous families attending, and her guests are slowly trickling through the door. ""Salaam-a-lakom,"" she says, greeting her guests as they enter the foyer. The women are in headscarves, and the men are in modest attire. They respond cordially and thank Kerry, also known as Kareemah Budair. Kareemah is hosting Iftar, the meal in which Muslims break their Ramadan fast. It is often celebrated in a community setting such as this. Kareemah says she was raised as a devout Catholic but converted to Islam 17 years ago. Like many young people, she searched for meaning in her life after graduating from college. ""I started to meet people of different faiths,"" she says. ""The Muslims I met, I really connected with. I started asking about the teachings, and I just connected with the ideas."" Kareemah's features immediately give away her Irish heritage. One can't help but wonder what it's like to see life through her eyes. ""It's a blessing, honestly,"" she says, her green eyes sparkling from within the framing of her headscarf. ""I know that there's a lot that's in the news, but the everyday life experience of a Muslim and as an American is that people have decent values. They value life, and they value different cultures. I can't say it's hard. I would feel guilty saying that it's hard."" Spate of attacks trouble U.S. Muslims . In an elegant comparison, Kareemah relates her strict Catholic upbringing to her current devotion to Islam. ""I really valued faith,"" she says. ""I mean it's kind of ironic that I'm looking like the nuns that I admired."" The sound of prayer playing from an iPod echoes through her house. It is time for her and her patrons to break their fast. The men and women move to separate rooms and sit around their respective tables. In keeping with the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad's practices, they eat three dates to begin the breaking of their fast. Depriving oneself of water and food, from sunrise to sunset, is the core practice of Ramadan. A moderate Muslim will only honor the fast, but a pious believer's day is filled with prayer and reflection. ""The miracle of it is that Allah has partnered the fast with the prayer,"" says Kareemah. ""It's an opportunity to purify ourselves, and either one by itself does not work."" After only a few dates and small sips of water, the guests file into their respective prayer rooms, separated by gender. They will recite a final prayer before sitting down to the hostess's elaborate dinner. The house is quiet and serious, as Kareemah's husband, Maher, sings out the prayer. It is an awe-inspiring moment, showcasing discipline and devotion in its barest form. This home in suburban Atlanta is suddenly transformed into a house of Islamic worship. More than 20 minutes later, the prayers are over, and it is time to feast. Tonight, Kareemah and her family provide the bounty of food they set out on the table. The guests line up to eat, as Maher piles food on each plate. This evening, Kareemah's family and friends are among their peers. Every adult in her home tonight abides by the strict demands of Islam and Ramadan. In predominantly Muslim countries, laws strictly enforce Ramadan, banning eating and drinking in public during daylight hours. In the southern United States, most people don't observe Ramadan, so for the relatively few Muslims there, doing so can be a challenge. ""Sometimes, you are the only fasting person in your workplace or your classroom,"" explains Ali Gebril, speaker at the Roswell Community Mosque in metro Atlanta. ""Everybody else is not practicing, but you're practicing. So you feel that you are doing this alone. It's not easy, but we do it because we believe that the order came from Allah, and you should do it wherever you are."" 'Don't call me late for Iftari' This month, more than 1 billion Muslims around the world are celebrating Eid Al Fitr, which officially ends the Islamic month of Ramadan. Many hope that they can continue to emulate the spirit and generosity of this month throughout the year. ""The idea is to go back to life better than when we entered Ramadan,"" says Kareemah. ""To try to improve ourselves and Inshallah ('God willing') improve the world through that process."" By the end of the night, the dinner is done, and Kareemah and her guests sit and share stories of how they cope with fasting and the other strict rules of Ramadan. But no one ever questions its purpose or its value. They feel purified by it, ready to begin another year of life, reflection, love and personal growth.","Kareemah Budair hosted a gathering for Iftar at her suburban Atlanta home .

"(CNN) -- This time it'll be Jason Dufner who laughs last and loudest. For months he's been ribbed by his pals for dozing off during a visit to a school arranged through the PGA Tour, creating a phenomenon that became internationally known as ""Dufnering."" The 36-year-old captured his maiden major title at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill in New York on Sunday, two years after his heartbreaking playoff defeat to Keegan Bradley. And don't be surprised if the Alabama resident does another spot of ""Dufnering"" this week, this time with a major difference -- the Wanamaker Trophy will be by his side. ""I checked out there,"" Dufner told CNN of the moment when he fell asleep on a trip to Dallas that was subsequently recreated by Bradley, Rory McIlroy and Bubba Watson to name but a few. ""That's the only time I did it, actually I did it once with Lindsey Vonn because she asked me. ""They caught me in a moment of relaxation and then the guys out here tried to give me a good ribbing on it and tried to get me in trouble. ""I ran with it and it turned out to be a good thing and a lot of people have taken to it so maybe I'll give them a special treat when I get home later this week with the trophy."" Dufner has become a cult figure on Tour due to his ""moment of relaxation"" but also because of his incredibly laid back demeanor. His mood barely seems to flicker away from calm and composed -- some people criticizing him for a lack of emotion -- and during his charge to the title he was still seen chewing tobacco. Dufner says his climb to the pinnacle of the game has kept him grounded and that his new found success won't alter him. ""A lot of things are going to change in my life because of this but I don't think it's going to change me one bit,"" he explained. ""That's just who I am, the way my parents raised me, that's the way I've been since day one. ""No matter what success I've had I've always had a lot of the same friends, the people that have been with me through college and through the mini tours. ""I've had the same caddy for 12 years which is pretty darn though out here. Those are the type of relationships I build and that's the type of guy I am."" That it was the PGA Championship crown that helped him break his major duck was fitting. Two years ago Dufner blew a five-shot lead over Bradley, eventually losing to his U.S. Ryder Cup teammate in a playoff. But after he fired a final round of 68 to finish on 10-under Bradley was one of the first to congratulate him, having raced back from the airport to toast his friend's victory. ""It made me hungrier actually to be so close and lose it like I did,"" Dufner said of his near miss at the Atlanta Athletic Club in 2011. ""I was able to learn from all the mistakes I made, learn from that experience and put it all together this week. ""Unfortunately when I did lose I was a little disappointed but I think it helped me in the long run. ""It's tough because you're not sure what happened or did I really do this but to be in the company of people who've won majors now and to have my name on the Wannamaker Trophy -- unbelievable feeling."" Dufner's triumph marks the end of an arduous 13-year rise to the top of the game. After turning professional in 2000 he flitted between the PGA Tour and its feeder competition, the Nationwide Tour. He's remained his usual unflappable self throughout his journey and has gone from strength to strength since cementing his spot on the PGA Tour in 2009. ""It's always been a struggle for me,"" Dufner explained. ""I felt like I was talented but I went through the ranks, whether it be junior golf, college golf, mini tour, early pro golf it was a struggle. ""There were moments of greatness followed by a lot of disappointment and frustration and question marks but the last couple years I've really solidified my spot out here on the PGA Tour. ""Now I'm getting more comfortable trying to win these tournaments.""","Jason Dufner celebrates his first ever major title with success at U.S. PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- French scientist Francoise Barre-Sinoussi almost didn't get the chance to make one of the greatest medical discoveries of the 20th century. She shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with her colleague Luc Montagnier for identifying HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, a plague that has killed about 35 million people since the 1980s. ""Never before has science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity,"" according to the Nobel committee. Because of their discovery, scientists quickly developed a test for the virus. Their discovery also led to the development of drugs that dramatically increased the life expectancy of HIV-positive patients. But had Barre-Sinoussi listened to one leader at the lab where she would eventually find fame, she may never have been a scientist at all. Natural aptitude . Barre-Sinoussi has loved science since she was a girl. But coming from a family of modest means, she decided to forgo a more expensive medical school to take the research route at the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Paris. But she says she ended up spending little time in class. ""This is not the advice I would give young people. University is important,"" she warns. But she had another interest: She had fallen in love with lab work. About two years into her studies, she grew tired of the theoretical. She wanted to test her mettle in a lab. ""It just was not done at the time, but I wanted to try,"" she says. After dozens of rejections, she reached the famous virologist Jean-Claude Chermann at the Pasteur Institute. He made her an unusual offer. ""He said, 'OK, if you want to be a volunteer here part time, that would be fine with me,' "" she recalls. She loved it immediately. ""Suddenly, I understood that's what I really wanted to do."" Her research then focused on the same family of viruses as HIV. She worked to find a connection between retroviruses, cancer and leukemia in animals. Friends shared their class notes so she could study late nights and weekends while spending full days at the lab. Incredibly, she passed her exams with top marks. She stayed at Pasteur and earned her doctorate. At the end of her Ph.D. program in the late '70s, she made an appointment with another head of the institute. She wanted to know if she could continue working there. She remembers the indignant tone of the man's response. ""He said, 'You are expecting to have a position at Pasteur?' I said, 'That is one of my dreams.' And he said, ' A woman in science, they never do anything. They are only good at caring for the home and babies. Forget this dream.' "" Instead, that conversation left her more determined to succeed. She went to do post-doctoral work at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. About a year later, she won a large grant, which meant a return to Pasteur. She returned to Montagnier's unit; his lab was one of the few still examining the connection between retroviruses and cancer. It was her dream job, and she's been doing it ever since, eventually becoming the head of the Virology of Retroviruses Unit in 1992. Nearly a decade earlier she performed the experiment that would change her life. The year that everything changed . A clinician named Willy Rozenbaum delivered a lunchtime lecture at the hospital at Pasteur. He talked about a new mysterious disease that seemed to be rapidly killing his patients. Many were young gay men who should have been at their healthiest. At the end of the lecture, he asked, ""Does anyone here deal with retroviruses?"" No one responded, said Barre-Sinoussi, who wasn't at the lecture. Rozenbaum went back to his clinic and complained to a friend that no one at Pasteur could help. His friend corrected him, telling him about the work of Montagnier and Barre-Sinoussi. In December 1982, he met with their team and told them about the disease. Barre-Sinoussi says she and Montagnier had never heard of it then, but they agreed to do some research. Everything they could observe in the clinic told doctors that the virus was attacking patients' immune cells, leaving them vulnerable to rare cancers and pneumonia. But there was a problem. As the disease progressed, it was hard to find enough CD4 lymphocytes, or T cells, to use in the lab tests. It made isolating the virus extremely difficult. The following month, a patient agreed to let the researchers do a lymph node biopsy. Barre-Sinoussi tested the sample every two days for activity. The first week there was nothing, but in the second, there was weak enzymatic activity. It started to increase quickly but just as suddenly dropped. The T lymphocytes in the culture started dying. ""That was a really worrying day,"" Barre-Sinoussi says. She changed out all the reagent chemicals they were using, but that didn't stop the T cells from dying. The team wasn't able to see the virus; it was getting away. ""So we knew it had to be something else,"" Barre-Sinoussi says. ""We ran across the street to the blood bank and asked if we could get samples for our experiment. We knew it was urgent."" She added lymphocytes from the blood donation, and it worked. The virus was still there. The researchers knew because it started to infect the new lymphocytes from the blood donation and there was enough that a colleague was able to take the first actual image of the virus. The team named it lymphadenopathy-associated virus -- the name human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, came later. The finding changed everything. ""I called my good friend in the United States, my former boss, and I told him what I thought we had and he joked with me and said, 'Throw it all away,' "" Barre-Sinoussi remembers. "" 'This discovery will change your life forever.' "" And it did. Barre-Sinoussi and Montagnier quickly put a paper together about the results. It ran in the May 1983 issue of Science. She presented her findings at an international conference and was invited to talk about her results at the National Institutes of Health and the CDC. ""So many people ask me if we were excited about the discovery, but so many young people were dying,"" Barre-Sinoussi says. Hospitals were too afraid to accept patients because they didn't know how the virus spread. She recalls seeing young men in Paris with telltale signs of the illness. Others, including the actor Rock Hudson, heard about the lab's discovery of HIV and came to Pasteur. Some of them, she says, had only a suitcase and often no money. ""They just wanted to be close to the place that made the discovery,"" she says. ""We knew we had to work to do, and it was urgent."" At the same time, an American lab claimed to have discovered the virus. A large legal battle and diplomatic fight raged for years. Ultimately, after French and American heads of state intervened, in 1987 they were all named co-discoverers and split the royalties from the blood test. The Americans, however, did not win the Nobel Prize. In 2008, when the Nobel Prize winners were about to be announced, the Nobel committee couldn't find Barre-Sinoussi to tell her. She had been working with doctors in Cambodia. Ever since she co-discovered the virus, she had traveled the world to try and help health professionals understand HIV better. She says the Nobel committee called her lab and her home without luck. A reporter tracked her down first. ""When I picked up my mobile, she said, 'Francoise, have you heard?' and then she started to cry,"" Barre-Sinoussi says. ""I thought something tragic had happened. I had already lost my husband that year and thought someone else must have died."" These were tears of happiness, the journalist said, delivering the Nobel news. Barre-Sinoussi says she couldn't believe it. ""It was like a dream,"" she says. No resting on her laurels . Some people might retire after such an honor but not Barre-Sinoussi. She has used her fame to open more doors. She is president of the International AIDS Society and continues working with clinicians, patients and activists -- particularly those from the gay community and those who try to help people in the developing world -- as they fight to eliminate the stigma of the disease and get patients the care they need. ""This is a good thing of the Nobel Prize -- it is easier for me to get an appointment with the first lady or the president of the country,"" Barre-Sinoussi says. ""It gives me the opportunity to try to be the voice for others. This is something that for me seems to be my responsibility, my duty."" She says she has high hopes for a vaccine, noting that recent developments show some promise. ""A total cure -- the total eradication of the virus will be extremely difficult if not impossible,"" she says. ""Although in my language we say 'impossible' is not French, so I cannot say impossible."" The attention her discovery has brought Barre-Sinoussi has changed everything, just like her friend warned, she says. It even won over the man who told her at the start of her career that a life in science would be impossible for a woman. He contacted her many years after the HIV discovery. ""He called me to congratulate me and said how impressed he was,"" she says. ""After a while of him saying these positive things, I finally interrupted him and said, 'You mean, because a woman can actually do something in science?' ""Of course, he did not understand. He did not remember saying anything. I told him what he said. He couldn't believe it. He said he felt so bad. 'But you did,' I told him. 'You did.' And I'm so glad I did not listen.""","Francoise Barre-Sinoussi co-discovered HIV, the virus that causes AIDS .

"(CNN) -- About 160 people were arrested by Saudi security forces early Friday morning in Buraida for unlawfully protesting outside that city's Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The spokesman for Qassim police said that 15 women and 6 children were among the 161 people taken in, and that the protesters had been arrested after officers at the scene had failed to convince them to end their demonstration. Buraida, the provincial capital of Qassim Province, is considered part of the ultraconservative heartland of Saudi Arabia. It has been the scene of several small-scale protests the past few months. Demonstrators have repeatedly gathered to demand the release of jailed relatives they say have been held for years without having been charged, tried or given access to lawyers. According to Saudi human rights activists, this latest demonstration was the result of growing anger over the arrest of dozens of female protesters in Buraida earlier in the week. Activists say that about 28 women, many who brought their children, gathered in Buraida on Monday to demand the release of detained family members. A statement issued Friday by Amnesty International criticized the arrests. ""According to reports,"" read a release from the rights group, ""those arrested this morning have been transferred to a prison in Tarfiyah, east of Buraida, while those detained since 27 February continue to be held at the central prison in Buraida. No one has had access to the outside world."" ""This cat and mouse game authorities in Saudi Arabia are playing is, simply, outrageous,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program director. ""Instead of persecuting peaceful protesters, what the Saudi Authorities should do is listen to their demands and release all those held solely for exercising their human rights."" One protester on the scene Monday told CNN by phone that while she and the other protesters had been surrounded by police and were afraid of arrest, they would not leave the scene voluntarily until their demands were met. ""We are calling for the release of our family members, like my husband, who've been in jail for years unlawfully,"" said the woman, who requested anonymity for fear for her safety. ""And we're demanding the ouster of Interior Minister Mohammed Bin Nayef."" After spending the night on the scene, Saudi human rights activists say the women and their children were arrested late Tuesday evening after putting up three tents and vowing to continue their sit in. Amateur videos posted online purported to show women holding up signs demanding the release of imprisoned loved ones, displaying placards saying they were not afraid of the country's interior minister and chanting slogans, such as, ""The people call for the liberation of the prisons."" In at least one video, female protesters burned a picture of Prince Mohammed, the country's recently appointed interior minister, a particularly brazen act in such an absolute monarchy. Prince Mohammed is one of the most powerful Saudi government officials, controlling the police, counterterrorism forces, several special forces units, the religious police and more. Demonstrations are prohibited in Saudi Arabia, a deeply conservative country that never experienced the kind of large protests that took root in the region as a result of the Arab Spring. Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says that while burning a picture of the country's interior minister is a big deal in such a conservative part of Saudi Arabia, ""we are still very far from an organized, coordinated groundswell that could in any way challenge the ruling family."" Lately, however, the number of dissenting voices in the kingdom has been growing. Rights activists say the Saudi Arabian government has detained thousands of citizens in connection with the country's counterterrorism efforts and that anger there is rising as a result. In his statement on Friday, Qassim's police spokesman said that those arrested Thursday ""will be referred to the competent authorities to complete the legal procedures against them."" He said that the gathering in Buraida on Thursday had been ""an attempt to turn public opinion by taking advantage of those who have been accused and convicted of activities of the deviant groups."" The term ""deviant groups"" is the language typically used by the Saudi government when referring to terrorist groups. Many relatives of detainees say their loved ones have no connection to terrorism and have been detained for long periods of time without being tried and with no access to lawyers. As a result, say activists, in the past two year an increasing number of sit ins and demonstrations have been held. Abdulaziz Al-Shubaily, an activist and member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, said ""many prisoners have been in jail for years without having been charged."" ""There's no reason for that,"" added Al-Shubaily. ""If you're not going to charge someone, you should release them."" According to activists, women protesters and several children were arrested in early January and February after also calling for the release of jailed loved ones. Those arrests sparked outrage and inspired more small-scale demonstrations in other cities. When asked in late January about demonstrators' claims that their relatives are political prisoners who should be released, Interior Ministry Spokesman Major Gen. Mansour Al-Turki told CNN that Saudi government officials would not comment on cases currently being ""looked at by the courts."" In the country's Eastern Province, larger-scale protests by members of Saudi Arabia's Shiite minority population have at time turned deadly. Demonstrators there haven't just called for the release of political prisoners, they've also been demanding equal rights. Wehrey calls the prisoner issue ""the most explosive grievance in the kingdom right now."" ""That said, I think it will remain contained,"" he explained. ""The ruling family still has enormous co-optive and repressive resources at its disposal. It is still able to present itself as the glue that binds the country together, an indispensable arbiter over a fractious and dangerously conservative population.""","NEW: Amnesty International calls arrests persecution .

"(CNN) -- Oscar-winning director James Cameron has plunged to the deepest known point in the world's oceans, tweeting from his one-man submersible during the process. The filmmaker reached Challenger Deep, which is part of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, near Guam, at 7:52 a.m. Monday (5:52 p.m. ET Sunday), according to Ellen Stanley, a spokeswoman for the National Geographic Society that is working with Cameron on the project. ""Just arrived at the ocean's deepest pt,"" Cameron wrote on Twitter. ""Hitting bottom never felt so good."" At more than 10,900 meters (about 35,800 feet), the Mariana Trench is deeper than Mount Everest is tall. And it has had only two previous human visitors, as U.S. Navy Lt. Don Walsh and late Swiss explorer Jacques Piccard descended to that spot in 1960. Cameron is the first person to make the dive solo, a distinction that also had been sought by billionaire businessman and adventurer Richard Branson and Patrick Lahey, an experienced submarine pilot. The man behind the blockbuster hits ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" went down in a high-tech vessel, the Deepsea Challenger, which he and a team of scientists and engineers constructed in Australia over the past eight years. Outfitted with special cameras and robotic arms, Deepsea Challenger is able to dive vertically at speeds of 500 to 700 feet per minute and can withstand immense pressure -- up to 16,000 pounds per square inch. Engineers and scientists joined Cameron's team during Sunday's deep sea endeavor. Earlier, he'd said he plans to spend six hours at the bottom of the trench collecting samples for research that will allow scientists on board and around the world to learn about the habitat and life forms at that depth. ""It's so exciting -- every second you see something cool or you've got something to do or you're photographing or you see some amazing fish,"" Cameron told CNN earlier this month. Scientists hope that a fresh look at Challenger Deep will provide insight into many unfamiliar life forms in the depths of the ocean. It is estimated that more than 750,000 marine species have not been formally described in scientific literature over the centuries, triple the number of those that have been. The figures exclude microbes, of which a 2010 marine life census estimates there are up to one billion kinds. The nonprofit X-Prize Foundation has announced it will award a $10 million prize to the first person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Cameron told CNN he's not interested in competing for this prize, or any other, because his mission is purely about scientific research. ""You know, there's so much we don't know,"" Cameron said. ""I'm hopeful that we'll be able to study the ocean before we destroy it."" CNN's Adam Reiss contributed to this report.","Cameron hits Challenger Deep, part of the Mariana Trench, a spokeswoman says .

"Boston (CNN) -- A federal jury Monday saw a rare display of emotion from reputed mob kingpin James ""Whitey"" Bulger when he laughed while reveling in his former drug dealer's nostalgia as the dealer testified in his federal murder trial. Jurors also saw the family of a man shot to death, allegedly by Bulger, react to disgraced former FBI supervisor's tearful public apology for his role in two 1982 deaths. Former FBI agent John Morris apologized in court to the family of Michael Donahue, whom Bulger is charged with killing, for leaking sensitive information that eventually made its way to the reputed South Boston crime boss, and according to testimony, cost Donahue his life. ""I don't ask for your forgiveness, but I do want to express my sincere apology for things I may have done and things I didn't do,"" Morris said to the Donahue family. Michael Donahue's three sons and widow, Patricia, sat front row in the reserved section in the Boston courtroom. Bulger is charged with killing 19 people during what prosecutors allege was a nearly 20-year reign of terror in South Boston. Morris admitted telling his ""best friend,"" Bulger's disgraced, now-jailed FBI informant handler John Connolly, the identity of another informant who had agreed to cooperate with the government against Bulger regarding the 1981 slaying of a wealthy Oklahoma businessman. Bulger faces off with FBI agent who went from pal to prosecution . According to previous testimony from Bulger's former associate and partner John Martorano, Bulger rained bullets on Donahue's car in pursuit of drug dealer Brian Halloran to prevent Halloran from implicating Bulger and his crew in the killing. Donahue, who was not affiliated with the gang, was giving Halloran a ride home from a bar that night. He was shot to death in May 1982. ""Not a day in my life has gone by I haven't thought about this. Not a day in my life that I don't pray that God give you a blessing and comfort for the pain that you suffered,"" Morris continued while looking directly at Donahue's widow. ""I am truly sorry; I do not ask for forgiveness. That's too much,"" Morris concluded in a trembling voice as tears began to well up in his eyes. Tommy Donahue, one of Donahue's sons, and his mother returned Morris' gaze. Outside of court, Tommy Donahue said Morris can ""take his apology and shove it. His tears and his apologies don't mean crap to me and my family, not one bit."" During the court break, Tommy Donahue exchanged kind words with the man defending his father's accused murderer, defense attorney Hank Brennan. Brennan elicited the apology from Morris when he pointed to the Donahue family in court and asked Morris if he has ever apologized to the ""families left behind"" due to his ""inappropriate actions."" Bulger trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty . Donahue described his family's ""lousy predicament."" ""We want Bulger to go to jail, but we have to rely on Whitey Bulger's lawyers to give us the truth. The government isn't going to give it to us,"" he said. ""It's a double-edged sword."" Patricia Donahue, who spoke for the first time since the trial began, said about Morris' apology Monday: ""No, those words didn't mean anything to me. I think he probably really feels guilty; to me that's a good punishment because that is something he has to live with for the rest of his life,"" When court returned after a brief recess, Bulger began cracking up, his shoulders moving aggressively up and down, when his former drug dealing associate Joseph Tower started telling a story about the time Bulger, or ""Boots,"" saved Tower's brother's life. Tower is testifying under an immunity agreement and was called to the stand to explain Bulger's extortion business, or ""rent."" Bulger is also charged with extortion, racketeering and money laundering. Tower, former cocaine dealer, said he entered into a business agreement with Bulger, reluctantly admitting that Bulger got a piece of the earnings, in exchange for ""protection."" ""I said, now you are in serious trouble,"" Tower testified he told the gangsters who kidnapped his brother, alluding to his affiliation with Bulger and how the kidnappers had made a dangerous mistake. Bulger got the kidnappers to release Tower's brother after a money exchange gone wrong, Tower said. When the judge called a sidebar, the two old friends exchanged shoulder shrugs, head nods and brief smiles. Tower will return to the stand for cross-examination Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- A room with a view is a perk usually coveted by travelers. So much so that one of the most famous travel romance movies of all time takes that title. But travel is also about shutting the rest of the world out, and nothing does that quite like a room without even a single window to the outside world. Here we look at a variety of viewless accommodations, from rock-carved former monastery chambers to cave camping Fred Flintstone-style. Locanda di San Martino Hotel e Thermae, Matera, Italy . Shutting out the world is an ancient tradition at Italy's Locanda di San Martino Hotel e Thermae, which pays homage to the baths, or thermae, of the Roman Empire. The spa complex, carved out of limestone rock thousands of years ago, re-creates this popular imperial pastime, with stages of water treatments, from the anti-tepidarium with its carved Medusa head to the tepidarium, hydromassage and caldarium, all meant to reduce stress and remove impurities from the body. 7 amazing island rentals . Rooms at the Locanda di San Martino, in the southern town of Matera, are a mix of caves, grottos and stone structures, wonderfully silent retreats whether you use the spa or not. (But why wouldn't you?) Matera, in the arch of the boot of Italy, is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. For thousands of years, citizens have lived in the hillside city, its historical 'Sassi' (or center) made of houses and caves carved into the tufa limestone. Visitors to the Locanda will find themselves wandering amid Roman, Byzantine and Baroque periods of Italy's history. Rates start at about $120 for a double room. Sextantio Le Grotte della Civita, Matera, Italy . Matera is home to a wealth of underground structures and accommodations. Another choice for a beautiful room without a view is Sextantio, known locally as an 'albergo diffuso,' or diffused hotel, due to its scattered locations within a complex. Also located in the Sassi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sextantio has rooms with simple stone arches, their interiors lit in such a way that the tufa limestone takes on a warm honey-like glow. Flower-filled patios are part of the charming lodging experience, where breakfast and other meals are served splashed in Italian sunlight. Summer in the Park: Cuyahoga Valley . Daniela Giardinieri, of Paradise Possible travel agency, works with the hotel and also recommends visitors see the nearby Camerano Caves. Though you can't stay in them, ""they keep many secrets"" and her tours through the more than 1 kilometer of tunnels include underground churches, bas-relief decorations and rooms that might have been used by free masons. Rates starting from about $265. matera@sextantio.it . Grand Canyon Caverns Suite, Arizona . For a more rugged cave sleeping adventure, try the Grand Canyon Caverns Suite. Billing itself as ""the world's largest, deepest, darkest motel room,"" the underground accommodation is tucked away 220 feet below ground, shaped by millions of years of history. The Cold War added another chapter to the caverns' long story when in 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy made the 65-million-year old caves into a bomb shelter stocked for 2,000 people to survive for more than a month. Today, visitors can stay in the Cavern Suite, which is part of a 48-room no-frills motel. The suite consists of a platform in a hulking limestone cave outfitted with beds, a living area and bathroom. It's so deep underground and devoid of natural light that nothing lives in the caverns, not even a bat or a mouse. The largest dry cavern in the United States, the air is filtered and virtually moisture-free due to the limestone setting. This unique sleeping arrangement doesn't come cheap: The Cavern Suite is $700 a night as a double, $100 for each extra person. (928) 422-4565 . Argos in Cappadocia, Turkey . Turkey seems to specialize in this kind of accommodation, and one of the most interesting underground dwellings is Argos in Cappadocia. This 53-guest room hilltop hotel complex is built into a series of caves, underground tunnels and other ancient structures once used by monks and early Christians. Some of the underground rooms are outfitted with ethereal cave pools, and there are above ground options if you're claustrophobic. The whole area looks like something out of a fairy tale with unusual chimney rock formations making sharp peaks over short bases that might remind you of the Seven Dwarves, if the Wicked Witch had turned them to stone. More than five kilometers of caves and underground tunnels lead through Old UÃ§hisar Village, where the hotel is located. With a vineyard on the hotel grounds, there's never a shortage of wine for guests lounging underground. Doubles from about $240 for basic rooms to about $1,802 for a special room with its own pool, with discounts available for early booking or multiple night stays. aic@argos.com.tr . Cumberland Caverns, Tennessee . Imagine a giant underground living room complete with its own crystal chandelier. That's what you'll find at Cumberland Caverns. The chandelier is an elegant touch to an otherwise primitive underground experience. Up to 250 people can camp inside the caves, bringing their own equipment or using air mattresses and other items management can provide. Bathrooms, a snack bar and other amenities mean you won't be completely roughing it. Overnighting in the cave starts at $40 per person and includes a tour and breakfast. The giant caverns were discovered in 1810 by surveyor Aaron Higgenbotham who wandered into them, getting lost for days when the torch he was carrying went out. Today, campers and explorers can find such enormous spaces as Hall of the Mountain King, Devil's Quarry, Grand Hall, Waterfall Room and the Volcano Room, all part of a complex that stretches for more than 30 miles underground. Many people come for the day, exploring and staying above ground nearby. Or make it an event with the once a month Bluegrass Underground concerts, recorded for a local radio station and seen on PBS. No matter the season, the Cumberland Caverns are a cool, year-round 56 degrees. Desert Cave Hotel, Coober Pedy, South Australia . Some places are literally underground jewels, and that's the case with the Desert Cave Hotel in Coober Pedy, the opal mining capital of the world. It is so hot in the Australian Outback that many people retreat underground, and the town has underground shopping, dining and accommodation complexes -- even subterranean churches. The Desert Cave Hotel was specially built to mimic this local way of living under the ground, its walls chiseled out of the sandstone. Located just off the Stuart Highway, Coober Pedy might not be as familiar as other popular Outback locations, but that doesn't mean you haven't come across it. The town was one of the locations for the Oscar-winning Australian movie ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."" Underground and above-ground rooms are available. Rates start at about $240. reserve@desertcave.com.au . Seven Springs Lodge, Tuscumbia, Alabama . You may not have heard of the town of Tuscumbia, Alabama, but you certainly know its most famous native, Helen Keller. The Seven Springs Lodge is in this northeastern Alabama town, not far from her homestead Ivy Green, one of the town's most visited sites. At the lodge, your unusual room with no view is an above-ground alternative to many of the cave dwellings mentioned so far. Here, you can bunk in a converted grain bin outfitted with bedrooms and a living room. The bathrooms are located in a smaller grain bin between the two bunkhouse silos. These rotund rooms might not have a great view, but the surroundings are spectacular, set in the green foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Seven Springs is likely to appeal to travelers who have a sporting side, who might fish in the stream fed by the seven springs, go hunting in the nearby woods, or explore on horseback. If the silos are full, the complex also includes camp sites, most with full electric, water and sewage hookups. The town also has a rich musical tradition, and is home to the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Staying in a silo will cost you $75.00 per night for 2 people and $20.00 per additional person. Call three days in advance to reserve a horse. (256) 370-7218 .","Cave hotels, whether deluxe or rustic, make for a unique lodging experience .

"(CNN) -- The president of Sudan ordered the shutdown of an oil pipeline running from South Sudan, explaining that he didn't want his country's neighbor to use oil funds to arm ""mercenaries, traitors and agents."" The closure ordered by President Omar al-Bashir goes into effect Sunday, according to a story from his country's state-run Sudan News Agency. Al-Bashir announced the directive to a large crowd attending the opening of a power station outside Kharthoum, saying his decision ""came after thoughtful considerations of all the consequences and expected impacts."" ""If (South Sudan) decides to send their oil through Kenya or Djibouti, that's fine. Good for them,"" the impassioned leader said in a speech broadcast by state-run Sudan TV. ""But we will never allow their oil to go through Sudan so they could buy arms and ammunition and give them to mercenaries, traitors and agents."" It was not immediately clear to what or whom he was referring. South Sudan became independent from Sudan in July 2011, following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead. But the two nations have remained at odds on some issues, including defining their borders and oil exports. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been at odds about how much the landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. Al-Bashir directed his nation's military and pro-government militias to open up camps by Sunday, urging ""all people"" to join their ranks. In April 2012, Sudan and South Sudan slipped close to all-out war in a series of air and ground exchanges. The two African countries' leaders had agreed in September 2012 to resume oil exports, but failed to address other issues such as the fate of the disputed region of Abyei. Yet they appeared to reach a significant breakthrough in March, with the signing of a deal to withdraw their respective military forces from a 14-mile-wide demilitarized zone between them. The withdrawals were to be monitored by the commander of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei. That agreement followed international pressure from the African Union and U.N. Security Council to resolve that and other disputes peacefully.","NEW: Sudan's president say South Sudan oil funds help arm ""mercenaries, traitors""

"(CNN) -- The French Open men's final was interrupted Sunday when a shirtless man ran onto the court wearing a white mask and carrying a burning flare. He ran onto the side of the court that Rafael Nadal was playing on. An official quickly removed him while another held onto Nadal. A small fire broke out behind behind the boards near the court and white smoke filled the air for several minutes before the flames were doused. A second shirtless man was hustled away before he could make it onto the court. A photograph taken by Getty Images at the stadium at Roland Garros shows five men, who unfurled a homemade banner that calls for the resignation of Francois Hollande, the president of France. Four of the men hold flares. CNN affiliate BFM reported the men were part of a group called Printemps FranÃ§ais, or French Spring. The group is opposed to same-sex marriage, which became law in France in May, BFM reported. The legislation has prompted fierce opposition from many social conservatives and the Catholic Church, with hundreds of thousands of people joining protest marches in Paris and other cities over recent months. Another photo showed other protesters -- fully clothed -- two holding a sign that read in English: ""Help! France tramples on children's rights."" They were removed after yelling during the match. Play continued with Nadal leading countryman David Ferrer in the second set. Nadal won the match 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 to win his eighth French Open men's title.

"(CNN) -- Does the best transport technology come from outside the U.S.? That was the question pondered at the FutureCast event last month. Guests from around the world were invited to guarantee that the conversation would not be too Silicon Valley centric. Frost & Sullivan Chairman David Frigstad argued at the debate that much of the best innovation in transportation has come from outside the U.S. and even predicted that the building of what he called ""a collision proof mobility system"" would most likely be realized outside the United States. ""Other countries will probably get there first,"" Frigstad predicted of this kind of large-scale transportation project, ""because some other leader will recognize this as an opportunity to revolution their economy."" Read more: Self-driving cars hit the road . As an example of non-American innovation, Frigstad spoke particularly highly about the work of Shai Agassi, the Israeli creator of the electric vehicle network Better Place which, he noted, is ""far ahead"" of anything created in the U.S. But even Better Place pales in comparison to Songo, a $35 billion Korean city of the future built from the ground up. As Bernard Moon, co-founder and general partner of the Korean-American venture fund Spark Labs noted, Songo is ""basically a transportation lab where they are experimenting with various kinds of car sharing to bike sharing to water taxis and intelligent highways. Just everything."" Well perhaps not quite everything. Absent from the $35 billion Korean city of the future are flying cars. But flying cars do actually exist. As Peter Laanan, International Trade Director at Netherlands Business Support Office, explained, they are being developed by a Dutch start-up, Pal-V. ""You need a helicopter license to drive that thing,"" Laanan said about the Pal-V flying car.

As Steve Lefever, who heads up Frost & Sullivan's Russian office, explained, car sharing exists in Moscow but with a twist.

""What's the business model?"" I asked him. ""There is no business model,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The death toll in the flooding across Pakistan is now 58, the National Disaster Management Authority said Monday. Flash floods from torrential rains over the past three days have killed 15 people and displaced more than 20,000 others in Pakistan's Balochistan province, Abdul Katif Kakar, the director of planning for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said Monday. At a news conference in Quetta, Kakar said that in Balochistan, the flooding and rain killed six people in Khuzdar district, four in Turbat and five in Lasbella. He said two people were missing in Lasbella district, feared to have been swept away by flood waters. Monsoon rains and flash flooding continue to bring misery to people living in Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi and Loralai districts. The disaster agency says nine districts across Balochistan are heavily affected by floods. It says more than two dozen mud-walled houses have collapsed from flooding in the Nawan Killi area of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan. In Jhal Magsi, one of the worst-affected areas, 27 villages have been overwhelmed, forcing thousands of people to flee to shelter on higher ground in deserted mountainous areas. Kakar says the Pakistan army is helping people affected by the floods. ""The army has stepped in to provide assistance to people in Jhal Magsi. Two army helicopters are bringing relief goods to the areas. Tents have been dispatched to people in need to the Nawan Killi areas of Quetta,"" he said. And in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, flood waters have receded, and people are cleaning up mud and debris and assessing damage to their properties and businesses. Since the weekend, disaster management agency officials say at least 17 people have died in flash flooding across the province. Flood waters are receding in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, where eight people were reported killed. A security official who didn't want to be named told CNN: ""In most parts of the city affected by the flooding, Shah Town, Saddar Town and Defence, the flooding is now under control. This is not a large-scale problem; the authorities in Karachi are handling things well with minimum input from the Pakistan army.""

"(CNN) -- The moment has to happen sometime in a new administration, and the Afghanistan speech was it: the end of the Obama campaign of limitless aspiration and the acknowledgement of a presidency burdened by harsh realities and difficult choices. The candidate who had called the surge in the Iraq war ""reckless"" was proposing a surge of his own in Afghanistan. The candidate who criticized President George W. Bush's emergency spending bills for the Iraq war could end up proposing one of his own. The candidate who said that defined benchmarks -- and penalties -- were necessary for Bush's surge to work in Iraq provided none of his own in his speech. Yet, in the end, there was one consistency: The candidate who called Afghanistan a ""war of necessity"" found that, as president, he still believes it to be true. There was a clear subtext in the president's speech on Afghanistan: I wouldn't be in this awful situation if my predecessor hadn't sent troops to fight the wrong war in Iraq. It's awfully late in the process to jump-start this war. I tried to figure out some other way to approach this, driving my generals and the intelligence community to distraction for three months with all of my questions and scenarios. No one can actually be certain that this is going to work, given the fact that we have to depend on the previously -- and notoriously -- untrustworthy governments in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But, knowing the threats that are out there, we have no choice: ""If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan,"" Obama said, ""I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow."" But he found out that he could not. Nor could he go the leaner troop route initially proposed by Vice President Joe Biden. Obama himself made it clear that Afghanistan is no Vietnam: After all, our enemies there weren't looking for ways to kill Americans at home. And, by specifying a clear exit ramp, he made it clear that he isn't about to get bogged down in a war, as if saying it could make it true. Or at least convince his liberal base to support him. Yet what he couldn't escape were the comparisons that he might be morphing into a version of Lyndon Johnson: a president with a robust domestic policy agenda fighting an unpopular war at the same time. And you can just hear his argument: I'm not LBJ; we're not getting bogged down. We're getting in fast, and, after 18 months, we're gone. But, like LBJ and Vietnam, this is now Obama's war. It's also Obama's economy -- and his high unemployment, his health care bill, his deficit. He's all-in. And now, so are we. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger says Obama's West Point speech on Afghanistan signaled shift .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court gave an Idaho couple another chance Wednesday to challenge a government ruling barring construction of their ""dream house,"" an important property rights defeat for the Obama administration. The justices unanimously ruled Chantell and Mike Sackett can appeal a compliance order that said wetlands on their residential lot were improperly filled with rocks and dirt. A building permit was then revoked. ""Since the agency's decision was final and since the Sacketts have no other adequate remedy in a court, they may bring their suit"" under federal law, said Justice Antonin Scalia. The couple's supporters had billed this as ""David vs. Goliath"" fight against the Environmental Protection Agency. ""We're here to stand up for the property rights and the constitutional rights of all Americans,"" Mike Sackett told CNN in January, when the case was argued at the high court. ""We felt blindsided by the EPA, and we remain determined to fight."" The high court had displayed wide support for the Sacketts during oral arguments 10 weeks ago. ""If you related the facts of this case -- as they come to us -- to an ordinary homeowner,"" Justice Samuel Alito asked the government's attorney, ""don't you think most ordinary homeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in the United States?"" What happened has become a six-year fight pitting business and property rights groups against the federal government and many in the environmental community. The effect could be huge for the longstanding tension over the balance between commercial and private development, and maintaining clean air, water, and soil. The Sacketts bought a small parcel of about two-thirds of an acre in the Idaho Panhandle in 2005, near the shores of the resort community of Priest Lake. They hoped to build a three-bedroom home, surrounded by neighbors' houses, and had obtained a county permit. Gravel had already been laid for the foundation when EPA officials told them their land was a wetland. That barred any development. They were ordered to immediately ""restore"" the land to its natural state or risk fines of up to $37,500 a day. At issue before the high court was whether the Sacketts have a right to have a ""timely and meaningful"" hearing before a court to challenge a Clean Water Act wetlands-restoration order of a federal agency. About 3,000 administrative compliance orders are issued each year by the EPA. A federal appeals court agreed with the agency that the couple's only remedy was to go through a lengthy wetlands permit process, which the Sacketts said would cost thousands more than the property is worth. ""EPA is not above the law,"" said Damien Schiff, an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation, representing the Sacketts in court. ""That's the bottom line with today's ruling."" Agency officials said in a statement: ""EPA will of course fully comply with the Supreme Court's decision, which the agency is still reviewing, as we work to protect clean water for our families and future generations by using the tools provided by Congress to enforce the Clean Water Act."" The EPA still maintains the land is a wetland, and says the couple passed up the chance to work with federal officials for an ""after-the-fact"" permit, which may have resolved the situation quickly and cheaply, a remedy the government says it uses often for individual homeowners. But Alito, in a concurring opinion Wednesday, said for ""a nation that values due process,"" the bureaucracy the Sacketts endured was ""unthinkable."" ""The combination of the uncertain reach of the Clean Water Act and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners with little practical alternative but to dance to the EPA's tune,"" he said. Defining ""wetland"" and the potential impact on drainage and ""discharging pollutants"" from nearby land has long been a tricky, subjective process. Federal regulators for decades have had the authority to protect water quality, even when land is not directly adjacent to streams, rivers, swamps, lakes or oceans. The Sacketts property did not border Priest Lake, but the EPA determined gravel on the lot amounted to a pollutant into ""waters of the Untied States."" The high court in 2006 failed to reach a standard that would have redefined current wetlands mitigation laws, the laws now confronting the justices and the Sacketts. ""The Supreme Court has come to our rescue,"" Mike Sackett said just after the decision was issued, ""and reminded the EPA -- and everyone -- that this is still America, and Americans still have rights under the Constitution."" ""We did everything right,"" he told CNN about the permit process to build their home. He said the experience has been ""literally terrifying."" The case is Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (10-1062).","An Idaho couple can file suit against an EPA ruling, the Supreme Court says .

"Paris (CNN) -- Citing ""unsanitary and unsecure living conditions,"" French Interior Minister Manuel Valls ordered police early Monday to dismantle a Roma camp set up along suburban railway tracks in Evry, south of Paris, and expel 72 inhabitants, including 19 children. It is a controversial decision for President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party, which attacked former President Nicolas Sarkozy when his party dismantled Roma camps around France in 2010. Since the beginning of August, five camps have been dismantled under Valls' directive. ""I cannot support -- not just as interior minister, but as a citizen, as a militant member of the left -- these shantytowns, these huts where people live in conditions that are totally unbearable,"" Valls said in an interview with Europe1 radio. Without giving details, he said the people will be housed elsewhere and will not be deported. However, he rejected the idea of housing all the Roma inhabitants in one building. ""It is necessary to fight against these mafias, these networks who maintain delinquency, who maintain also a criminality notably through the exploitation of minors,"" he said of the Roma, who also are called Gypsies. Serge Guichard, of the Roma Europe support group, told CNN that his association was ""shocked and furious"" about the dismantling of the camp. ""We're talking about putting them in the care of the Red Cross. But after one week or two weeks, what happens to them? They return to the streets? Those who had a job will be unemployed, and children who were in school will no longer be educated,"" he said. ""It is unacceptable that in this country, human rights are not respected,"" he said, lamenting the ""incapacity of those elected to see Roma as humans and not objects."" During his presidential campaign this year, Hollande sent a letter to Roma support groups saying that when camps were dismantled, alternative solutions would be proposed. The European Commission investigated Sarkozy's government for abuses after the dismantling and destruction of Roma camps in 2010. At the time, Roma who voluntarily left France were given 300 euros in cash per adult and 150 euros per child. Last week, the government sought to appease criticism by easing up on work restrictions for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. Valls said he will accompany the French minister for European affairs to Romania and Bulgaria to address the question of the Roma encampments in mid-September. Roma are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, often in poverty. They tend to live in camps, caravans or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history. According to the nonprofit organization Doctors of the World, or Medecins du Monde, around 15,000 Roma people live in makeshift camps across France.","Interior minister's action means expulsion of 72 inhabitants, including 19 children .

"(CNN) -- An e-mail exchange released by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's office on Tuesday has revealed a series of potential Republican concessions to a three-week standoff over a budget bill that would restrict the collective bargaining rights of most public workers. The e-mails show a discussion between Walker's deputy chief of staff, Eric Schutt, and Democratic state Sens. Tim Cullen and Bob Jauch in a correspondence that reveals offers and counter-offers between two sides who have remained at an impasse since mid-February. Walker's initial proposal -- which passed the state's assembly on Friday and would exclude police and firefighters -- requires public workers to contribute more to their pension and health care plans, while prohibiting collection of union dues. It would also restrict the collective bargaining power of public-sector unions to be limited to wages, and would be capped to the rate of inflation. Pay raises beyond the inflation index would require a voter referendum. The original bill would also restrict contracts and would mandate annual votes for unions to keep their certification. But in this latest e-mail exchange, dated Sunday, March 6, Walker appears willing to take steps that would curtail the proposal. According to the e-mail, the changes would: . -- Allow unions to bargain for wages beyond inflation rates, without a mandatory voter referendum. -- Permit collective bargaining on certain economic issues, including mandatory overtime, performance bonuses, hazardous duty pay, calendar and classroom size, as well as certification or license payment. Unions and public employers would be required to define the parameters of the negotiations in each case. -- Allow public workers at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority to keep their collective bargaining rights. -- Permit public workers to collectively bargain workplace safety issues, while restricting workers from negotiating hours, overtime, sick or family leave, work breaks and vacation. -- Limit collective bargaining agreements to one or two years. -- Require unions to register less than one year after the bill is signed into law, and compel their registration every three years to stay active. The original measure would mandate annual certification. The modifications do not address Walker prohibiting unions from collecting dues, often considered a sticking point in negotiations. Later Tuesday evening, Democratic lawmakers offered an ""alternative adjustment bill"" in an open letter to Walker and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, identifying three areas where the Wisconsin state budget is facing shortfalls: medical assistance, public defender, private bar and the Department of Corrections. ""Recent reports made it clear that Wisconsin is not 'broke,' as you claim,"" the statement said, referencing Walker's earlier speeches. The Democratic proposal requires ""the same level of contributions for pension and health care that Gov. Walker proposed"" and would ""maintain provisions to restructure Wisconsin's debt, freeing $165 million to be used to cover shortfalls in the current biennium,"" according to the statement. The statement did not offer specifics in covering the shortfalls. On Monday, Walker dismissed as ""ridiculous"" a letter from a Democratic state Senate leader, who suggested meeting near the Wisconsin-Illinois border to discuss the budget impasse. Fourteen Democratic senators left Wisconsin for Illinois on February 17 to prevent a vote on a budget bill that ignited fierce opposition from labor leaders and their supporters. Last week, the Senate's Republican majority approved a resolution charging their Democratic colleagues $100 fines daily until they return. On Friday, Walker's office issued notices to unions, warning them of possible layoffs in early April if the budget battle continues. Wisconsin is confronted with a looming $137 million shortfall at the end of the fiscal year, June 30, and faces a $3.6 billion budget gap by 2013.

"(OPRAH.com) -- Every day, three women die as result of abuse -- that's nearly 1,100 killed every year. ""That number might not mean anything to you...unless the woman was your mother, your sister, your daughter,"" Oprah Winfrey says. Young men who admit to hitting, kicking, choking and even wanting to kill the women they claim to love are opening up to Winfrey and giving an unprecedented look inside the minds of abusers. Men who have abused women reveal to Oprah Winfrey why they did it. Sir says the first time he laid his hands on his wife, Christy, was just weeks after their wedding. He says he got jealous after a party where she was dancing with someone else. ""It set me off. I remember walking up to her and smacking her full force,"" Sir says. ""I grabbed her by her neck, and I kind of held her against the car. Then, I walked her over to the bushes and threw her in there, and I just started choking her. It was with every bit of rage, every bit of anger I've ever had."" After the first incident of abuse, Sir says he held a gun to his head. ""It was very hard for me to come to grips with the man that I was,"" he says. Sir promised Christy it would never happen again, and she forgave him. Though Sir swore to his wife that the abuse would stop, it continued for the next two-and-a-half years. Even while Christy was pregnant, she says Sir beat her to the point where she feared for her life. ""She didn't want to be intimate with me, she didn't want to have sex with me and I got very furious,"" Sir says. ""I got on top of her and sat on her stomach."" Christy says Sir choked her and covered her nose and mouth so she couldn't breathe. ""I was just thinking: 'Oh my gosh, I'm going to die right now. Is this really happening?'"" Oprah.com: 7 ways to end violence against women . When he was in a rage and beating Christy, Sir says he did want her to die. ""I had every intention to take her life. I felt like I had power and control over something in my life,"" Sir says. ""It made me feel invincible."" Luckily, Christy survived the abuse. ""By the grace of God, reality would come back to me as the rage would decrease,"" Sir says. ""I look back now and I can see that at that time, when the rage would come, it was like tunnel vision. I would try and express my anger and my disappointment the only way I knew how. And that was through abuse."" Eventually, Christy left Sir and gave him an ultimatum -- either they would include Christ in their marriage or she would not return to Sir. ""I went home and gave my life to Christ,"" Sir says. ""With that [freedom] came the relationship with my wife. It was so much better."" Sir says it's been about two years since he last hit Christy. ""If one of our arguments were to progress and continue to escalate, instead of adrenaline, it's knots,"" he says. ""I'll have knots in my stomach, and I'll say, 'Okay, we have to stop talking.' That allows me to step aside and pray and calm down."" Christy says that if Sir were to ever hit her again, she would leave. ""He has full knowledge of what he needs to be doing as a man and a father and a husband,"" she says. ""If he's not owning up to those responsibilities, then I'm better than that, and my kids deserve better than that."" Oprah.com: What happens when children witness abuse? Though Sir says the abuse has stopped, he admits it's an everyday struggle. ""If I ever think I have it under control, I'm in trouble,"" he says. Though Sir can't speak for all men, he believes his own abusive behavior was triggered by his past. ""Kids are precious -- they record everything,"" he says. ""I grew up in an abusive household, so I didn't know how to verbally communicate with my wife without putting her down. I didn't know how to verbally disagree with her and say, 'We don't see eye to eye,' and be okay with that."" Does Sir believe that every man who hits a woman once will hit her again? ""I say yes because I hit [Christy] more than once -- there was a second occasion, there was a third,"" he says. ""Do I think it's a cycle that can be stopped? Yes."" Tony is another man who admits to having abused a woman. In an e-mail to Winfrey, he said he beat a previous girlfriend so badly she bled. ""I couldn't express myself verbally, so I would take it out on her physically,"" Tony wrote. ""The thing that triggered me was that I was insecure as a person. To see her stare at another man, or to see her have a conversation with another man, or if she confronted me about anything, it enraged me."" Though Tony says he knew, even in the moment, that he shouldn't being doing what he was doing, he says he couldn't stop. Today, he says he's trying to make amends for his previous actions by speaking out against domestic violence whenever he can. ""[I want] to say, by grace and remorse, that I'm still here today,"" he says. ""I made it through."" Tony says it felt like he ""blacked out"" during the abuse. ""You don't understand what's going on,"" he says. ""I completely own up to [what I did], but in that rage, it's like your brain wires, they aren't clicking."" He says being in an abusive relationship is like being in a drug addiction. ""It becomes like your bond in the sense that the woman is like cocaine inside of that relationship. That's the only connection you have, because there's no real love,"" he says. ""In order to overcome it, it's almost like you have to separate, go to rehab, move out of the dope house and never come back."" Although physical abuse is never acceptable, Sir and Tony say it's the emotional abuse that leaves the deepest scars. ""The internal abuse, the demoralizing and demeaning of a woman, lasted longer than the physical abuse,"" Tony says. ""The bruises heal. On the inside, you strip away their pride, force them to compromise their self-worth, their self-respect."" Tony says a grooming process tends to take place within abusive relationships. ""In a sense, you gain their trust, but it's all lust and lies. The relationship is built on deception,"" he says. ""They feel like you love them, and when you get close enough to them, you're able to critique them and criticize them in a way that they feel like, 'He loves me, so I need to change this.'"" The grooming, Sir and Tony say, stems from the man's own lack of self-worth. ""In public I'm a very confident male; at home I'm very insecure,"" Sir says. It's an issue Sir says he and his wife are still working through. ""She still heals from the verbal abuse. I took almost every secret that she gave me to in an argument and threw it back at her as an insult,"" he says. ""So it took awhile to kind of have communication."" Many people who have never experienced abuse wonder why it isn't easy for a woman to leave after the first time she's hit. If a woman does leave immediately, would an abuser get the message? ""Would a man continue to hit a woman who refuses to be hit?"" Winfrey asks. ""I think it's different for each man,"" Sir says. ""To me, it could have been reversed in the sense of, 'Okay, I'm going to have to tame this now.' Or the opposite is, 'I shouldn't have done that.'"" Oprah.com: How do we end the cycle of abuse?

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been cleared of any misconduct by an internal investigation into the bribery scandal that threatened to drag football's world governing body into terminal crisis. But his predecessor, Brazilian Joao Havelange, has now resigned as FIFA's honorary president for his part in the scandal. Havelange and former executive committee members Ricardo Teixeira and Dr. Nicolas Leoz were all found to have accepted illegal payments from FIFA's former marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL). The payments were made between 1992 and May 2000 -- ISL went bankrupt the following year. FIFA's Ethics Committee -- set up by Blatter after the corruption scandal was investigated by the Swiss authorities last year -- said it would not take any further action, adding the case was now closed. The findings of the committee have been published in detail, following Blatter's re-election promise in 2011 to make FIFA's workings more transparent. Blatter, who took over the presidency of FIFA from Havelange in 1998, welcomed the report, saying in a statement: ""I have taken note of the report from the chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert, regarding the examination of the ISL case. ""I note in particular that, in his conclusions, chairman Eckert states that 'the ISL case is concluded for the Ethics Committee' and that 'no further proceedings related to the ISL matter are warranted against any other football official.' ""I also note with satisfaction that this report confirms that 'President Blatter's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules.' ""I have no doubt that FIFA, thanks to the governance reform process that I proposed, now has the mechanisms and means to ensure that such an issue -- which has caused untold damage to the reputation of our institution -- does not happen again."" Havelange, who turns 97 next month, was one of the most recognizable figures in sports administration, serving as FIFA president for 24 years from 1974 and doing much to make football a truly global game. Prior to FIFA, he served as president of the Brazilian Sports Confederation from 1958 to 1973 and was also on the International Olympic Committee, until his resignation -- because of his links with the FIFA scandal -- in 2011. A report by a Swiss court last year found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from ISL, who then owned the TV rights to the World Cup. ""The acceptance of bribe money by Havelange, Teixeira and Leoz was not punishable under Swiss criminal law at that time,"" explained Eckert in his report into the FIFA-ISL case. ""I agree with that determination. However, it is clear that Havelange and Teixeira, as football officials, should not have accepted any bribe money, and should have had to pay it back since the money was in connection with the exploitation of media rights. ""This does not change anything with regard to the morally and ethically reproachable conduct of both persons. ""I note that Mr. Havelange resigned from his position as Honorary President effective from April 18 2013 and that Dr. Nicolas Leoz resigned from his positions as a FIFA Executive Committee member, as a FIFA standing committee member and as CONMEBOL (the governing body for South American football) President effective from April 24 2013. Hence, any further steps or suggestions are superfluous. ""No further proceedings related to the ISL matter are warranted against any other football official."" Teixeira -- Havelange's former son-in-law -- had already stood down from FIFA last year, shortly after resigning as president of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Blatter claimed in 2012 that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former FIFA executives, but insisted he didn't think they were illegal. At that time Blatter was working as FIFA's secretary general. The report by FIFA's Ethics Committee again cleared the 77-year-old of any direct culpability but still raised question marks over his behavior. ""It must be questioned, however, whether President Blatter knew or should have known over the years before the bankruptcy of ISL that ISL had made payments (bribes) to other FIFA officials,"" the report stated. ""President Blatter stated during his interview with Mr Garcia that he 'couldn't understand that somebody is sending money to FIFA for another person,' but at that time he did not suspect the payment was a commission (bribe). ""President Blatter's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules. The conduct of President Blatter may have been clumsy."" The report from the Ethics Committee, which was established on guidance from the Swiss court and is led by U.S. attorney Michael Garcia, effectively draws a line under the scandal that first emerged at the end of 2010.","FIFA president Sepp Blatter is cleared of misconduct by internal investigation into bribery .

"(CNN) -- Pep Guardiola's first competitive game in charge of Bayern Munich ended in defeat on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund ran out 4-2 winners in the German Super Cup. Two goals from Marco Reus helped Jurgen Klopp's team beat the reigning German and European champions in front of a home crowd at the Signal Inuna Park. Dortmund always held sway in an absorbing contest but Bayern, minus Franck Ribery and former Dortmund midfielder Mario Goetze, were never far behind. Klopp's men were gifted the opening goal in the sixth minute when Reus headed home from close range after Bayern keeper Tom Starke -- deputizing for an injured Manuel Neuer -- had fumbled a cross. Dortmund were unlucky not to double their lead moments later when Robert Lewandowski scored, but he was adjudged to be offside. Bayern fought back and were denied in the 12th minute by a fine double save by Roman Weidenfeller who blocked Xherdan Shaqiri's low shot before palming away a rebound effort to safety. The half ended as it had begun with Dortmund with their noses in front but it was Bayern who struck first after the break -- Arjen Robben heading home in the 54th minute to level the scores. The goal sparked a frantic passage of play which saw four goals in ten minutes. In the 56th minute, Dortmund regained the lead when Daniel van Butyen scored an own goal and 60 seconds they were 3-1 up thanks to a wonderful curling effort from Ilkay Gundogan. Bayern halved the deficit eight minutes later when Robben received a cross from Philipp Lahm, before turning and firing a left-foot shot past Weidenfeller. But it was Dortmund who finally finished the contest in the 86th minute when Reus steered Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cross into the net to bag a brace and ensure Dortmund made a winning start to the season. The Bundesliga gets underway on the August 9 with Bayern Munich playing Borussia Monchengladbach at the Allianz Arena.

"(CNN) -- Seven-time European champions AC Milan breezed into the group stages of the Champions League with a 4-1 aggregate victory over Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. The continent's top club competition would have seemed inconceivable without the Italian giants but they made light work of their youthful opponents at their San Siro stadium. Two goals from Kevin-Prince Boateng and one from Italy striker Mario Balotelli secured Milan's passage to the lucrative group stages. After suffering defeat in their opening Serie A game at the weekend to Hellas Verona, Milan restored some pride and ensured they will be in the hat when the draw is made on Thursday. If Milan enjoyed a comfortable night, Scottish champions Celtic had to secure their passage the hard way after coming back from a 2-0 first leg deficit to beat Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan. Shakhter were prevented from conducting their usual pre-match ritual of sacrificing a sheep and were hit by two goals either side of halftime as Kris Commons and Georgios Samaras leveled the tie. And just as it looked like extra time was inevitable, James Forrest finished off a cross from Anthony Stokes to send Celtic manager Neil Lennon sprinting the length of the touchline to celebrate with his players. Elsewhere, two goals from Carlos Vela helped Real Sociedad to a 2-0 victory over French side Lyon, the Spanish side winning 4-0 on aggregate. Zenit St Petersburg booked their place with an emphatic 8-3 aggregate victory over Portuguese side PaÃ§os de Ferreira, winning 4-2 in Russia. Miguel Danny scored twice. Czech club Viktoria Plzen triumphed 1-0 away to NK Maribor in Slovenia thanks to Stanislav Tecl's goal as they ran out 4-1 winners on aggregate. In England's League Cup -- the third most prestigious domestic title behind the Premier League and the FA Cup -- five top flight clubs were in action. Everton needed extra time to beat third tier Stevenage 2-1, while Aston Villa defeated Rotherham, from the same league 3-0. Newcastle beat Morecambe, from the fourth tier, 2-0 while Cardiff triumphed 2-0 at Accrington Stanley and Stoke beat Walsall 3-1. The draw for the third round threw up a tantalizing tie as Manchester United were drawn at home against Liverpool. It is the first game in which Luis Suarez would be available to play for Liverpool after serving a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic at the end of last season. Suarez was banned for eight games the previous season after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra.","Italian giants AC Milan move into the group stages of the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for groups opposed to same-sex marriage in California petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that OK'd the resumption of such unions -- doing so a day after that ruling. Attorneys applied Saturday to the U.S. Supreme Court for ""an immediate order vacating"" a decision Friday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to copies of the document from ProtectMarriage.com and the Alliance Defending Freedom. That appeals court Friday lifted a previous injunction on same-sex marriages in California, ""effective immediately."" ""Without the immediate relief requested by this Application, the Ninth Circuit will circumvent the proper rules and procedures established by this Court,"" the application says. Those on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, think the appeals court acted appropriately. ""The Ninth Circuit had broad discretion as to whether to stay the injunction pending appeal,"" said Manny Rivera, a spokesman for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. ""Now that the Supreme Court has decided that the injunction against Proposition 8 must stand, it was entirely appropriate for the Ninth Circuit to dissolve its stay of that injunction."" California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state's constitution gives ""this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."" But months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman. The measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold, though lawsuits followed. State officials declined to stand behind Proposition 8 -- and, thus, its prohibition on gay marriage -- though private parties did step in and offer to do so. A federal appeals court later ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in. That happened in a 5-4 decision Wednesday, when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds. That meant Friday's news -- the resumption of same-sex marriages in California -- was expected, even though it wasn't known when it would happen. Supreme Court cases rest of citizens who sued, made history . ProtectMarriage.com and Alliance Defending Freedom say it shouldn't have happened then, at the least. In their emergency application, affiliated lawyers claimed the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ""lacked jurisdiction to issue its order purporting to dissolve the stay."" They reasoned that this appeals court wasn't authorized to weigh in until the Supreme Court ""sends a certified copy of the judgment to the Ninth Circuit."" Among other arguments, the application also stated that ""permitting the Ninth Circuit to prematurely dissolve its stay order would effectively deprive petitioners of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to petition for rehearing."" Such petitions for the Supreme Court to reconsider a case must be filed within 25 days after a ruling has been made. It's unclear if and/or when the high court might consider this request. Justices recently began a recess after issuing a number of pivotal rulings last week. And there's no immediate indication it will have any impact on same-sex weddings taking place around California. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a directive on Friday telling authorities in ""58 California counties that same-sex marriage is now legal in California and that marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately."" Attorney General Kamala Harris, in fact, performed one of the first such unions -- between Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect -- at San Francisco's City Hall.

"(CNN) -- German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer achieved the rare feat of saving two penalties in a major football final to help her side beat Norway 1-0 Sunday to win Euro 2013. Angerer kept out spot kicks in either half with substitute Anja Mittag scoring the only goal of the match in Solna in Sweden just after the break. It was enough to give Germany an unprecedented sixth straight European Championship crown, with the last two under legendary former player and now head coach Silvia Neid. An uneventful first half came to life when Norway were awarded the first of their penalties as Catherine Dekkerhus hit the turf under challenge from Celia Okoyino da Mbabi. Penalty save . Angerer, incensed by the earlier award of a corner to Norway just before the penalty incident, channeled her aggression to keep out Trine Ronning's penalty with her knee. Germany took the lead just after the halftime break with Mittag tapping in from close range after excellent work by Okoyino da Mbabi. Norway responded with a surging run from Caroline Hansen brought to an abrupt end to lead to the award of a second penalty. This time Solveig Gulbrandsen stepped up to attempt to score, but her effort was too close to Angerer, who fended it away. Germany enjoyed more good fortune when Maren Mjelde's cross was turned in by Ada Hegerberg, but she was rightly flagged for offside. Deserved winners . But the reigning champions were deserved winners, with Nadine Kessler's late low shot and an earlier header from Leonie Maier both hitting the woodwork. Still looking for their first Olympic gold medal, Germany have dominated at European level, winning eight of the 11 championships staged, with Neid being involved in them all. The result also continued two-time winner Norway's losing run in Euro finals to Germany, this there fourth and doubly frustrating thanks to Angerer's heroics. Norway had also beaten Germany in the group stages of the competition, but could not repeat the feat when it really mattered.","Germany win Euro 2013 women's championship .
