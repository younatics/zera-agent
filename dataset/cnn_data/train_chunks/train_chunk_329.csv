"(CNN) -- Tom Greer says he fought back when he was attacked by intruders at his Southern California home. Then he got his gun and fired at them and they ran. The 80-year-old homeowner says one of the fleeing burglars, a woman, shouted, ""I'm pregnant!"" He shot her twice, killing her. The woman was not pregnant, Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told CNN on Friday. The district attorney will decide whether Greer will face criminal charges. Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell said Greer walked into his house Tuesday to find suspects Andrea Miller, 26, and Gus Adams, 28, ransacking it. According to McDonnell, Greer said this was the fourth time his house has been burglarized. Police say the couple beat and threw the elderly man to the ground, causing injuries, which included a broken collarbone, cuts and bruises. Despite his injuries, Greer managed to grab his gun and fire at the suspects, causing them to flee through the garage and into the alley, police said. In an interview with KNBC, Greer said that as the suspects ran into the alley, Miller yelled, ""'Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant! I'm going to have a baby!' and I shot her anyway."" Miller died in the alley, the police chief said. When asked by KNBC how he felt about the incident, Greer responded that he had no regrets. ""I had to do what I had to do."" Adams, the alleged accomplice, fled the scene, according to Greer and Chief McDonnell. He was later arrested and charged Friday with five felony counts, including murder in Miller's death, residential robbery , burglary, grand theft firearm and possession of a firearm by a felon. He's currently jailed on $1.25 million bond. Adams was scheduled for arraignment on Friday, but his court appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court in Long Beach was postponed until August 11.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For Europe's biggest leagues the football season has ended, the boring business of kicking a ball about is over, and now the real fun can begin as the transfer window opens. Cristiano Ronaldo has left Manchester United to join Real Madrid for a world record fee of $130 million. What is the transfer window? The transfer window is a set period of time when football clubs are allowed to buy new players. Although players can't be bought outside the transfer window it doesn't stop clubs negotiating transfers before the window opens, with players signing on the dotted line once it does. There are two transfer windows per year, one pre-season, and one mid- season, which is open throughout January. The English Premier League pre-season transfer window opened at midnight on the last day of the season (May 24) and will close on August 31, while in the other big European football nations (including France, Germany Italy and Spain) the transfer window opens on July 1 and closes at the end of August. Other countries operate pre-season transfer windows to fit the calendar of their own football seasons. See our choice of the top 20 transfer targets ». Why does it matter? The transfer window can see some of football's biggest stars switch club and it is a period that can determine how a team will fare during the season ahead. It is a chance for coaches to rebuild and reinforce their squads, and a time when clubs can see their key players depart for greener pastures and bigger wage packets. When a club is active in the transfer window, making big name buys, it can be taken as a statement of intent for the following season. Just watch Spanish club Real Madrid bring in star players in an attempt to make up the distance between them and arch-rivals Barcelona. The global economic downturn means many clubs may not spend as much money this summer as they have in recent years, or that they may be more willing to trade or part exchange players if they are unable to meet a player's price tag. The final day of the transfer window, known as deadline day, often brings a frenzy of activity as teams try to finalize deals before the window slams shut, drawing the curtains until January 1, when the transfer fun begins again. Keep up with the latest transfer gossip with our transfer blog. Movers and shakers . This summer's transfer window is likely to be dominated by one club -- Real Madrid. Their newly elected club president, billionaire construction magnate Florentino Perez, previously headed the club between 2000 and 2006, when his policy was to bring football's biggest names to Real Madrid. The ""Galacticos"" brought to Real by Perez included the likes of Luís Figo, Zinedine Zidane, the Brazilian Ronaldo and David Beckham. Now Perez is back in charge and seems intent on reviving his ""Galacticos"" policy, rsigning former World Player of the Year Kaka before smashing the world transfer record to spay $130 million for Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo. Madrid have also been linked with Bayern Munich's French winger Frank Ribery, Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso and Valencia winger David Silva . But Real won't have it all their own way, facing competition from the likes of Chelsea. New manager Carlo Ancelotti is bound to have brought a shopping list with him and the club's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich will want to show that he still has the financial muscle to compete on the transfer money-go-round. Then there is Manchester City, funded by the vast oil wealth of the Abu Dhabi United Group. The owners have so far struggled to attract big names to the club and will be keen to show that City are genuine Champions League material. At the other end of the spectrum Spanish club Valencia are in all kinds of financial difficulty and may be forced to sell their biggest assets, with David Silva and striker David Villa the most prized of all.","The transfer window is the only time football teams can buy new players .

"(CNN) -- The southern Chinese city of Suzhou has been eulogized by artists since the Tang Dynasty. The poet Bai Juyi wrote: ""In front of storied buildings everywhere waft the melodies of flutes, And by the door of every house are moored ships and boats."" Today, Suzhou's classical gardens are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and its canal network, bisected by gorgeous stone bridges, has earned the nickname, ""The Venice of the East."" Yet when our small convoy of cyclists approached the city that so impressed Venetian traveler Marco Polo in the 12th century, there was little to wax lyrical about. The whole of the Yangtze River Delta was enshrouded in headline-making smog. I'd run into veteran Chinese rock musician Zhao Laoda in Shenzhen just before I'd set off on Ride For Hope, a three-week, 2,000-kilometer charity bike ride from Shenzhen to Shanghai organized by Shangri-la Hotels and Resorts. Zhao had retreated south for the winter to avoid ""the smog and cold"" of Beijing. ""The country's done,"" he complained. ""Only in the mountains will you find unpolluted areas."" His words would prove prophetic. Foreboding odors . Our journey began with much media fanfare in downtown Shenzhen in mid-November. Cycling smooth roads though some of China's most prosperous neighborhoods furnished a false sense of security. As soon as we exited the old Special Economic Zone the experience rapidly descended into one of brute survival along the gravel coated, anarchic roads of the Pearl River Delta. Shenzhen's Bao'an district, the city of Dongguan and much of the provincial capital of Guangzhou comprise the world's largest manufacturing base. Only three decades ago this land was a patchwork of rice paddies and fruit plantations. Now it's a sea of concrete, hurriedly and carelessly erected by entrepreneurs racing to squeeze quick cash from China's newly opened economy. The economic reforms that began in the south have lifted many out of poverty, but the environment has borne a heavy toll for progress. By day two, we were cycling seemingly endless roads, lined by indistinguishable factories beneath anonymous and repetitive gray skies. Each waterway we crossed emanated a foreboding odor. Wildlife was distinctly absent. It might sound surprising, but most of the time cycling through the pollution didn't affect me as much as you might think. There was one episode, however, on the leg between Hangzhou and Suzhou, when the pollution was at its worst. Feeling nauseous, I ended up falling behind the team because I had to stop to retch at the side of the road. The air literally sickened me. Sixty percent of the world's concrete . On day three we finally left the manufacturing lands behind. Beyond the scenic city of Huizhou, our troop of seven cyclists pedaled along relatively empty roads through broad expanses of green, undulating farmland. But construction was never far away. Even in the hinterland, real estate companies are busy erecting malls and high-rise apartment buildings. According to various sources, as much as 60% of the world's cement is dumped annually in China, creating a dust cloud that NASA has photographed from space. Many in China stoically maintain environmental damage is a consequence of the transition from a feudal agrarian society to a modern, predominantly urban one. The words of industrializing Britain's laureate, Charles Dickens, are often invoked. Didn't Europe experience the same thing? And hasn't it cleaned up its act since? The difference, of course, is that China's industrial revolution and urbanization program is of a scale unsurpassed in human history, a continental shift that's creating huge conurbations, as cities, like those of the Pearl River Delta, converge. Alarmingly, some detractors even believe much of the construction may be pointless. ""It is said that there are 64 million empty apartments in China,"" Hong Kong-based analyst Gillem Tulloch told Journeyman.tv. Indeed, on Ride For Hope we passed through more than a few Potemkin towns -- shiny, new and all but empty. All is not lost . Zhao Laoda's sentiments resonated with me when we engaged our first mountain range late on day three. Only in remote and hilly regions, where it would be unprofitable to build, is China's environment unspoiled. Of course, for cyclists mountains pose a different challenge. While we got stunning views -- bamboo forests, sequestered villages, isolated Buddhist monasteries -- cycling uphill for hours on end was grueling. We completed day three well after nightfall, thighs burning as we rolled into the tiny market town of Gongping. This pattern of heinous urban cycling followed by a few days of scenic, if challenging, rural riding would define our journey north to Shanghai. Chaoshan in eastern Guangdong province and the western Taiwan Straights in Fujian province are emerging mega-cities. Yet between them, in the rural areas of southern and northern Fujian, the rugged lands given over to tea cultivation are majestic. Villagers wearing bamboo hats toil in fields before stunning mountain vistas -- a picture-postcard China far removed from the ""booming"" economic centers. Our third province, Zhejiang, would also provide one day of fine rural riding. Several degrees north of our starting point in the subtropics we were now battling the cold. But an autumnal myriad of red and orange deciduous trees more than compensated for the chilly condition along road between Taizhou and Ningbo. ""Never seen air like this."" Beyond Ningbo, however, we navigated through smog all the way to the outskirts of Shanghai. ""The air quality index reached 305 by midnight, or severely polluted, the highest level,"" Shanghai Daily reported. Throughout the region, flights had been canceled, schools closed. All the while the Ride For Hope team pressed on toward the finish line. Remarkably, the air cleared considerably just as we entered China's showcase metropolis. After three weeks overcoming soaring mountains and sprawling cities, we rolled to the finish outside the Kerry Hotel in Pudong to be welcomed by an applauding crowd. We'd raised 400,000 yuan ($66,000) for charity having cycled more than 2,000 kilometers. Our typically self-effacing team indulged in the adulation. The next day as we packed our bags, despite the glowing sense of achievement, the team traded despondent words with regards to China's environmental plight. ""I've never seen air like we saw in Zhejiang,"" said Lu Yushui, a 21-year-old chef from Guangxi province. ""My friends are all buying fancy cars. I don't want to be like them,"" added Herman Wong, 52, from Hong Kong. ""We're destroying our world!"" But it was Lu Baokang, a cycling enthusiast from Guangxi, who best summed up the contrast between the grotesque and the gorgeous we'd witnessed cycling China's southeast. ""The big mountains and scenery have lifted my spirit more than I can say, but the pollution has been too serious. I wish there was some way to tell the world how liberating and non-polluting cycling is.""","The author pedaled more than 2,000 kilometers, much of it through epic smog .

"(CNN) -- Ed Nelson, best known for playing a doctor in the 1960s nighttime soap opera ""Peyton Place,"" has died at 85, his family said. Nelson, a New Orleans native, died Saturday at his Greensboro, North Carolina, home from congestive heart failure, daughter-in-law Asta Hansen said.Â . Nelson's acting resume stretches back to 1952 when his job was to play a man waiting in an airport ticket line in a film called ""The Steel Trap."" His last role was in ""Runaway Jury,"" a 2003 film starring Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Gene Hackman. The five decades between those jobs were filled with hundreds of television and movie roles, including several of Roger Corman's low-budget B movies in the 1950s -- such as ""Swamp Women"" and ""Attack of the Crab Monsters."" The 1960s brought cowboy roles in hit TV series including ""Rawhide,"" ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Have Gun -- Will Travel."" Nelson is created with 436 episodes of ""Peyton Place,"" which starred Ryan O'Neal and Barbara Parkins, starting in 1964. He was Michael Rossi, the town physician. He also appeared in the TV reunion movies for the show. He continued acting mostly on TV, through the 1990s, including playing several characters on ""Murder, She Wrote"" from 1985 to 1995.

"(CNN) -- We've come to know her as Lady Gaga, but before the world tours, ""The Fame"" or even the dress made of meat, photographer Malgorzata Saniewska knew her simply as her restaurant co-worker, Stefani Germanotta. In the summer of 2005, Saniewska, who goes by Maggie, happened to be tending bar at the same West Village restaurant where the 19-year-old soon-to-be star worked as a waitress. Just 24 at the time, Saniewska had moved from her native Poland to the United States two years prior with dreams of becoming a photographer. But to support herself, ""I started working as a bartender,"" she recalled. ""It was definitely a money thing. I did want to go to school, but I didn't do research on photography, my focus was to make better money."" Keeping an eye on her bank account is what drove Saniewska to study accounting, leaving photography to become an amateur pursuit for a while. She went from taking landscape photos of New York City to setting up her own shoots, with Gaga being among some of her first ones. ""We were colleagues, we didn't hang out really heavily, but she's the nicest girl ever. ... She's down-to-earth,"" Saniewska said. ""At that time, she gave me a CD of her first single, and I listened to it and I was really impressed. And she's a beautiful girl. Based on her looks and her personality I thought (a photo shoot) would be great fun."" CNN Photos: See Malgorzata Saniewska's exclusive and unseen photos of Lady Gaga . Back then, Gaga ""played piano and sang. This 19-year-old girl, she was really talented. She didn't talk about it a lot, (but) she did say that she studied music. ... I cannot even explain to you what she sounds like with just a piano, then or now,"" Saniewska said. ""I offered her the photo shoot, and she said yes right away."" Gaga had the perfect location in mind: Her parents' place on the Upper East Side. (CNN has reached out to Lady Gaga's rep for comment.) The two young women hopped on a train and headed over there, and set to work creating what Saniewska says became Lady Gaga's first photo shoot, although Saniewska didn't know that at the time. ""The house was empty, it was just the two of us,"" Saniewska said. ""I knew she was a singer, so our focus was her and her very first piano. We just hung out in her parents' living room, and the piano was right by the window."" ""She's a good model, obviously,"" Saniewska added with a laugh. Armed with just her first point-and-shoot camera, Saniewska let the intimate shoot unfold organically. ""We had no plan."" ""We basically walked into her house, she did hair and makeup, picked out the clothes and we started,"" she recalled. The lighting was natural: ""No strobe lights, nothing special, no tripods,"" she said. ""It was hand-held."" Saniewska, who's never been formally trained, said she shot around 200 photos that day. After culling through the resulting images, choosing the photos with the best natural lighting, she presented Gaga with a CD of the pictures. The burgeoning singer was happy with them, and used some of the art for her own promotional materials. Of course, there's no way Saniewska could have known that the young woman she photographed on a summer day in 2005 would become the international superstar she is today. As a matter of fact, Saniewska says that at first, when she saw her as Lady Gaga, she didn't recognize her, having been accustomed to her as a long-haired brunette waitress. Even as Gaga's fame continued to grow, Saniewska kept those early photos to herself ""out of respect,"" she said, particularly because she wasn't in touch with her. And then, she just so happened to bump into her old colleague in 2010. ""I actually ran into her in the East Village, and she came up to me. She was already Lady Gaga, and we spoke a little, and she leaned on me, and she said in my ear, 'Did you know that this was my first photo shoot?' I had no idea,"" Saniewska said. ""She was really excited. From that moment on I figured I could do something about it. And she's OK with it."" Saniewska hopes that those viewing the photos will get to see another side of Gaga, a peek at who the star was before the world knew her name. But even with all the fame, to Saniewska, she's ""still the same girl. The fact that we ran into each other and she came up to me - she didn't say 'Hi' and run off. She stood there for 15 minutes, just chatting. She remembered my name, she remembered who I was, and she had so much to say. She's still the same person to me.""","Malgorzata Saniewska worked at the same restaurant where Stefani Germanotta worked .

"(CNN) -- With the launch of the gleaming new Azzam, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich can no longer lay claim to being the owner of the world's largest superyacht. At 590- feet long, the Azzam is 57-feet longer than Abramovich's mighty Eclipse -- previously the largest yacht on the waves. The hulking superyacht is significantly longer than a football field, larger than the US Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and more capacious than many popular cruise ships. Last month, the behemoth eased cautiously out of its shipyard in Bremen, Germany, ushered by a team of powerful tugboats which were dwarfed by its enormous scale. The yacht has been kept under wraps throughout its construction for the past three years. The identity of the huge boat's owner remains a mystery, but some speculate that it belongs to a powerful Middle Eastern billionaire. Just building the yacht cost a staggering $605 million -- a fee which doesn't even begin to take into account the sky-high costs of its annual upkeep. In his book on the Lady Linda superyacht, author G. Bruce Knecht said that, ""operating and maintaining a yacht is at least 10% of what the thing cost."" By which estimation, just keeping the Azzam on the water could cost as much as $60 million every year. The project was brought to fruition by Mubarak Saad al Ahbabi, who assembled a triumvirate of yacht-building super stars: the Azzam's engineering was done by premier German shipbuilding company Lürssen, the exterior design was by Nauta Yachts and the interior was composed by Christophe Leoni. At present, very little is known about the interior detailing of the vessel. A spokesperson for Lürssen said ""the yacht is still under construction, and I doubt that we will get permission to shoot her even when she is ready."" Experts suggest that the interior could match or even surpass the opulence of Abramovich's yacht which is equipped with two helipads, two swimming pools, a cinema, a disco and a mini-submarine that can dive to 150-feet to explore the ocean floor. Bullet-proof glass and armor plating lines Abramovich's master bedroom, and the boat has its own missile defence system. The Azzam is described as having a ""sophisticated and luxurious interior in a turn of the century Empire style."" Although his primary work is not in yachting, French interior decorator Christophe Leoni says he is ""confident that the final yacht is everything and more the owner expects."" TheYachtPhoto's Peter Seyfferth commented: ""For a yacht of this size, I think that she looks amazingly elegant and sleek."" As well as its prodigious length, the yacht also travels at a record-breaking pace. With a top speed of over 30 knots (around 34 mph), the Azzam is considered to be the fastest superyacht on the sea. The Azzam is the latest in a line of vessels to have held the mantle of world's largest yacht. Prior to the Eclipse, the 482-foot Prince Abdulaziz, owned by the Saudi royal family, held the record for 22 years. And before it, the Rising Sun was briefly the record-holder. Built by American businessman Larry Ellison, The Rising Sun came in at 454-feet and cost $200 million. With many more billionaires around the world eager to inscribe their names into the history books, it is anyone's guess quite how long the Azzam will remain at the top. For now, its mystery owner can revel in the knowledge that his or her boat is at the very pinnacle of the yachting pecking order.","590-foot Azzam becomes world's largest superyacht .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana man told police he ""messed up"" by killing a woman in Hammond, then came clean, leading them to several more bodies in nearby Gary, Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said Monday. Doughty stopped short of calling Darren Deon Vann a suspected serial killer, but left the possibility open if police are able to connect the convicted sex offender to any of the six women found in Gary over the weekend. ""If we directly attach him to it, we can make that assumption,"" he said, adding that Vann's statements lead authorities to believe there are ""possible other victims."" Some cases may date back 20 years, based on what Vann has told police, the chief said. Text messages would be Vann's undoing, Doughty said. Vann, 43, ordered a prostitute through the backpage.com site serving Chicago and arranged a Friday meeting at a Motel 6 in Hammond with Afrikka Hardy, 19, the chief said. The person who arranged the meeting, whom Doughty described only as ""a facilitator,"" later texted Hardy and received ""suspicious texts"" she believed were from Vann, the chief said. She and another person went to the motel to check on Hardy, according to a probable cause affidavit. They found her body in a bathtub. Using a phone number provided by the facilitator, police electronically tracked Vann down, the chief said. A search warrant obtained for the vehicle police believe Vann drove to the motel as well as his home yielded a number of items that connect him to the scene, according to the affidavit. The search turned up clothing similar to the clothing worn by a man captured on surveillance video leaving the motel room, the same brand of condoms found inside the room and a cell phone that matched the description of Hardy's. In addition, Vann was wearing a shirt with a missing button. A button was found inside the room where Hardy was killed. The police affidavit said the shirt Vann was wearing when police questioned him matches the button from the room. Vann told police he ""messed up"" and expressed surprise that he was found so quickly, Doughty said. ""He admitted his involvement in the Hammond incident"" and began leading police to other bodies in Gary, Doughty said, adding that at this point, Vann is charged in only Hardy's death. According to the affidavit, police found signs of a possible struggle in the motel room: a broken fingernail on the floor and the beds moved away from the headboards. A former boyfriend of Hardy remembered her as a terrific person and friend. Michael Moore said they had dated in high school and continued to keep in touch. ""She was a really loving person. She was very funny, very outgoing. She always was pretty lively,"" he said. ""It's crazy because, I mean, she was really -- she was an amazing person."" Seven women total . Police found three bodies at three abandoned houses in Gary early Sunday morning, and later that night were able to find three more bodies, one at a new location and two at one of the places where bodies were found earlier Sunday, Doughty said. Hardy and three other women have been identified. Doughty and the Lake County Coroner's Office identified two of the women as Teaira Batey, 28, and Christine Williams, 36. Earlier Monday, Chelsea Whittington, a spokeswoman for Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, identified the other two as Hardy and Anith Jones, 35, of Merrillville, who had been missing since October 8. Only Jones had been reported missing, Doughty said. The coroner's office said Williams and Hardy were strangled to death. The coroner listed two of the Jane Does as homicides but didn't elaborate on the cause of death. Doughty declined to say how the other five women died. As for a motive, Doughty told reporters, ""I don't have a specific reason he does this."" The Gary homes where the bodies were stashed were all within a 5-mile drive of each other. Vann cooperated, gave police descriptions and accompanied officers to certain locations, the chief said. Asked why Vann chose to cooperate, Doughty said he wanted to cut a deal with prosecutors but didn't provide further details. ""It was just something he wanted to do. That's all I can say,"" he said. A man living next door to where one of the bodies was found told CNN affiliate WSBT that he believes the crimes occurred recently. ""Somebody had to come in there like last week or something, because (Northern Indiana Public Service Company) and the water company were there turning off the power and stuff, so there was no one in there,"" Justin Jones said. Vann has a record . The Indiana-born Vann is a convicted sex offender from Austin, Texas, police said. Records show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in Cherry Point, North Carolina, in 1993. He was convicted of aggravated rape in 2009 from a 2007 case, the Austin Police Department said in a statement. After serving five years in jail, he left for Indiana in June 2013, police said. Vann is not a registered sex offender in Austin. The police department there said detectives would be conducting a review of potentially related cases, asking anyone with information to contact its missing person and homicide cold case units. Vann also had a conviction in Lake County, Indiana, that was ""not in the sex offender category,"" Freeman-Wilson said. Court records show Vann was accused of breaking and entering and intimidation in 2004. ""He certainly was cooperative. He led (police) to the locations of these bodies. Whether he was eager or not, I'm not in a position to say that,"" she said. Several police agencies are now working the case, which could grow larger and expand to at least one other state, the mayor said. CNN's Miguel Marquez, Marina Carver, Chuck Johnston, Ronni Berke and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","A motel crime scene showed signs of a struggle, police say .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal may have warranted a reputation for playing through the pain barrier but surely not appendicitis. The world number two has apparently been struggling with the condition in the build-up to this week's Shanghai Masters. But whereas mere mortals might seek out their sick bed, Nadal has somewhat surprisingly instead opted to take to the court. The Spaniard did at least attend a hospital in the Chinese city on Sunday after complaining of stomach problems and was treated with a course of antibiotics. But with just two days of rest, he returned to action against countryman Feliciano Lopez Wednesday and was unsurprisingly below par -- losing the match in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 despite a spirited second-set fightback despite his ailment. ""For sure I don't feel perfect,"" said Nadal following the defeat, only his third to Lopez in 11 years. ""It's the same way I felt before, a little bit dizzy now but that's it. Nothing that I have to worry about. ""When you lose a match, it's not the moment to talk about obvious things. I lost, Feli played better than me."" Nadal could be forgiven for feeling cursed. The previous tournament in Beijing last week had been his first since Wimbledon because of an on-going wrist injury. Having missed much of the season, the 14-time grand slam winner insisted he had no plans to cut short his season to deal with his latest setback. ""My thoughts are to continue with Basel, Paris and London. It's true that the past few months I did not have the best of luck. I didn't have the best of luck since Wimbledon. ""I was playing a good year, very positive year. After that I was unlucky with the wrist, what's going on now. But there remains three more tournaments for me."" Nadal will consult with his doctor on his return to Spain to ascertain when he might require surgery on his appendix, doctors in Shanghai having told him ""sooner or later I have to take it out."" While Nadal is struggling through his latest setback, world number one Novak Djokovic is at the top of his form and won his 50th match of the ATP Tour season . World No. 1 Novak Djokovic clinched his 50th win of the season Wednesday as he beat rising star Dominic Thiem, 6-3 6-4. The Serb extended his unbeaten run in China to 26 matches. He is the defending champion in Shanghai and won last week's tournament in Beijing. Andy Murray, beaten by Djokovic in the semifinals in the Chinese capital, also advanced as he saw off Jerzy Janowicz of Poland 7-5 6-2. But Japan's Kei Nishikori exited to American hopeful Jack Sock, the Tokyo Open winner going down 7-6 6-4 in their second round match. Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, like Murray and Nishikori hoping to seal a place in the end of season ATP Tour Finals in London, also went out to Frenchman Julien Benneteau in straight sets, beaten 7-5 6-3. In the final match on court Wednesday, Roger Federer narrowly avoided going the same way, taken to a third set tiebreak by Argentina's Leonardo Mayer. The third seeded Swiss maestro saved five match points -- the first two coming at 4-5 in the third set, the other three in the tiebreak before -- before completing a 7-5 3-6 7-6 victory in two hours 42 minutes. Federer once saved seven match points in a match against Scott Draper in 2003 before going on to win and after his latest escape has reached the third round where he will face Roberto Bautista Agut.","Rafael Nadal admits he's been diagnosed with appendicitis on the eve of the Shanghai Masters .

The Fortune Global 500 ranks world's largest companies based on revenue. Here's what the list reveals: . U.S. keeps top spot -- for now . With 128 companies, the U.S. remains the most represented country, at least ""for now,"" Fortune said. Four American companies dropped off the list this year, while China gained six new representatives. China now has 95 companies in the top 500. The top ranks are diverse, with seven countries are represented within the top 10. Three of the companies from China while two are from the U.S. There are also companies from the Netherlands, UK, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. Chinese newcomers dominate . Seven of the 23 newly-listed Fortune 500 companies are Chinese. The China Development Bank is the highest-ranking newcomer, coming in at number 122. According to the bank, it supported the government's economic policies with more than $160 billion in loans. Pacific Construction Group was the highest-ranking private company, leap-frogging into number 166 spot. Russian sanctions impact limited . Two Russian corporations debuted on the Global 500, bringing the total number of the country's companies on the list to eight. Russian VTB Bank, the country's second largest banking group, and the power networks company Russian Grids made their first appearance in the Global 500, despite Western sanctions imposed on the country following Russia's seizure of Crimea. Gazprom, Russia's state-owned energy giant, has improved its standing within the top 20. It has climbed from 21 to 17, despite being at the center of the Ukraine crisis. Gazprom signed a huge gas deal with China in May, securing an estimated $456 billion over the 30-year term. The gender gap . Judging by the number of women heading the world's largest companies, the gender gap is larger on the global stage than it is in the U.S. Only 17 of the Global 500 companies have a female CEOs, compared to 24 in the U.S.-only Fortune 500 ranking. Last year, only 12 women made it into the elite club of Global 500 CEOs. The climbers . Four companies within the top 20 have jumped four ranks up compared to last year. Russia's Gazprom climbed from 21 to 17. Apple jumped from 19 to 15 despite disappointing sales in 2013. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Warren Buffett saw his Berkshire Hathaway move from 18 to 14, and French insurance giant Axa jumped from 20 to 16. Read more: Will Russia's friendship with China work?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You're overseas. It's late. You're driving alone when disaster strikes. You've crashed your car and you need help. Who do you call? In an emergency, it's easier to remember just one number. You might not know the number for the local emergency services, or that it's 999 in Britain; 15, 17 and 18 in France; or 10111 and 10177 in South Africa. But do you know that there is one internationally-recognized number that will connect you to the emergency services across Europe and even further beyond? The 112 emergency number was first introduced in 1991 so that European citizens could dial just one number, rather than have to memorize a different one for each country. The number is now operational in all 27 EU member states. It should also redirect to emergency services on GSM cell phones in countries including the United States (see box below). But 18 years after 112's introduction, it is still largely unheard of. A 2009 Eurobarometer survey revealed that only 24 percent of Europeans are aware of the number. In Ireland, nine percent know about it, eight percent in the UK and only three percent in Italy. The lack of awareness is partly the fault of older EU member states including the UK, France and Italy that have been reluctant to advertise the number, said Gary Machado from the European Emergency Number Association (EENA) that was set up to promote 112. Technical issues and language barriers also haven't helped. EENA told CNN the number still does not have 100 percent coverage across Europe. And 29 percent of people in the Eurobarometer survey said they had encountered language problems when making an emergency call in another EU country. ""Officially, 19 member states are able to answer in English,"" said Machago. ""But that's wrong."" EENA recently sent journalists to make calls from outside the European Commission in Brussels. Even here, from the center of Europe, staff could not immediately respond in English, let alone other European languages such as Spanish or Finnish, he said. But with new member states from central and eastern Europe adopting -- and actively supporting -- 112, EENA believes there is now is an opportunity to increase awareness and encourage more countries to upgrade the quality of their services. Watch CNN Business Traveller for more safety tips » . Bilingual interpreters . Given the difficulties accessing emergency services when abroad, travelers are increasingly turning to commercial services to get them out of tricky situations. Services such as ""Just text HELP"" from CallUma in the UK and Language Line Services from the United States provide 24-hour access to interpreters who speak over 170 languages and can help with anything from dealing with a medical emergency to finding a restaurant. CallUma founder Tony Partridge came up with the idea for the service after a harrowing experience whilst on holiday in Spain. ""It was 2am, my two-year-old was screaming and we needed an ambulance. But I didn't have a clue who to call,"" he told CNN. Over 150 people are signing up for the service every day, he said. A common request is for help with lost passports. ""We can get people to the nearest embassy and can arrange for transportation if need it,"" said Partridge. New tools . Tech-savvy travelers are also taking matters into their own hands and using social media tools such as blogs, location-based technologies, and instant messaging services to respond to emergencies. Research published in New Scientist magazine last year by Leysia Palen, assistant professor of computer science at the University of Colorado, revealed that social networking sites, including Twitter, were more effective than government emergency services when it came to distributing information during emergencies such as the Virginia Tech shooting of April 2007. Social networking tools are particularly useful during disasters when cell networks go down but SMS services remain in action. With this in mind, the Red Cross has worked with Twitter for its ""Safe and Well"" site so people can register their whereabouts during a disaster, as well as check on people they know. People are also using social networking and location-based technologies to help co-ordinate rescue efforts. Last month, friends of two British skiers who went missing in Verbier in the Swiss Alps used Twitter to find their friends' cell phone numbers. They then helped mountain rescue teams locate one missing skier by using GPS and Google Maps from his cell phone. Google's Latitude service, launched in February, constantly updates users' location, enabling contacts to see their whereabouts on a map as well as their activity via status updates. Privacy issues aside, the service could prove invaluable for people traveling alone in unfamiliar areas or dangerous situations. Smart phone applications such as Emergency Aid or In Case of Emergency (ICE) for the iPhone provide one-touch emergency contacts and first aid information in the event of an incident. Several phone makers, including Samsung and Asus, also offer SOS functions that, with the push of a button, send text messages to pre-set numbers and warn that the sender is in danger. With an ever-growing array of automatic services for cell phones, we may never need to remember an emergency number again -- whether that's 112 or not.","Emergency number 112 was introduced in 1991, works in all EU member states .

"(CNN) -- The future residents of a new Spanish neighborhood say they are the first in the world to name their street after the Super Mario video game character. Onlookers sporting fake black mustaches cheered. A Mario mascot danced. And a violin and cello duet performed the catchy theme song from the popular Nintendo game as the suburb in Zaragoza, northeast Spain, unveiled ""Avenida de Super Mario Bros"" Saturday. But the cartoon plumber character, who turns 25 this year, isn't the only one who will be honored by residents of Arcosur, which is still under construction. Other planned roads in the neighborhood include streets named for ""Sonic the Hedgehog,"" ""Space Invaders"" and ""The Legend of Zelda."" Video games won out over more traditional options in an online poll that residents used to pick their street names, said Antonio Almudi Miranda, president of the Arcosur neighborhood association. ""We are people who grew up living with video games. We know them very well,"" he said. ""I'm 25. I'm the same age as Mario."" The government-sponsored Arcosur project aims to build more than 21,000 residences for people ages 20 to 35 who are buying their first homes, he said. Construction began last year. A dozen of the development's streets will be named for video games, Almudi said. Names of musical composers and Spanish monuments will grace the neighborhood's remaining 46 roads. Super Mario's street is nearly a kilometer long and will have hundreds of homes on it, Almudi said -- and his will be one of them. The English and math teacher said he's looking forward to living on a street named after someone his students will recognize. Residents are proud to have Super Mario represented in the neighborhood, he said, and grateful that their street signs will not feature names of war heroes or violent characters. At Saturday's festivities, representatives from Nintendo handed out prizes in honor of Super Mario's 25th anniversary, Almudi said. But there's also a serious side to the publicity stunt, he said. Future residents hope increased media attention will pressure the government to finish building the neighborhood on time -- by June 2012. ""We wanted to make noise and show that there are a lot of us who are in this neighborhood,"" he said. ""We want our homes now, because we are many young people and we have been waiting."" Once it's constructed, more than 60,000 people are expected to live in the neighborhood, Almudi said. ""The majority of us are lawyers, police officers, engineers, businessmen, teachers and hard workers of all kinds,"" he said. ""Surely we have a lot of plumbers.""","NEW: The neighborhood association president says real-life plumbers will live there .

"(CNN) -- In a few breathtaking weeks, the winds of change whipped from Tunisia east to Egypt and Jordan, bringing down two regimes and putting the third on notice that it must make democratic changes. Now analysts, and a world suddenly focused on the region, are wondering whether those winds will continue blowing east into Iran and bring real democratic change or, instead, amount to only a whisper. A year and a half after the Iranian regime brutally suppressed the so-called Green Movement, a new test of its openness to reform and patience may come Monday. The government -- which Friday said the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt ""joyfully"" coincided with the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution -- has rounded up activists after Iran's two leading opposition figures called for a rally Monday in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East. From all appearances, the regime is not about to loosen its grip. And, unlike Mubarak, it won't be caught off-guard by the zeal of protesters. The Obama White House and some observers say Iran may not be as confident as it appears about demonstrations. ""They are scared,"" press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday hours after Mubarak stepped down. ""That's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this. That's why they have shut off all measure of communication."" Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. It was unclear whether people will take to the streets, anyway. ""We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies, and we will confront them with force,"" Revolutionary Guard Cmdr. Hossein Hamedani told IRNA. The Iranian regime on Friday celebrated the 1979 revolution that dethroned the shah. Opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi asked that the rally take place in Tehran's Azadi Square, the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, based in the United States, called Friday for an end to restrictions on the movements of Karroubi and Moussavi. ""The [Iranian] government is doing all it can to intimidate Iranians and deny their right to peaceful assembly,"" the U.S.-based group said in a statement. ""With recent events in Egypt, we see another round of repression in Iran aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights."" Observers point to an interesting synergy between protests in Iran and Egypt. They are waiting to see if what's transpired in Egypt will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in Iran. ""I think that's a very substantial possibility,"" Joshua Muravchik, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told CNN Friday. ""I think that the Green Movement in part inspired what has happened in Egypt. Obviously, Tunisia is the most recent inspiration."" ""In June 2009, when the Green Movement emerged, the internet was full of chatter by Egyptians sort of beating their breast saying, 'Why are we so lame? Look at that: a million Iranians out on the street standing up to their government. Why can't we do that?' "" ""And that sort of stuck with them [Egyptians], I believe,"" said Muravchik. ""They kept having these small demonstrations and somehow it finally started to gather momentum and the snowball turned quickly into an avalanche."" ""There's no guarantee though that it will work in the reverse direction,"" he said, referring to Iran. The disputed 2009 presidential election sparked widespread outrage within the Islamic republic, thrusting the depths of Iranian society into the global spotlight and inciting violence that hadn't been seen in decades. Iran quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists, reformists and opposition figures. A diverse opposition movement -- headed by reform candidates Moussavi and Karroubi -- grew into today's Green Movement, protesting for social justice, freedom and democracy. Experts interviewed by CNN said they believe Jordan, Bahrain and Yemen will likely see significant democratic changes before Iran, and each face different circumstances. The United States on Friday slammed Iran's ""hypocrisy"" for arresting opposition figures and the blocking of world media outlets and websites. ""For all of its empty talk about Egypt, the government of Iran should allow the Iranian people the same universal right to peacefully assemble, demonstrate and communicate in Tehran that the people are exercising in Cairo,"" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Iranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic. Abbas Milani, director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, said the Middle East is at a ""crucial tipping point."" If democratic voices and a government prevail in Egypt, he told CNN, Iran will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform. But, he and others said, there is a singular difference between Egypt and Iran. The Egyptian military, while key to power in the country, did not clash with its citizens. Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was established after the Islamic Revolution to defend the regime against all threats. The IRGC and its ""thugs"" have repressed Iranians, Milani said. The Iranian military is not as well equipped and as politically oriented as the IRGC and played little, if any, part in the 2009 crackdown. ""I think they knew the military could not be depended upon"" because they might side with protesters, Milani said of the Iranian government. The IRGC has ""expanded far beyond its original mandate,"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. foreign policy research center. ""Today the guard has evolved into a socio-military-political-economic force with influence reaching deep into Iran's power structure,"" the CFR says, noting that several current and former IRGC members have been appointed to positions as ambassadors, mayors, undersecretaries, provincial governors and cabinet ministers. Mohamad Bazzi, adjunct senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the IRGC will stand behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who helped consolidate their influence. And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has shown no signs of abandoning Ahmadinejad, Bazzi said. Milani doesn't expect the Iranian regime to allow large protests, but he believes ""major changes"" and an ""unstoppable democratic wind"" eventually will come to the republic. Iran also must address significant economic problems, he added. ""The Iranian society has profoundly changed,""he said. ""The regime has not."" Ali Alfoneh, a resident fellow at the conservative but non-partisan American Enterprise Institute, said he doesn't expect to see major reforms in Iran, at least in the short term, but he believes dissidents were heartened by the Egyptian revolution. ""The Green Movement was almost dead and it has become energized,"" he told CNN Friday. The reform efforts will succeed if some principal players in the regime become sympathetic, he said. In Egypt, armed forces helped bring about Mubarak's downfall. That won't likely happen in Iran, Alfoneh said. ""Revolutions take defections,"" Alfoneh said. Rapid changes in Egypt and the region make it difficult to predict what might happen in Iran, Bazzi said. ""Surviving the last round [of protests] strengthened the regime's hand,"" he said. The suppression ""put fear in the protesters,"" he said. To succeed, the Green Movement will have to reach out to opponents and ""to the millions who are silent,"" said Bazzi, a member of the faculty at New York University. Real change may not occur until the next presidential election, he said. Still, the Iranian regime is probably somewhat concerned after what happened in Egypt. ""They are crushing anything that moves,"" Bazzi said. Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council for Foreign Relations, said one big difference between Iran and Egypt are their economies. Iran has a lot of oil, and it can afford to be ""more reactionary and revolutionary."" Meanwhile, the Obama administration will continue to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, human rights and influence with militant organizations that threaten Israel, among other governments. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Friday questioned the White House's handling of Iran. ""Media: ask ""Will Obama Admin exert as much 'constructive' pressure on Iranian govt to change & allow freedom -- as they just did for Egypt?,"" she wrote on her Twitter account. As the world turns its attention to Iran, especially in the coming days, questions remain on whether governments can change and still hold on to power. Milani offered his opinion. ""The experience of the last days shows it is almost impossible to ask for democracy and not ask for a regime change,"" he said. CNN's Joe Sterling, Samira Simone, Sarah Aarthun and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Iranian regime congratulates Egyptian revolution .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Five former Blackwater security guards, indicted in a 2007 shooting incident in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead, will surrender to the FBI on Monday, a source told CNN on Saturday. An Iraqi woman looks at a blood-stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nusoor Square shooting. The men were identified as Donald Ball, 26, of West Valley City, Utah; Dustin Heard, 27, of Knoxville, Tennessee.; Evan Liberty, 26, of Rochester, New Hampshire; Nick Slatten, 25, of Sparta, Tennessee; and Paul Slough, 29, of Keller, Texas. All have served in the military. Two people with knowledge of the case said Friday that a sixth security guard is in plea negotiations. The exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury this week were not revealed, because the indictment remains under court seal. It could be made public by Justice Department officials Monday. Sources have said that charges under consideration included murder and assault. The Justice Department had no comment on the development Friday. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, also had no comment. Blackwater declined to comment until an official announcement is made. Blackwater Worldwide has been told by the government that the company will not face charges, according to several sources. ""We strongly disagree with the Department of Justice's decision to bring charges against Dustin Heard,"" attorney David Schertler said in a statement. ""Any charges brought against Mr. Heard are wrong and unjust."" Slough's attorney, Mark Hulkower, said he is ""an honorable young man who served this country with distinction for many years."" CNN was attempting to contact attorneys for the other men Saturday. The six guards were informed during the summer that they were targets of the investigation into the September 16, 2007, shooting in a Baghdad intersection. Blackwater claims that its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder."" None of the guards has worked for Blackwater since 2007, company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said. ""On September 16, 2007, at Nisour Square, Blackwater security guards were defending themselves and their comrades who were being shot at and receiving fire from Iraqis they believed to be enemy insurgents, in a place where the enemy has made a major city, Baghdad, the battlefield,"" Schertler said. ""Because of that and because of the deceptive tactics used by these insurgents against Americans, civilian casualties tragically occur. ""We have been and remain determined and prepared to fight these charges, and we are confident that Dustin Heard will be vindicated."" The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is that the law under which the charges are expected to be brought covers contractors working for the U.S. military, but the Blackwater guards were contracted by the State Department. Some independent legal experts have questioned whether U.S. courts would have jurisdiction in this type of case. Also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by State Department Diplomatic Security Agents, who were investigating the incident before the FBI tried to interview them when it took over the investigation. The State Department maintains that its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution but only promised that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered that some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI investigation. The indictments come within days of a new U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, which pointedly specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country. The State Department renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government. CNN's Terry Frieden and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Five former Blackwater guards identified .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A 49-year-old woman collapsed and died on the floor of a waiting room at a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital and lay there for more than an hour as employees ignored her, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which on Tuesday released surveillance camera video of the incident. Surveillance video shows a woman lying on the hospital floor for almost an hour before anyone helped her. Esmin Green was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric emergency department of Kings County Hospital Center on June 18 for what the hospital describes as ""agitation and psychosis."" Upon her admission, Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment, said the civil liberties union, which was among the groups filing suit against the facility last year seeking improved conditions for patients. The surveillance camera video shows the woman rolling off a waiting room chair, landing face-down on the floor and convulsing. Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19, the NYCLU said, and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. During that time, the organization said, workers at the hospital ignored her. At 6:35 a.m., the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot, the group said. Help was summoned three minutes later.  Watch the surveillance video » . In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. ""Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital's video cameras, the patient's medical records say that at 6 a.m., she got up and went to the bathroom, and at 6:20 a.m. she was 'sitting quietly in waiting room' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor."" The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, released a statement Tuesday saying it was ""shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care."" After a preliminary investigation, the corporation said it suspended or terminated six employees, ""including staff involved with the direct care of the patient as well as managers of security and clinical services,"" the statement said. A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green's record when it began the preliminary investigation on June 20. That information is now in the hands of various investigatory agencies, she said. The corporation pledged to put ""additional and significant"" reforms in place in the wake of the incident. The civil liberties group and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service filed suit against Kings County in May 2007 in federal court, alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital, the suit alleges, lacks ""the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons."" The video sent the organizations back into court Tuesday, demanding immediate reform. ""What's happening in Kings County Hospital is an affront to human dignity,"" New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman said in a written statement. ""In 2008 in New York City, nobody should be subjected to this kind of treatment. It should not take the death of a patient to get the city to make changes that everyone knows are long overdue."" The Department of Justice recently initiated an investigation into conditions at the hospital, the organization said, prompting the facility to improve some of its problems. ""But the culture of abuse and neglect remains and, as evidenced by the June death, the situation is too dire to wait for the Justice Department to act,"" the group said. Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said. In addition, the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff; expanding space to prevent overcrowding; and reducing patients' wait time for release, treatment or placement in an inpatient bed. On Monday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was appalled by the surveillance video. ""Look, I saw the film like everybody else did and I was -- horrified is much too nice a word. Disgusted I think is a better word. I can't explain what happened there."" Green, a native of the island of Jamaica, lived alone in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood. She had no close family in the United States, and her neighbor Beatrice Wallace described her as a quiet woman who had few visitors and spent most of her free time at church. The medical examiner is withholding autopsy results pending further study and investigation into the precise cause of death.","Esmin Green was involuntarily admitted June 18 for ""agitation and psychosis""

"(CNN) -- Molly Haskell will always have brotherly love for Ellen Hampton. After all, Hampton was once named John Cheves Haskell Jr. and used to be Haskell's brother. Until 2005, Hampton lived as John -- or, as his family called him, Chevey. That year, he told his sister he had been living with gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as ""a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender."" ""This was my 59-year-old brother,"" Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview. ""He had been this little boy, and all my memories had been of a male. It makes you revisit your whole past."" Haskell details the experience with a critical but compassionate eye in her latest book, ""My Brother My Sister."" At the time of the announcement, Chevey was married to a woman, Eleanor, and a loving stepdad to their two children. Hampton, now divorced, lives as a heterosexual female after gender reassignment and facial reconstruction surgeries, hormone therapy and a wardrobe overhaul. Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling. The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: You've obviously come to terms with Ellen's decision. What did it take on your part? Haskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it's very overwhelming. I knew I could never say 'don't do this.' My brother would have never hurt anyone, so it really told me how powerful the feeling was. Watching her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy, but she was completely upfront with it. Seeing how she handled it -- she would talk about it if people wanted to -- showed me this was meant to be. CNN: Yet, you do candidly write about having unexpected anxiety about the news. Haskell: I was afraid for her. I was flabbergasted that this was going on. There was shock and apprehension. I had been all for more diversity, and challenging binary roles for male and female behavior, but it didn't somehow include my brother changing sexes. The one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against. I think one interesting thing a feminist said to me is that I seem to embrace these binary principles in the book. I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female; we need these dichotomies, like good and evil. We make these divides to keep our footing in the world. The sex we're born is not immutable, and that is very hard to grasp. You can't really call her decision a choice. It's too painful, too perilous, it has to be an urge that we don't even have a word for. CNN: What was your takeaway from Ellen's journey? Haskell: I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all. For example, the director of ""The Matrix"" Larry Wachowski, who is now Lana Wachowski, has this wild red hair. My sister is so not like that. This book is an attempt to ""unweird"" the whole subject. I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people. So much changes, but so much doesn't change. You can take hormones to change this, have surgery to change that, but you can't change the voice, the hair, the love -- there is a core of self that doesn't change. CNN: How has it been different to have a sister rather than a brother? Haskell: It's wonderful. It's like I've gotten two for the price of one. We have differences -- it takes so long for her to get dressed! We're just much closer than we've ever been. It's hard to say the change hasn't made her happier. At first I thought I'm really losing a brother. It was like a grief; a death. But, her happiness is crucial. She's more open, more gregarious. I think my mother would've been very, very upset but, in a funny way, Ellen is the kind of person my mother wanted Chevey to be. CNN: How was it different at age 59 than it might have been earlier? Haskell: I think the reason she didn't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance. Why is so much of this happening now? Because it can. There is a word for it and there are people doing it. This submerged desire finally had a means of being liberated. CNN: Having Ellen in your life took some adjusting, even in small areas like the correct language, right? Haskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very self-conscious and nervous. We went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food. I said, ""Mine is good, but his is fabulous."" She (Ellen) smirked and I smirked. I would often call her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us. And on the phone, the voice is a huge thing that is not improvable. There is no good surgery. When she gets on the phone, I would see her as Chevey, my brother. Recently, though, I've stopped doing that. It's automatically Ellen. CNN: Ellen initially didn't want you to write the book, but then she changed her mind. Why? Haskell: She wished she had this book when she was struggling with it.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A 49-year-old woman collapsed and died on the floor of a waiting room at a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital and lay there for more than an hour as employees ignored her, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which on Tuesday released surveillance camera video of the incident. Surveillance video shows a woman lying on the hospital floor for almost an hour before anyone helped her. Esmin Green was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric emergency department of Kings County Hospital Center on June 18 for what the hospital describes as ""agitation and psychosis."" Upon her admission, Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment, said the civil liberties union, which was among the groups filing suit against the facility last year seeking improved conditions for patients. The surveillance camera video shows the woman rolling off a waiting room chair, landing face-down on the floor and convulsing. Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19, the NYCLU said, and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. During that time, the organization said, workers at the hospital ignored her. At 6:35 a.m., the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot, the group said. Help was summoned three minutes later.  Watch the surveillance video » . In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. ""Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital's video cameras, the patient's medical records say that at 6 a.m., she got up and went to the bathroom, and at 6:20 a.m. she was 'sitting quietly in waiting room' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor."" The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, released a statement Tuesday saying it was ""shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care."" After a preliminary investigation, the corporation said it suspended or terminated six employees, ""including staff involved with the direct care of the patient as well as managers of security and clinical services,"" the statement said. A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green's record when it began the preliminary investigation on June 20. That information is now in the hands of various investigatory agencies, she said. The corporation pledged to put ""additional and significant"" reforms in place in the wake of the incident. The civil liberties group and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service filed suit against Kings County in May 2007 in federal court, alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital, the suit alleges, lacks ""the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons."" The video sent the organizations back into court Tuesday, demanding immediate reform. ""What's happening in Kings County Hospital is an affront to human dignity,"" New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman said in a written statement. ""In 2008 in New York City, nobody should be subjected to this kind of treatment. It should not take the death of a patient to get the city to make changes that everyone knows are long overdue."" The Department of Justice recently initiated an investigation into conditions at the hospital, the organization said, prompting the facility to improve some of its problems. ""But the culture of abuse and neglect remains and, as evidenced by the June death, the situation is too dire to wait for the Justice Department to act,"" the group said. Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said. In addition, the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff; expanding space to prevent overcrowding; and reducing patients' wait time for release, treatment or placement in an inpatient bed. On Monday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was appalled by the surveillance video. ""Look, I saw the film like everybody else did and I was -- horrified is much too nice a word. Disgusted I think is a better word. I can't explain what happened there."" Green, a native of the island of Jamaica, lived alone in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood. She had no close family in the United States, and her neighbor Beatrice Wallace described her as a quiet woman who had few visitors and spent most of her free time at church. The medical examiner is withholding autopsy results pending further study and investigation into the precise cause of death.","Esmin Green was involuntarily admitted June 18 for ""agitation and psychosis""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- The Indian capital has launched a campaign to discourage urinating in public places -- a common sight across the country. The city of New Delhi, which is preparing to host the Commonwealth Games in October of next year, will soon be displaying large billboards along its gridlocked roads and on buses in a bid to embarrass those who urinate in public to end the practice, said Mayor Kanwar Sain. The signs will feature three characters: Mr. Thu-Thu Kumar (the spitter), Mr. Kuda Kumar (the litterbug) and Mr. Su-Su Kumar (the person who pees in public). ""The capital of India must be clean. We see how clean are places like Singapore. Then, why not Delhi?"" Sain said. Authorities will launch a similar campaign on television and radio, he said. Urinating, spitting and littering in public are acts punishable with a fine of $10 or more in New Delhi. Deep Mathur, the spokesman for the city's municipal corporation, said offenders had been prosecuted. He could not provide immediate figures about prosecutions aimed at sanitation control. Bindeshwar Pathak, India's winner of the Stockholm Water Prize, which is awarded to those who contribute to the conservation and protection of water resources, welcomed the new campaign as a motivation for a cleaner Delhi. Nonetheless, he said India's capital needed at least 40,000 more well-maintained urinals and bathrooms. Countrywide, India must build 112,000 toilets every day if it wants to meet its sanitation goal by 2012, according to the ministry of rural development. Even as the South Asian nation emerges as a global economic power, millions of its citizens still live in poverty. The government estimates that less than 30 percent of villagers have access to latrines, which poses serious health risks. ""Indians are clean individually, but community-wise their habits have not been very encouraging,"" said Pathak, who is credited with improving sanitation across cities, villages and slums. ""Things, however, are changing now.""","Indian capital has launched a campaign to discourage urinating in public places .

"(CNN) -- Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev apologized Saturday for referring to Serena and Venus Williams as the ""Williams brothers"" during a TV chat show. Tarpischev, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has already been carpeted by the WTA for ""insulting and demeaning"" remarks about the American siblings, being hit with a $25,000 fine and a one-year ban from tennis activities. Tarpischev is the chairman of the Kremlin Cup tournament in Moscow which is finishing this weekend and has held a string of leading positions in sports administration. He made the faux pas on a light night talk show in Russia -- Evening Urgant -- sitting next to former WTA star Elena Dementieva. When the subject of how difficult it was to beat the Williams sisters -- Serena has 18 grand slam titles and Venus seven -- Tarpischev made his controversial comments. After a translation of his remarks became public, the WTA responded immediately and its chief Stacey Allaster pulled no punches. ""The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport,"" she said. ""I have ordered Mr. Tarpischev to be fined $25,000, the maximum allowed under WTA rules. In addition, he will be suspended from any involvement with the WTA for one year and we are seeking his removal from his position as Chairman of the Board of the Kremlin Cup for one year."" Tarpischev claimed he had not intended to insult the sisters and that his remarks were light hearted. ""Serena and Venus (Williams) are without doubts outstanding athletes,"" he said in a statement released by Russia's tennis federation. ""The situation that has spontaneously emerged during the late night chat show had a bad influence on the perception of tennis in general and splits our friendly and cohesive team. ""I'm sorry that the joke which was taken out of context and attracted so much attention,"" he added. Tarpischev's U.S. counterpart David Haggerty, the president of the USTA, was angered by the remarks and issued a strongly worded condemnation. ""As the President of the Russian Tennis Federation and a member of the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Tarpischev is expected to conduct himself with the highest degree of integrity and sportsmanship. Unfortunately, his comments do not embody either of these traits and in fact were reprehensible,"" he said. Meanwhile, Serena Williams was handed a tough task when the draw was made Saturday for the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore. She heads the Red Group, which also contains Simona Halep and Eugenie Bouchard, two of the most promising young players in world tennis, and former world number one Ana Ivanovic. The White Group is topped by second seed Maria Sharapova and she is joined by Caroline Wozniacki, Agnieszka Radwanska and the in-form Petra Kvitova. Williams, who has capped her season by winning the U.S. Open title, beating Wozniacki in the final, is desperate to finish her year by claiming the prestigious title for a third straight year. ""I think everyone here is here to win. Everyone here is tough. Every match is going to be tough, so you have to be ready for that,"" Williams told the official WTA website ahead of the start of the tournament Monday. The race to claim the final places in the men's ATP Tour Finals in London next month is also hotting up with Britain's Andy Murray doing his chances no harm by reaching the final of the Austrian Open in Vienna. He beat Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-4 6-3 and will play rival and top seed David Ferrer in the final. Both men are battling for a spot but Ferrer had to dig deep to beat German fourth seed Philipp Kohlschreiber in a third set tiebreaker. Only three spots are still on offer for the finals after U.S. Open winner Marin Cilic booked his place by reaching the semifinals of the Kremlin Cup.","Russian federation chief apologizes to Serena and Venus Williams .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the greatest World Cup scandals and 25 years on Chile return Wednesday to the ""crime scene"" that resulted in the South American country being banned from the 1994 World Cup. It's a story of brazen deceit and shameless subterfuge and had it not been for the photographic skills of just one man, Brazil's unimpeachable record of being the only side to have competed at every tournament would have been put into serious jeopardy. Victory for either Brazil or Chile in their final qualifier at the Maracana Stadium would have taken them to the 1990 World Cup. With 20 minutes left, Brazil were 1-0 up and looking good for qualification, especially since a draw would also take them through. Then, their world suddenly fell apart. In the Chile penalty area, goalkeeper Roberto Rojas was prostrate on the floor, seemingly hit by a flare that was still fizzing and pumping smoke into the sky just inches from him. As legendary Brazilians Bebeto, Dunga and Careca looked on, Chile's players rushed towards Rojas -- furiously beckoning the medical staff once they had reached him. With the blood leaking from his head turning his jersey crimson, Rojas was soon carried off the pitch and, as booing filled a bewildered Maracana, the match officials soon abandoned the game. With the flare having been thrown from a Brazilian section of the stadium, football's greatest superpower -- Brazil has won the World Cup five times -- was facing an unprecedented elimination. ""I was terrorized,"" Ricardo Gomes, Brazil captain on the day, told CNN. ""I thought immediately of losing the chance to go to the World Cup. It was something really bad."" Now a football agent, Paulo Teixeira was working as a pitch-side photographer that day. ""Amazing as it may sound, no TV camera caught the moment the flare flew over and supposedly hit the goalkeeper,"" he told CNN. ""We photographers were sitting along the side line and saw the flare come over. I was amazed to see Rojas rolling over and bleeding from an eye, as the device had hit the ground about a meter from him."" With neither TV nor photographic evidence to prove otherwise, Brazil were in deep trouble but, wholly unbeknown to them, they were on the wrong side of an enormous hoax. In a planned incident, Rojas -- a highly-respected goalkeeper who was playing for Brazilian side Sao Paulo at the time -- had used a razor blade hidden in his gloves to cut his own head while lying on the floor. It was the most Machiavellian play to ensure Brazil's elimination, but no one in Brazil had any hope of proving that. Unless evidence could be found. ""Now of course -- with all the cameras on mobile phones around -- it would have been impossible,"" said Gomes. ""I missed the shot and so did most of the photographers,"" recalled Teixeira. ""But there was one guy by me -- Ricardo Alfieri, a good friend -- and I asked him: 'Ricardo, did you capture the flare?' He said: 'Of course, about 4-5 shots.'"" Teixeira immediately realized the huge significance of the shots but in an age when cameras recorded images onto slides, rather than digitally, obstacles remained. ""Ricardo had a problem. He was on assignment for a Japanese magazine and had to send the films to Tokyo -- unprocessed -- the next morning, and the Japanese would only trust their laboratory,"" recalled Teixiera of his fellow photographer, who now works for the South American governing body Conmebol. ""I said to Ricardo: 'Listen, you are the only one to have the evidence that Rojas is lying and cheating. I won't let you out of my country with those films unprocessed.'"" Just after the game had been abandoned, Teixeira had watched aghast as a Chilean pundit told a local radio station how he had seen the flare hit Rojas, so turning the knife into Brazil's unprotected back. ""So I found the radio reporter and told him Ricardo had the shots. He put Ricardo live on air and the whole atmosphere changed,"" Teixeira recalled. ""Ten minutes later, Brazilian football president Ricardo Teixeira [no relation] walked into the dressing room where we were. He was livid -- his face white, black, red, yellow -- all colors. ""'Who has the films?' he asked. I have them, I answered. I was the biggest asset on earth at that point and Teixeira was always asking if I was sure about the shots. But I knew I could rely on Alfieri's word, because he was the best."" So began a frantic -- and equally anxious -- scramble to see if the images really proved that Rojas had cheated. ""It took four hours to warm up and prepare the laboratory. The lab lady was furious -- having been dragged out of her Sunday to work at night,"" Teixeira said. While the lab was heating up, so were the deliberations over which agency would get the pictures. With one baulking at Teixeira's demand for five thousand dollars, the famous Globo network agreed to stump up the sum for the images. ""When the pictures came out, there were four clear shots -- starting with the device flying and then landing one meter away from Rojas. (CBF president) Teixeira was so relieved,"" said the agent Teixeira. On the Monday evening, Globo ran the scoop -- showing pictures that proved Rojas' play-acting -- in a program called ""Jornal Nacional"", a copy of which CBF boss Teixeira showed to FIFA after flying to their headquarters in Switzerland. Satisfied by the documentary evidence, football's world governing body awarded Brazil a 2-0 technical victory that duly took the nation to the 1990 finals. FIFA ruled that Chile had broken the regulation of leaving the pitch before a game's conclusion and then issued a final judgment, suspended Chile from the 1994 World Cup. The world governing body also issued a life ban to Rojas from playing football, with Chile's coach and team doctor receiving a similar ban. Then just 32, Rojas could continue to work in football however and as he licked his wounds back home in Chile, help came from an unexpected source -- Brazil itself. ""In 1993, Sao Paulo coach Tele Santana and the club president traveled to the Chilean capital Santiago to ask Roberto to work at the club as the goalkeeping trainer,"" Viviane Rojas, his wife, told CNN. Rojas declined an interview request on the grounds of poor health. The 56-year-old, whose FIFA ban was lifted in 2001, has been awaiting a liver transplant for three years now, after contracting Hepatitis C, and underwent a five-hour operation in March to relieve the accumulation of fluid in his lungs, according to Viviane. Despite his elaborate attempts to deny Brazilians what they consider to be their sporting birth right (i.e. playing at the World Cup), Viviane says Rojas receives no animosity as they live their life in Sao Paulo. ""Here in Brazil, Roberto has always been loved,"" she said. ""The most important thing for Brazilians is that he has, in his interviews, come across as a human being with a very distinct and good character. He has admitted his guilt and been forgiven. ""He showed his strength of character through his work and after training (Sao Paulo) goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni to be one of the best, Roberto also coached Sao Paulo for a brief spell from 2003 -- qualifying the team for the Copa Libertadores."" Viviane's sentiments are backed up by former Brazil captain Gomes, who bears no malice towards a man who could have stolen his only chance of playing in the World Cup finals. ""I met Rojas many years later and he admitted his mistakes. He is not naughty but that day, he had a lapse -- a really bad decision,"" Gomes said. ""Chile had a plan which they had prepared and it was unbelievable, truly unbelievable. ""The strangest thing is they had a good team."" On Wednesday, Chile are back in the Maracana as they continue their 2014 World Cup campaign with their second group game against Spain. Given Spain lost their first game, while Chile won their opener it should be a cracker -- but hopefully without the fireworks of the 1989 game.","Scandal!

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tom Laughlin, the actor who wrote and starred in the ""Billy Jack"" films of the 1970s, died Thursday, his family confirmed Sunday. He was 82. Laughlin's Billy Jack character was a heroic Native American ex-Army Green Beret who used his karate skills to fight racism and oppression. The second of the series -- titled ""Billy Jack"" -- was a low-budget independent film that became a box-office blockbuster in 1971. Laughlin's vigilante character defends a counterculture ""Freedom School"" from townspeople who harass and discriminate against the Native American students. The film was criticized by those who saw its central theme as a message that violence was an answer to injustice. Laughlin resorted to renting theaters himself to show the film after Hollywood studios refused to distribute it. The Billy Jack character first appeared in ""The Born Losers"" in 1967, fighting a motorcycle gang. Laughlin co-wrote and directed the film. Laughlin later attempted a political career, putting his name on presidential primary ballots in 1992, 2004 and 2008. Laughlin's acting career began with TV and film roles in the 1950s, including a ""lover boy"" role in Sandra Dee's 1959 beach movie ""Gidget."" His wife of 60 years, Delores Taylor, also acted in his ""Billy Jack"" films. Laughlin died near his Thousand Oaks, California, home Thursday, his family said.

"(CNN) -- Hollywood and the Kennedy family came together Saturday with the marriage of Robert Kennedy Jr. to actress Cheryl Hines. The two wed at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, which captured the nation's attention more than 50 years ago during the presidency of John F. Kennedy. ""They have wed, and it was beautiful,"" Hines publicist Ann Gurrola said. Robert Kennedy Jr. is the late president's nephew and the son of former attorney general and U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy.

"(CNN) -- Judging by the dust on the label, the bottle hasn't been handled for years, yet it feels warm to touch. Perhaps that's because it's part of a wine collection that I'm told belongs to Russian President Vladimir Putin and my palms are perspiring. Turning slowly, I half expect to be confronted by a bare-chested man in a judo stance, demanding to know what I'm doing with his vino. I'm imagining things, of course. Putin has more pressing matters to attend to than skulking around in catacombs in Moldova. I'm in the state-owned Cricova wine cellar, deep beneath the hills outside Chisinau, the capital. My paranoia isn't quite as foolish as it sounds -- Putin reportedly celebrated his 50th birthday right here. Moldova, Europe's least-visited country, is separated from Russia by Ukraine -- although since the recent annexation of the Crimea, it feels a lot closer. It certainly holds this complex little country's fortunes in its hand. Last year, when Russia ceased importing Moldovan wine because it said trace contaminants had been discovered, some said the move was really an expression of displeasure at European Union expansion. Wine is everything here. The countryside is covered by vineyards and Moldova produces some of the world's best wines, although you wouldn't know it looking at stockists in many parts of the planet. Britain's Queen Victoria was a fan, partial to a bottle of Negru de Purcari. Limestone labyrinth . The limestone labyrinth I'm standing in is one of the planet's biggest cellars. Cricova's tunnels are vast wine-filled wormholes that extend for anywhere between 60 and 120 kilometers (37 and 74 miles), depending on who you believe. They're so huge I'm exploring them in a van. Oceans of splendid sparkling white are made in this subterranean wine city using Dom Pierre Perignon's celebrated Methode Champenoise, and conditions are perfect for storing all varietals. Putin isn't the only person to have a private stash here. I spy a collection labeled as belonging to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. There's also a priceless group of bottles accumulated by Hermann Goring, including a 1902 Jewish dessert wine. The Nazi commander's ill-gotten hoard was liberated by the Red Army at the end of World War II and brought here. Moldova sees only a few thousand visitors annually, with Cricova among popular destinations. There have been some illustrious guests -- including Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, whose sampling tour reputedly lasted two days. Tourism clearly doesn't keep the country afloat, but wine sales do, which is why the Russian embargo causes such concern. Moldova might be commercially dependent on Russia, but culturally the country looks west, to Romania. Romania and Moldova were unified for several decades in the first half of the 20th century and share a common language. Moscow opposes a reunion, however, preferring to keep a meek and weak Moldova on its doorstep than have to contend with a bigger, emboldened Romania with close ties to the European Union. Cultural and political arm wrestling . On my next stop -- Transnistria, to Moldova's east, sandwiched between the Dniester River and the Ukraine border -- this complicated cultural and political arm wrestle gets even stickier. Border crossings are rarely fun, but the uniformed individual in the bleak hut straddling the line between Moldova and Transnistria takes officiousness to a new level. Finally, though, he stamps my form and I'm in. Exactly where I have got ""in"" to, however, is a point of contention. Transnistria is a nation in its own eyes only -- no other country officially recognizes it. For all its solemn theatrics, the grilling I've just experienced was geopolitically meaningless and I'm still in Moldova. Culturally, though, everything has changed; I've crossed a line from a Latin-leaning land onto Slavic soil. Many Transnistrians speak Russian and look more toward Moscow than Chisinau. Now that parts of Ukraine have voted to cede to Russian control, people are pondering the possibility that Transnistria might be next on Putin's wish list. Transnistria: Country roads . The territory has a defiantly independent attitude. It has its own army and a currency you'd be pushed to spend anywhere else on the planet. The local soccer team, F.C. Sheriff Tiraspol (started by a KGB agent and sponsored by a supermarket) regards itself as the national squad. Given the Monty Python-esque posturing at the border, it shouldn't have been a surprise when, at the Tighina Fortress in Bender, on the banks of the Dniester River, I come face to face with Baron Munchhausen. The Baron -- a German nobleman in real life, who became a captain in the Russian army -- was famous for his tall tales long before ex-Python-turned-director Terry Gilliam immortalized him on film in 1988. A renowned raconteur, Munchhausen once claimed to have flown over Tighina riding a cannonball during a battle with the Turks. In a monumental salute to his overactive imagination, he has been cast in statue form just outside the fortress walls next to the saddled projectile he supposedly rode. Less amusingly, the fortress also features a hideous torture chamber whose thick walls must have absorbed the screams of many unfortunates as control of the 15th-century fortress bounced back and forth between the Russian and Ottoman empires. I'm glad to escape and thankful for the fresh air as we drive back across the Dniester and through the bucolic countryside that sprawls across Moldova and Transnistria, where people still live the kind of rural life that's mostly extinct elsewhere in Europe. Wine-making monks . We pull up outside Noul Neamt, a monastery that was shut down by the Soviets in 1962 and transformed into a hospital. The monks moved back in shortly before Moldova became independent in 1991 and, in between prayers, they've been busy producing barrels of wine ever since. Here, from the top of the region's highest bell tower, I get an eyeful of the surrounding farmland, where donkeys pull cartloads of fresh vegetables past vineyards, and people congregate around wells at crossroads. I'm shown around by a charismatic monk called Alexi. He tells me how the Soviets cut the bell ropes in the tower, but when they tried to pull down one of the crucifixes with a tractor, it fell and killed the driver, so they left the rest standing. My tour finishes in the wine cellar, where we sample a glass of red straight from the barrel. Transnistria, though, is more famous for its fabulously smooth brandy, made in the regional capital by the Tiraspol Winery and Distillery, otherwise known as KVINT. In Tiraspol, I combine a shopping quest to acquire a bottle of brandy with some urban exploration and discover a highly eccentric city with a distinctly Soviet aura. Uniformed guards rebuke me for photographing official buildings. In the absence of playgrounds, kids climb on decommissioned Russian battle tanks ceremoniously parked in public spaces. Clutching my KVINT I stand in the street, under the stern gaze of one of several statues of Lenin. I stare straight back. This bottle, unlike the ones in Putin's rack, is mine -- bought and paid for.

"(CNN) -- Utah doctor Martin MacNeill was found guilty of his wife's murder in a verdict read early Saturday morning. MacNeill showed no emotion as he learned his fate, but a yell came from the section where his relatives sat. He will be sentenced later on the charges of first-degree murder and obstruction of justice. MacNeill had said his wife's death was an accident. In the end, jurors believed prosecutors' allegations that MacNeill drugged and then drowned his wife, Michele MacNeill, in the bathtub of their home on April 11, 2007, to be with his mistress. MacNeill, who had been on trial for 22 days in Provo, Utah, had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors alleged that his actions after his wife's death hindered the investigation, forming the basis for the obstruction of justice charge. However, defense attorneys said his wife, who was found with a powerful cocktail of prescription drugs in her system, died of natural causes. None of the medical examiners who worked on the case could determine definitively whether she died as a result of homicide. One of MacNeill's daughters, Alexis Somers, said she was happy with the verdict. ""There was justice for my mom today,"" Somers said. ""We are just so happy he cannot hurt anyone else."" During his closing arguments Friday morning, prosecutor Chad Grunander pleaded with jurors to return a guilty verdict on both counts. ""Martin MacNeill murdered his wife, Michele. Her death was not the result of an accident, and it certainly was not the result of a heart condition,"" Grunander said. ""The defendant carried out a cold and calculated plan to murder his wife. He relied on his knowledge and experience as a doctor and also as a lawyer to accomplish this."" In his closing argument, defense attorney Randall Spencer said prosecutors had simply not proved their case. ""There's not evidence in this case that rises to the level of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Spencer said. ""The prosecution has presented to you their cherry-picked versions of the evidence that is most consistent with their theories."" Prosecutors also called Gypsy Willis, Martin MacNeill's former mistress, to the witness stand. She admitted having an affair with Martin MacNeill both before and after Michele MacNeill's death. Less than two weeks after his wife died, MacNeill hired Willis as the family nanny to take care of his four youngest children. MacNeill could spend the rest of his life in prison for his convictions. He faces 15 years to life in prison for murder, and he could be sentenced to up to 15 years for obstruction of justice. The MacNeills had eight children, and to many in their community, they seemed to be living an idyllic life in a gated community when Michele MacNeill died. More than one of the children, however, has since come forward and accused their father of killing their mother.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Palestinian leaders, using a new strategy, will return Thursday to the U.N. General Assembly in their latest bid to garner enhanced international recognition. After its failed bid to win United Nations recognition as an independent state, the Palestinian Authority is seeking non-member observer state status, one step up from its current status as a permanent observer. Palestinian Authority leaders have been working with dozens of supporting nations to put together the wording of a formal draft of a resolution. Among those on board are Norway, Spain, Denmark, Iceland, France and Switzerland. Opinion: Why U.S., Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. The United States and the United Kingdom oppose the effort, arguing that the only real solution to the conflict will come when Palestinians and Israelis return to the bargaining table. ""I have said many times that the path to a two-state solution that fulfills the aspirations of the Palestinian people is through Jerusalem and Ramallah, and not New York,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Germany said it will abstain from the vote. The renewed effort comes a year after a more ambitious full statehood bid died because it would not get a majority of votes on the Security Council. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told supporters in Ramallah in the West Bank that the resolution, which many observers call symbolic, ""is the first step to achieve all our national Palestinian rights."" If approved, the new status would place the Palestinians in the same category as the Vatican. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev called the move ""political theater."" Read more: Gaza conflict leaves a 'cruel paradox' for Palestinians . ""The Palestinians can get a piece of paper from the United Nations, but they are not going to get a state because Palestinian statehood can only be achieved through negotiations with Israel,"" Regev said. Palestinian leaders argue they have the right to go to the U.N. because Israel failed to comply with agreements it signed more than 20 years ago. The last round of negotiations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority was in 2010. ""It's about a contract. Our contract is that in five years we should have concluded the treaty of peace and all core issues. This did not happen, and we're talking about 20 years later. And going to the U.N. is not a unilateral step,"" Palestinian Authority chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said in September. The new status would eliminate Israeli justifications for building settlements in the disputed areas of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, according to Erakat.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Xi Jinping is a mystery. So much so that the presumed leader-in-waiting of the world's most populous nation could vanish for more than a week without any explanation being given. In September this year, Xi disappeared. It sparked a flurry of rumors: he'd had a heart attack, suffered a stroke, was injured swimming, and had even gone on strike. Xi eventually re-appeared and normal transmission was resumed. But should we be so surprised? Barely an analyst I've spoken to can say they really know him, or what type of leader he would be. Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S-China Institute, has seen China's leaders come and go but concedes Xi is difficult to read. ""Xi Jinping is in many ways an unknown commodity. He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks,"" Chinoy said. CNNMoney: Economy key to China's transition . But this is not an era characterized by leaders such as Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, Chinoy added. The China of the 21st century has no supreme leader. The modern Chinese Communist Party is run by a small collective, the nine members of Politburo Standing Committee of which Xi is expected to be the next leader. This is an opaque system. It is a transition worked out behind doors -- nothing is left to chance and little is revealed to the Chinese people. As the United States prepares to elect its next president this week, a very different, more selective ""democracy"" is taking place in China. The 18th Communist Party Congress will come together on November 8 to chart a new course for the country, say farewell to the old leadership and usher in a new generation. More than 2,200 delegates from across China will gather for the Congress, and they in turn select the 200 plus members of the party's Central Committee, who in turn appoint the Politburo and ultimately the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee -- the country's decision makers. But most, if not all, of the outcomes are predetermined. The Congress itself meets every five years. It is designed to assess the country's progress, and set new directions. Every ten years it selects the new leadership. This year the legacy of the Hu Jintao years is under the microscope. Under President Hu and his Premier, Wen Jiabao, China's economy has continued to grow, lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty. China is now entrenched as the world's second biggest economy and closing fast on the United States. But there are disappointments, and Hu's much vaunted ""harmonious society"" is showing signs of cracking. ""These ten years without them accomplishing anything but following old customs without innovation can even be described as political backwardness. It could be seen as a mark of shame in Communist Party history,"" said Zhang Ming, an analyst from China's Renmin University. Historian Zhang Lifan is even more devastating in his assessment. He believes the very future of the party itself is at risk. ""I once told someone in the party, 'if your party is to fail one day, when they look for the reason of their failure, this period would be a main part,'"" he said. Certainly it has been a tumultuous year. The veil of secrecy around the party itself has been lifted, with reports of rifts and infighting. The purge of party power broker, Bo Xilai, sparked China's biggest political scandal in decades. Bo, once party chief of the massive metropolis of Chongqing, is now in disgrace awaiting trial. His wife, Gu Kailai, is in prison, convicted of murdering a British business associate. The case of human rights campaigner Chen Guangcheng made global headlines. The blind activist escaped house arrest and took refuge in the U.S Embassy in Beijing, before fleeing to America where he now lives with his family. China is treading many fault lines: a widening gap between rich and poor, rising unrest about everything from pollution to land seizures, and a slowing economy that some say is in need of serious reform. To some China watchers, Xi is going to need to be a traitor to his own class if he is to succeed. Critics say the party and China's elite have lost touch with the people and are facing a crisis of legitimacy. But others warn against looking to Xi for radical change -- as first and foremost he is a son of the party. ""He is part of a consensus to keep the Communist Party as the only ruling party. Any so-called liberty must only be on the condition of the survival of a one-party dictatorship,"" said historian Zhang. What happens in China no longer stays in China. In a world still mired in economic crisis, China is an engine of growth. As the Chinese economy slows, alarm bells sound. China is also rattling nations in its own region. Territorial disputes with the likes of Japan and the Philippines have made China's neighbors nervous. Meanwhile, the U.S. is pivoting its geo-strategic policy away from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to east Asia, strengthening key alliances and even boosting its military presence in the region -- much to the consternation of Beijing. Internal strife and external tensions -- this is the China that Xi stands to inherit. Kevin Rudd, a former Australian Prime Minister and once a diplomat in Beijing, has met Xi and says he is a man ""you can do business with."" Yet Xi remains largely unknowable, a man who could disappear without explanation.","China preparing to bring in its next generation of leaders at its party congress .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani armed forces have killed 80 militants since launching an assault on a region recently held by the Taliban, the military announced Sunday. Displaced people from Buner district flee the fighting. Three soldiers have been killed and eight wounded in the crackdown in the Buner district in the northwest of the country, the military statement said. The Pakistani offensive started in the province last Sunday, after Taliban militants moved into Buner, a move that alarmed U.S. and Pakistani officials. Pakistani security forces also killed at least 16 militants late Friday and early Saturday in the Mohmand district, in the country's volatile tribal region, the country's military said on Saturday. The incident appears to be separate from the hostilities in Buner. However, it reflects the tensions in the region and could signal a spread of fighting resulting from the crackdown. In the incident, about 100 militants attacked a Frontier Corps post in the Mohmand Agency, or district, an area where militants hold great sway. Troops returned fire and killed the 16 militants, the military said. Mohmand is in the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas that border a volatile region in war-torn Afghanistan and Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. Earlier this year, Pakistan had entered into an agreement with militants, allowing them to enforce Islamic law, or sharia, in parts of Swat Valley in exchange for ceasing violence. The Swat Valley is a broader area that includes several provincial districts, including Chitral, Swat, Shangla, Malakand, Upper Dir, and Lower Dir. But Pakistani officials say the armed militants' advance into Buner district violated the agreement and briefly halted peace talks between the two sides in North West Frontier Province. Representatives from Pakistan's government and the Taliban restarted their negotiations on Friday and were planning to have another session soon, a provincial spokesman said. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries.","Pakistani security forces kill at least 80 militants in country's tribal region .

"Johnston, Iowa (CNN) -- Rick Santorum has two words for Mitt Romney. ""Game on,"" Santorum said in a speech to supporters after the Iowa caucuses. With a low-budget, grass-roots campaign that chugged along in near invisibility for months, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania caught the Republican establishment completely off-guard with a stunning performance Tuesday night in Iowa. (Romney edged out Santorum by eight votes, but both had roughly 25% of the vote.) Analysis: Narrow loss a big win for Santorum . Asked whether he felt like another Pennsylvanian, the fictional underdog fighter Rocky Balboa, Santorum could not resist predicting a sequel in the upcoming New Hampshire primary. ""There's going to be a rematch,"" Santorum said to CNN about the battle ahead against caucus winner Romney. Santorum brushed off news that Sen. John McCain would endorse Romney. McCain was the winner of the 2008 New Hampshire primary and the eventual GOP presidential nominee that year. ""I would have expected that. I'm surprised he hadn't done it sooner,"" Santorum said of McCain's expected endorsement. Santorum worked in a dig that McCain's moderate views meshed better with those of Romney. Opinion: Can Santorum show Iowa was no fluke? Santorum may have been the only politician in Iowa who was not surprised by his remarkable performance. Even his top Iowa surrogate, Secretary of State Matt Schultz, said he didn't expect Santorum to do so well. In the hours before the caucuses began, Santorum sounded cautiously optimistic. But he was careful not to predict victory. ""I feel like if we can crack the top three that would be great,"" Santorum told CNN. 5 things we learned from the Iowa caucuses . Santorum earned his strong showing with an old-fashioned, retail-politics campaign. In the months leading up to the caucuses, he held roughly 360 town halls across all of Iowa's 99 counties. Unlike his more well-financed rivals, the former senator worked off of a shoestring budget. While some candidates had their faces plastered across slick campaign buses, Santorum rode around in a supporter's pickup known as ""The Chuck Truck."" 'Fear Rick's Vest': Santorum's sweaters go viral . Driving home that down-to-earth image, Santorum often wore his trademark sweater vest and cowboy boots. All along the way, Santorum was patient. He watched other conservative alternatives to Romney rise and fall. As luck would turn out, Santorum's moment would come at exactly the right moment. One week before the caucuses, two polls from CNN/Time/ORC and NBC/Marist confirmed Santorum was gaining support. Then Saturday's Des Moines Register poll, which has a solid track record of predicting the outcome of the caucuses, confirmed the Santorum surge. Over the four days during which the poll was conducted, Santorum finished third. But voter preferences measured during the last two days found Santorum in second place, statistically tied with Romney. In a fresh sign of Santorum's strength, the former Massachusetts governor took a soft jab at his newfound rival. ""Like Speaker Gingrich, Sen. Santorum has spent his career in the government in Washington,"" Romney said. Speaking to an overflow crowd jammed into a Polk City coffee shop, Santorum fired off a surprisingly sharp response, taking aim at Romney's business experience. ""I know one of my opponents who has now directed his attention to me, surprisingly, has said that he has executive experience. We are not looking for a chief executive officer for this country. We are looking for a commander in chief,"" Santorum said. In the day before the caucuses, Santorum told another crowd in Boone he was the subject of negative robocalls that accused him of opposing the Second Amendment. Santorum blamed another rival, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, for being behind the calls. There were also challenges coming from conservative media outlets, where right-leaning pundits questioned Santorum's viability in a general election. In 2006, Santorum lost his Senate seat to Democrat Bob Casey by 18 percentage points. Santorum brushed off the concern. ""I lost an election in the worst election year for Republicans in the history of our state,"" Santorum said. A major factor in Santorum's defeat was his controversial vote to have a judge intervene in the case of Terri Schiavo, a Florida woman who was living in a vegetative state at the time and whose family was deeply divided over whether to remove her feeding tube. Santorum defended his vote to CNN. ""What I cared about with Terri Schiavo was that a judge looked at the case fairly and they did. And they made their decision,"" Santorum said. ""I didn't think that was an unreasonable thing to do."" Polls conducted before Santorum's re-election defeat found voters in Pennsylvania were opposed to congressional intervention in the case. Santorum's handling of the Schiavo case did agree with social conservatives, who are now flocking to his campaign. One day before the Iowa caucuses, the former senator picked up the endorsement of Jim Bob Duggar, a reality TV star and Christian conservative who backed Mike Huckabee in 2008. Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses with the support of evangelical votes. Duggar and roughly half of his 19 children accompanied Santorum on stops Monday across Iowa. The reality-show family traveled in a Santorum for President bus. In the final moments when nearly all of the votes were in, Santorum was 19 ahead of Romney. People at the Santorum caucus party joked it was the Duggar family that had put him over the top.","Iowa runner-up Rick Santorum predicts ""rematch"" with Mitt Romney in New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- The growing refugee crisis in northwestern Pakistan is fueling the danger of spreading the polio virus among the displaced population, the World Health Organization warned on Wednesday. More than 450,000 Pakistanis have fled their homes in the past two weeks as the military tries to root out militants in the North Waziristan region near the border with Afghanistan. But ""this number could reach 600,000 as the military operation continues,"" federal minister for states and frontier regions, retired Lt. Gen. Abdul Qadri Baloch, said during a news conference on Pakistan State TV Wednesday. That could mean an even bigger danger of spreading the disease as the number of refugees increases. Rising polio risk . Polio rates are higher than average in North Waziristan due to a ban on anti-polio campaigns imposed by the Pakistani Taliban two years ago in response to U.S. drone strikes. In June 2012, Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur released a statement that said vaccines ""would be banned in North Waziristan until the drones strikes are stopped."" He added that drone strikes ""are worse than polio."" Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. It can lead to paralysis and death. The virus is easily preventable through immunization, but there's no cure once it is contracted. ""The highest number of polio cases have been witnessed in North Waziristan,"" Pakistan WHO spokesperson Dr. Nima Saeed told reporters in Islamabad. ""The mass migration of people from the vulnerable area has increased the risk of the polio virus spreading further."" Mass vaccination . The WHO is working to contain the threat by vaccinating people along routes out of North Waziristan. Many are receiving the dose at government-run centers set up to register displaced people. As of Wednesday, the U.N. said around 146,000 people had been vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled North Waziristan since the launch of a government offensive on June 15 against the Pakistani Taliban in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. The United Nations says most of the people who have fled the region have sought shelter with relatives and in rented accommodation in the town of Bannu, in Bannu district. One government-run camp has been set up with enough room for 200,000 people, but so far only around 20 families have moved there. ""The facilities in the camp aren't yet up to the standard that we'd like them to be. Also, for cultural reasons people don't want to live in tents,"" said Timo Pakkala, the U.N's Humanitarian Coordinator for Pakistan. ""The people who come from North Waziristan are very conservative, very traditional. There are restrictions on men and women staying together. They have families; they want to stay together,"" he said. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","WHO warns Pakistan's growing refugee population at risk of polio .

"(CNN) -- So much for Roma's sizzling start to the season. Roma set a record by becoming the first Serie A team to win its opening 10 games of a season but after Sunday's 3-0 loss to Juventus when it finished with nine men, it slipped well behind the Old Lady. Even though Roma hadn't been beaten in the division until Sunday, a run of five draws in seven games allowed in-form Juventus to grab the lead and now Juve -- with an eight-point cushion -- is in pole position to make it three league titles in a row. For all its possession, Roma was always playing catch up, since Juventus struck early through free-scoring midfielder Arturo Vidal -- he beat Morgan de Sanctis from close range following Carlos Tevez's good work in the 17th minute. Juventus all but put the game away in the 48th minute when defender Leonardo Bonucci connected with Andrea Pirlo's teasing free kick at the back post. Roma was out of sorts and Daniele de Rossi received a straight red in the 75th minute for his two-footed tackle on Italian international teammate Giorgio Chiellini. Pirlo, back from a knee injury, took the ensuing free kick and seconds later Leandro Castan saw red for his hand ball on the line. Mirko Vucinic sent de Sanctis the wrong way from the penalty spot to end Roma's miserable evening. Elsewhere in Italy, Fiorentina beat Livorno 1-0 but Giuseppe Rossi -- the league's leading scorer -- limped off with a knee injury after a challenge from defender Leandro Rinaudo. It was the same knee that has troubled the Italian international in recent years and forced him to miss Euro 2012. ""We are all worried,"" Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella told reporters. AC Milan plays Monday but manager Max Allegri confirmed Sunday that he would be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season. Allegri led Milan to the Scudetto in his first season of 2010-11 but the Rossoneri has struggled since off-loading an array of world-class internationals two years ago. Milan currently sits 13th in Serie A, much closer to relegation than Juventus, and was paired with Spanish high-flyer Atletico Madrid in the next round of the Champions League. ""We still have objectives to reach and we have to do everything we can to get back up the table,"" Allegri told Milan's website. ""We have the Italian Cup and the Champions League to play in and I have faith that we'll do well. ""I want to finish my time here in the best way possible."" Showdown set in Spain . Barcelona and Atletico Madrid will face off next week tied on points atop Spain's La Liga after Barca thrashed Elche 4-0. Alexis Sanchez netted a hat-trick for the home team, which was still without multiple world player of the year Lionel Messi -- although he has looked sharp in his return to training -- and didn't start Brazilian ace Neymar. Barcelona's website said Sanchez was chosen ahead of Neymar because he was ""better prepared to play."" ""Alexis was in better condition and we have to pick one of the two,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website. Barcelona overtook Atletico on goal difference ahead of the showdown in Madrid. Atletico edged Malaga 1-0 on Saturday. ""Atletico Madrid can win it all,"" said Martino. ""They are built to do great things, it doesn't matter who plays.""","Juventus ends Roma's unbeaten run in Serie A by winning 3-0 in Turin .

"(CNN) -- Police in Boulder, Colorado, want to talk to the older brother of JonBenet Ramsey, the 6-year-old girl slain at home on Christmas night 14 years ago, the Ramsey family's attorney said. Supporters of the family call it harassment. The brother, Burke Ramsey, has no interest in once again answering questions he has answered for many investigators many times, said the attorney, Lin Wood, of Atlanta, Georgia. And yet the mere hint of activity in one of the nation's most famous cold cases has headlines swirling. So, what's the story this time? Burke Ramsey was the 9-year-old brother of JonBenet who, by all accounts, slept soundly in his room that Christmas in 1996 while his sister's skull was fractured and she was strangled elsewhere in the house. Now, he's 23, and although police investigators aren't talking, the family's lawyer is. Wood said police investigators approached Burke Ramsey on his college campus in the spring, gave him a business card and said that if he wanted to talk about the case, they'd like to hear from him. Investigators, no doubt, are hoping that locked in Burke's memory is some clue that could crack the case; maybe it's a detail that he was afraid to mention as a child or as a teenager but that he now wants to discuss. But police will have to keep waiting. Wood says his client has declined their latest request to talk. Good for him, say some journalists and legal analysts in the Colorado foothills who have long followed the story. ""Burke Ramsey has been completely cleared,"" said Denver attorney Larry Pozner, who has no direct involvement with the case but has been sharply critical of how authorities have handled it. ""The Boulder police engaged in a crime scene search and preservation that was worse than amateurish. It borders on criminal,"" Pozner said. The police have always defended their work on the case, but despite all the scrutiny, all the hours of investigation, nothing came of their efforts. It's hard to remember now, but the death of JonBenet was little more than a tragic local news story that holiday season until her parents appeared on CNN. John and Patsy Ramsey turned the story into a sensation when Patsy, crying and shaking, told the nation: ""There's a killer on the loose. I don't know who it is. I don't know if it's a she or a he, but if I were a resident of Boulder, I would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you. There's someone out there."" The interview unleashed the now famous pageant video, the disquieting cheesecake photos of JonBenet and a national debate: How could a 6-year-old girl be killed in a quiet neighborhood, and no one see or hear a thing? The early evidence seemed to point toward the parents. There was no sign of forced entry into the Ramsey home, no footprints in the snow surrounding it. The rope used to choke JonBenet was tightened with a paintbrush from her mother's hobby kit. An alleged ransom note (remember, this was first thought to be a kidnapping) was written on a pad of paper from inside the house, and some investigators thought the handwriting looked like Patsy's. It contained details about the family's past and finances that few outside their close circle could have known. And the body was found in a little-used basement room that police didn't even notice at first. Investigative reporter Julie Hayden, who tracked the case all those years ago, said people were asking how a stranger could have pulled it off. ""It's sort of like a puzzle,"" she said. ""How do you put all of those pieces together? Was it an intruder? If it wasn't an intruder, how on Earth did this happen? But on the other hand, how could somebody do that to their own child? It's got to be one or the other, you know? Somebody killed JonBenet."" The Ramseys ramped up public suspicion, whether they meant to or not, when they hired lawyers and a publicist. Their relationship with investigators grew noticeably strained. Each possible break in the case, each supposed suspect over the years, proved worthless or a fraud. Two years ago, the district attorney said that new DNA testing methods had cleared all family members of suspicion. John Ramsey appeared relieved. ""We're certainly grateful for an acknowledgement that we are innocent, this was an intruder, which of course we've always maintained."" Yet here investigators are, once again, knocking on Burke Ramsey's door. Attorney Scott Robinson, who has closely watched the case, said that even if JonBenet's brother knows something, so what? ""Even if Burke were to have some miraculous memory that could lead to the arrest of a suspect, that information would be so dated and so questionable that most criminal defense attorneys would have a heyday with it at trial,"" Robinson said. ""It's very problematic to be using information that would be so stale from an individual who did not remember it before."" The main adult figures in the Ramsey case are almost all gone -- to other jobs; other cities. Some, including Patsy Ramsey, have died. They leave behind unanswered questions and one terrible fact: A 6-year-old girl was killed, and 14 years later, no one has spent even a day in jail for her murder. Like many who have followed the Ramsey case from the start, Robinson doubts the killing will ever be solved. ""The colder the case gets, the colder the trail gets.""

"(CNN) -- Jason Momoa's audition tape for ""Game of Thrones"" is an impressive piece of work. The actor gave a breakthrough performance as Dothraki leader Khal Drogo in the first season of ""Game of Thrones,"" and a 35-second audition tape proves that he was pretty much born to play the part. A 2012 YouTube clip of the audition, resurfaced by Time, shows Momoa giving a captivating performance of a haka, a traditional dance done by the Maori people of New Zealand. Momoa was born in Hawaii, but the actor told New Zealand's Stuff last year that he feels a kinship with the Maori. ""We come from the same (Polynesian) culture,"" he said. ""When I found out more about the Maori culture, I fell in love with it and with the people, too."" To win the part of Khal Drogo, Momoa wanted something powerful and irresistible to watch -- and haka fit the bill on both counts. ""It's very, very powerful, and I wanted to capture that,"" the actor told Stuff. ""I just thought it was apt for the role because it's beautiful and scary."" Unfortunately, Momoa's imposing Drogo didn't last long in the ""Game of Thrones'"" world, but with at least one flashback planned for the upcoming fifth season, fans can always hope to see his character again. In the meantime, there's Aquaman. Warner Bros. has confirmed rampant rumors that Momoa will play the hero in 2016's ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" in addition to getting his own Aquaman movie in 2018. Wonder Woman, Aquaman and more headed to theaters . At the Walker Stalker Con in Atlanta over the weekend, Momoa was finally able to talk about landing the huge role.

"(CNN) -- Stoppages due to injuries and fouls are routine in football matches, but it's not often squirrels stop play. But that's what happened on Saturday at a second-tier English football match between Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City at Loftus Road in London. The grey squirrel invaded the pitch during Leicester's 1-0 win, forcing the game to be stopped for a couple of minutes. QPR's website said Leicester City forward David Nugent and QPR captain skipper Clint Hill did their best to chase away the rodent, before play resumed. Squirrels seem particularly fond of the Loftus Road grass -- in March 2012 one turned up when QPR played Everton in an English Premier League game. Soon afterwards a Twitter account -- @QPRSquirrel1 -- was set up. Including the hashtag -- NUTS -- in its profile and the account now has 214 followers. Squirrels are not the only animals to have invaded English football pitches in recent years. A cat popped up at Liverpool's home ground against Tottenham in February 2012. Nicknamed the ""Anfield Cat"" it too found Twitter fame -- @Anfield Cat has over 58,000 followers. Grey squirrels were not native to Britain but spread rapidly across the country after being introduced from the United States and Canada around the start of the 20th century.","Squirrel stops plays at second-tier English football game .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the most mocked fonts on the Internet, the target of numerous campaigns and websites that believe its ""comical"" design has no place in civilized society. Now, Comic Sans has gone analog with the ""Sincerity Machine,"" a typewriter that types letters in Comic Sans. The idea came to Pittsburgh designer Jesse England one night in September, when he was lying in bed reading a comic that used a typewriter-style font in its lettering. ""It just struck me there was nothing stopping me from making a typewriter that could use a different font,"" he said. Why do it? It's hard to say, exactly. But it's the kind of project that interests England, an artist and educator who leads classes in laser-cutting and engraving at a digital media studio for a living. Through his job he had access to tools to etch letters out of acrylic and glue them onto the strikers of an old Brother Charger 11 typewriter he found on the street years ago. He could have used any font, but he chose Comic Sans ""to provoke a reaction."" ""If I'd made it in Helvetica people would've just observed it as a little design experiment,"" he said in a phone interview Saturday. Instead, by altering a classic machine to type one of the most polarizing fonts, he hopes to make people think about how they consume, generate and store media. It appears to be working. Reaction on his YouTube video has been mixed and extreme, much like feelings over the much-maligned font. The Comic Sans Criminal website urges people to take the ""Comic Sans Pledge"" to seriously consider whether it is ""an appropriate font choice"" before using it in any printed work."" England has contemplated use of media in previous projects. As a Carnegie Mellon graduate student, he printed the pages of an eBook to create a bound book. He also leads YouTube tutorials on how to write in different fonts to show people that they can ""retrain themselves"" to use media differently from how they were taught in school. He insists he's not a Luddite: he uses a smartphone and the cloud, and he appreciates the benefits of the digital age. But he worries that our fetishism of nostalgia and ""homage to older standards in unquestioned fashion"" is misguided at times. He also worries about policies and governments that restrict access to digital media. ""It's great that we can store our own content in the cloud and access email anywhere,"" he said. ""What I want to avoid is the ability to have control over my media life being removed."" So, what does that have to do with a Comic Sans typewriter? ""I sincerely want people to consume and generate and make media in a considered fashion,"" he said. As for those who despise the Sincerity Machine as much as the font, he has a reminder: Nothing is permanent. ""If need be those stickers can come off the keys and the Comic Sans covers can come off the strikers, and the machine would be as good as new.""","""Sincerity Machine"" types letters in Comic Sans .

"(CNN) -- If a rain dance brings relief for one kind of drought then golfer Rory McIlroy might just be hoping a few traditional dance steps in Abu Dhabi might satisfy his thirst for another major title in 2014. McIlroy and reigning British Open champion Phil Mickelson joined a local dance troupe swirling golf clubs instead of the traditional sticks in a dose of Al Razfa dancing. The entertainment was a curtain raiser for this week's Abu Dhabi Golf Championship where McIlroy and Mickelson will tee off against fellow top-10 players Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia. ""That was a bit of fun and a great way to get into the rhythm of the season,"" said former world No. 1 McIlroy, who put a miserable 2013 season behind him with victory in the Australian Open in November. ""Some skilful finger work and balancing is needed. I suspect it's a bit like golf, practice, practice, practice."" McIlroy, a two-time major winner, seemed in buoyant mood as he prepares to knuckle down to the new season. On New Year's Eve, the 24-year-old announced on Twitter his ""first victory of 2014"" as he revealed he was engaged to Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. The pair have been dating since September 2011, but if media rumors were to be believed their romance has endured some difficult moments, particularly as both slipped down the rankings in their respective sports in 2013. But McIlroy, now the world No. 7, told the media ahead of the Abu Dhabi tournament that he is feeling more focused, especially as a would-be married man. ""I'm not going to sit here and say that all the stuff going on off the golf course wasn't a distraction and say that it didn't affect me,"" McIlroy, who is involved in a court case with his former management company, told reporters. ""Of course it did. You're thinking of other things when you really shouldn't have to. Feeling good . ""I don't think there can be a bigger decision you have to make than asking someone to marry you. ""If anything, it will only help to have that stability and knowing everything in that regard in my life is set. ""I'm feeling good about where I am mentally. I feel good with everything that's going on off the golf course, and it's hopefully shaping up to be a good year."" Mickelson has his own targets in mind as he begins his new season in Abu Dhabi. The American may have won his first British Open title last season but he had to swallow the agony of finishing as runner-up of the U.S. Open for a sixth time. It is the only one of the four majors to elude Mickelson, denying him a career grand slam. ""Any major championship win would make the year special and memorable,"" Mickelson told reporters in Abu Dhabi. ""I do believe that I'll win a U.S. Open. I don't know if it will be at Pinehurst this year -- very well could be, or in the future. But any major championship would make 2014 a remarkable year."" Joining the quartet of top-10 players at the desert showdown are former winners Paul Casey from England, Germany's Martin Kaymer and Welsh defending champion Jamie Donaldson as well as major winners Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke and Ireland's Padraig Harrington. The $2.7m prize pot attracts some of golf's big names to open their season under the desert sun of Abu Dhabi but the game's biggest cat Tiger Woods is not in attendance this year and the world No. 1 has yet to open his campaign.","Top-10 stars Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia to tee off in Abu Dhabi Golf Championship .

"New York (CNN) -- A taxi driver is in stable condition Wednesday after allegedly being stabbed by a passenger who apparently asked if he was Muslim before attacking him, a taxi driver union official told CNN. Police have identified the suspect as Michael Enright, a 21-year-old white male. New York Police Det. Mark Nell said Enright has been charged with four counts, including attempted murder and hate crimes charges, and he's expected to be arraigned Wednesday afternoon. Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the cabbie who was attacked is Ahmed H. Sharif, 43, a practicing Muslim. When he first got into the taxi Tuesday night, Desai said, Enright engaged in cordial conversation with Sharif. He ""started out friendly, asking Mr. Sharif about where he was from, how long he had been in America, if he was Muslim and if he was observing fast during Ramadan,"" said Desai, who has spoken with the cab driver. Then, after a few minutes of silence, Desai said Enright started violently cursing at Sharif and shouted ""Assalamu Alaikum, consider this a checkpoint,"" before slashing him in the throat, arms, and hand. Though gushing blood, Sharif was able to escape and quickly flagged a police officer, who apprehended Enright, Desai said. Police said the suspect was highly intoxicated. Nell said Enright has been charged with attempted murder in the second degree as a hate crime, assault in the second degree as a hate crime, aggravated harassment in the second degree as a hate crime, and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. Sharif, a father of four who immigrated to the United States from Bangladesh 25 years ago, has been driving a cab for more than 15 years, according to a statement from the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. ""I never feel this hopeless and insecure before,"" he said in the statement. The incident comes as tensions run high in the city over the proposed building of an Islamic center and mosque near the site of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Desai said her organization, with 13,000 members, is warning drivers to be extra careful. ""This kind of bigotry only breeds more violence and makes taxi drivers all the more vulnerable on the streets where there are no bully pulpits or podiums to hide behind,"" Desai told CNN.","Passenger allegedly stabs taxi driver after asking if he's Muslim .

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela welcomed the World Cup trophy to South Africa on Thursday, nearly six years after the former freedom fighter and national leader cried tears of joy when the tournament was awarded to the continent for the first time. With 35 days before the soccer showpiece kicks off in Johannesburg, the trophy that 32 teams are hoping to lift come July 11 is about to embark on the final leg of its world tour. On Friday it will go to the township of Khayelitsha on the outskirts of Cape Town before heading through 38 cities and towns in all of the host nation's nine provinces. The 91-year-old Mandela, who in 1994 became South Africa's first democratically-elected president after decades of apartheid rule, was at FIFA's Zurich headquarters in May 2004 when football's governing body awarded his country the right to host the event. ""Nelson Mandela was one of the architects of this FIFA World Cup. 'Madiba' is the symbol of this new democratic South Africa,"" FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said in a statement. ""For us there was no way that the trophy would arrive in the country and not be brought first to Mandela. ""Nelson Mandela expressed his wish that he would see Bafana Bafana win the FIFA World Cup. We really hope that he will experience together with us the special moment celebrating South Africa's achievements in the stadium."" Local organizing committee chief Danny Jordaan was also present as Mandela, who served 27 years in prison before his release in 1990, was reunited with the trophy. ""It was so wonderful seeing 'Madiba' in Zurich on the day South Africa won the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, so happy with tears of joy rolling down his cheeks,"" Jordaan said. ""So, it is quite an emotional and joyful moment to be back bringing the trophy to him, a symbol of world football with a global symbol of humanity.""","World Cup trophy arrives in South Africa to begin final leg of its tour around the planet .

"(CNN) -- Beyonce and Jay Z don't have to be ""On the Run"" anymore. A nine-page report released on Wednesday by the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General states that the power couple, whose legal names are Beyonce Knowles-Carter and Shawn Carter, did not violate any U.S. sanctions laws during their visit to Cuba last year. Their April 2013 trip, around the time of their fifth wedding anniversary, was highly criticized. It sparked discussion that the two might have engaged in tourist activities that are illegal under the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Under current law and regulation, travel to the island nation is only permitted under license. The report states that the couple's trip to Cuba was properly licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the ""people-to-people"" educational exchange program. The license was issued to a nonprofit organization that has a mission to promote education in the fields of art, architecture and the decorative arts. There were concerns that the two might have abused the terms of the license by engaging in too many tourist activities such as a welcome dinner, a walking tour of various Cuban neighborhoods and visits to see student artwork and theater performances. But, the report concludes that all activities followed the terms of the license. ""We believe OFAC's determination that there was no apparent violation of U.S. sanctions with respect to Jay Z and Beyonce's trip to Cuba,"" the report states. The criticism following the couple's trip prompted Jay Z to respond to detractors with an open letter. The rapper also recorded a song called ""Open Letter"" that slammed critics who suggested the couple's clearance came from their pal President Barack Obama in the White House rather than the Treasury Department. In the song, Jay Z raps, ""Obama said, 'chill you gon' get me impeached. You don't need this s**t anyway. Chill with me on the beach.' ""","There had been rumblings that the couple's 2013 trip violated U.S. sanctions .

"(CNN) -- The midterm elections are around the corner. The big question will obviously be what happens to control of the House and Senate. But control of Congress is only one part of the equation. There are a series of issues that will shape the individual races that will tell us a lot about which way American politics is heading. Can mainstream Republicans take the party back? There are a number of House and Senate primaries where Republicans, organized through business-backed organizations, are trying to seize back control of their party. Former Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette and the Main Street Partnership, a group with strong backing from the corporate world, are trying to counteract the power of the tea party, which they believe is damaging the standing of the GOP. ""We want our party back,"" LaTourette explained to the The New York Times. In the 2nd District of Idaho, Rep. Mike Simpson is facing a strong challenge in the May primaries from Bryan Smith, a tea party Republican who has received support from the Club for Growth. Smith is challenging the eight-term incumbent by depicting him as an embodiment of Washington Republicans who refuse to stand firm for real budget cuts, a legislator who agreed to reopen the federal government even without what conservatives would consider a good budget deal. The Main Street Partnership has been fighting back. The most visible battle between a mainstream Republican and tea party Republican is taking place in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing a challenge from Matt Bevin in the primary. In Texas, the controversial right-wing Rep. Steve Stockman is running against Sen. John Cornyn. Can Democrats take advantage of Republican problems? Despite the fallout from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are hoping that they can take advantage of the turmoil facing the Republicans over the recent year, as the party's approval ratings have plummeted in light of the budget battles and the public's unhappiness with the party's growing extremism. There are certain must-wins for Democrats if they are to show that they are capable of taking advantage of this moment. In Florida's 13th District, Alex Sink, a well-known and well-respected Democrat, is attempting to win the seat of long-term Republican veteran Bill Young, who recently died, leaving open this highly competitive district. If Democrats can't win this special election on March 11, it will signal trouble. Democrats will also be looking for a win in Florida's 2nd District, where Gwen Graham is trying to defeat Rep. Steve Southerland in a test of whether the South has really softened as conservative territory. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been pouring resources into the district to paint Southerland as a poster child for the House GOP. ""Congressman Southerland's reckless plan to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act would mean 614,200 consumers in Florida would be left without health insurance rebates,"" said one party spokesperson. What effect will the politics of immigration have? After the 2012 election, many experts predicted that the immigrant vote would continue to flow toward the Democrats while Republicans will pay the electoral price for their obstruction. Now we'll find out if that's correct. In Colorado's 6th District, Republican Mike Coffman, a former opponent of immigration reform who changed his tune after redistricting brought an infusion of Latinos into his constituency, is struggling to hold on to his seat. Democrats are hoping that the sizable Hispanic population in suburban Denver will demonstrate their opposition to what the House Republicans have been doing by blocking legislation that would offer a path to citizenship. Which is the more politically potent issue -- opposing Obamacare or supporting the minimum wage? Both parties are putting forth national issues for candidates to run with in their districts and states. Democrats are honing in on the issue of economic inequality, stressing their campaign to raise the minimum wage from $7.25 to over $10 by 2015. For Democrats, the risk is alienating Democrats from centrist constituencies who believe this will damage the economy. But they hope that the strong support in polls for the minimum wage boosts their candidates. Rep. Steve Israel, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, predicts that there are at least 12 seats where labor-based campaigns to raise the minimum wage will help Democrats. ""The refusal to increase the minimum wage is just one of the ways House Republicans have inflicted harm on the economy and hurt people's pocketbooks,"" Israel said. For Republicans, the risk is they will be perceived as a party that is stuck in the mud, at a time that millions of Americans are starting to finally see benefits from the ACA rather than simply see the program as something abstract that threatens their families. In Arkansas, Republicans are counting on Sen. Mark Pryor's support for the Affordable Care Act as a useful target for Rep. Tom Cotton to unseat this incumbent. Republicans will do the same in Louisiana, where Sen. Mary Landrieu has a record of statements in support of the health care program. How much money should we spend on elections -- and where should it come from? This is the question now asked of every congressional and presidential election, but it is one we need to continue asking. On both sides -- the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Freedom Works, Club for Growth, and America Rising on the right and American Bridge and Priorities USA on the left -- independent organizations are ready to roll in an unprecedented effort. With each election we have been seeing the cost of campaigning rise and the need for candidates to court donors as more and more urgent. The Kentucky Senate race will probably be the most expensive ever. All of this fuels the power of private money in our political system, undermining trust in government and supporting gridlock. When the results become clear in November, we will know a lot more about the general tenor of the American electorate. Politicians in both parties will have a better read of the kind of electorate they will be facing as they move into the 2016 presidential election. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","As 2014 elections loom, there are questions beyond which party controls Congress .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian town slipped out of a tense fear and into mourning overnight with the arrest of a man suspected of killing three police officers and wounding two others. 'I'm done,"" suspect Justin Bourque yelled as he gave up, a nearby resident who watched the 24-year-old's arrest through a window told CNN partner CBC. He was unarmed, although police found weapons nearby, said Marlene Snowman, a superintendent for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Authorities offered no explanation for the rampage in the town of Moncton, New Brunswick. Charges against him would be filed later, Snowman said. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown identified the slain officers as Constables David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40. ""On Wednesday night, we lost three incredible members of our organization, and I can't dig deep enough to explain the sadness that we all feel,"" Brown said, his voice breaking at times. Shortly after Bourque's arrest, barricades tumbled as residents on lockdown since the shooting slowly gathered on the streets. ""It's hard to imagine that we can go back and turn the page without having a sense of the great loss we've suffered,"" Mayor George Leblanc of Moncton told CTV. ""Moncton is such a beautiful, warm community ... I know this community has a tremendous spirit, and we will get through this."" Arrested in a backyard . Michelle Thibodeau told CBC that the suspect was captured near her home in Moncton. ""There were trucks going by really slowly as well as cop cars surrounding my house, so we knew they were looking directly around my house,"" she said. ""Suddenly, one of the SWAT trucks stopped and unloaded officers, and they proceeded to go to my backyard."" While there, they yelled for the suspect to surrender. He was hiding behind a row of trees, Thibodeau said. ""They were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded. And eventually Justin came out with his hands up and he yelled, 'I'm done.' And they collected him and brought him to my front yard, where he lay sprawled out. "" Police surveyed her yard for weapons before taking him away, she told CBC. ""My heart dropped in my stomach. We were all shaking and panicky. It was a very scary situation."" Her parents, brother, his girlfriend and a dog all watched the scene unfold from a window. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was wearing the same camouflage uniform shown in the pictures, according to Thibodeau. The only difference was his hair was ""dripping wet,"" she said. Last social media post? A Facebook page purported to belong to Bourque has many posts with pro-gun photos and a few anti-police memes. There is also a photo where two men pose with shotguns in the snow. It was posted on February 25, six days after the Facebook page was created, and is used as the profile picture. In what appears to be his final post, the page's author used the words of a song by the metal group Megadeth. You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway? Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way? Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come. I believe my kingdom will come. Rare shootings . Moncton has 140,000 people and is 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of Saint John. ""It's a lot. Especially for a city like this, where you wouldn't expect something to happen like this,"" resident Jonathan Hurshman told CTV. ""You see it all in the States, and you think, 'No, that could never happen here' -- and sure enough, it happens here."" There were no homicides in Moncton in 2011 and 2012, and the average number of homicides per year between 2006 and 2011 was one. In 2012, the homicide rate in Canada was 1.6 per 100,000. In the United States, it was 4.7 per 100,000, according to United Nations statistics. Georgia courthouse shooter had bombs, assault rifle . 3 shot at Seattle Pacific University .

"(CNN) -- The husband of an Indian dentist whose death sparked anger over Ireland's abortion laws told an inquest on Monday that her requests for a termination for her miscarrying fetus had been denied. Praveen Halappanavar told the hearing in Galway that he was told that because Ireland is a Catholic country, an abortion could not be done while the fetus was still alive. He was one of the first witnesses to give evidence at the inquest, which is expected to last several days. The death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway on October 28 prompted anger in Ireland and elsewhere and sparked demands for Ireland to introduce new abortion laws. Doctors and nurses from the Galway hospital are also due to testify at the inquest. Praveen Halappanavar said as he arrived at the courthouse that he hoped the inquest would get to the truth. He has previously said that his wife was advised her unborn baby would likely die, and that she was in extreme pain. Savita, 31, went into the hospital on October 21, complaining of back pain. She was 17 weeks pregnant at the time. Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita died of a blood infection. The coroner, Dr. Ciaran McLoughlin, opened the hearing with a promise to Halappanavar to help find out what happened to his wife. An inquest by a coroner is standard procedure in cases of sudden, unexplained or unnatural deaths in Ireland. Opinion: If Ireland had abortion rights . Strict laws . The couple, who married in India, had moved to Ireland four years before Savita's death and were excited to be starting a family, Praveen Halappanavar told CNN last year. He said the family was left stunned and grief-stricken by her death. ""Every single person in the family asked me, 'How could this happen in a place like Ireland in the 21st century?' -- because it was just so simple,"" he said. ""When they knew the baby was not going to survive, why not think about the bigger life, which was the mother, my wife, Savita? And they didn't."" A number of inquiries were set up by Irish authorities after Halappanavar died, including one by the Health Service Executive. The Health Service Executive report has not yet been published but details of the draft text have been leaked to the Irish media. The Irish government plans to introduce new abortion legislation by the summer. Minister of Health James Reilly announced late last year that the proposed changes would clarify that abortions are permissible when the life -- but not just the health -- of the mother is at risk. That would bring the country's laws in line with a 1992 Irish Supreme Court ruling that established a woman's right to abortion when her life is at risk, including by suicide. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Indian dentist was denied abortion for her miscarrying fetus, her widower says .

"(CNN) -- High level workers are looking for an alternative to the 9 to 5. Armed with years of experience, a growing number of professionals are looking to fashion project-based careers where the monotony of office life is exchanged for a varied and tailored work schedule. Business Talent Group, the brainchild of Jody Miller, works with nearly 300 companies to provide projects for its highly experienced pool of workers. Roping in opportunities from sectors such as Healthcare, Media and Manufacturing, the 'full-time' employee may be a role of the past. CNN: What is the landscape like for employee recruitment? Jody Miller: Typically, companies that have to get work done have two ways they look at it: one is that they usually hire full-time employees or they can go out to firms, consulting firms, outsourcing firms and have them do work. In fact, there's a growing population of people who prefer to work independently and create a project-based career, and those people are fantastic. Companies are now understanding that they can harness this group of talent to create exactly the team that they need to get their work done, and then disband that team and put another team in place. CNN: Has there been a shift in how people view their work life? JM: I think you're seeing two different things happening. On the talent side, we're seeing three demographic trends: we're seeing baby boomers retiring, we're seeing women increasingly joining the workforce, and we're seeing Millennials who want a different relationship between work and life. These three demographic trends are driving more and more people into the independent talent market. CNN: What kind of people are in the talent pool? JM: The talent pool has about 3,500 professionals, and those people are coming to Business Talent Group for one reason - they want great projects. They want to be able to say ""I want to do this but don't want to do this"". These people are very senior people, these are people who have MBAs and have experience at the best firms in the world - people who really value great work. So it's not just about finding a senior executive and putting them in a permanent job and it's not just about going into an expensive outside firm. This is a new resource. CNN: How is the Business Talent Group different from other talent pools? JM: The thing that's revolutionary about what we're trying to do is that we're introducing a model that has worked in other segments into the very highest echelons of corporate America. So we're taking very top consultants and very top executives and enabling them to work in a different way. So it's all in their control. I want companies to feel like there's a reliable source for this kind of talent so they can bake this into their planning. Our best clients actually budget independent talent into their next year's planning because they know now that there are great people in this pool that they can rely on.

"London, England (CNN) -- He has played kings, princes, captains and professors on stage and screen, but now actor Patrick Stewart will have a new title all his own: ""Sir."" The 69-year-old Yorkshire, England, native tops the list of those receiving New Year's honors from Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the Cabinet Office announced Thursday. Stewart, well-known for playing Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" will receive a knighthood. It means he will now be known in Britain as ""Sir Patrick."" Others on the list include designers, restaurateurs and two famous names from Formula 1 racing. Ross Brawn, who started the Brawn GP Formula 1 team that won the constructors championship in 2009, will receive an OBE, which stands for Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Brawn started his eponymous team this year after buying out the existing Honda team. Mercedes-Benz took over the team last month, announcing that Brawn would remain at the helm and that the team would be renamed Mercedes GP. Jenson Button, who won the 2009 Formula 1 drivers championship, will receive an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire. He races with the Brawn-Mercedes team. The 2008 F1 champion, Lewis Hamilton, received an MBE last year. British designer Amanda Wakeley, whose designs grace models on the catwalk and celebrities on the red carpet, will receive an OBE. Two other British designers will receive MBEs. Cath Kidston is known for putting traditional floral prints on modern accessories, and Luella Bartley was hailed for mixing prim and punk before her label was forced to close last month. Also receiving an MBE are Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers, who together started the River Cafe in London, along the Thames. Their passion for Italian cuisine has led critics to call the restaurant one of the most influential in Britain, and the two have written several cookbooks together. A committee within the British Cabinet Office assembles the honors list, which is released twice a year -- at New Year's and on the queen's birthday in June. Queen Elizabeth awards the honors to recipients in ceremonies at Buckingham Palace. The awards recognize service and achievement in all fields and are considered a major honor for British citizens. Noncitizens may also be recognized. A knighthood is the highest honor. Men are made knights, after which they are called ""sirs,"" and women are made dames. Below that comes CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire. OBE and MBE follow respectively.","Patrick Stewart played Capt.

"(CNN) -- Who am I? How do I identify? Lately, I've been telling people that I'm a criminal. This shocks most people, since I don't ""look like"" one. I'm a fairly clean-cut, light-skinned black woman with fancy degrees from Vanderbilt University and Stanford Law School. I'm a law professor and I once clerked for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice -- not the sort of thing you'd expect a criminal to do. What'd you get convicted of? people ask. Nothing, I say. Well, then why do you say you're a criminal? Because I am a criminal, I say, just like you. This is where the conversation gets interesting. Most of my acquaintances don't think of themselves as criminals. No matter what their color, age or gender, most of the people in my neighborhood and in my workplace seem to think criminals exist somewhere else -- in ghettos, mainly. They have an unspoken, but deeply rooted identity as ""law-abiding citizens."" I ask them, ""Haven't you ever committed a crime?"" Oddly, people often seem perplexed by this question. What do you mean? they say. I mean, haven't you ever smoked pot, didn't you ever drink underage, don't you sometimes speed on the freeway, haven't you gotten behind the wheel after having a couple of drinks? Haven't you broken the law? Well, yeah, they say, but I'm not a criminal. Oh, really? What are you, then? As I see it, you're just somebody who hasn't been caught. You're still a criminal, no better than many of those who've been branded felons for life. Perhaps there should be a box on the census form that says ""I'm a criminal."" Everyone who has ever committed a crime would be required to check it. If everyone were forced to acknowledge their own criminality, maybe we, as a nation, would second-guess our apparent zeal for denying full citizenship to those branded felons. In this country, we force millions of people -- who are largely black and brown -- into a permanent second-class status, simply because they once committed a crime. Once labeled a felon, you are ushered into a parallel social universe. You can be denied the right to vote, automatically excluded from juries and legally discriminated against in employment, housing, access to education and public benefits -- forms of discrimination that we supposedly left behind. This kind of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion may befall you for no reason other than you were once caught with drugs. I doubt Barack Obama thinks of himself as a criminal, though he should. He has admitted to using illegal drugs during his college years -- lots, in fact. What if he thought of himself as a criminal? What if he identified that way? Would it lead him to feel a bit more compassion for those who are branded drug felons for life, unable to find work or housing, and deemed ineligible even for food stamps? Maybe if Obama thought of himself as a criminal he wouldn't have just endorsed spending even more money on prisons at a time when scarce resources would be much better spent on education or health care, or just about anything else. I am a criminal. Coming to terms with this aspect of my identity has helped me to see more clearly -- with blinders off -- the ways in which I have been encouraged not to feel any connection to ""them,"" those labeled criminals. I see now that ""they"" are me, and I am them.

"(CNN)  -- Among U.S. adults who go online, 13% use Twitter -- and more than half (54%) of these people access the popular social media service with their mobile phone, according to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project. The report also revealed some interesting details about the demographics of Twitter users. For instance, 25% of adult African-Americans who use the Internet are on Twitter, as are 19% of Hispanic Americans, compared with only 9% of whites. Where you live also may affect whether you're on Twitter: About 15% of both urban and suburban U.S. adult Internet users are on Twitter, vs. only 7% of rural dwellers. Twitter is slightly more popular with men than women, and most popular with Internet users ages 18 to 29. Income is not an especially significant indicator of whether someone is likely to use Twitter, but education is: 16% of college-educated adult Internet users are on Twitter, vs. only 8% of those who stopped school after graduating high school. ""Mobile Twitter"" can mean several different things, since Twitter exploits nearly every available mobile communication channel. Pew did not examine which types of phones mobile tweeters use, but it's probably all of them. After all, Twitter was designed from the very beginning to be accessible on even the simplest feature phones (the next step down from smartphones, representing 70% of the handsets currently in use in the U.S.). This is evidenced by the most obvious characteristic of Twitter -- that tweets are limited to 140 characters. That comes from the constraints of SMS text messaging, which can be done from virtually every cell phone on the planet. Texting is, by most measures, the most popular activity across nearly all mobile demographics and on all types of mobile phones. Twitter also supports optional e-mail notifications, and e-mail is increasingly popular with mobile users on all kinds of phones. On the higher end of mobile, you can access Twitter from a variety of native mobile apps for smartphones and tablets, created by lots of different developers using Twitter's application programming interface, or API. Twitter also recently updated its mobile website by leveraging new HTML5 capabilities to add interactive features and make the site function more like an app -- at least on smartphones with full-featured browsers. But even on the limited ""microbrowsers"" still common on most feature phones, Twitter's site offers a fairly user-friendly mobile Web experience. Pew's report echoes other research that has found that social media is an increasingly popular mobile activity. A February report from comScore noted that social media is currently the fastest-growing content category for mobile users (up 56% over the previous year). And a year ago, Nielsen noted that 54% of smartphone users and 36% of feature phone users were accessing social media via mobile apps. On the flip side, all this research indicates that if you're using social media, expect that a significant and growing proportion of your audience are on mobile devices. Increasingly, social media will also mean mobile by default. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","54% of Twitter users access the social media service through their mobile phone, study shows .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Robert Plant's 2007 album with pop-bluegrass songbird Alison Krauss, Raising Sand, did something 25 years of solo records never quite managed. It fully transformed him from former Led Zeppelin golden god into a roots singer. Plant had never sung so tenderly or collaboratively, commanding a crack modern string band that defined power in terms other than ""Physical Graffiti"". ""Band of Joy"" -- named after Plant's first band with late pal John Bonham -- smartly takes some cues from ""Raising Sand."" Plant uses an A list of country voices and players (Patty Griffin, Buddy Miller) and an inspired mix of vintage and modern songs. If it's not quite as seamless and sublime a record, well, it's pretty damn good, and what it lacks in coherence it makes up for in magnified rock & roll mojo. Miller helps with the latter. The journeyman guitarist-songwriter (and former Emmylou Harris collaborator) co-produced the record with Plant, and he contributes muscular playing and singing. His guitar is low and nasty on the lead cut, a coiled, mandolin-dusted cover of Los Lobos' ""Angel Dance."" And he opens up on ""House of Cards,"" a cover of Richard Thompson's scalding 1978 folk rocker, bright leads carving the air while Plant and Griffin's harmonies recall Zep's ""The Battle of Evermore."" But what's most striking is Plant's vocal versatility. As a solo act, his songwriting has been spotty, if impressively versatile. But he's proved himself to be an excellent interpreter, from his 1984 ""Honeydrippers"" EP of old-school R&B and pop through Raising Sand. He does the same here, and the songs give him plenty to work with. He returns to the late, great Townes Van Zandt (whose ""Nothin' "" was a highlight on Sand) for the bleak ""Harm's Swift Way,"" working a metaphor that turns the idea of time into a woman beyond a man's control. Plant doesn't oversing a whit, delivering poetic meditations on mortality with Griffin's harmonies clinging to him like a spangled death shroud. The two most striking songs are the most left-field, both penned by the brooding husband-wife indie-rock band Low. ""Silver Rider"" is a glittering dirge, another showcase for Griffin, who's such a good songwriter that's it's easy to forget what a great singer she is. Plant sings ""Monkey"" almost as a whisper. ""It's a suicide/Shut up and drive,"" he snarls, in what sounds like the opening scene of a David Lynch film. It's as menacingly restrained as anything he's ever uttered. This is a record primarily about loss and time's march, and Plant sings with gravity, working his middle range. It doesn't all click. ""Even This Shall Pass Away"" tries too hard for profundity. And the old spiritual ""Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down"" mostly makes you want to hear Plant back cruising Lucifer's daughter on ""Houses of the Holy."" But Plant isn't singing like the old days. The closest he comes is ""You Can't Buy My Love,"" first recorded in 1965 by R&B singer Barbara Lynn. Plant knocks it out playfully, like a lost demo from Led Zeppelin I, with a few hollers and sexy woo-oh-ohs. And in 3:10, it's over. You can't buy his love, and you can't turn back time. It's a notion other rock vets could do well to ponder. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Robert Plant releases new album titled ""Band of Joy""

"(CNN)  -- Pirates seized a North Korean-flagged cargo ship Wednesday in the Gulf of Aden, a European Union anti-piracy task force said. The ship, the MV Rim, changed course and is heading for the Somali Basin, the EU Naval Force said. Two U.S. Navy ships working with NATO confirmed the hijacking, the USS Porter and a helicopter from the USS Farragut, the task force added. The 4,800-ton ship is owned by Libya's White Sea Shipping. It is not clear how many crew members are on board or where they come from. The attack comes two days after pirates released a Greek-owned vessel and its crew months after hijacking it off Somalia. The MV Filitsa was released Monday after its owner paid a ransom, said Michael Battzoglou, a security officer and spokesman for the owner, Order Shipping Co. He did not say how much had been paid. ""All are well and safe,"" Battzoglou added. The Greek coast guard also said no one had been killed or injured on the vessel. The EU Naval Force confirmed the ransom had been paid and the ship freed. It did not say how much money changed hands. The bulk carrier was hijacked November 11 off Somalia near the Seychelles, and was held at the pirate stronghold of Hobyo on the Somali coast, the EU said. The coast off lawless Somalia has become a hub for piracy. At least three ships have been attacked in the region this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, a nonprofit group that tracks and fights maritime crime and malpractice. Pirates in the area hold nine ships with a total of 216 crew members, not including the MV Rim, said the bureau's Capt. Cyrus Mody. The pirates normally seek payment to release ships. The EU mission's main tasks include escorting merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid for the World Food Program, protecting vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and deterring and disrupting piracy.","North Korean-flagged cargo ship seized in Gulf of Aden .

"(CNN) -- That's it. Starting today the next guy to text me and ask me on a date will be deleted from my cell phone -- permanently. Want to make plans for the weekend? Wondering how my day was? Need to discuss our relationship? Call me. Save texting for simple stuff: Let's meet at 8 p.m.? Do you like sushi? Or even, you looked so hot last night! When it comes to texting, the KISS rule applies -- Keep It Simple Stupid. Now of course, there are times when a ""U & I R DUN"" text may be in order. But that rule is only acceptable if you've gone out once or twice and had an awful experience. Dumping or even divorcing someone via text message is just cowardice. It's a punk move but it happens quite often and not just among teens, as pop star Katy Perry tells us in the July issue of Vogue magazine. ""He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,"" Perry says, of her ex-husband Russell Brand. ""Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011."" It's best to say good riddance to a loser like Brand. Because while it may be cute for teenagers to text their sweetheart all day and night, that is really no way for intelligent, confident adults to communicate. ""People can hide themselves in a text message,"" warns Bela Gandhi, founder of Smart Dating Academy in Chicago. ""When you talk to someone on the phone that's when their true personality starts to shine. Hearing someone's voice tells you if they are positive or negative, or enthusiastic about life. The voice conversation is very important. It keeps people from hiding. The phone is a screener."" How technology has changed romance . As a happily single woman, I am shocked at how many professional, attractive and otherwise intelligent men have no idea how to hold communicate effectively by phone or face to face. Real communication often takes courage. It's not easy to drop our defenses and reveal our insecurities to one another, especially if we've gotten our feelings hurt a few times. But developing your emotional intelligence is a critical ingredient in all healthy adult relationships. A short text in the middle of the day to let someone know you are thinking of them is a sweet gesture. But if you imagine that sending a daily barrage of texts, such as ""driving to work, heading to lunch, or just left a meeting"" is a romantic way to show you are thinking of your partner, think again. Or texting in the middle of the night. I once dated a 50-something guy who thought it was romantic to send me a ""good morning"" text at 4:30 a.m. Good grief. When the chime on my phone jolted me awake, I panicked: ""Someone must have died,"" I thought. Why else would anyone text me at this hour? Bad move. ""Texting is not the place for anything serious. Never handle something over text that should be handled in person or over the phone. This just shows that you are a weakling who deserves a good slapping. Swallow your fear, and pick up the phone."" says relationship expert Michael Masters, author of ""TextAppeal -- For Guys! The Ultimate Texting Guide."" Don't get me wrong, no one has time to be on the phone all day every day, but I can guarantee you that if the woman you're dating would rather text you than call, the relationship is over. Also, it's best to avoid needy ""Crack Texting."" ""This is hands-down the number one mistake people make,"" says Masters. Texting is best used as a slowly developing conversation. And the benefit of texting is that you actually have time to think before you blast off an inappropriate message. I like Masters' rule: ""The hotter the person is, the less you should be texting them. Don't be needy."" The lost art of offline dating . I get it. I love technology and I text, tweet, tumblr, pin, and share on Facebook with a passion. Social networking is an integral part of my life. But when it comes to romance, women still need to hear your voice or look you in the eye when we're talking. ""[Research shows] that about 93% of how we make our first impressions of people within 30 seconds of meeting them is nonverbal communication -- body language, voice tone, personal appearance ... "" Gandhi reminds us. ""And relying on texting to build a relationship is a recipe for miscommunication, and premature intimacy."" Don't let technology turn you into a coward who is afraid of real conversation, or sharing yourself in any meaningful way. Don't be a Russell Brand. If you have more virtual friends on Facebook than you do in reality, it's time to reevaluate your life. Get out there make a few actual friends, in person. Dating is easy. It's risky. But it is not nearly as complicated as many people make out -- as long as you actually like yourself first and are basically satisfied with your own life. I admit there is one date text I always will answer: ""Want to go to the Knicks game tonight?"" Now that message just might be the start of a beautiful relationship. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: It was cowardly of Russell Brand to divorce Katy Perry via text .

"(CNN) -- Last week, The New York Times gave us an inside look at what it's like to work at Foxconn, the manufacturing company that owns several China-based factories that crank out Apple's iPads, iPhones and iPods by the millions. The story is full of examples of horrifying working conditions in Foxconn's factories that would never fly here in the United States. Here are some of the more troubling ones from the Times story: . Foxconn is a 24-hour operation. Employees work six days a week, sometimes in 12-hour shifts. They're on their feet for so long that their legs begin to swell. There are underage workers. They live in crowded dorms on the factory's campus. In recent years, there have been reports of workers leaping from buildings in apparent suicides. And so on. The story even describes the gruesome death of one Foxconn worker after an explosion in a facility that made iPads in Chengdu, China. The worker's ""skin was almost completely burned away"" by the blast, the Times reports. He died a few days later with his family by his side. Foxconn denies the reports that working conditions are like what the Times describes. Apple refuses to comment on the record, but a leaked e-mail from CEO Tim Cook to all Apple employees says the company is committed to worker safety and that it takes all those claims very seriously. So knowing all that, should we be concerned about where our iPhones and other gadgets come from and how they're made? Or is the human cost so far removed from us here in the United States that we're willing to look over it in favor of whatever fancy new touchscreen gadget Apple releases next? The issue even has some people throwing around the idea of a boycott. One effort, hosted on the website Change.org, has collected more than 145,000 signatures from people calling on Apple to better protect its workers. While those efforts sound noble, there's no way boycotting Apple gadgets will actually work. Let's start with why people keep snapping up Apple's iPhones and iPads by the millions each week in the first place. When it comes to smartphones and tablets, Apple still makes the best there are. With the iPhone and the iPad, the company set a new standard that other tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are still struggling to imitate. Apple can't make them fast enough. On launch days, people queue up in massive lines so they can be one of the first to get a new iPhone or iPad. Even if consumers do know about what it took to make their new gadget, as many likely do thanks to the widespread reports on working conditions overseas, it's obviously not enough to keep them from getting caught up in the fervor of an Apple product launch. I can't see that ending just because of a new story in The New York Times or a proposed boycott. But it's not just about the massive popularity of Apple's gadgets that keep people buying. It's the price. The latest and greatest iPhone model, the 4S, costs $199. iPads start at $499. One of the biggest reasons Apple can sell its stuff at such low prices is because they're produced on the cheap in China, sometimes by sacrificing good working conditions to make it happen. (If you believe the reports.) Those cheap production costs are why a lot of the anger comes from the fact that Apple is a massively profitable company. Right now it has almost $100 billion sitting in the bank. It could use some of that cash to put more pressure on Foxconn and others to improve working conditions overseas. A successful boycott could force Apple to make those changes, but consumers will have to sacrifice something, too. In a poll from the Times that ran with its Foxconn story last week, most consumers thought companies such as Apple should make products in the U.S. but still absorb the added manufacturing costs. In other words, consumers don't want to pay more for iPhones and iPads than they already do just to ensure factory workers get better working conditions. It's all about money. So even if Apple moved production to the U.S. or managed to heavily invest in China and improve working conditions there, it would likely result in higher prices for consumers. For a profit-driven company such as Apple, there's almost no chance it would want to absorb those costs itself. Yes, a lot of the heat on this issue has been put on Apple. But keep in mind it's not alone. Foxconn and similar manufacturers in Asia make gadgets for several other major consumer brands. It's not like suddenly switching from the iPhone to another smartphone will improve the lives of those who make it. You may feel guilty buying an Apple product, but the problem won't be fixed until all electronics makers change, too. In the end, consumers would be the ones who have to pay to make working conditions better for the people who make your iPhone. And it seems unlikely there are enough of you out there willing to do that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Kovach.

"(CNN) -- The final day of the European transfer window produced the usual flurry of frantic activity Friday but no big deal to match the $61 million transfer of Juan Mata from Chelsea to Manchester United earlier this month. Jose Mourinho's Chelsea continued to re-invest the money until the last day, landing promising 19-year-old French central defender Kurt Zouma, who signed from Saint-Etienne for a reported fee of $19 million before being loaned back to the Ligue 1 side. Zouma, who has just served a 10-game ban for a foul challenge which broke an opponent's leg, is the fourth player to sign for Roman Abramovich's big spenders in January after Nemanja Matic, Mohamed Salah and Bertrand Traore. Chelsea's West London rivals Fulham, battling against relegation from the English Premier League, landed Greek international striker Konstantinos Mitroglou from Olympiakos for a fee of nearly $20 milllion. The 25-year-old is a national hero in Greece after scoring three goals in their two-legged World Cup qualifying play-off against Romania last November. He will have to act as a replacement for former Manchester United star Dimitar Berbatov. The Bulgarian international striker has gone on loan to cash-rich Monaco. Claudio Ranieri's team are challenging for the French league title but have lost their big money summer signing of Radamel Falcoa to injury and Berbatov will act as a high-profile replacement. Monaco slipped six points behind leaders Paris Saint Germain Friday as the reigning champions beat Bordeaux 2-0 with their big money signing from this window, former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye, coming on as a substitute for the capital giants. EPL title challengers Arsenal, who signed Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid before the start of the current season, strengthened their squad by the acquisition of experienced Swedish international midfielder Kim Kallstrom from Spartak Moscow on loan. ""Arsenal is an amazing club with a lot of great players and a coach who has done really well here for a long time,"" Kallstrom told the club's official website. But top of the table Manchester City have not added to their already strong squad, who are still campaigning on all four fronts under Manuel Pellegrini. City spent an estimated $100 million on player signings before the start of the current campaign, playing their part in record amounts changing hands by EPL clubs in the 2013-14 period. According to football finance experts Deloitte, the combined transfer spend of the 20 clubs had broken the £700 million ($1.12B) mark for the first time even before the frenetic last day of trading. This enormous sum is despite the likely restrictions imposed by UEFA's new Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, which limit the losses clubs can make. But according to a top lawyer specializing in sports finances, the big spending EPL clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea are unlikely to be troubled by the new regulations. ""It seems the Financial Fair Play rules are unlikely to have the desired effect of providing an even playing field if clubs generating huge losses can meet the rules,"" Faye Bargery, a senior associate at law firm Thomas Eggar LLP, told CNN. ""Manchester City recently announced a £51m ($81.6 million) loss (down from £97m last year) but are confident that they will meet the FFP rules. ""Clubs have a number of ways to reduce their losses, including excluding money spent on youth development and facilities as well as amortizing transfer fees over the term of player' contracts. ""However, the significant increase in commercial and sponsorship income for the top clubs, as evidenced by Arsenal's recent kit deal with Puma, is likely to mean that the larger clubs can meet the rules but smaller clubs with less income are adversely effected."" La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, who signed Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale for a world record fee last August, kept their powder dry in the last day of trading, but other European powerhouses strengthened their squads. Runaway Serie A leaders Juventus signed Argentina-born forward Dani Osvaldo on loan from EPL Southampton. Osvaldo was a club record signing for Southampton but has lasted less than five months at St Mary's after he was reported to have had an altercation with teammate Jose Fonte last week. Inter Milan also completed the big money signing of Brazilian midfield star Hernanes from Lazio on a four-and-a-half year deal. Last season's Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund attempted to boost a flagging season by signing 21-year-old Serbia midfielder Milos Jojic from Partizan Belgrade on the final day of the window. Dortmund celebrated later Friday by scoring their first Bundesliga win in five games with a 2-1 victory at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang grabbed both their goals.","Final day of European winter transfer window sees usual round of frantic trading .

"(CNN) -- It was rush hour on a Tuesday, and Dorothy Otto was sitting in traffic in her Pontiac Bonneville on the lower level of the Cypress Freeway, in Oakland, California, when the voice on the radio said, ""We're having an earthquake."" Suddenly, the concrete around her began to ripple. There was a giant crash, and a large, heavy beam dropped on the front of her car, crushing the engine, barely missing her face. The car dropped 20 feet, and when it settled, Otto's left foot was trapped. The double-decker freeway had collapsed, pinning motorists in their cars. Otto found a pen and decided to write a note to her husband, just in case. ""Jack, earthquake hit while I was under concrete, worst happened,"" she wrote. ""It collapsed on car. I'm alive, just my left foot is stuck under the car. Hope they don't kill me getting me out. Love you lots, good luck to us both."" Firefighter Lorenzo Frediani was running out of time as he struggled to free Otto's foot and get her to safety. Each aftershock lowered the upper deck, bringing it closer to crushing Otto and Frediani. Then, Frediani was able to nudge the crushed dashboard just enough. Otto was free. Her section of the Cypress collapsed 20 minutes later. That was October 17, 1989. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake, now called Loma Prieta, killed 63 people, 42 of them on the Cypress freeway. The quake caused $10 billion in damage, ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to re-examine their safety measures for earthquakes. Nearby Oregon sits on a huge fault line that separates two of the Earth's tectonic plates. One plate lies beneath the Pacific Ocean, off Oregon's coast, and it is being shoved beneath the North American continent, according to Ian Madin, a geologist and chief scientist at Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Are earthquakes on the rise? The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could one day cause an even larger quake. ""As the two plates collide,"" Madin says, ""the fault gets stuck, eventually slipping when enough stress builds up to produce a great earthquake."" With ultra-accurate GPS, Madin says scientists know that the collision is still going on because they can measure the movement. Oregon actually moves about 1Â½ inches every year, typical for a region near a subduction zone. These megaquakes can cause strong shaking over large areas for several minutes. They can also lead to landslides, tsunamis and widespread liquefaction, turning soil to soup. After the deadly 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011, Oregon legislators commissioned a study on the impact a comparable quake could have on the state. Madin was one of the authors of the Oregon Resilience Plan, which is aimed at reducing risk and improving recovery for the next Cascadia earthquake and tsunami. Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake, and few areas are, Madin says. He says Japan is the most prepared, ""and look at the results of their megaquake."" The 2011 earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 15,000 deaths. Before 1974, there were no specific building requirements in Oregon to make sure structures were built to withstand major quakes, and design codes have only been adequate for the megaquake since 1993, so many structures are not designed to resist such a large earthquake, Madin says. Earthquake fast facts . ""On top of that, we have a lot of mountainous terrain that is highly susceptible to landslides, large areas that are susceptible to liquefaction, and 300 miles of coast that will be inundated by tsunamis that will arrive within 15 to 20 minutes of the earthquake and may locally reach elevations of 100 feet above sea level,"" he says. It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years. The damage could result in $30 billion in economic losses. Madin says $30 billion is almost certainly an underestimate, and death estimates could also be off. Based on the study of geologic features that record prehistoric earthquakes, scientists generally agree that there have been 42 megaquakes along the Cascadia fault in the last 10,000 years, with the most recent in January 1700. Using historic data, scientists like Dr. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can forecast the probability of another great quake. The Cascadia Subduction Zone is actually made up of different clusters, according to Goldfinger. On the south end of the fault, the data shows that an earthquake with a magnitude between the high sevens and low eights occurs every 250 years. ""We're 300 years into a 240 year cycle,"" says Goldfinger. On the other hand, the north end, with the great population centers, sees a big event closer to every 500 years. But before Oregonians panic, consider Goldfinger's assessment of the statistics. For the south end of the Cascadia, there is roughly a 35-40% probability of having a major quake in the next 50 years. On the north end, there is only a 10-15% probability. Even if there is still plenty of time before the next big quake, much work has to be done to make sure Oregon is ready. ""The most important thing is to strengthen or replace infrastructure to make sure that our lifeline systems like power and water will not be so severely damaged that they require years to repair. We also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities like hospitals, fire and police facilities and schools,"" says Madin. Following on the release of the Oregon Resilience Plan, the Oregon Legislature established a task force to come up with specific recommendations for action for the 2015 legislative session. Oregon has already turned a corner because institutions are no longer asking,""Why should I do anything to prepare"" and are now asking,""How do I pay for the preparation I know I need?""","25 years ago, a 6.7-magnitude earthquake hit San Francisco .
Since then, West coast communities have assessed their earthquake readiness .

"(CNN) -- FaceTime, the Apple video-chat application, is not a replacement for real human interaction, especially for children, according to a new study. Tween girls who spend much of their waking hours switching frantically between YouTube, Facebook, television and text messaging are more likely to develop social problems, says a Stanford University study published in a scientific journal on Wednesday. Young girls who spend the most time multitasking between various digital devices, communicating online or watching video are the least likely to develop normal social tendencies, according to the survey of 3,461 American girls aged 8 to 12 who volunteered responses. The study only included girls who responded to a survey in Discovery Girls magazine, but results should apply to boys, too, Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor of communications who worked on the study, said in a phone interview. Boys' emotional development is more difficult to analyze because male social development varies widely and over a longer time period, he said. ""No one had ever looked at this, which really shocked us,"" Nass said. ""Kids have to learn about emotion, and the way they do that, really, is by paying attention to other people. They have to really look them in the eye."" The antidote for this hyper-digital phenomenon is for children to spend plenty of time interacting face-to-face with people, the study found. Tweens in the study who regularly talked in person with friends and family were less likely to display social problems, according to the findings in the publication Developmental Psychology. ""If you eschew face-to-face communication, you don't learn critical things that you have to learn,"" Nass said. ""You have to learn social skills. You have to learn about emotion."" The Stanford researchers were not able to determine a magic number of hours that children should spend conversing per week, Nass said. Social skills are typically only learned when children are engaged and making eye contact, rather than fiddling with an iPod during a conversation, he said. FaceTime and Skype are not replacements for actual face time because other studies have found that people tend to multitask while on video calls, Nass said. Nass is a self-described technologist of 25 years, who has worked as a consultant with many major electronics firms, including Google and Microsoft. He said the findings disturbed him. A few years ago, Nass worked on a study about how multitasking affects adults. He found that heavy multitaskers experience cognitive issues, such as difficulty focusing and remembering things. They were actually worse at juggling various activities, a skill crucial to many people's work lives, than those who spent less time multitasking, Nass said.","Children who frequently multitask are less likely to develop social skills, study says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Counterfeit capsules of the diet drug Alli that are sold online can pose a serious health risk to some users, a research director from the Food and Drug Administration said Saturday. The FDA warned consumers this week that fake versions of the over-the-counter drug are being sold, mainly on online auction sites. Testing shows that the counterfeit pills contain excessive amounts of sibutramine, a prescription drug and controlled substance that can place people with cardiovascular disease at risk for higher blood pressure, heart attack or stroke, said Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The fake pills contain at least twice as much sibutramine as would normally be recommended, she said. ""Unfortunately, many people with high blood pressure or heart disease are trying to improve their health by losing weight, and we are concerned that such individuals might be exposed to the counterfeit drug,"" Woodcock said. Woodcock said possible symptoms of excess sibutramine are heart palpitations, sleeplessness, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea and shakiness. She said the FDA has received about two dozen calls from people reporting these symptoms. According to Alli's Web site, sibutramine is the active ingredient in the prescription diet drug Meridia. ""Sibutramine could potentially interact with other medications the consumer may be taking, and there are dosing differences between Alli (three times a day) and Meridia (once a day),"" the site says. Analysis also shows that the counterfeit pills lack the active ingredient orlistat found in the authentic Alli product, which prevents a portion of the fat eaten from being absorbed, Alli's Web site says. Instead, the fat passes directly through the digestive system and is eliminated. According to Alli, which is made by London, England-based pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, consumers should watch for these signs in determining whether the product they are buying is fake: . • LOT code information is missing from the top of the box. • The expiration date includes month, day and year (example: 06162010), instead of only the month and year (example: 05/12). • The seal on the bottle should read ""SEALED FOR YOUR PROTECTION"" in white ink on the real Alli bottle; this statement is not present on the fake product. • The counterfeit capsule is slightly larger, and its content is powdery; the genuine capsule is shaped more like a pellet.","Counterfeit pills sold online contain excessive amount of drug, FDA says .

"(CNN) -- Three choices, and you only get to pick one: . Of these three developments that took place in the second half of the 20th century, which has had the most enduring impact on our lives today? 1. The building of the interstate highway system. 2. The blanketing of the United States with coast-to-coast television. 3. The introduction and spread of the Internet. We're finally far enough into the 21st century that we can look at the previous one with the perspective that comes with distance. American life prior to 1950 felt nothing like American life feels now, and a big reason is those three changes. They, more than any fleeting headline event or arcane political controversy, transformed everything; the question for you is, which of them changed things the most? Before the interstates were constructed, the country felt pretty hemmed in. Even a trip within an individual state often took considerable planning; two-lane roads, dangerous and slow, were common, and people didn't leave their hometowns on a whim. The interstates -- the official name, still, is the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways -- tore down the invisible walls around U.S. towns. President Eisenhower was in favor of building the interstates (often said to be the biggest public works project in the history of the world) because he believed that, in a time of war, they would be helpful in moving troops and supplies. But their immediate effect was to make Americans feel that certain doors had been unlocked. With the interstates came an exhilarating sense of freedom: A person could drive anywhere -- everywhere -- easily and without paying tolls. Suddenly, horizons were unlimited. ""Local"" didn't mean quite the same thing it used to. You didn't have to stay put. Getting away was effortless. The introduction of national television meant that for the first time in history, people in every corner of the country -- people in small towns, in huge cities, in farm communities, in remote villages -- were watching exactly the same thing at exactly the same moment. It connected the country, made it cohesive, in a way that even network radio hadn't accomplished, and it was because of the transfixing quality of the TV pictures. As with the interstates, coast-to-coast television was an antidote to isolation. The executives who ran the newly formed television networks had an enormous amount of power. Their decisions about what to put on the air determined what people would be talking about the next day. They, in essence, controlled what people would laugh at and when, what people would cry over and when, what would anger people and when it would anger them. The handful of national over-the-air networks, in their early days, were just that dominant. America might as well have been hypnotized, so great was the devotion to the new machine. And then, later in the century, the Internet came along and with it the promise of the erasure of all symbolic borders. If the interstate highways had allowed physical freedom, the Internet allowed a different kind of freedom, one unprecedented in human experience. It was no coincidence that it was initially referred to as the information superhighway: Seemingly overnight, the knowledge (and trivia and gossip) of the world was available to anyone with a keyboard and a modem; people who had never met and would never meet could communicate as if they were lifelong friends. The old-time television executives no longer had as firm a grip on how citizens would spend their time; now the individual at his or her computer terminal was given the power to decide how he or she would be informed, entertained or infuriated at a given moment. No one else had the absolute authority to program the individual's life; he or she made that decision, moment by moment. What in the past might have taken a person a lifetime -- searching for mankind's recorded wisdom in distant and magnificent libraries -- now, in theory, was available with a series of key taps from one's room, regardless of how modest. What had once seemed inconceivable had, in the blink of an eye, become routine. So: . The three innovations ended up changing our daily world profoundly -- largely because of them, it is a world that would be almost unrecognizable to our grandparents and great-grandparents. Each of the three, it can be argued, had certain drawbacks and tradeoffs that we should not ignore: . The interstates let us roam at will but weakened our sense of place; television brought us together, but somehow, in relieving the old sense of forced isolation, it paradoxically introduced a new kind of voluntary isolation as it lured us to stay increasingly within the confines of our walls; the Internet gave us access to the whole planet but locked our attention on a small sheet of plastic or glass. The drawbacks are perhaps a discussion for another time. What is not debatable is how much influence each of the three developments has had on the way we live our lives today. The question is, if you had to choose one of the three as the most far-reaching, the one that has altered our lives -- all right, your life -- the most, which one would it be? Or, to put it another way: which of the three couldn't you live without? There's no right answer. There's just your answer. Feel free to come up with it as you drive unfettered down the open highway, as you sit around watching TV or, if you'd like, by going to the quick vote that you'll find on this page. [Postscript: Voting is now closed. More than 303,000 people voted; 58 percent selected the Internet as the most enduring innovation, 29 percent selected television, and 14 percent selected the interstate highways.] .

"(CNN) -- The toughest conditions she has ever played in. That's how one of tennis' biggest stars described this year's scorched Australian Open. And it's not hard to see why. With temperatures in excess of 40 degrees, and after four days of players fainting, vomiting and tirelessly icing themselves to keep cool, Li Na was feeling hot and flustered. The fourth seed, a runner-up at last year's Melbourne grand slam, was facing match point and a shock early exit at the hands of world No. 26 Lucie Safarova. But the Czech sent a backhand five centimeters long of the baseline, letting Li back in to take a second-set tie break and then take advantage of the extreme heat contingency plan. In light of the oppressive weather, tournament organizers have allowed for an extra 10 minutes between the second and third sets of women's matches, a break which rejuvenated the 2011 French Open champion. ""After the second set, lucky thing we had the 10 minute break,"" China's Li told reporters after her 1-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-3 victory set up a fourth round match with Russia Ekaterina Makarova. ""I think five centimeters saved my tournament. If she hit it in, I think me and my whole team would be on our way to the airport now. ""At least I won the match, and I'm still in the tournament now. It was a difficult day for me but I was really happy with the way I was fighting on the court from the first point until the last point."" While Li Na went to cool down, tournament doctor Tim Wood had defended organizers' refusal to halt play during the sunniest parts of the day, saying that, while playing in the heat might be terribly uncomfortable, human beings ""evolved on the high plains of Africa chasing antelope for eight hours under these conditions. ""There will be some players who complain and no-one is saying it is terribly comfortable to play out there, but, from a medical perspective, we know that man is well adapted to exercising in the heat. Whether it is humane or not is a whole other issue,"" Wood told the BBC. Words that might not be music to Britain's Jamie Murray's ears, who was treated for heatstroke. Whatever the conditions, world No. 1 Serena Williams continues her peerless dominance of the women's game. The top seed has now won more matches at the Australian Open than any other woman in history after registering her 61st success at Melbourne Park by beating Daniela Hantuchova 6-3 6-3. ""I feel good to have gotten through that one because it was tough conditions out there, but I was happy to win,"" said the 32-year-old. ""Today actually wasn't as hot. I think it was hotter yesterday. So it wasn't as bad today. Honestly, on the one end I felt it was like a cool breeze coming over, so that was a good sign."" Williams' fourth round opponent will be the resurgent Ana Ivanovic, who reached the fourth round after coming from one set down to end Australian Samantha Stosur's hopes of a home grand slam triumph. In the men's draw, defending champion Novak Djokovic remained on course for his fourth Australian Open title in a row as he eased into the fourth round with a 6-3 6-3 7-5 victory over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. ""I feel better on the court as the tournament is progressing,"" Djokovic, who played under the cool conditions of the Rod Laver Arena's closed roof, told reporters. ""Of course, I played three matches in different conditions. The roof was closed and the temperature dropped by at least 10 degrees, and you could feel that. It affected the play, it was much slower."" Victory for the Serbian, who won his first grand slam in Melbourne in 2008, sets up a meeting with his old friend Fabio Fognini, after the Italian beat American Sam Querrey. ""I'm going to try to win against him regardless of whether he's a friend or not,"" Djokovic continued. ""I have a real friendship with him for more than 10 years but once we get on court we're both professionals and we want to win."" Spanish third seed David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych, the Czech seventh seed, and South African Kevin Anderson also booked their places in the next round of the sizzling Australian Open.","Li Na saves match point to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Along with his band The Stooges, Iggy Pop invented punk rock and his outrageous onstage antics have inspired countless wannabes. After years of excess, the 'Godfather of Punk' moved to Miami in search of peace. CNN's travel show My City, My Life caught up with him to talk about music, inspiration and life in his favorite city Miami. Iggy Pop: ""Don't look now but that guy is going to try and carjack your rental car!"" CNN: What made you move to Miami? Iggy Pop: I was fed up after 25 years in huge, dark, media-centric cities. I decided to find a house and move here. I was looking for something in a kind of elegant coma with a lot of peace and convenience. CNN: Is Miami similar to you as a person? IP: Miami is nothing like me and that's why I need to be here -- it's the opposite. I'm practical, where this place is moody, I'm stolid in my interior where this place has a certain flair and I'm materialistic in a sense that this place is fundamentally spiritual -- there's a quicksilver quality about this place. CNN: How would you describe Miami's personality? IP: Miami's a hell of a good town to eat a banana! CNN: What do you do when you need writing inspiration for your music? IP: I need to feel good. When I was 20, 21 years old, it meant three or four joints and then went from there. Now, I usually get it after exercise or from nature, sometimes from a woman or a city. I get it from a good song or a great book. Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water. I don't fish, I don't hunt, I don't scuba, I don't spear, don't boat, don't play basketball or football -- I excel at staring into space. I'm really good at that. It helps the writing a little bit, the kind of writing that works for music, which is tiny writing. It's not like writing a novel -- it's all about making your point small. CNN: What do you most love about Miami? IP: I love what was here before any of the people - the puffy clouds, the forgiving quality of the light, the breeze that renews life and hints at freedom, and the sea. It's somewhere you can look out and just see things stop. Second only to the sea the Miami sky has been the greatest comfort in my life past 50. On a good day, when the wind blows from the south, the light here is diffuse and forgiving.  See photos of Iggy in Miami. » . CNN: If you were an estate agent, how would you sell Miami? IP: I'd say: ""you've done your time up north, you've got your medal; now come down to Miami and heal yourself."" CNN: If you were trying to put people off Miami, what would you tell them? IP: I'd say: ""Don't look now but that guy is going to try and carjack your rental car!"" CNN: Is Miami a poor cousin to New York or LA? IP: Miami's not anybody's poor cousin. It's an aspiration to live in this town, not something you have to do to promote yourself like some of the larger cities. CNN: What's the stereotype of Miami and is it correct? IP: It's changing rapidly but, more than anything else, it has always been associated with retirement and indolence in equal proportions. Miami's reputation is probably a little low brow, which is changing. CNN: How have the changes in Miami affected you? IP: Miami is growing and that's always a tricky proposition. Basically, I'm one of those characters who like to lurk where not too many people are, so the effect on me has been to push me bit by bit like an Indian tribe, closer and closer to the edges of town, which is fine. CNN: How has Miami influenced you as an artist? IP: Miami has given me 11 very good years now and has prolonged my abilities and energies, and provoked my good humor enough that I could continue in my field. But it's not a place to come to get an idea. Come here to catch a fish! CNN: What is the music like in Miami? IP: It's a very musical town and it's full of some of the best musicians you'll find anywhere in any genre -- soul, Latin, pop, salsa. There are some damn good rock players down here. There are a lot of good little punk bands here -- little punkers with good little attitudes. It's a very musical place and I kind of like that it puts rock and roll in perspective. It's not the biggest or only thing here and I don't think it ever should have been. CNN: If Miami was a person, who would it be? IP: It would be Rudolf Valentino, because it's dark and moody, with a brilliant and sensual side, and it captures and inflames the imagination of a great deal of the western world. CNN: How would you describe Miami in one sentence? IP: Miami's a sunny place for shady people!","Iggy Pop says he moved to Miami in search of peace and convenience .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, Democratic governors and even a Republican Cabinet member on Friday blamed GOP intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect March 1. The increasingly strong entreaties for Republicans to discuss a middle-ground solution with Obama and Democrats showed White House concern over the impasse, as well as its ability to mount a message campaign during a week that Congress is on break. At issue are $85 billion in mandatory across-the-board spending cuts this fiscal year that both sides agree will harm the economy and national security. However, the intractable ideological divide over taxes, spending and the role of government has led to another political showdown in Washington like those that dominated Obama's first term. The president met with Democratic governors at the White House and later told reporters that the forced spending cuts -- known in Washington jargon as sequestration -- were the ""wrong prescription"" for reducing the nation's chronic deficits and debt. Others were less diplomatic. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin called Republicans ""obstructionist,"" while Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy accused GOP legislators of false claims about the issue that he said the news media reported as truth. ""This is craziness,"" Malloy said, adding that a lack of leadership among congressional Republicans meant ""there's nobody to deal with anymore."" Outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the lone Republican in Obama's Cabinet for now, also called on GOP legislators to fully join the debate. He noted the impending cuts would mean lengthy flight delays and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April without a deal. ""I think Republicans need to step up here,"" LaHood told reporters at the daily White House briefing, where he appeared with Press Secretary Jay Carney. ""This requires compromise. This requires Republicans stepping forward with some ideas about how to keep essential services of government running at a level that people are accustomed to."" At issue are the forced cuts and how they came about. They were mandated under a 2011 agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit, intended to motivate Congress to negotiate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal rather than face unpopular reductions in military and non-defense spending. Republicans contend the idea came from Obama and continually refer to the cuts as ""the president's sequester,"" while the White House notes GOP leaders also endorsed and voted for the plan before Obama signed it into law. While House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders say they want to replace the forced cuts with other spending reductions that would be less harmful, some GOP legislators contend the across-the-board approach of sequestration is a good start. ""It's the least we can do,"" conservative Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said Friday on Fox. ""We have to slow down spending."" For their part, Obama and Democrats continue to push the central theme of last year's election campaign in calling for a combination of more tax revenue from the wealthy as part of a package that includes spending cuts, rather than what they call a meat cleaver approach. Republicans, however, reject any talk of higher taxes or increased tax revenue after conceding on that issue in the January agreement that raised rates on the nation's top income earners. They want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it, while Democrats want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable communities. While both sides accuse the other of refusing to yield, the Democratic voice was more prominent Friday. Obama ""has offered a balanced approach and it is time for (the) Republican Congress to stop playing games with our jobs recovery, to stop playing games with our middle class who struggled long enough (and) finally see some hope, some income growth, some job growth,"" Shumlin said. ""We are seeing it in our states."" In an interview on Thursday with the radio program ""Keepin It Real with Al Sharpton,"" Obama said GOP opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was ""the thing that binds their party together at this point."" ""Unfortunately, I think Republicans have been so dug-in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them,"" the president said. In an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Boehner labeled the spending cuts ""ugly and dangerous,"" saying they would diminish resources for the military, law enforcement, border security, aviation safety and other programs. However, the de facto GOP leader on the issue argued that his party's agreement to higher tax rates for the wealthy ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now. The forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies -- but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits -- were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan sought by both sides. Such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper-political climate of an election year, and the government-wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect. That would mean $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, as part of a 10-year total of about $1 trillion. A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. GOP leaders, meanwhile, seek to blame Obama for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result, such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth, get attributed to the president. A majority of Americans support an approach that combines spending cuts and some tax increases to reduce federal deficits, according to surveys Thursday by Pew/USA Today and Bloomberg News. However, another poll on Friday showed limited support for reducing specific programs, such as defense, entitlements, education and health care. According to the new Pew Research Center survey, a majority of the public wants to either keep funding the same or increase it for 18 of 19 federal programs mentioned in the poll. The only exception was U.S. aid for people in need around the world, with 49% of respondents saying such assistance should be increased or kept at current levels while 48% said it should be decreased. CNN's Paul Steinhauser and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.","President Obama calls upcoming forced spending cuts the ""wrong prescription""

"(CNN) -- Dozens of pilot whales have been rescued after they beached themselves along the shore of Farewell Spit on New Zealand's South Island on Saturday. Fifty-three of the animals had been discovered along the beach after swimming up on shore, said John Mason with the New Zealand Department of Conservation. Teams of volunteers successfully delivered 40 of the pilot whales back to deeper water, and most of them appeared to be fine, although 10 appeared to be still at risk and lingering near the shore, Mason said from Golden Bay. ""What we have is quite a large pod and we have had to chase them along,"" Mason said. ""If they come back in we have found making human chains to splash and guide them to deeper water is the most effective way to help them to safety."" It's the fifth large-scale stranding in recent days at the bay, leaving at least 22 of the animals dead. Officials have been calling in volunteers with wet suits or boats to help the whales and monitor their path. Mason said it is not unusual to have whales beaching themselves at Farewell Spit, a long hooked sandy area that forms the top of Golden Bay where the shallows appear to confuse the animals.","40 pilot whales helped back to deep water in Golden Bay .

"London, England (CNN) -- The launch of the Facebook Home app has reignited the privacy debate over whether the social networking site is becoming too integrated in our lives. Unveiled last week, Home integrates all of the social network's services into the operating system of Android phones. Instead of having to download apps to use Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook Camera, access to these features is consolidated into Facebook Home, which appears on the user's home screen. Typically for a Facebook launch, it has attracted fierce criticism. CNN contributor Andrew Keen, an expert in the digital economy, said: ""Facebook wants to know everything we do, so they can sell more advertising. It shows that Facebook has absolutely no respect for our privacy."" ""They are by definition creepy, untrustworthy and they've proven that time and time again,"" he added. Facebook has responded to the criticism following the launch in a blog post to say that the data Home would collect is no different from what the social networking site already tracks and that it is used internally to improve the user experience. For tech-savvy digital natives, who share personal information frequently and tend to see value in such personal disclosures, the polemic around Home could be seen as a non-issue. It also could be argued that privacy is a long-dead illusion that is fast becoming an outdated concept. David Rowan, editor of technology magazine ""Wired,"" thinks so. ""Our concept of privacy is very much a 20th century idea,"" he told CNN at Names not Numbers, an idea-sharing and networking conference held in the UK recently. ""All that personal data you are giving to these private companies they are making money on and they decide how it's going to be used. You lose control of that data."" Commentators say that we should be asking tougher questions about that information is being used. Read more: Using social media to predict the future . In his upcoming book ""Who Owns the Future?"" digital pioneer Jaron Lanier discusses how the world's biggest online services such as Google and Facebook are not in fact ""free"" because in return we are duly handing over information about ourselves that can be turned into big money. Read more: 5 tips for controlling your privacy online . But can we really move beyond privacy? Keen thinks that if we don't act soon, we could. In his latest book, ""Digital Vertigo"", he argues that in California's Silicon Valley there are people who ""have already discarded privacy as if it's like gas lighting -- an archaic thing which humans will move beyond."" Keen urges us to consider what privacy really means in the ""Big Data Age."" Read more: Privacy was good while it lasted . He talks in apocalyptic terms about a ""scary, nightmarish, dystopian future,"" where we live in a world of ""radical transparency"". Technology seems to be moving ever closer to a world where every aspect of our existence is recorded, both at our will and not, and Keen argues that humans are not ready for this, this ability ""to press the rewind button on your life"". ""The internet needs to learn how to forget. All it knows is how to remember. That's not very human,"" he says, arguing that forgetting is as essential to the human condition as remembering. But, in today's world, the documentation of our every move and every desire is becoming increasingly inescapable. According to Rowan, ""anybody who is using any kind of electronic device is giving up the practical ability to be untrackable."" So pervasive is the power of internet giants that the U.S. government launched an official ""National Data Privacy Day"" -- a drive to raise awareness among teenagers and young adults about the importance of maintaining what little privacy they may have left. Keen draws similarities between the negative impacts of the industrial revolution and those of the digital world order, which, he says, ""is in some ways more profound and far-reaching"". Just as ""the downside of industrialization was pollution, data distribution and the invasion of our privacy is the pollution of the big data age.""

The app will launch for iPhone and Android in August, Adidas announced on its Instagram page. The technology is part of the relaunch of ""mi adidas,"" the shoemaker's customizable-sneakers program, and is available for its line of Originals lifestyle shoes, such as the ZX Flux (but not its sport shoes). Adidas spokesperson RaEsa Benjamin-Wardle said more details on prices and how the app works will be forthcoming. Some sample styles that Adidas suggests on its website: cherry blossoms, tree bark, a beach scene and a hamburger with all the fixings. The Instagram post had garnered more than 42,000 likes by Tuesday afternoon, perhaps an indication of potential customers.

"Mayflower, Arkansas (CNN) -- Tornadoes tore through several states Sunday evening as severe weather slammed into parts of the central United States. Authorities confirmed at least nine fatalities: eight in Arkansas and one in Oklahoma. Damage is ""widespread"" after a tornado hit Mayflower, Arkansas, and there are numerous reports of injuries, said Matt DeCample, a spokesman for the state's governor. Damage is also widespread in Vilonia, north of Little Rock, he said. ""I can't even get down the main street down to the middle of town,"" Vilonia Mayor James Firestone said. ""I am trying to make my way through the downed trees and power lines. What I am seeing, it is a lot of damage. I've been listening to the rescue folks. They're saying people have to be extracted from vehicles. ... It looks pretty bad. From what I understand, there has been a subdivision that's been leveled."" In Mayflower, overturned, smashed cars were visible along the freeway as search and rescue teams combed the area. Video from CNN affiliate KARK showed a decimated building in Mayflower surrounded by scattered debris and emergency vehicles. Interstate 40 was shut down as authorities removed debris from the highway after the tornado struck Mayflower, said Arkansas State Patrol spokesman Bill Sadler. Mayflower is roughly 25 miles northwest of Little Rock. The National Weather Service's Little Rock office tweeted a series of messages warning of tornadoes, reporting damage and telling residents to take cover. A tornado crossing I-40 ""was reported to be as much as a half-mile wide,"" the weather service said. Officials reported overturned semi-trucks and destroyed homes, the weather service said. Witnesses also spotted a twister in the Oklahoma town of Quapaw on Sunday, an emergency official said, as severe weather slammed into parts of the central United States. Joe Dan Morgan, emergency manager in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, said ambulances had deployed after reports of a funnel on the ground in Quapaw, and rescuers were working in an area where a concrete wall crashed onto a car. Numerous buildings in the town were damaged, said Keli Cain with Oklahoma Emergency Management. Kelly Flecks, an emergency dispatcher in Ottawa County, also said a tornado hit the town. ""Search and rescue is under way involving several agencies,"" she said. ""Please tell the public to stay away so they can do their jobs. We can't confirm anything else at the moment. Quapaw is in the northeastern part of the state, near the borders with Kansas and Missouri. Also Sunday evening, a tornado emergency was declared for Maumelle, Arkansas, the weather service said. Maumelle is also northwest of Little Rock in central Arkansas. Storm spotters were tracking a confirmed tornado with reports of damage, the weather service said. A tornado emergency is issued when a storm is producing a life-threatening, confirmed tornado capable of significant destruction. Strong tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail were expected for parts of the Central Plains and along the Mississippi River Valley on Sunday, CNN meteorologists said. Forecasters from the weather service warned that numerous tornadoes could hit, ""with a few intense tornadoes likely."" Large hail and damaging winds are also possible, forecasters said.

"(CNN) -- For palaeontologists, the Middle East has long proven a bit of a blind spot. Evidence of dinosaurs has proven scarce, and what little surfaces from time to time have been traditionally difficult to itemize. That changed recently when an international team of scientists uncovered the first evidence of dinosaurs in Saudi Arabia near the coast of the Red Sea. The findings were published last month in the scientific journal PLOS ONE. ""To say that finds (in the Arabian Peninsula) are rare is an understatement. What's been discovered, you could almost fit inside a shoebox,"" notes Dr. Benjamin Kear, a palaeontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden, and the study's lead author. ""The problem in the past is that what's been found are just bone fragments, and you can say they're dinosaur, and vaguely what kind, but we've been unable to reconstruct and assemble them. This is therefore the first time that we can confidently identify an Arabian dinosaur fossil with any degree of accuracy,"" he says. Kear and his team uncovered 72-million-year-old fossils. The first was of a series of vertebrae from the tail of a ""Brontosaurus-like"" sauropod called a titanosaur, the second, a few teeth from a theropod. The latter belonged to an abelisaurid -- a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur some 20 feet long. Read more: Unearthing tomb of Egypt's beer-maker to the gods . Kear, who has excavated in the region before, says he was following up a lead on potential dinosaur fossils found by oil geologists who stumbled upon an outcrop. ""They had found an accumulation of fossils that mostly weren't from dinosaurs, but rather giant marine reptiles,"" he says. As it happens, much of the Arabian Peninsula was underwater when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and those rare remains that were discovered were washed downstream and out to sea by rivers, probably during a flash flood long ago in the Late Cretaceous period. ""We systematically worked this area over the last few years in the hope that a dinosaur would turn up. It was a matter of time to be honest; dinosaurs do often turn up in marine rocks washed out to sea,"" he says. ""There are a handful of blank spots on the dinosaur map, and the Arabian Peninsula is among the very biggest blank spots,"" notes Dr. Anne Schulp, a palaeontologist and researcher at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. In 2008, Schulp led a team that unearthed the first dinosaur tracks found in the region near Sana'a, Yemen. ""Even the tiniest scrap of bone is something to get excited about,"" he says. ""The picture is slowly filling in, but it's a very large area and there remains much more to be discovered."" Louis Jacobs, a vertebrate palaeontologist and professor at Southern Methodist University, explains that the discovery could also help find much sought-after answers about the history of the Earth and its land formations. Jacobs explains that when the fossils were first buried, Saudi Arabia was part of Gondwana -- the subcontinent that made up the southern half of Pangaea, and included parts of modern-day Africa. Read more: How not to do a desert expedition . ""India started out much further south, and through time it moved north and slammed into Asia, creating the Himalayas. But it passed by the Arabian Peninsula about the time that dinosaurs lived,"" explains Jacobs. ""Part of the interest in dinosaurs from Arabia is to get at that relationship between Gondwana and India during that time."" Several factors explain the scarcity of dinosaur-related material in the Arabian Peninsula. One issue is that the richest sites aren't always the most accessible. Fragments have previously been found in Syria (currently a no-go zone) and Yemen, which discourages certain travelers. Meanwhile, visitors to Saudi Arabia need a sanctioned invite. Kear notes that in Saudi Arabia part of the problem is that the most prevalent types of rocks aren't the right types for capturing millennia-old land-based animals. He also notes that until recently, the country suffered from a lack of interest in this type of research. ""Let's say the geological view has been skewed in the past towards oil exploration,"" he says. Still, he says, paleontological research is gaining more traction, as evidenced by the government-run Saudi Geological Survey recently adding a palaeontology division. ""For the first time, you can see the work is going somewhere, and leading to a lasting legacy. In the future, we can expect to see Saudi dinosaur displays and museums so people inside the country can understand the riches they possess.""","An international team of scientists discovered the first evidence of dinosaurs in Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- The sentencing in Cairo of journalists from Al Jazeera's English-language channel this week has shocked the West. Australian Peter Greste, formerly of the BBC, received seven years: so did Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy, who had worked with CNN. Baher Mohammed, an Egyptian producer, was given 10 years. The Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, herself a trained lawyer, said the sentence was incomprehensible ""based on the evidence presented in the case."" Fear of the Muslim Brotherhood appears to be a factor. Mohammed Morsi was elected as Egyptian president in 2012 with support from the Brotherhood and from Qatar. Since Morsi's displacement in July 2013, relations between Egypt and Qatar have been uncomfortable. Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel Mubasher Misr (""Egypt Live"") was identified as particularly close to the Brotherhood. The sentences handed down to Al Jazeera journalists may reflect the distrust of the current Egyptian regime for the Qatari owners of the TV station. Al Jazeera has transformed both television reporting within the Middle East and coverage of the Middle East elsewhere. The characteristic logo of Al Jazeera is constantly seen on images fed to major television networks across the world. The channel was established by the Emir of Qatar in 1997 and originally employed many who worked -- before it folded -- with the BBC Arabic World Service. Its style was more in line with western news media than national Middle Eastern channels of the time. The impact of its coverage of the first Gulf War established its credentials. Although demonized by the U.S. government in the period following 9/11, when it broadcast interviews with al Qaeda leaders, it has developed a formidable reputation both in the Middle East and beyond. Possibly the best way to gauge its success though has been through impartial interviews with its audience. I oversaw a survey, during which we interviewed more than 2,000 Arabic speakers who watch satellite-delivered Arabic television in Europe. It revealed that Al Jazeera is widely viewed and is particularly popular with those of Middle Eastern, as opposed to North African Maghrebi heritage. Many talked with pride of the channel: one man in Nicosia said ""it transformed how media treats news of the region."" It has a reputation for balance. An English viewer said ""Al Jazeera is very much impartial,"" while a German viewer said that Al Jazeera news was ""better"" than German news as it was less locally focused. Several participants recommended Al Jazeera English to non-Arabic speaking friends so they discovered alternative points of view in the Arab world. Al Jazeera courts controversy. Debates are often raucous, stories are broken and images shown that may offend some viewers. While on the one hand Al Jazeera is suspected of fundamentalist Islamic links, on the other some Arabic speakers in Europe denounce it as a mouthpiece of the U.S. For example, one Arabic speaker from Stockholm cited the huge U.S. air base in Qatar as a reason for distrusting the channel. But Al Jazeera is part of a trajectory of modernization of media in the Arabic world. It broadcasts in Modern Standard Arabic, the modern literary lingua franca which spread in the 1920s as the intelligentsia of the Arabic speaking world sought to modernize (Arabic dialects are so numerous as to be mutually incomprehensible.) Egypt, the Middle East's most populous nation, was at the heart of that process of modernization -- the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram was the paper of record for the Middle East throughout the first part of the 20th century. After World War II, anti-imperialist radio, encouraged by then-president Gamal Abdel Nasser, took on the pan-Arabic mantle. That process has continued in recent times. The satellite station Nile TV International is a hugely successful entertainment channel watched in the Arabic-speaking world and Europe. During the Arab Spring, new forms of communication used in Tahrir Square -- including Facebook and Twitter -- were portrayed as the new face of freedom of speech. The fate of the Al Jazeera journalists shows just how far Egypt has now fallen. READ MORE: Gorani: Why we should all be worried by the jailing of Al Jazeera journalists .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- The past is a foreign place: they do things more fashionably there. That must be the reason for the continued infatuation with the vintage trend on catwalks, in boutiques and in stores around the world. But for Lourens Gebhardt, aka Loux the Vintage Guru, vintage is not just a trend, it is a way of life. ""Vintage clothes have history behind them, they are from a legendary era that has been left behind by our ancestors. It is not a trend, it won't go away,"" said the Namibian blogger and fashion designer. The Congolese dandies known as the ""Sapeurs"" have become well known for their love of classic designer labels and elegant vintage clothes, but retro is being worn by hipsters across the continent. ""Vintage clothing is cheap here in Africa compared to Europe and people can source their clothes easily at open markets, that's why it's so popular,"" Gebhardt explained. The Timeless Collective, a group of young creatives from Pretoria, South Africa, want to show off their talents through their love for vintage fashion. Members of the group include stylists, design students and photographers. ""I like vintage because of its quality,"" said Timeless Collective stylist Mapusha Mushe, ""the quality which you find in vintage clothes is just great. They are second hand clothes but no-one would believe it if you check the way I style them. ""Historically, Pretoria is not so fashionable, it's more of a city, a basic modern city, but fashion wise we are trying as youngsters to bring it up."" Johannesburg fashion blogger Jerri Mokgofe also appreciates the quality of vintage clothing. ""If you look at the retail stores, it's all about fast fashion, fast fashion is what sells, and now you get a lot of synthetic fibers whereas in the past you got cotton, raw silks and those kinds of materials. Times have changed,"" he said. ""Vintage is people being nostalgic about the time or era that they didn't grow up in; I mean everybody would have loved to have been born in the 1960s or the 1920s. So I think for some people it's about escapism and fashion is escapism. ""You can always turn back the hands of time in terms of your wardrobe and revisit the past, the era your mom grew up in, and borrow from your mother's, grandmother's or grandfather's wardrobe and put those elements together and wear it today. And the beauty of it is that it's celebrated and people see it as the hottest trend."" Not wanting to be left behind, retailers have also been turning back the hands of time. In Lagos, Nigeria, retro store ""Retrospective"" specializes in pre-owned clothes and accessories, while Vintage Gh is showcasing second-hand style in Accra, Ghana -- giving ""new life and value to otherwise discarded clothing."" Vintage haven Fruitcake Vintage was set up by friends Jamakazi Thelejane and Sthembiso Mngadi in Johannesburg's central business district. It opened in 2010, and with prices ranging from about $8 to $50 it is known as the place to find both unique and affordable items. For the owners, their love of all things vintage is nothing new. ""I was brought up by my grandparents and I remember my grandfather used to change into three different suits a day,"" explained Mngadi. ""I never once saw my grandfather in casual clothing, so I think that stayed with me and my grandma of course, in her Sunday best. My mother and father were very fashionable people because of them, so it has always been with me. I think I was born with it.""","Vintage clothes a hit with fashionistas across Africa .
The quality, availability and price of vintage clothing is part of the appeal .

"(CNN) -- A scathing review of policing in Boston found that in a city where about a quarter of the population is African-American, two-thirds of police stops involved black residents, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The report, titled ""Black, Brown, and Targeted,"" is based on the preliminary results of a study commissioned by the Boston Police Department -- which analyzed 204,000 ""Field Interrogation and Observation"" (FIO) reports from police officers between 2007 and 2010. ""The fact that blacks make up about 25% of Boston's population, but are stopped 63% of the time raises serious concerns of racially biased policing,"" said Nusrat Choudhury, an attorney with the ACLU Racial Justice Program. The findings come in the wake of troubling incidents across the nation in which police actions disproportionately targeted African-Americans in cities like New York, where questionable police tactics have been captured on video. Additionally, the controversial shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, has drawn national attention to the issue of police/community relations. Released jointly by the ACLU and its branch in Massachusetts, the report found that Boston Police gave no justification for 75% of the encounters with citizens and listed the reason for the stop simply as ""investigate person."" Only 2.5% of the encounters lead to seizure of contraband, according to the ACLU. ""'Investigate person' cannot provide a constitutionally permissible reason for stopping or frisking someone,"" said Matthew Segal, legal director at the ACLU of Massachusetts. ""It only describes what the officer decided to do. It basically means: 'Because I said so.'"" The Boston Police Department said it has made significant changes to procedures since 2011, including improved documentation and supervision of stops. ""Over the past month, the Department has held three separate meetings with the ACLU to receive feedback and engage the organization in the solutions,"" the department said in a statement. ""As a result of the meetings, the Department agrees that publishing FIO statistics going forward is necessary, and the Department is working toward personalizing interactions between officers and citizens."" The report said that Boston police failed to show that its stops and frisks produced results. ""In a four-year span, the BPD targeted Blacks for roughly 129,600 encounters -- 63.3% of 204,739 -- that did not result in arrest,"" the report said. Segal said the findings were clear evidence of racial bias by Boston officers. ""This practice contradicts the principle of equal protection under the law, which is guaranteed by both the U.S. and Massachusetts Constitutions,"" he said. ""We hope that we can work collaboratively with the BPD to address this problem."" A report released in New York last year found that officers there also disproportionately targeted minorities during stops. Nearly nine out of 10 people ""stopped and frisked"" under a controversial New York Police Department policy in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic, the NYPD report said. The New York report showed that of 685,724 stops made by police that year, 53% of those questioned were black, 34% were Latino, 9% were white and 3% were Asian. The citywide population in 2011 was 23.4% black, 29.4% Hispanic, 12.9% Asian, and 34.3% non-Hispanic white, according to the report. Opinion: Obama needs to lead on racial profiling legislation . In Boston, the ACLU has requested that police release statistics on police-civilian encounters on a quarterly basis. It also recommended that officers who are involved in stops wear body cameras during interactions with the public -- a practice now in place in Ferguson, Missouri, after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer. A spate of incidents across the nation has drawn attention to police tactics. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed the 18-year-old in the middle of the day on August 9 after telling Brown and a friend to get out of the street. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether Wilson will be charged criminally for the shooting, which has sparked weeks of unrest. On Staten Island in New York on July 17, Eric Garner raised both hands in the air and told officers who approached him about illegally selling cigarettes to not touch him. Seconds later, a video taken by a bystander showed an officer grab Garner from behind in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. The video showed Garner lying on the ground motionless. An asthmatic and father of six, Garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital. An Indiana family is suing a city and the local police after officers smashed a car window to stun and arrest a black passenger during a traffic stop. The family said police pulled them over because the two front passengers were not wearing a seat belt on September 24 in Hammond, Indiana.","In Boston, 25% of population is black, but 63% of police stops involve blacks, study finds .

"Washington (CNN) -- Macy Friday can't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape, eyes bugged -- she shook hands with Hillary Clinton in Denver this week. It all happened so fast, she says. What she does remember is the national response to the photo of her reacting with pure, unadulterated excitement to meeting the former secretary of state. Media outlets pounced on the story. The Washington Post captured the reaction perfectly, writing that Macy had a ""look on her face that has never been witnessed by anyone who is not a dad chaperoning a minivan full of teenagers at a One Direction concert."" But why was Macy so excited? What does she like about Hillary Clinton? And who else would she react that way to meeting? CNN spoke with Macy Friday over the phone Thursday. Here is our conversation: . CNN: How did you get to meet Hillary Clinton? Macy: I went to Union Station unsuspecting that she would come. I had seen her in the elections and I have heard a lot about her. I was just like, 'Wow.' I was excited because, I thought, she was saying hi to a lot of people. I didn't think she was going to say hi to me. They went into a coffee shop and we were like, 'Oh no, they are going to leave.' And then, she came out and she is like, 'Hey you.' And I didn't know who she is talking to. And then I realized it was me and I went up and I turned back at my family. (long pause) I had never met anybody famous before. (long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face. CNN: What did you think about all the attention your photo received? Macy: Well, I love it. Because, well, it is not just because... I think Hillary Clinton is a a really good role model for girls of all ages and it [the reason she liked the attention] isn't just because it got a lot of cool places. I am just happy because people know that a younger girl still looks up to somebody like that. CNN: What is it about Secretary Clinton that you look up to? Macy: I like her because, like, she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls shouldn't be president because they are not as smart or they shouldn't have the same rights. And she is just a good role model for girls because, you know, she is just sort of, like, to everybody, 'Girls can be awesome, too.' [Editor's note: Clinton herself has said she has yet to make a decision on whether she will run for president.] . CNN: You are 10. When you were born, Hillary Clinton had been well known for 20 years. How much did you know about her when you met earlier this week? Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much. I knew that she was the first lady for a while. And her husband is Bill Clinton. And her daughter Chelsea just had a baby. And her niece's name is Macy. And that is my name. And when I first went up to her, I said, 'Macy,' and she said that is one of her favorite names. CNN: Who are some other famous people you would be as excited to see as you were with Secretary Clinton? Macy: Oh gosh, well, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, probably Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. Hmmm... Taylor Swift. Did I already say Taylor Swift? Probably One Direction. CNN: A local anchor in your hometown joked that you would be the first women president. Would you ever want to do that? Macy: Maybe! It is a really hard job. I think, I think, maybe. [Editor's note: Macy will be eligible to run for president in 2040.] . CNN: Do you think you could do it? Macy: Yeah! CNN: If Hillary Clinton runs for president, what would your advice be to her? Macy: I would say that even if you are different or you are a different gender, it doesn't matter what you look like. I don't know, like, if you wear glasses. Everybody can be awesome. CNN: If you could vote in 2016, would you vote for Secretary Clinton? Macy: Yes, totally. CNN: Thanks Macy... Macy: Thank you. And one more thing: Make sure if Finn [her 12-year old brother] does give you the permission to use the photo, give him photo cred! --- . (CNN did use the selfie that Finn took of his family and Clinton. And, yes, he did get the photo cred. Also, some question and answers were edited for clarity.)","Macy Friday met Hillary Clinton this week and a photo of her priceless reaction went viral.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's Federal Police agency said Thursday it's investigating an oil spill at a site off the coast of Rio de Janeiro being explored by the U.S. oil company Chevron. The Federal Police's Rio de Janeiro office said in a statement those responsible for the ""environmental accident in the Campos Basin"" could face sentences of up to five years in jail if found guilty. Brazil's Oil and Gas Regulator (ANP) said Chevron reported a seepage in its offshore Frade project November 8 and said that between 200 and 330 barrels of oil per day leaked into the ocean. The resulting slick was about 163 square kilometers (100 square miles), Chevron said, and was situated about 120 km (75 miles) off the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Chevron moved to cap an assessment well Wednesday that it says is the source of the seepage, ANP said. Chevron told ANP that 18 vessels were on the scene to take care of the clean-up. But according to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, Federal Police did a fly-over of the site Tuesday and saw only one vessel. ""The reports do not correspond with the reality of the facts,"" Fabio Scliar, from the police environment department, told Folha de Sao Paulo. ""I want to understand what happened."" ANP said the spill is dispersing and moving away from the Brazilian coast, so it does not appear to threaten Rio's world-famous beaches. But it does raise questions about how prepared Brazil is for the development of its offshore ""pre-salt"" deposits, which are expected to turn the country into a major oil exporter in the coming years.","The oil slick in the Campos Basin is about 163 square kilometers .

"(CNN) -- Throughout this primary election season, as tea party candidates in Kentucky, Georgia, Texas and elsewhere faltered, a media narrative started taking shape that the Republican establishment was taking back control of the party. Then, stunningly, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost Tuesday night. Some will insist that this historic upset was simply a fluke. But the reality is that the ""Establishment Strikes Back"" storyline has been wrong all along. The tea party has in fact been on a roll ever since it burst on the scene. Its success needs to be properly understood -- then emulated by its foes in both parties. The tea party is resilient partly because for many in the movement, winning is not primarily about election results. Even when it loses primaries, it wins -- by forcing the winners so far to the right that they would be unrecognizable by establishment Republicans of a generation ago. And when tea party candidates win primaries outright, as David Brat did Tuesday night in Virginia, they of course directly push their party rightward. When it comes to actual policymaking and governing, the same dynamic applies. In cases where the tea party didn't get what it wanted, as in the debt and default crisis, it still succeeded in redefining the frame of the possible. In the House it can always veto proposals such as immigration reform that have cleared the Senate. In short: The tea party wins when it loses and wins when it wins. This is a pretty good setup. And it's not an accident. I disagree profoundly with the tea party's policy agenda. Yet I also have come to see that nobody is better at democracy today than the tea party. Cantor's electoral autopsy will surely describe how Brat's campaign, out-funded and out-endorsed, was never out-organized. Tea partyers win elections by old-fashioned person-to-person proselytizing, plenty of new-media mobilizing and a fair amount of time-tested fear-mongering. They create a sense of urgency, and they convert that urgency into turnout. After the election, they continue to meet, rally and apply effective pressure on elected officials. Yes, it's not all grass roots, and pools of big money and the power of Fox News have much to do with tea party clout. But when you spend time with activists, you come to appreciate that there is no secret playbook at work. At the core is a network of citizens who've decided to deploy the full range of tools available. They show up. They work the phones. They work the media. They elect people. They un-elect people. That full-range deployment has given a minority of the nation's minority party truly outsize voice in American politics. Consider immigration. Just Tuesday morning came reports of a new poll showing majorities in both parties supporting a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. By nightfall, with Brat's uncompromising stance against such a pathway, the new conventional wisdom was that immigration reform is now dead. Never mind that Lindsey Graham, who shaped the Senate immigration bill that included a pathway to citizenship, handily defeated his primary challengers. Never mind that anything's possible in a lame-duck session with a House leadership in flux. Now many in the Beltway will simply say immigration is untouchable because the tea party wants it that way and if the tea party can beat Cantor it can beat anyone. Cantor 'earthquake' rattles Capitol Hill . You can decry the tea party's ability to create such self-fulfilling perceptions, but you cannot dismiss it. In fact, activists along every other point of the political spectrum should study the tea party more closely and learn just how it endows relatively small blocs of voters with the force of much larger blocs. What if the progressive left, centrist Democrats and moderate Republicans all organized and mobilized their people as effectively as the tea party has? What if citizens of every stripe, even without access to big campaign cash, learned to activate people power? What if leaders of all leanings thought harder about how to wake up their base and get them actually to vote? It may be harder to do that in the middle than on the extremes, but it's not impossible. The political scientist E.E. Schattschneider once wrote, ""All that is necessary to produce the most painless revolution in history, the first revolution ever legalized and legitimatized in advance, is to have a sufficient number of people do something not much more difficult than to walk across the street on election day."" As Cantor can now attest, the activists of the tea party understand this. They count votes and make votes count. Want to join them? Learn from them. Want to beat them? Learn from them. Either way, it's how we'll make a new democracy.","Eric Liu: GOP establishment seemed to be reasserting itself, then Eric Cantor loses .
Liu says tea party wins even when it loses, forcing GOP candidates further to the right .
Liu: Tea party uses every strategy to give a minority of the minority party outsize clout .

"New York (CNN) -- Former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner is hoping to open a restaurant and create jobs, a year after his failed bid to become the city's next mayor. The Rockaway Restoration Kitchen is still in the planning phases, but part of its stated mission is to aid the unemployed residents of Rockaway, Queens, a neighborhood that was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In its current state, Rockaway is a ""food desert"" according to Weiner, with pizzerias and other fast food joints dominating the landscape. Bagel shop rises after Hurricane Sandy . ""It's more than just opening a restaurant,"" Weiner told CNN. ""We want to do something sustainable for the community, while also providing healthy, local food options for the Rockaway population."" There is no indication yet of what will be on the menu. A thirteen week training program for prospective employees will cover not only kitchen and serving skills, but also professional appearance and life skills, according to Weiner. ""Our hope is to train people and give them skills to be able to go on and work in other restaurants,"" Weiner said. ""They'll be able to write on their resume that they worked at Rockaway Restoration Kitchen."" The program's target population is unemployed residents who have had trouble finding work ""because of history of substance abuse, incarceration or health problems,"" according to the restaurant's website. ""It's ridiculous that these people are not able to find jobs because of one blemish on their records,"" Weiner said. Anthony Bourdain: Eat out and tip big to save NYC restaurants after Sandy . Weiner says he's still raising money for the non-profit, and that he hopes the restaurant will be operational ""in about a year.""

This won't be the first restaurant endeavor for the family; Weiner's brother Jason is the chef and co-owner of Almond restaurant in New York City's Flatiron district. An Anthony Weiner timeline . Weiner gained national attention in 2011 when he resigned from Congress after admitting to sending inappropriate pictures and messages to several women.

"(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder strode in to a raucously triumphant welcome at Justice Department headquarters on cold, sunny February morning in 2009, less than a month after the inauguration of President Barack Obama.

This was the department where he first started his career as a lawyer in the public corruption unit in 1976, and where he has served 26 years, including as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, and for a few days as acting attorney general under President George W. Bush. They mobbed him as he stood in the wood-paneled law library and gave an impromptu speech promising to turn the page from political scandals during the Bush administration. Cheers rang out again after Vice President Joe Biden administered the oath of office and Holder vowed to return the department to ""what it once was."" More than five years later, Holder is leaving the department, marking as his top accomplishments: the Justice Department's civil rights division, revising policies aimed at reducing the racial disparity in prison sentencing, and defending the use of federal civilian courts to try terrorists against a push by conservatives to use military courts at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Obama hailed Holder's role in the administration's decision to stop defending the federal ban on recognizing same-sex marriages, which has opened the way to some of the most sweeping changes in gay rights. Related: Who might replace Eric Holder? His critics would also note that despite promising to change Bush-era counterterrorism policies, Holder signed off on ever-expanding government mass surveillance programs by the National Security Agency. Under his watch, the department also aggressively sought phone records of reporters in the hunt for national security leakers. That makes his record on civil liberties more complicated than his record on civil rights issues, critics argue. One of Holder's heroes is Robert F. Kennedy, who used the Justice Department to push the agenda of civil rights. At the same time, RFK also signed off on J. Edgar Hoover's invasive surveillance of civil rights Martin Luther King Jr. on suspicion of being a communist. At a White House ceremony to announce his plan to step down President Obama called him ""the people's lawyer."" Holder's voice broke as he thanked the president for affording him ""the greatest honor of my professional life."" The ceremony reflected the fact the attorney general's own view that he is leaving on top, and after having grown to be a close friend to the president. He survived many trials, taking blows on the president's behalf, as has become normal for the attorney general job in this highly-politicized era. His fights with congressional Republicans left scars; they made him the first sitting cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. In recent months, Holder seized the opportunity to use his credibility on race issues by traveling to Ferguson, Mo., to try to ease tensions following the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man, by a white police officer. He launched an investigation of the police department, the latest in a string of such probes around the nation. Related: Feds probe Ferguson police . One of his frustrations during his tenure is the Justice Department's inability to find prosecutable crimes to pursue against bankers linked to the global financial crisis. Holder instead has overseen a push to bring civil cases that have wrung billions of dollars in settlements from some of the world's biggest banks. Holder's defenders say that the criticism over civil liberties reflects the view of liberals who have set an impossible standard in an era with real national security threats from terrorism. In some ways, Holder's more cautious stance on national security programs came after he learned early in his tenure that turning away from Bush-era policies would be easier said than done.

Within weeks of taking office, Holder tussled with the CIA and with conservatives in Congress, over his push to release Justice Department legal memorandums that authorized torture as part of the CIA's interrogations of terror suspects. Behind the scenes he also drew fire from some in the White House, where Obama's top aides thought Holder was triggering unnecessary controversy for the new president and that conservative anger could endanger plans for a quick start on Obama's legislative agenda. He oversaw the president's plan to close the Guantanamo prison, only to find himself abandoned by the White House, which decided the matter was too hot to handle. Holder was forced to retreat on plans to hold trials in Manhattan for Khaled Sheikh Mohammed and others accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks. More than five years later KSM and his fellow defendants remain at Guantanamo, still awaiting trial, a problem for the next attorney general. And Holder feels vindicated.

"(CNN) -- There is a phrase that has long been used in discussing nuclear warfare: . Mutual assured destruction. What it means is that if various enemies develop and use the most powerful and harmful weapons available, everyone will lose. Everyone will die. National politics is not literal warfare, although its practitioners like to use the language of combat: . War rooms. Battleground states. Attack ads. And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year's presidential campaign may turn out to be the dirtiest ever. You've already seen it in the wall-to-wall television commercials during the primary season; with the fall campaign shifting into overdrive, you can expect the tone of the advertising to make sewage seem pristine by comparison. As Peggy Noonan wrote in The Wall Street Journal: ""With all the PAC money floating around, we've entered the Golden Age of mudslinging."" It's not that the candidates are incapable of high-mindedness; they are extraordinarily bright. But in recent years the mantra of high-octane campaigns has been that below-the-belt tactics work, and the rationalization has been that a candidate can't accomplish anything worthy if he or she doesn't get elected in the first place. Jim Rutenberg, in The New York Times, under the headline ""The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Race for President,"" wrote last month: ""The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges seriously."" That, he wrote, is looking like an unrealistic expectation, and thus ""Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol."" From time to time there are public calls for a truce in the invective. It never seems to stick. Carol E. Lee, writing in The Wall Street Journal: ""Neither side shows any signs of curtailing the negativity. ... One effect of such early negativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier."" Why does this matter? With politics more of a spectator sport than ever, what is the real harm in its devolving into an only slightly more refined version of mud wrestling? The harm is that it's a difficult shift to go from mud wrestler to statesman once the votes are counted. The metaphorical eye-gouging and groin-kicking of take-no-prisoners campaigns may be effective in grabbing voters' attention -- increasingly, watching a presidential campaign play out is like slowing down to gape at a particularly ugly auto accident. But there are indications that the voters are getting wise to the game, and becoming disillusioned with it. In a front-page story in USA Today before the conventions began, Susan Page reported that a USA Today/Gallup Poll ""finds Americans taking a decidedly more negative view of the presidential candidates and the tenor of their campaigns than they did four years ago."" Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other. To an extent not seen in at least the last six election seasons, voters say that they view both the Republican and Democratic parties unfavorably. When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes. This year, asked the same question, only 12% said yes. And that is the danger of mutual assured destruction, politics-style. In warfare, the hoped-for impact of the knowledge that either side could annihilate the other was to preserve a state of peace, however strained or uneasy -- it was, and is, a doctrine of deterrence. In politics, it doesn't seem to inhibit the combatants. A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president. But then the president will have to lead a nation that has turned darkly cynical about the entire process. There is a publication that has none of the glitz or dinner-party cachet of the national newspapers or television news networks, but it reaches an audience that dwarfs theirs. The publication is the AARP Bulletin -- circulation 22 million -- and its editor, Jim Toedtman, recently wrote an editorial that puts all of this in measured perspective. Under the headline ""Leaders, Try Greatness, Not Meanness,"" Toedtman said that strategists for the opposing sides are displaying ""no interest in compromise,"" and quoted Allegheny College President James H. Mullen Jr. in characterizing the current process as ""a disgraceful stew of invective ... a continuing contest in which each side of the partisan divide sees itself as right and the other as evil, uncaring or, worst of all, unpatriotic."" Does it have to be this way? The editorial recalls John Adams, who ""could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress' decisions would be dictated 'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; by contracted hearts, not large souls.'"" Adams wrote, ""There must be decency and respect and veneration introduced for persons of authority of every rank or we are undone. In popular government, this is our only way.'"" When the country loses that, it loses something essential. Just what is it that we are throwing away? Toedtman's editorial concludes: ""Decency, respect and veneration produced compromise and a foundation that has endured for 236 years. We are surrounded by noise, meanness and ignorance. The measure for our leaders must be their ability to rediscover that proven formula of sense, greatness and learning."" But what political consultant would waste his client's money trying to fit those sentiments into a 30-second commercial? Meanwhile, Election Day is less than 10 weeks away. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Political campaigns resemble warfare's mutually assured destruction .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Militants launched a string of bold strikes in Pakistan on Thursday, leaving at least 30 police officers and civilians dead, authorities said. A bomb disposal squad member removes a suicide jacket from a body at the FIA in Lahore on Thursday. At least 10 militants also died in the fighting, while others were missing. The attacks on five targets in two cities were carried out on the same day that U.S. President Barack Obama signed legislation providing an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to the Pakistani government. Among other things, the act promotes a partnership aimed at ""combating the extremism that threatens Pakistan and the United States."" Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Pakistani Taliban accepted blame for the three attacks against two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore. At least 25 people died. The three assaults began about 9 a.m. and were nearly simultaneous, police spokesman Rai Nazar Hayat said. The militants stormed each facility before setting off explosives and, in some cases, taking hostages.  Watch a rundown of the day's attacks » . ""(If) the law enforcement agencies are not safe ... how can the common man feel safe?"" asked Amir Mughal, a civilian witness to the attack on the investigation agency. ""Our children go to school -- even they are so scared,"" he added. ""We don't know that we can get back to our homes after work."" Shakeel Ahmad, a witness to one of the training center explosions, acknowledged he is afraid, but added: ""On the other hand, we are motivated also by seeing these army soldiers. We are with them."" About a half hour after the trio of attacks, a suicide car bomber hit a police station in the Kohat district of northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 11 people -- eight civilians and three police, said Kohat Police Chief Dilawr Bangish. A dozen people were wounded. The offices of several senior police and government officials and several military installations also are nearby. In Peshawar, a remote control bomb exploded inside a car parked in front of an apartment building. A hospital official said an 8-year-old boy was killed and eight people -- four women, two men and two children -- were wounded. One of the children, a girl, is in critical condition. The blast took place in a residential area for government officials and employees. Militant attacks have become increasingly bold in recent days. At least 41 people were killed and 45 wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan. The explosion occurred in the Shangla district in the volatile Swat Valley. On Saturday, militants attacked the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, killing 11 military personnel and three civilians, according to the Pakistani military. Nine militants died. A total of 39 hostages were freed Sunday morning after being held by five militants at the army headquarters.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius is a heartbroken man who has to live with the fact that he killed the love of his life, his uncle has told CNN in an exclusive interview. For the past three months, the double amputee sprinter has been living at his Uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria. He has grown a beard because he doesn't want to be recognized, and has surrounded himself with photos of Reeva Steenkamp, his uncle says. Pistorius is charged with murdering the 29-year-old model and law school graduate early on February 14, and faces a court hearing next Tuesday. Arnold Pistorius described the runner's grief as ""unthinkable"" and says his heart bleeds for his nephew. ""He's got photos in his room, photos all over the place. He's housebound, you know. He doesn't go out in public places. Bloody photos of scene of killing leaked . ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument? How would you feel? It's unthinkable."" Pistorius says Steenkamp's death was an accident and that he mistook her for a burglar. The state says it was murder. A trial date has not been set. The sprinter's agent has also spoken for the first time about the 4 a.m. call he received telling him there had been a shooting at the track star's home. ""It was the estate where Oscar (was) staying at, the estate manager's daughter phoned me from Oscar's phone. So I picked up the phone and saw it was Oscar's number and thought it was him phoning me. And just had this voice of a girl frantically on the other side shouting, 'Please, you have to rush over here, you have to come to Oscar's house,'"" Peet van Zyl told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I initially thought it was Oscar that has been shot. She said, 'No, no, no, no. Reeva's been shot.' She explained then to me basically just briefly what happened. And yeah, total shock obviously. So I had to jump in the car and rush through to Pretoria."" Van Zyl said he then called Ampie Louw, the sprinter's coach, and told him to jump in his car and get to Pistorius's house. ""When arrived at the house and you see all the police cars and lights ... I was standing outside, me and Peet and the lawyer, but Oscar was inside,"" Louw told CNN. ""I could hear him crying in the garage, and Reeva was at the entrance. So that was terrible for me."" Pistorius will make a brief appearance Tuesday at the Pretoria Magistrates Court, which will hear a motion by state prosecutors to postpone the case for further investigations. The trial itself may not happen until early 2014. READ MORE: Not everyone surprised at Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace . READ MORE: Pistorius, and the psychology of walls .

"(CNN) -- A year to the day after he killed his girlfriend, South African ""blade runner"" Oscar Pistorius broke his silence Friday, describing her death as a ""devastating accident."" The double amputee Olympic star is charged with premeditated murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, a model and law school graduate. He has never denied killing the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day last year. But he maintains that he mistook her for a home invader when he shot her in the bathroom of his upscale home in Pretoria. Since being freed on bail, he has remained largely out of the spotlight. He released a statement Friday, the anniversary of her death, saying he will carry the ""complete trauma"" of the day forever. ""No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love Reeva,"" he said on his website. ""The pain and sadness -- especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow."" Pistorius, an Olympic sprinter, also tweeted about her death for the first time since the shooting. ""A few words from my heart,"" the tweet said, linking to the statement on his website. His statement got mixed reviews on social media. ""Apparently Oscar Pistorius is 'consumed by sorrow'. All these perpetrators claiming victim status. Again, I want to scream,"" Marianna Tortell tweeted. Others were more forgiving. ""God bless you, Oscar,"" @Sissi_olcp tweeted. ""Such kind and heartfelt words. My thoughts and prayers are with you, your family and Reeva's loved ones."" His trial is set to begin next month. Steenkamp's family members, including her mother, said this week that they will attend the trial. It will be the first time they'll face their daughter's boyfriend in court. ""All we are looking for is closure and to know that our daughter did not suffer on that tragic Valentine's Day,"" the family said in a prepared statement. Prosecutors allege that Pistorius intentionally killed her after a loud argument, but he has consistently said he mistook her for an intruder. Pistorius made history when he became the first Paralympian to compete in the able-bodied Olympics in London in 2012. He ran on special carbon fiber blades affixed to his legs. He was born without the fibulae in his legs, and they were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo -- the man known as CR7. So while he managed to take his career goals tally to 400 with a double in Real Madrid's 3-0 win over Celta Vigo Monday, it's rather ironic that he has never scored in the seventh minute of a professional football match. In fact, Ronaldo has registered in every single minute of a football match throughout his career -- but never in the seventh. Ronaldo, who brought up the landmark in his 653rd match for club and country, has scored 230 goals for Real, 118 for Manchester United, five for Sporting Lisbon and 47 for Portugal. The 28-year-old has scored against 109 different teams, in 87 different stadiums with 332 goals coming from inside the penalty area. Real's victory in its first game back since the winter break, came courtesy Ronaldo's double and an opening strike from Karim Benzema. Ronaldo dedicated his goals to fellow countryman Eusebio -- one of Portugal's greatest players, who passed away at the age of 71 on Sunday. Real, which has played 18 games, sits third, five points behind leaders Barcelona and city rival Atletico. ""It was not a good performance and we need to learn how to be tighter at the back,"" Real coach Carlo Ancelotti told a news conference. ""We lacked balance as we had a lot of players going forward and were open to the counter-attack. ""Celta defended deeply and it wasn't easy but we should have been more balanced when we pressed."" Arsenal . In England, Arsenal star Theo Walcott has been ruled out for up to six months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The winger, who suffered the blow during the 2-0 FA Cup win over fierce rival Tottenham on Saturday, is also a huge doubt for the World Cup. In a statement on its website, Arsenal said: ""After coming off injured in Saturday's 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, the Club regrettably announces that Theo Walcott has sustained a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee. ""Theo will have surgery in London in the near future and is expected to be out for at least six months, therefore missing the remainder of the season and the World Cup in Brazil in the summer. ""Everyone at Arsenal wishes Theo a speedy recovery and we look forward to seeing him back on a football pitch as soon as possible."" The England star faces a race against time to be ready for the World Cup with his country's first game set to take place against Italy on June 14. Walcott, who has scored five times in 36 appearances at international level, made his debut at the age of 17 in 2006. Rossi . Meanwhile, Italy's top scorer Giuseppe Rossi could miss up to three months of the season after being forced to undergo surgery on his knee. Rossi, who lost two years of his career after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury and required two operations, will visit U.S. surgeon Richard Steadman for treatment. Fiorentina said Rossi picked up a second degree sprain to the medial collateral ligament during the 1-0 victory over Livorno on Sunday. Rossi, who has scored 14 goals this season, limped out of the action following a poor tackle from Leandro Rinaudo. ""For a correct valuation of the extent of the damage and the outlook, a visit to a specialist will take place in the next few days,"" Fiorentina said in a statement. On the pitch, Kaka inspired AC Milan to a 3-0 win over Atalanta in Serie A with his 100th goal for the club in all competitions. He added a second after the break and 18-year-old Bryan Cristante netted a third on his full debut.

""Kaka played excellent football working for the team and scoring twice,"" Allegri said. ""I'm very happy for him and the objective that he's reached. ""We all need to be focused on ending the season in the best way that we can and aware that we still have a long way yet to go.""

"(CNN) -- On September 13, President Obama spoke about the importance of historically black colleges and universities as part of HBCU Week. It was a thrill for me to be there. He paid tribute those who created these schools: . ""We remember all the men and women who took great risks and made extraordinary sacrifices to ensure that these institutions that you lead could exist,"" Obama said. ""We remember that at a critical time in our nation's history, HBCUs waged war against illiteracy and ignorance -- and won."" I appreciated the president's words of praise and encouragement. But I felt that one group was overlooked in the president's remarks: the churches that brought these remarkable institutions into being. UNCF-the United Negro College Fund represents the nation's private black colleges and universities. Private HBCUs trace their history to the years just before and after the Civil War, when they were founded by a variety of Christian denominations. They were some of the few institutions of that era that believed educating slaves, former slaves and other free blacks was worth the resources that this daunting work required. In 1867, two years after the Civil War ended, Augusta Institute was established in the basement of Springfield Baptist Church, the oldest independent African-American church in the United States, in Augusta, Georgia. Its purpose was to prepare black men for the ministry and teaching. Augusta Institute is now known as Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia, and a UNCF member. I vividly remember being introduced to the historic role churches played in black education. My mother, a journalist covering the civil rights movement, moved our family from Los Angeles, California, to Alabama in 1961. We spent six months living in rural Tuskegee, home to the legendary Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) and near the state capital, Montgomery. Montgomery was at the time the center of a movement led largely by black ministers under the guidance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. That time in Tuskegee, along with my college years at Morehouse, imprinted on me the powerful connection between the black church, its social justice mission, and HBCUs. The churches' investment in black education paid dividends, not only to the students, but also for America. During the long dark days of Jim Crow segregation, HBCUs educated the lawyers, doctors, teachers and ministers who built black communities across the South. They educated the pioneering activists who built the civil rights movement that broke Jim Crow's back. U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a civil rights pioneer, graduated from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund, attended Spelman College in Atlanta. Martin Luther King Jr. graduated from my alma mater, Morehouse. Every historically black college or university produced activists who helped break down the barriers of segregation and transform our nation. Over the decades, these church-founded colleges and universities developed a finely tuned balance between their religious roots and their secular missions. As institutions of higher education accredited by secular agencies, and as educators of students who, upon graduation, needed to compete in the job market, they offered courses that would prepare their students for employment. But as church-affiliated institutions, their education provided another element: The education emphasized moral character and community service. The dedication to service has become a hallmark of HBCU graduates. Earlier this month, The Washington Monthly issued its liberal arts college rankings, which are based on the school's contribution ""to the public good,"" including the role that service plays in the education. Private historically black colleges and universities were highly ranked. Morehouse was No.1 among the nation's 252 liberal arts colleges. All told, 20 of UNCF's 39 member HBCUs ranked in the top half of their categories. HBCUs have also been exemplars of how institutions with different religious affiliations can work together in harmony toward a common goal. Many HBCUs are affiliated with denominations widely recognized for their support in the African-American community -- the various Baptist conventions, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the United Methodists and the United Church of Christ. But Xavier University in New Orleans, Louisiana, the nation's leading educator of future black physicians and pharmacists, is a Catholic institution. And Oakwood University in Alabama is closely affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Despite the wide religious diversity among private HBCUs -- or, perhaps because of it -- these colleges and universities came together to start the UNCF in 1944. They have worked together under the UNCF umbrella to raise and distribute more than $3 billion and help more than 350,000 students graduate from UNCF member institutions. The UNCF's experiment in collaboration among religiously affiliated colleges and universities has worked for two principal reasons. First, the schools that united under the UNCF banner found that they could accommodate to the civil-society needs of their educational institutions without giving up their core convictions. In fact, what the churches brought to these institutions strengthened them. Second, those schools discovered that although each denomination has maintained its own beliefs, the ties that bind them together are stronger than the forces that divide them. In a nation and world in which religions are too often pitted against civil society -- and against each other -- America's private HBCUs provide an example of how communities of faith can work harmoniously with civil society and how differing religions can work with each other for their mutual benefit, the benefit of those they serve and the even greater benefit of the country.","Michael Lomax: Churches' investment in black education paid dividends for America .

"Washington (CNN) -- A same-sex couple has been turned away at the Supreme Court in a cross-state dispute to have both of them officially listed as the parents of an adopted 5-year-old boy. The justices rejected the California couple's appeal Tuesday without comment. The couple claims that Louisiana, where the child was born, has an unconstitutional policy against adoption by unmarried partners. The state used that policy to justify naming only one of them on an amended birth certificate. The men, Oren Adar and Mickey Ray Smith, argue gay couples have a due process right to be listed on such certificates as joint custodial parents. A federal appeals court ruled against the couple earlier this year. Some civil rights groups had urged a high court review, saying the case would have broader implications in the current legal fight in state and federal courts over same-sex marriage and whether states -- and Washington, D.C. -- must honor legal rights that gays and lesbians enjoy in other states. The men, who live in San Diego, legally adopted a 1 year-old boy from Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2006. The adoption was finalized in New York state, where the couple was then residing. In their appeal, spearheaded by the gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal, the couple said it was important both practically and symbolically they both be listed as the legal parents. ""Obtaining an amended birth certificate that accurately identifies both parents of an adopted child is vitally important for multiple purposes, including determining the parents' and child's right to make medical decisions for other family members at the necessary moments; determining custody, care, and support of the child in the event of a separation or divorce between the parents,"" the legal brief said. Lawyers for the men also said it is vitally necessary for Social Security and tax purposes, inheritance, insurance, school registration, and obtaining a passport. Adar and Smith tried to have the birth certificate changed in Louisiana. All states have laws creating a right to accurate, amended official birth and identity documents that would be recognized in other states and by the federal government. Darlene Smith, Louisiana's registrar of vital records and statistics, refused their request. She took the position that the term ""adoptive parents"" in the applicable section of state law applies only to married parents, because in Louisiana, only married couples may jointly adopt a child. Louisiana state officials argued they did not refuse to recognize the New York adoption decree, and had offered to list one of the parents on the official amended birth certificate. But Adar and Smith insisted both of them should be named. In a statement, Lambda Legal said it was disappointed in the court's discretion to stay out of the dispute. ""This decision leaves adopted children and their parents vulnerable in their interactions with officials from other states,"" said Kenneth Upton, a senior staff attorney with the group. ""More particularly, this decision leaves a child without an accurate birth certificate listing both his parents,"" Upton added. ""This issue now moves into the legislative arena. We need to push for a change in Louisiana state policy in order to stabilize and standardize respect for parent-child relationships for all adoptive children."" The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled in April that Adar and Smith could not file a federal civil rights claim under the Constitution's ""full faith and credit"" clause. That refers to Article IV, Section 1, which says states must respect the ""public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state."" The full 16-member court, in an 11-5 ruling, concluded the clause applies only to court actions, not those of state legislators or executive officials, and added that ""there is no legal basis on which to conclude that failure to issue a revised birth certificate denies 'recognition' to the New York adoption decree."" More importantly, the court said states have the power to make their own decisions about issuing birth certificates. ""Adoption is not a fundamental right,"" said the appeals court, citing studies that found marriage provides a more stable environment in which to raise children. ""Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children. ... Louisiana may rationally conclude that having parenthood focused on a married couple or single individual -- not on the freely severable relationship of unmarried partners -- furthers the interests of adopted children."" Tuesday's decision by the justices not to intervene is the final legal defeat for Adar and Smith on the certificate question, but does not affect their continuing custody of the boy. The case is Adar v. Smith, State Registrar (11-46).","The couple wants both their names listed on birth certificate .

"(CNN) -- Naomi Sims, one of the world's first black supermodels, has died at the age of 61 after a battle with breast cancer, according to her family. Naomi Sims became an icon of the ""Black is Beautiful"" movement with her modeling. Alex Erwiah, her brother-in-law, said Sims died Saturday in Newark, New Jersey. Sims was a teenager from Oxford, Mississippi, when she broke fashion industry color barriers on New York runways in 1967. She became an icon of the ""Black is Beautiful"" movement after she appeared on the cover of Ladies' Home Journal magazine in November 1968. She later graced the covers of Time, Cosmopolitan, McCall's, Life and many other magazines. Audrey Smaltz was a fashion editor at Ebony magazine when she became Sims' friend. ""She demanded attention,"" Smaltz said. ""She would walk into a room and people would come to a stop. People would go, 'Oh, my God, look at that person.' "" Essence: Images of Naomi Sims . Smaltz said Sims' success as a model ""started the whole whites accepting blacks,"" paving the way for others, including Beverly Johnson. ""They had so many fabulous black models in the '70s,"" Smaltz said. ""It was our heyday, and Naomi made that way for the rest of the girls to come along."" Sims quit modeling in 1973, saying she was bored and disenchanted with the use of racial quotas in the fashion industry. ""If they use you, it's because you're Black,"" she said in the biography posted on her personal Web site. Sims married in 1973 and soon gave birth to a son, Robert. She launched a successful wig collection targeted at African-American women in 1976, followed by a cosmetics line in 1986. Sims wrote several books focused on beauty, health and career advice for African-American women.","Naomi Sims was one of first black supermodels .

"Gaza (CNN) -- Israel late Saturday authorized an extension of the humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza for another 24 hours at the request of the United Nations, Israeli officials told CNN. But Hamas rejected a cease-fire extension, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said. ""Any humanitarian cease-fire that does not include the withdrawal of the occupation soldiers from Gaza borders and allowing citizens to return to their homes and evacuate casualties is unacceptable,"" he said. Prior to Hamas' rejection, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat also expressed concerns about occupation. ""I'm very, very worried,"" Erakat told CNN. ""We are witnessing the gradual reoccupation of Gaza."" The developments came as a tenuous cease-fire both parties agreed to earlier appeared to be shattered, with at least eight militant rockets again hurtling toward Israel as diplomats pushed for a longer truce in a conflict that has killed more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians. The Israeli Security Cabinet late Saturday agreed to extend the cease-fire, starting at 5 p.m. ET, on the condition that Israel Defense Forces continues dismantling and destroying militant tunnels from Gaza into Israel, according to senior Israeli officials. Lt. Col Peter Lerner, an IDF spokesman, told CNN that dozens of tunnels provided militants ""easy infiltration"" to carry out attacks against Israelis. ""We will do what it takes in order to stop this threat,"" he said. ""We have to take this threat off of the table."" Senior Israeli officials said IDF would ""act against any violations of the cease-fire"" during this period. The Cabinet was to reconvene Sunday to discuss the continuation of the military operation, the officials said. Israel had earlier agreed to extend the truce for four hours, but Hamas spokesman Abu Zuhri said there would be no extension. The original cease-fire started at 8 a.m. Saturday (1 a.m. ET). The temporary truce enabled Palestinians to move medical supplies into Gaza, families to emerge from shelters and people to dig the dead from piles of rubble. The prospect of an extension faded quickly as the IDF accused militants of exploiting the humanitarian window by firing at Israel for the second time, with three rockets hitting the Sha'ar HaNegev regional council. Earlier Saturday, moments after the cease-fire officially ended, another three mortars were fired from Gaza and hit Israel in the Eshkol regional council. No casualties or damage were reported. At about 4 p.m. ET, IDF said four rockets had been fired in the last hour: two were intercepted above Ashkelon, one was intercepted above the Shfela region and another came down in the Hof Ashkelon regional council. Residents back in harm's way? The IDF said many Gaza residents were returning to previously evacuated areas despite repeated warnings, placing themselves at risk. It said operations against the tunnel threat continued and defensive positions were being maintained. Israeli government officials told CNN that the United Nations has asked for a 24-hour humanitarian cease-fire extension. ""We owe to the people of both Israel and Gaza our renewed effort to consolidate this pause in fighting into a more sustainable ceasefire,"" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in statement, reiterating his call for seven-day humanitarian cease-fire. Palestinians found more than 100 bodies in areas that have been too dangerous to enter in recent days because of Israeli bombardment, Dr. Ashraf al-Qedra from the Gaza Ministry of Health told CNN. Nearly 1,050 Palestinians have been killed and about 6,000 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation, al-Qedra said. The IDF reported that two Israeli soldiers wounded in Gaza in the past week died on Saturday, bringing to 42 the number of Israeli troops killed in the current operation. The possibility of a longer truce seems to have passed, according to comments from the Hamas camp. ""There won't been any talks about extending the cease-fire as long as there aren't talks about breaking the siege,"" said Israa Al-Mudalal of the Gaza Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She accused Israel of ""escalating the situation"" in the so-called buffer zone and of not letting medical workers remove bodies in certain areas. ""We can't stop the firing (of rockets) until we have a real solution to this problem,"" she said. ""There will be no peace as long as the siege continues."" Two senior Hamas officials, Izzat Risheq and Jamal Nazal, told CNN that the truce negotiations were tense and difficult. In Paris on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and other diplomats pushed for an extended truce. He met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. The passions of the conflict, meanwhile, echoed across the world. About 40 protesters were arrested in Paris on Saturday when a banned pro-Palestinian demonstration turned violent, authorities said. Police brandished shields as they faced off with protesters in a cloud of tear gas at Place de la RÃ©publique, a busy pedestrian square in central Paris. Angry protesters hurled glass shards and rocks at police, set a small fire and smashed a bus shelter. 'There is no Eid' A CNN team visiting the hardest-hit areas in northern Gaza where many of the newly-discovered bodies were discovered saw entire blocks of buildings reduced to rubble. ""I wish this cease-fire had never happened,"" one man in Beit Hanoun told CNN, ""And I would have never found out my home is destroyed."" Another woman in Beit Hanoun meets a neighbor as she navigates her way through mounds of rubble and metal. ""Did you see my home?"" ""It's gone. Nothing is left,"" the neighbor responds. Families took advantage of the cease-fire to stock up on provisions. ""There are more people in the streets,"" said a mother of five in Khan Younis, who did not want to be named. ""People who were afraid before, go out now out of necessity. People with sick kids go to the hospital today. Buy Pampers today. Buy food today. I went to get bread for my family today."" She added, ""When my husband goes to the mosque to pray, I pray that he comes back. ... If someone killed a cat in America, people make a bigger deal about it than children dying in Gaza."" As the Muslim world prepared to celebrate the Eid holiday in two days, Gaza residents buried the dead. ""There is no Eid,"" the woman in Khan Younis said. ""In the Gaza Strip, it would be absurd for anyone to bake cookies."" Israel Defense Forces have accused militants of hiding weapons in shelters and schools and firing rockets at civilians. The IDF said it will keep working to ""locate and neutralize tunnels"" being used by militants during the cease-fire and will respond with force if militants target Israeli civilians or soldiers. Doctor: 'We are preparing ourselves for death' The bloodshed is pushing hospitals in Gaza to the limit. At South Gaza's European Hospital, the flood of bloodied children and adults has overwhelmed doctors. ""We sometimes work 20 hours continuous,"" Dr. Jamal Abu Hilal said. Doctors here say they're sick of stitching up bodies mutilated by shrapnel. ""We feel exhausted. We feel anxious. We feel depressed,"" Hilal's colleague Dr. Shadi said. In one room, surgeons worked on a child mangled by shrapnel. The rest of the boy's family was killed. ""Not even one square meter is safe in Gaza strip,"" Dr. Hassen al-Masri said. He, too, is afraid of dying in the conflict. The doctor carries his identification papers with him all the time, even while treating patients -- just in case. ""We are preparing ourselves for death."" Casualties mount in West Bank . The violence has also expanded to the West Bank. At least four Palestinians were killed in outbreaks of violence in several parts of the West Bank, according to medical sources. A 23-year-old man was shot near Huwara village outside Nablus by Jewish settlers, a doctor at the Rafidia Hospital said. The circumstances of his death are unclear, but it led to clashes between protesters and the Israeli military in which another man was killed, medical sources said. Two more men were killed during clashes with Israeli troops at a checkpoint north of Hebron in Beir Ummar in the West Bank, according to Palestinian medical sources. The violent protests came after the U.N. shelter in Gaza was hit, killing 16 people and wounding a couple hundred more -- most of them women and children. Video from the school showed chaos amid pools of blood. There were so many victims than many gurneys included two wounded children. The bloodshed left the U.N. Secretary-General exasperated. ""I am telling to the parties -- both Israelis and Hamas, Palestinians -- that it is morally wrong to kill your own people,"" Ban said. The ""whole world has been watching, is watching with great concern. You must stop fighting and enter into dialogue."" Americans fighting for Israel . Is Hamas using human shields in Gaza?

"(CNN) -- American Airlines has already called Alec Baldwin ""extremely rude,"" and now the actor isn't making any friends at Greyhound either. Baldwin was booted off an American Airlines flight Tuesday because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure, the airline said. The actor was apparently playing ""Words With Friends,"" a Scrabble-like online game. In a column published by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, Baldwin said a crew member singled him out during the incident. He also raged against flight attendants who ""have made flying a Greyhound bus experience."" That didn't sit well with Greyhound. In an open letter to the actor issued Thursday, Greyhound President and CEO Dave Leach said he was disheartened to hear about the comments Baldwin made about the company. ""I'm the first to admit that Greyhound has had some challenges in the past, so I understand that you probably were basing your comments on that alone. But we've made so many changes in recent years to significantly improve the travel experience,"" Leach writes. ""My guess is you've never traveled with us, but I ask you to give us a try for a number of reasons and see for yourself that we're really a great way to travel."" Leach then touts the hundreds of new buses the company has added to its fleet as well as the extra legroom, leather seats, power outlets and free Wi-Fi. ""I think you especially would find the latter two amenities exciting, because we don't require our customers to turn off their electronic devices ... ever. You could therefore play 'Words With Friends' during your entire trip and nobody would give you any grief over it,"" Leach tells Baldwin in the letter. He also reminds the actor that Greyhound carries more than 17 million travelers a year and asks Baldwin to become one of them. ""I invite you to meet with me in New York and we'll take a trip to Boston so you can see first-hand what a great ride Greyhound can be,"" Leach writes. ""We are not the same company we used to be. We are better, providing a safe, affordable and modern travel alternative to other forms of transportation. Greyhound is an American icon, a proud company that many people depend on to get them to their destinations, the same people who watch your films and TV show."" No word on whether Baldwin plans to take Leach up on his offer. The actor deactivated his Twitter account after the American Airlines incident.","Alec Baldwin: Flying has become ""a Greyhound bus experience""

"Washington (CNN) -- While stone carvers chisel new pieces to repair damage inflicted on the Washington National Cathedral by an earthquake last August, fundraisers say the cathedral's restoration fund is $18 million short of the repair cost. The cathedral, sometimes called ""the spiritual home for the nation,"" was perhaps the hardest-hit landmark in the capital when a magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck on August 23. The Gothic cathedral's three towers and the carved pinnacles and embellishments that decorate them were severely affected by the earthquake. ""The repair work, which includes intricate stone carving and detailed masonry, and will require significant scaffolding and large cranes to access the damaged areas, could be completed in five years if sufficient funds are raised immediately,"" the cathedral said in a news release. Carvers are fabricating new stones from blocks of limestone taken from the original quarries in Indiana, it said. A total of $2 million was raised over the past six months to cover the cost of stabilizing damaged stones and protection to allow the cathedral to reopen, it said. The total repair cost, initially estimated at $15 million, is now expected to be more than $20 million, leaving another $18 million to be raised, it said.","Carvers are making new stones from limestone blocks from an Indiana quarry .

"(CNN) -- Saying it is ""unfair for Florida taxpayers to subsidize drug addiction,"" Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday signed legislation requiring adults applying for welfare assistance to undergo drug screening. ""It's the right thing for taxpayers,"" Scott said after signing the measure. ""It's the right thing for citizens of this state that need public assistance. We don't want to waste tax dollars. And also, we want to give people an incentive to not use drugs."" Under the law, which takes effect on July 1, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services will be required to conduct the drug tests on adults applying to the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. The aid recipients would be responsible for the cost of the screening, which they would recoup in their assistance if they qualify. Those who fail the required drug testing may designate another individual to receive the benefits on behalf of their children. Shortly after the bill was signed, five Democrats from the state's congressional delegation issued a joint statement attacking the legislation, one calling it ""downright unconstitutional."" ""Governor Scott's new drug testing law is not only an affront to families in need and detrimental to our nation's ongoing economic recovery, it is downright unconstitutional,"" said Rep. Alcee Hastings. ""If Governor Scott wants to drug test recipients of TANF benefits, where does he draw the line? Are families receiving Medicaid, state emergency relief, or educational grants and loans next?"" Rep. Corrine Brown said the tests ""represent an extreme and illegal invasion of personal privacy."" ""Indeed, investigating people when there is probable cause to suspect they are abusing drugs is one thing,"" Brown said in the joint statement. ""But these tests amount to strip searching our state's most vulnerable residents merely because they rely on the government for financial support during these difficult economic times."" Joining in the statement denouncing the measure were Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor, Ted Deutch and Frederica Wilson. Controversy over the measure was heightened by Scott's past association with a company he co-founded that operates walk-in urgent care clinics in Florida and counts drug screening among the services it provides. In April, Scott, who had transferred his ownership interest in Solantic Corp. to a trust in his wife's name, said the company would not contract for state business, according to local media reports. He subsequently sold his majority stake in the company, local media reported. On May 18, the Florida Ethics Commission ruled that two conflict-of-interest complaints against Scott were legally insufficient to warrant investigation, and adopted an opinion that no ""prohibited conflict of interest"" existed. Also on Tuesday, Scott also signed a measure outlawing hallucinogenic designer drugs known as ""bath salts."" ""The chemical substances found in 'bath salts' constitute a significant threat to health and public safety,"" the governor's office said in a statement. ""Poison control centers in Florida have reported 61 calls of 'bath salts' abuse, making Florida the state with the second-highest volume of calls."" The drugs ""are readily available at convenience stores, discount tobacco outlets, gas stations, pawnshops, tattoo parlors, and truck stops, among other locations,"" the governor's office said.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- Oilfield contractor Halliburton has agreed to pay Nigeria $35 million to settle bribery allegations that led to charges against former Vice President Dick Cheney and other executives, the company announced Tuesday. Cheney, who was Halliburton's CEO in the 1990s, and nine others were charged with conspiracy and ""distribution of gratification to public officials"" in a long-running case involving the company and its Kellogg, Brown and Root subsidiary. Nigerian officials accused the company of paying bribes to secure $6 billion worth of contracts for a liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta. ""Pursuant to this agreement, all lawsuits and charges against KBR and Halliburton corporate entities and associated persons have been withdrawn,"" the company announced in a statement Tuesday evening. Nigerian officials agreed ""not to bring any further criminal charges or civil claims against those entities or persons"" in return, the company said. The $35 million includes $2.5 million to pay legal fees and other expenses for the Nigerian government, Halliburton said. There was no immediate comment from Nigerian officials to the news. Halliburton also agreed tp help Nigeria recover money from a Swiss bank account set up by a former agent for its Nigerian joint venture TSKJ, the company said. Nigerian officials said as much as $130 million had been stashed in Switzerland. The bribes are said to have amounted to $180 million between 1994 and 2004. The settlement announced Tuesday is far smaller than the $120 million a spokesman for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission cited as a possible fine last week. An attorney for Cheney, who left office in 2009, said there was no reason to suspect the former vice president was guilty of any wrongdoing. ""The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated that joint venture extensively and found no suggestion of any impropriety by Dick Cheney in his role of CEO of Halliburton,"" Terrence O'Connell said. Halliburton pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges in the United States last year and paid a $402 million criminal fine, the U.S. Justice Department said. KBR and Halliburton also paid $177 million to settle civil complaints related to the bribery, the Justice Department said. Many observers in Nigeria regarded the charges as a publicity stunt by the financial crimes commission ahead of national elections in April and as a symbolic effort to display resolve against government corruption. The agency has had limited success in getting successful prosecutions and hasn't charged any high-profile people since its top commissioner was removed from the body in 2007.","The allegations date back to the 1990s, when Cheney was Halliburton's CEO .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- This presidential election tells us something unexpected about American politics. For all the talk about polarization and discord in Washington, it appears that both parties will have pragmatic problem-solvers at the top of their tickets. Democrats have accepted four more years with a pragmatist. President Barack Obama has consistently been willing to anger members of his own party by reaching out to Republicans and often embracing their issues, such as deficit reduction. Rather than a fighting for an ideological agenda, he has instead focused on one problem at a time and accepted the constraints that he faces. Republicans are settling on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who has spent much of his career avoiding ideological purity. By all accounts, one of his virtues as a leader has been his eagerness to delve into difficult problems and his willingness to experiment when trying to find solutions. As everyone knows, he has shifted his positions on matters such as stem cell research and as governor he was willing to put forward an ambitious health care plan that expanded government by using a conservative idea, the individual mandate. Some pundits will read the decision to support these candidates as continued evidence of party loyalty. In the case of Obama, there were no Democrats who decided that they would challenge him in the primary because they wanted to avoid the kind of turmoil that occurred when Sen. Ted Kennedy ran against President Jimmy Carter from the left in 1980. In the case of Romney, the Republican hatred of Obama is so great that the party is willing to compromise on a candidate whose politics are hard to pin down but who stands a better chance of winning in November. Yet another way to read these decisions is that, at some level, voters are genuinely angry about the polarized status quo in Washington. They are willing to support pragmatic problem-solvers because, at some level, they find it appealing to elect politicians who could overcome the deeply dysfunctional government we have. There is some evidence to support this claim. In ""Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America,"" Morris Fiorina argued that polarization was much stronger among political elites that it was in the broader electorate. His examination of poll data revealed that on many controversial issues such as abortion or gay rights, most Americans tended to be in the middle of the political landscape. Second, the approval ratings of Congress also suggest that citizens are unhappy with polarization. Approval ratings for Congress are at about 12.5%, a historic low. When such a large number of Americans indicate that they don't approve of the institution, they are registering their complaints about the gridlock in Congress. Even though most Americans continue to vote for incumbents in their districts, they don't like the institution as a whole. Finally, for all the talk about polarization, when it comes to electing presidents, voters have tended to go for the people who promise to reach out across the aisle. In 2008, Obama ran as the candidate who appealed to both sides of the political spectrum and who contrasted himself with the fierce partisanship of the Republican side. In 2000, George W. Bush ran as the compassionate conservative who was willing to use government on behalf of some causes, and in 2004 he avoided some of the more divisive issues by emphasizing national security as his unifying issue. In 1992, voters went for Bill Clinton, a proud pragmatist who wanted to move beyond the orthodoxies of the 1960s. Clinton was part of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that sought to move his party toward the center. Clinton doubled down on this theme in 1996 as he leaned to the right following the Republican takeover of Congress, and he defeated Sen. Robert Dole by landslide. The emerging contest between Romney and Obama thus provides more evidence that there is still room to move beyond Washington's bitter partisan stalemates. When politicians yell and fight, they capture the attention of the television cameras but the public is not always with them. As this upcoming contest reveals, there is still a yearning in the electorate for a different kind of politics in Washington. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Washington (CNN) -- For overweight Americans, and those looking for a healthier lifestyle, the claim was almost too good to be true -- wear Skechers Shape-ups footwear and watch the pounds melt away. At a news conference Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission said the shoemaker's claims weren't true and alleged Skechers violated federal law by misleading consumers. According to the FTC, Skechers agreed to pay a hefty $40 million fine to settle charges the California-based company deceived consumers by making ""unfounded claims that Shape-ups would help people lose weight, and strengthen and tone their buttocks, legs and abdominal muscles."" The company enlisted high-profile celebrities Kim Kardashian and Brooke Burke to sell the shoes. Besides Shape-ups, Skechers also made deceptive claims about other products including Resistance Runner, Toners and Tone-up shoes, the FTC alleges. ""Skechers' unfounded claims went beyond stronger and more toned muscles. The company even made claims about weight loss and cardiovascular health,"" said David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. As part of the settlement, customers who bought Skechers ""toning"" shoes will be eligible for refunds either directly from the FTC or through a court-approved class-action lawsuit, officials said. Wednesday's announcement was the culmination of a months-long investigation involving the FTC and attorneys general from 44 states and the District of Columbia. FTC officials highlighted a Skechers television ad featuring the endorsement of chiropractor Dr. Steven Gautreau. In the ad, Gautreau cited an ""independent"" clinical study he conducted testing the shoes' benefits. The FTC said the study results Gautreau promoted weren't factual, and alleged the company hid the fact that Gautreau is married to a Skechers marketing executive. The FTC also said Gautreau was compensated for his endorsement, which wasn't made clear in the commercial. Skechers introduced Shape-ups in 2009, and sales peaked a year later. The FTC called Skechers an industry leader in the booming business of toning footwear. Estimated sales were close to $1 billion industrywide in 2010, the FTC said. The toning shoes Skechers sold cost between $60 and $100 a pair. As part of an expensive campaign to promote the fitness benefits of Shape-ups, the company unveiled a scantly dressed Kim Kardashian peddling the shoes during the Super Bowl in 2011. Brooke Burke's ads claimed the shoes would help improve her cousin's posture, mother's legs and give her brother a tighter core. Additionally, Burke's ad told consumers ""the newest way to burn calories and tone and strengthen muscles was to tie their Shape-up shoe laces,"" the FTC said. ""The FTC's message, for Skechers and other national advertisers, is to shape up your substantiation or tone down your claims,"" Vladeck said. Under the FTC's settlement, the company is barred from any advertising making similar claims unless it's backed up by scientific evidence. What Skechers plans to do with the Shape-ups brand remains to be seen. An ad featuring Burke touting ""the next generation of Shape-ups"" remained on the company's website Wednesday morning. According to the FTC, the commission files a complaint when it has ""reason to believe"" that the law has been or is being violated. The FTC says despite Skechers agreement to pay a fine, the complaint is not a court ruling or an admission that the company violated any law.","FTC official: Skechers' claims ""went beyond stronger and more toned muscles""

"(AOL Autos) -- Imagine this: It's a gorgeous spring day in Miami and you're thoroughly tempted to lower the top of your rental car and push the power pedal a little too hard in a bid to break free from the traffic crush on the Palmetto. But, though there may not seem to be a heavy police presence on the freeways on this particular day, you can be pretty sure that someone up in the sky is keeping a close eye on speeding vacationers and the massive traffic tailbacks they're trying to avoid. Welcome to Florida and aviation law enforcement from the state's Highway Patrol. It's one of the few states in the U.S. that employs aircraft to monitor speeders, reckless drivers and, sometimes, soon-to-be felons fleeing a police pursuit (Nevada and Minnesota are among a dozen others). And if you never quite realized what those strange white lines along the side of the highway mean, well, now you will. Flight Captain Matt Walker, the Florida Highway Patrol's chief pilot, says his job primarily involves monitoring motorists' speed between these painted white lines, which are placed a quarter-mile apart in frequent intervals. How it works . Surprisingly, aviation enforcement doesn't involve radar: it's a straightforward stopwatch time over distance equation that allows a pilot to work out whether a driver has broken the speed limit. Captain Walker, having clocked a motorist driving too fast, then radios the speeding car's information to a waiting state trooper, or ground unit, who stops the car and issues a citation. AOL Autos: How to avoid a speeding ticket . That is, if the driver stops. Sometimes, Walker says, they don't, a felony offense. But this is where aviation enforcement really comes into its own. In certain cases, rather than pursuing a fleeing motorist, which can be dangerous for all involved, an order will be given for the troopers to stand down but the pilot will still pursue the driver. Occasionally, the driver will head home, or even go shopping, completely unaware that his movements have been tracked from the air. Planes, after all, operate much more quietly than the helicopters often employed in other states in such pursuits. When the driver is quickly apprehended on the ground, usually they're shocked to hear they'd been tracked from high above. ""The troopers will back off and we'll follow the vehicle,"" Walker said. ""When the person doesn't see the troopers' lights, he'll pull off and stop or he'll drive to his house. And as he's going into his house, the troopers are coming around the corner. ""It takes the fleeing portion out of the pursuit. Sometimes he'll still drive recklessly but the majority of the time he'll operate within speed limits if he thinks nobody is chasing him."" AOL Autos: Caught at 100 mph -- now what? Walker says that a fleet of seven Cessna fixed-wing aircraft operates in the skies above Florida. The combined fleet delivers some 45,000 citations on average each year, and speed will be a factor in about 38,000 of these citations. The rest of the citations are made up of secondary factors, if the driver is drunk or not wearing a seatbelt, for example, or is driving on a suspended license. He says about 150 arrests are made each year where a pilot has spotted a clearly impaired driver, and aircraft enforcement results in the recovery of about 50 stolen vehicles annually. AOL Autos: Worst states for drunk driving . ""The primary use of aircraft is for traffic enforcement,"" Walker said. ""The pilot has a stopwatch and observes traffic going down the roadway. He activates the stopwatch on the first line and calculates the average speed over the quarter mile. AOL Autos: How police catch you speeding . ""We'll say, 'the vehicle is a red pickup truck in the inside lane, number 5 behind you, off to your left now, now he's number 1. The trooper looks out his window and will pull in behind that vehicle. We confirm the time and speed and the pilot will return to the lines and do it over again."" Impact of weather . The most challenging days for Walker and his team of pilots are busy holidays with heavy traffic and when the weather takes a turn for the worse. He says in those situations, or when a storm is looming, the fleet will be grounded. ""We do not fly in inclement weather,"" he says. Walker, who was born and raised in Florida, says that any prospective pilot must have logged at least one year as a regular state trooper and 500 hours of flight time and gained a commercial or instrument rating. He says many pilots were former civilian fliers who paid for their lessons out of their own pocket, although they can gain the qualification when they're going through the police training academy. Walker was a trooper for five years before he took to the skies, and now spends about five hours a day in the air. He also has to testify in court should a motorist decide to challenge a citation. David Haenel, a defense lawyer at fightyourticket.com, has gotten to know many of the FHP pilots well in his long career fighting speeding tickets in Florida courts. He says he has won many cases challenging the basic equipment used to issue a citation -- including radio and the three stopwatches that pilots may use to clock a vehicle -- and discrepancies in the timing of an issued ticket. AOL Autos: How to fight a speeding ticket . He says that a pilot must prove that their stopwatches -- which must be of a certain brand -- have been calibrated in the last six months. He says a description of the car, its time and its speed must be written on the ticket, and that the citation's reliability must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Which means that if there is a discrepancy between the time a pilot says he contacted the trooper and the time the trooper wrote on the ticket, even by a minute, Haenel has grounds to get the citation dismissed. ""First and foremost typically a client will tell me, 'I didn't see the plane in the air',"" Haenel said. ""But I want to know the locations of where the lines are, if the ticket is written in the appropriate venue [or county] if the troopers come from different stations, if the ticket is valid on its face."" ""Every inconsistency goes in the benefit of the driver. The time on the citation is usually the most critical. If the pilot says 3.59, but the ticket's at 3.58, or 4.01, sometimes I don't even take these to trial."" Tread warily the next time you're tempted to put your foot down in Florida. You never know who might be watching. Or from where.","A few states in the U.S. use aircraft to monitor speeders, reckless drivers .

"(CNN) -- Some fashionistas will look to the runway for inspiration as Mercedes Benz Fashion Week kicks off in New York this week. Others will simply turn on the TV. Characters' wardrobes have been used to dictate more than just a setting or a character's frame of mind arguably since Patricia Field transformed HBO's ""Sex and the City"" into a live-action fashion magazine in the '90s. But as many of the notable costume designers making their mark on fall TV will tell you, clothes and accessories have always played an integral part in the storytelling process. Jill Ohanneson outfits the cast of ABC's ""Revenge"" with more than 20 years under her undoubtedly stylish belts. Ohanneson says the key to costuming the Hamptons-set drama, which follows Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) as she takes vengeance on the people who destroyed her family, is sticking to pieces that are ""simple yet elegant."" ""The clothes are really important because it shows we're not in New York (City). It shows that we're not in the South. We're not in San Francisco,"" Ohanneson said. ""What I try to do is really place us in that particular world. That world of leisure. You know, 'Am I going to go golfing today? Am I going to go sailing today?' "" So despite what Ohanneson is drawn to on the runway, she'll stick to pieces that make sense for the show and on each actor's body. ""I will always end up pulling from runways or collections what works for my actors versus what the trend is at the moment,"" she said. ""If my actor cannot wear that great dropped-waist dress that's happening out there right now for summer, I can't put it on her. ... I wouldn't want to send her onto the set in something that's not flattering."" Viewers will be well into fall by the time ""Revenge's"" second season premieres on September 30. On-screen, however, summer will just be underway. That's one reason Ohanneson stocks the wardrobe in the months leading up to production, while the weather is still warm. ""We're going to probably film summer up until, I'd say Christmas. ... Throughout the (TV) season, there are some designers I can work with that I know keep a summary feel,"" she said, adding she often dresses the youngest Grayson, Charlotte (Christa B. Allen), in Nanette Lepore and Trina Turk. What else can fans expect to see? ""Not necessarily the color block, but the mixing of solids and patterns,"" Ohanneson said. ""Textures are really important, as well as the bright colors, which work well for summer in the Hamptons."" But not every character will be rocking feel-good hues. There's ""trouble in paradise"" as the season premieres, she said, and viewers can expect to see that reflected in the color palette. Even Emily, who Ohanneson routinely dressed in ""spotless white"" last season to embody ""the ultimate Hamptons princess,"" might be wearing more tans, grays and denim blues. ""(I'm) keeping that darker layer on top so that it's almost an emotional layer between her and the rest of the world,"" she said. Rarely dressed in white is Ashley Davenport, played by British actress Ashley Madekwe. Madekwe, who writes about fashion on her personal blog, told CNN, ""We try to make it clear that (my character is) not from the Hamptons. She's a London girl who then moved to New York, who now works in the Hamptons. I think we try to give her a little bit more edge. I'm very anti-beach attire, so there's never any of that."" And though Madekwe admires some of the pieces in Ashley Davenport's closet, she said she would never wear them off set. ""It's bad enough we have the same name, I don't want to be wearing the same clothes, as well,"" she said. And then there's the fact that her character is ""far preppier than I am, because she has a job that kind of links her to the corporate world in some capacity and I don't."" Madekwe's character will continue to be the trendiest of all the Hamptonites on ""Revenge,"" but her style is certainly evolving. Having been hired by Conrad Grayson at the end of last season, the actress said Ashley Davenport will pick up some higher-end pieces to reflect her new paychecks. ""I have my eyes on (Proenza Schouler's) PS11 (for Ashley) because it's kind of firm. It's almost work oriented, but it comes in so many bright colors that it's also edgy,"" she said told CNN before ""Revenge"" started filming its second season. The PS11, with a price tag of more than $1,000, didn't make it on the show. Instead, Madekwe and costume designer Ohanneson settled on a Mulberry bag for the character. And just as much thought goes into the male characters' outfits. Fan favorite Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann) showed up in the pilot episode -- costumed by Marie-Sylvie Deveau -- wearing a sailor cap and whale-printed pants. As the purveyor of the whale cam, Nolan's sea creature-themed wardrobe was merely a coincidence, said Ohanneson, who took over as costume designer by the series' second episode. ""That's kind of his idea of, 'Yeah, I'm wearing the cool, preppy stuff.' But he doesn't quite get it right,"" Ohanneson added. ""We wanted to keep quirkiness to him,"" she said. ""Keep an eccentricity to him, but not make him a caricature. ... Now that he's been spending more time around the Hamptons, he might start to pick up more information about how stuff fits."" Madeleine Stowe's character Victoria, whose plane crashed at the end of the first season finale, will also dress differently this season. That is, if she's to return. Like Emily, Victoria would dress ""a little bit darker,"" which works because ""(Stowe) can wear black and dark red like nobody else I know,"" Ohanneson said. Though, the quality and quantity of the Grayson matriarch's wardrobe will likely remain unchanged. ""In some of these episodes, both Emily and Victoria have, like, 10 changes each,"" Ohanneson said. ""So if I'm dealing with dresses that are $3,000, for two characters that's $60,000 just for those."" That's why it's sometimes advantageous for Ohanneson to dress the characters in separates. And, of course, hold onto jeans, slacks and skirts that can be worn again or transformed. Modifying garments is key. ""We end up dropping a lot of necklines, if a neckline is too high for somebody,"" Ohanneson said. ""I have an incredible cutter-fitter who will take a dress we know is a perfect silhouette for Victoria, and we will make it up in a couple of different colors and different fabrications, and change the necklines and sleeve lengths."" Needles and thread come out a lot, actress Madekwe said, noting, a lot of work goes into making sure everything fits perfectly. ""(Ohanneson) likes making something (into) something new,"" she said. ""We've turned dresses into tops. If she loves something, especially with the summer clothes going out of the stores, she'll buy it in whatever size is available, and then she'll cut it down to fit me."" So what's Madekwe excited to don this season? ""There's a Prada dress I'm really looking forward to wearing. A L'Wren Scott yellow number that I'm really looking forward to wearing,"" she said. ""There has to be an occasion. ... But there'll always be a Hamptons cocktail party.""","Costume designer Jill Ohanneson outfits the cast of ABC's ""Revenge""

"(CNN) -- Last month, thousands of people in Saudi Arabia opened up their newspapers to find a full-page picture of a woman with a black eye clearly visible underneath her burqa. Below the image ran the slogan in Arabic, ""Some things can't be covered"", and a list of phone numbers for local domestic abuse shelters. In a culture that tends to turn a blind eye to the issue of violence towards women, it was a shocking and powerful image. ""It's a problem that's been swept under the carpet for years,"" says Scott Abbott, the creative director for Memac Ogilvy, the Riyadh-based agency responsible for the advert. When Ogilvy approached the King Khalid Foundation, a charity that focuses on issues of advocacy and developing the country's non-profit sector, they weren't sure what type of reaction to expect. ""I think that there was always a real concern that, given the subject matter, it would never get through,"" says Abbott. A major push came from Saudi princess HRH Banderi A.R. Al Faisal, the foundation's director. Though the campaign has captured the public's attention, both within Saudi and abroad, where an English version has made the rounds online, Al Faisal says she doesn't see the ad as shocking. ""My media and PR team were a bit nervous going into this, saying, 'Are you sure you want to do this?'"" she admits. ""I didn't understand why. I don't understand what is so controversial. Who will say, 'Yes, it's ok for women to be beaten up'?"" Read more: Women directors find acclaim worldwide . Saudi women are legally reliant on the permission of their male guardians to travel freely, driving is still a socially contentious issue and there are no laws that protect victims of domestic abuse. According to Al Faisal, however, change is in the air. ""For several years, domestic abuse was sort of the elephant in the room. There was nowhere for a woman to go if she was abused because a system wasn't set up to handle that,"" she admits. Though the issue is still not completely out in the open, she notes the last few years has seen a rise in shelters that cater to female victims of violence. It has been a watershed year for women's rights in the conservative country. So far, women have been accepted into the government's advisory Shura Council, given the right to vote, gained entry into a range of new professions (including engineering and law) and granted permission to have their own IDs without guardian permission. Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, admits that though these measures are impressive, more needs to be done to protect women inside the country. ""There are no laws that protect women specifically. If, for example, a woman claims rape, and a man says it was consensual, she can face a counter charge of adultery,"" he says. Though there is currently no law that punishes a man for beating his wife, the King Khalid Foundation has prepared legislation that would do just that. In fact, it is the pending bill, which would decide the punitive measures abusers could face (a mix of imprisonment, financial restitution and loss of custody), that spurred the campaign to begin with. Last year, the Shura Council pushed through similar legislation the foundation helped pen protecting the rights of children in abusive situations. Al Faisal is confident that the drafted legislation will meet with the same level of success. Read more: The Saudi museum with more Facebook likes than the Louvre . Coogle, however, says that Saudi still needs to overcome considerable social hurdles before the situation improves. ""Women who speak out about emotional abuse or neglect often face societal judgments. There is a prevalent attitude that if a man hits his wife, it's acceptable, because she's not being a good wife."" Coogle points to a ten year old study in the Journal of Muslim Affairs where Saudi men were polled on whether they ever hit their wives -- 53% answered yes. Al Faisal agrees that the Saudi mindset has to change and notes that a major obstacle is the naturally guarded nature of the culture. ""This is a very private society, and we tend to try to deal with things discreetly. We do not air our dirty laundry in public, as families or as communities,"" she says. ""The negative side of that discretion is that it allows abusive behavior to thrive, because it is not stopped."" A main goal of the campaign is to create a countrywide social dialogue. In that regard, says Abbott, the campaign has been successful. ""Outside of the two days of ads we ran, it's been printed on the front page of national newspapers,"" he says. ""People are talking about it, and it's been largely well-received.""","Saudi Arabia has launched its first anti-domestic abuse ad campaign .
Domestic abuse is not currently criminalized in Saudi Arabia, and there are no laws protecting women from violence .
The King Khalid Foundation has timed the campaign to push an anti-abuse law it drafted last year ."
"(CNN) -- A total of 142 deaths have been reported from the Ebola outbreak in Guinea and Liberia, the World Health Organization said. The virus is still limited to the two nations, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, despite rumors of it spreading to other countries. Nineteen suspected cases reported in Sierra Leone tested negative for the virus, it said. In a statement on its website, WHO said Guinea has reported a total of 208 clinical cases of Ebola, including 136 deaths. Liberia has reported 34 cases, including six deaths. Ebola is one of the world's deadliest viruses and kills up to 90% of those infected. It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain, often accompanied by bleeding. It's the first emergence of Ebola in western Africa, which means doctors and health officials in the region don't have any experience with the virus. The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has called the outbreak unprecedented because previous cases have been limited to a small area.

"(CNN) -- Know your caucuses from your primaries? Your superdelegates from your Super PACs? As Republican presidential hopefuls battle to win the right to take on Barack Obama in November, we've defined the array of words and acronyms that will define this year's election. Attack ads -- An ad that promotes another candidate's perceived weakness, rather than the good qualities of the candidate the ad wants you to vote for. Battleground states -- Both sides concentrate their efforts on those states they want to keep from falling into the other's hands, and those they think they could take from the other party. States seen as safe will not see an influx of candidates or cash, as the White House hopefuls consider it better to spend their time and money in the battleground states. This time round, Florida -- center of the controversial 2000 election -- will again be a key state, as will Ohio and Pennsylvania. Blue state -- Traditionally a Democratic-controlled state. Caucus -- Local party members get together for an evening of debate before deciding who they will support for their party's presidential nomination. The process is open for all to see and takes place in someone's home or a town hall rather than a voting booth. Debates -- Debates are held between the Democratic nominees, the Republican nominees, as well as in the presidential campaign between the Democratic and Republican candidates. Rules for answering and the format of the debate are laid down in advance, taking much of the spontaneity out of the debate. But they are still seen as important to the race, and each candidate's performance -- best answer, worst answer, even appearance -- is analyzed in the media for days after. The candidates for vice president typically have their own face-off. Delegate -- A person chosen at local level to represent the state at the party's National Convention. They are there to support a particular candidate based on the results of the state primary or caucus. Electoral College -- The Electoral College was created in the early years of the United States. Each state has a number of Electoral College votes depending on its population. California has 55, while a number of smaller states have only three. With the exception of Nebraska and Maine, all electoral votes are cast for the candidate that wins the state, no matter what the margin. A presidential candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to win the election. The system can mean a candidate wins the popular vote but does not win the election. Endorsements -- Come in three types: From celebrities, from newspapers and from political figures and organizations. Whether any endorsement sways voter opinion is debatable but all candidates fight hard behind the scenes to earn them. In this election, notable endorsements have included House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and business magnate Donald Trump coming out for Republican candidate Mitt Romney, and actor Chuck Norris endorsing Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. When newspapers give an endorsement, they usually do it in the form of an editorial in support of their candidate. FEC -- Federal Election Commission enforces U.S. federal election law, discloses campaign finance information and oversees public funding of presidential elections. Favorite son -- A politician winning support in a state because of connections to that state such as being born there or having held public office there. GOP -- Grand Old Party, nickname of the Republican Party. Magic Number -- The number of Electoral College votes a candidate needs in the general election, and the number of delegates a nominee needs in the primary process. In the general election, state wins translate into Electoral College votes based on the state's population. A candidate needs 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. In the nominating process, Republicans need 1,144 delegates and each state has its own rules on whether they are assigned as a proportion of the number of votes received or if they all go to the winner of the state vote. Democratic candidates need 2,025 delegates, usually earned as a proportion of state votes, but this time round there is no challenge to incumbent President Barack Obama. Party national conventions -- A gathering of the party faithful to formally select the presidential and vice presidential candidates. Involves state delegations standing around a state banner and announcing that they come from ""the great state of..."" This year, the Democrats have their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina from September 3-6; the Republicans will have theirs in Tampa, Florida from August 27-30. Primary -- Primaries are generally only open to party members. Democrats and Republicans vote for the candidate they want to be their party's presidential candidate. Republican and Democratic primaries do not have to be held on the same day. Purple state -- A state that regularly swings from one party to the other. Push polling -- Similar to an attack ad but disguised as opinion polling. During the course of the poll questions, spurious information or disinformation about a candidate will be mentioned to those being surveyed. Red state -- Traditionally a Republican-controlled state. Stump speech -- A stump speech is the candidate's form speech in which he mentions key policies, family background and asks for citizens' votes. It is generally repeated in the same form in state after state, county after county, with only minor tweaks for each venue. Super Tuesday -- Super Tuesday is the biggest single day of the Republican presidential nomination process. This year, 10 states choose their Republican candidate for president, including Ohio, Massachusetts, and Virginia. More than 400 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday, which takes place on March 6. Superdelegate -- Members of the party hierarchy with an individual vote at the National Convention on who the candidate will be. Their vote does not have to reflect any primary result, or the popular vote of the party. They can pledge support to one candidate and then change their mind later. Super PACs -- A controversial 2010 court decision swept away restrictions on the amount of money corporations can donate to political action committees (PACs). In the wake of the ruling, a new breed of PACs called Super PACs were formed that can receive unlimited contributions from corporations and unions to use to advocate for or against a candidate. While they are banned from coordinating their efforts with candidates, some Super PACs are run by their former aides or close associates. Super PACs spent $390 million in the 2010 elections and are expected to spend much more in the upcoming elections. Tea Party -- A conservative, Republican-leaning political movement inspired by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, when colonists protested a British tax on tea by boarding ships in Boston Harbor and dumping tea overboard. The modern movement sprang up in 2009 as a protest over an Obama-backed $787 billion government stimulus package, and says it opposes excessive taxes and big government, and supports a strict adherence to the U.S. Constitution and to federal spending reductions. A number of Tea Party-backed candidates won political office in 2010. Wedge issue -- A key issue used by one or both parties to show clear differences between the two parties or candidates. Wedge issues are often raised to get each party's ""base"" supporters out to vote. The abortion issue is used to get out supporters of a woman's right to choose, and supporters of the unborn child's right to life. Gun control is a wedge issue generally separating Democrats who often support stricter gun control legislation from Republicans who are generally against gun-control legislation.","CNN defines the terms and buzzwords of the 2012 U.S. presidential election .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- At least 13 people were killed and 26 more were injured when a five-story residential building collapsed in the Indian financial hub of Mumbai early Friday, a hospital spokesman said. Dozens of people are feared to be trapped in the wreckage of the region's latest building disaster. ""It's a pancake collapse,"" said Sachidanand Gawde, deputy commandant at the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). ""The exact number of those trapped under the debris is not known,"" he said. Forty-four people had been pulled from the debris as of Friday, including the deceased, Gawde said. One of the survivors is an 11-year-old girl who was heard shouting from inside the rubble that she was alive. ""There is a lot of chaos here, but my boys are closely monitoring any noises or movement from under the debris that can lead us to people trapped inside,"" Gawde said. ""We are using latest rescue techniques so that maximum number of lives could be saved."" Around 40 people are feared to be buried in the rubble, CNN's sister network IBN reported, citing the disaster officials. The building, an old construction in southern Mumbai, gave way around 6 a.m. Friday. Fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene to carry out rescue efforts, Gawde said. The first floor of the building was rented out to a decorating firm, but about 22 apartments were occupied on the upper four floors, said Sitaram Kunte, the commissioner of Brihanmumbai Municipal Council, which owns the building. A spokesman for the council said a notice was issued in April regarding major structural issues with the building. It underwent renovations at that time, and further repairs were scheduled, spokesman Vijay Khabale Patil said. The residents were made aware of the situation, but continued to live in the building, he said. Several buildings in the Mumbai area have crumbled this year, one of them with disastrous consequences. In April, scores of people were killed in the collapse of an illegal multistory building in Thane, a city in the Mumbai region. Deadly collapses have occurred in the city in past years, as well. Housing rights groups say many old buildings in the city are rundown and neglected, while newer ones are often built using substandard materials and have structural problems. People live in them because they don't have a choice -- in Mumbai, demand for housing far exceeds supply. About 65% of the population is estimated to live in slums, the groups say. CNN's Lonzo Cook in New Delhi contributed to this report.","The death toll rises to 13, a hospital spokesman says .

"Gaza (CNN) -- Angry clashes erupted Friday in the West Bank, after Palestinian leaders called for a ""day of rage"" in response to the shelling of a United Nations shelter that killed 16 people. At least four Palestinians were killed in outbreaks of violence in several parts of the West Bank, according to medical sources. The call for a massive follow-up to what were already some of the largest West Bank protests in years came as diplomats scrambled to find a cease-fire proposal that would satisfy mortal enemies Israel and Hamas and end more than two weeks of violence that has claimed more than 800 lives, most of them civilians. The developments come as Israel and Hamas agreed to a 12-hour humanitarian cease-fire beginning Saturday morning. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that Israel agreed to a cease-fire, a U.S. official told CNN. The official, who is traveling with Kerry, spoke on condition anonymity. The news was first reported by Reuters and Agence France Presse. Hamas also agreed to the cease-fire, according to a statement released by senior Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri. There were questions whether the temporary truce would hold given that a previous Egyptian-backed cease-fire earlier this month collapsed. Israel's military warned militants against targeting its soldiers and civilians during the 12-hour period it would respond, saying it would respond. During the cease-fire, Israel Defense Forces says it will continue working to ""locate and neutralize tunnels"" being used by militants. The cease-fire agreement came hours after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the cease-fire, with the hopes it would be extended to seven days, while diplomats work to broker an end to the bloodshed. The cease-fire talks are playing out against a backdrop of mounting casualties. At least 864 people have been killed and more than 5,700 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation on Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Friday. An Israeli military representative said Friday that another soldier had been killed in Gaza, bringing the total number of Israelis killed to 36 -- 33 soldiers and three civilians. A 23-year-old man was shot near Huwara village outside Nablus by Jewish settlers, a doctor at the Rafidia Hospital said. The circumstances of his death are unclear, but it led to clashes between protesters and the Israeli military in which another man was killed, medical sources said. Two more men were killed during clashes with Israeli troops at a checkpoint north of Hebron in Beir Ummar in the West Bank, according to Palestinian medical sources. A pro-Hamas demonstration in Ramallah drew a crowd of several hundred, and a protest march toward a Jewish settlement led to heavy clashes with the Israel Defense Forces and border police. Several people were injured, a CNN crew at the scene said. The IDF confirmed one Israeli soldier was killed and several were wounded Friday in Gaza, when militants fired mortars and anti-tank missiles. It also confirmed one of its soldiers, Sgt. Oron Shaul, was killed in battle in Gaza on Sunday. Hamas had said it was holding Shaul after capturing him in an ambush on an armored personnel Sunday in which six other IDF soldiers died. A committee led by the chief rabbi of the IDF concluded that he should be defined as ""a soldier killed in action whose burial site is unknown,"" an IDF statement said. Diplomatic moves . Meanwhile, the Americans were taking the lead on drafting an agreement with Israel and the Palestinians on a one-week humanitarian cease-fire starting Sunday, several diplomatic sources told CNN on Friday. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is the main Palestinian party to the agreement and has been the lead in discussions that include the United States, Egypt and Israel. At one point, the United States and Egypt were said to be close on an agreement with Israel and the Palestinians on the one-week cease-fire proposal, several diplomatic sources told CNN on Friday. But Kerry told reporters Friday that no final proposal was submitted to Israel for a vote. ""We still have some more things to do over the course of ... 24 to 48 hours,"" Kerry said, adding that he would travel to Paris on Saturday, where he will continue to press for a deal. If the temporary 12-hour humanitarian truce holds, it will be used to get medical supplies into Gaza, and the injured and some of the dead bodies out -- with the hope that the parties can enter formal negotiations on a more permanent cease-fire that addresses economic, political and security concerns about Gaza, with other nations involved. Palestinian Parliament Member Mustafa Barghouti told CNN Hamas will comply with the terms of the temporary cease-fire. ""Of course, they will,"" Barghouti said during an interview that aired Friday on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. ""Not only Hamas but all Palestinians."" Americans fighting for Israel . U.N. shelter hit . The word of a temporary truce follows violent protests in the West Bank and Gaza, prompted after the U.N. shelter in Gaza was hit, killing 16 people and wounding a couple hundred more -- most of them women and children. Video from the school showed chaos amid pools of blood. There were so many victims than many gurneys included two wounded children. One father carried his small daughter into a hospital. There wasn't much he could do but try to comfort his little girl as she cried and begged for him not to leave her. The bloodshed left the U.N. chief, Ban, exasperated. ""I am telling to the parties -- both Israelis and Hamas, Palestinians -- that it is morally wrong to kill your own people,"" Ban said. The ""whole world has been watching, is watching with great concern. You must stop fighting and enter into dialogue."" A Palestinian government statement called the shelling ""Israeli brutal aggression."" It's unclear who was responsible. The Israel military said it is investigating. ""From initial inquiries done about the incident, during the intense fighting in the area, militants opened fire at ... soldiers from the school area,"" a military statement said. ""In order to eliminate the threat posed to their lives, they responded with fire toward the origins of the shooting."" Regev, the Israeli government spokesman, said Friday that it could have been inadvertent Israeli fire or the result of a Hamas rocket strike on Israel that fell short. ""Even if we do discover in the end that it was errant Israeli fire, why was a U.N. school, the vicinity of a U.N. school, turned into a war zone by Hamas?"" Regev said. The Israeli military said the area surrounding the school in Beit Hanoun had turned into a battlefield, and it had asked that the facility be evacuated even before the school was hit. A four-hour window was given, the military said. Chris Gunness, a spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, disputed that Friday. He said the Israeli military never responded to the agency's urgent pleas for a cease-fire. ""If the IDF had responded, this carnage would never have happened,"" he said. The Israeli military accused Hamas militants of refusing to let people at the shelter leave, saying they were being used as human shields. ""This is a tragedy. This is a clear tragedy,"" Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN. Thursday's strike marks the third time a U.N. school serving as a shelter has been hit. The first occurred Tuesday at an UNRWA school in eastern Gaza, where about 300 people were staying. The second occurred Wednesday in central Gaza at a shelter where about 1,500 were staying.

That's the finding of a new study by media research firm Nielsen. Its Music 360 report set out to learn how music is found, purchased and consumed. Among all adults, radio remains the most popular tool, with 48 percent saying that's how they usually discover their new jams. Young listeners opting to stream, not own music . But more teens, 64 percent, cited YouTube, the Web's leading video-sharing site, as a place where they listen to music. Followed by radio (56%), iTunes (53% ) and CDs (50%). The popularity of YouTube is dramatically higher among teens than all adults. Only 7 percent of all respondents said they discover music most frequently through the site. Strangely, the report doesn't address teens' listening habits on music-streaming sites such as Pandora, Spotify or Grooveshark. ""The accessibility of music has seen tremendous expansion and diversification,"" said David Bakula, a Nielsen senior vice president. ""While younger listeners opt for technologically advanced methods , traditional methods of discovery like radio and word-of-mouth continue to be strong drivers."" The study also shows the changing landscape of music sales. Just over one in three teens (36 percent) said they'd bought a CD in the past year, while more than half (51 percent) said they'd paid to download at least one song. The report came from an online survey of 3,000 people in the United States. Among all respondents, finding new music still relies upon a mix of new media and more traditional means. In addition to the 48 percent who favor radio, 10 percent said they rely on friends or relatives for suggestions. But more than half (54 percent) said those personal recommendations make them more likely to make a purchase. YouTube, which is owned by Google, claims more than 800 million unique visitors every month. More than 3 billion hours of videos are viewed each month and 72 hours worth of video are uploaded every minute, according to the site. Streaming debate strikes chord with music fans .

"(CNN) -- Eating home-cooked food in a local's house -- it's what great stories are made of. Thanks to some enterprising minds, dozens of home kitchens and dining tables in Southeast Asia have opened up to travelers wanting a taste of the local cuisines. They're available for booking online, complete with reviews, photos and payment options. PlateCulture is the latest to gain traction out of Asia, following the likes of mealsharing.com, which we wrote about in our best websites for travelers roundup. More than 80 home chefs in four Southeast Asian countries -- Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore -- are listed on the PlateCulture site. Each listing outlines the menu that will be cooked and the hosts' background. Most also include user reviews that range from mild to wild endorsements. The most popular tried-and-tested kitchens are showcased on the homepage under ""Our Picks."" After the booking, customers receive detailed directions to the host's house. Payments are made through PayPal, and the company keeps 16.7% as a commission. PlateCulture says hosts have been tested and approved by staff or company ambassadors in different countries. While most listings are standard dinners, some are more creative, such as this Indian cuisine cooking workshop or English afternoon tea. Travel, eat, share . Founder Reda Stare says she was inspired to start the company by her own experiences of dining in local homes while traveling in India. The goal of the company is to ""help travelers in all countries across Asia to experience being in a local home, eating homemade food and feeling like you've been a part of something authentic and special,"" Stare says. One of the most difficult parts of the job has been convincing travelers it'll be a better alternative to a restaurant. ""Mostly the challenges are spreading the idea to travelers, that it is really worth it to step a bit from your comfort zone while traveling and try out this new concept of spending a few hours at local homes in Asia."" While the experience is great for travelers, Stare says the company's impact has also been big for the hosts. ""One of our home chefs received a lot of praise for her recipes so she decided to write and publish her recipe book while another host who makes excellent sweets started cooking and selling various jams as her part-time job,"" said Stare. The company pans to expand to Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka in the upcoming year and South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Australia in the near future.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Polls opened in Libya on Wednesday in the country's second parliamentary elections since the fall of the Gadhafi regime in 2011. The vote was announced last month as Libya faced its worst political and security crisis since the revolution. The voting is taking place at a time of high tensions that have polarized the country into two camps: Islamists and those who oppose them. More than 1,500 candidates are competing in these elections, but they are running as individuals, not as political parties. In Libya's first vote in 2012, a more liberal political coalition won more seats than the Islamist parties. The United Nations, the European Union and other Western countries have called for peaceful polling and stressed the importance of these elections for Libya's transition to democracy. More than 1.5 million Libyans have registered to vote for a new 200 member parliament that will be called the Council of Representatives (COR) and will replace the General National Congress (GNC).","The vote takes place against high tensions that have polarized Libya .

"(CNN) -- The age of the virtual assistant is here to stay with Microsoft adding the voice of Cortana to its Windows Phone 8.1. I'm old enough to remember the days when certain computing tasks required a steep learning curve. Now it seems almost magical that I can tell my virtual assistant to remind me to take out the garbage when I get home or call my mom when I get busy. The best part is that when it speaks to me, it does so in a way that allows me to believe, for a brief moment, that I'm interacting with another person. That's because these virtual assistants sound so human. For the creators of artificial intelligent systems, it's critical to build them so that they can facilitate emotional connection with users. When machine interactions with humans feel effortless, natural and ""real,"" that's the ultimate metric of success. We're just getting started. Today's artificial intelligence systems are just scratching the surface of what's possible for personal assistants, advisors and maybe, in some cases, true companions. Indeed, the machine-human relationship in the movie ""Her"" may not seem so far-fetched in the decades to come. Future virtual assistants will offer far more capabilities and can be personalized for each person. Why should we settle for the voice that companies choose for us? We've known for quite some time that typically female voices are preferred, based on their ability to be heard in a clear manner across a broad range of devices. Of course, female voices also tend to be trusted more than male voices. However, if there is one request heard over and over again, it's for more and varied choices in the persona of these virtual assistants, along with greater control over their spoken voice. Creating text-to-speech, or TTS, can be a difficult task. The more human the system needs to sound the more data needs to be collected. Often times this requires massive amounts of linguistic and acoustic information, based on recordings of real humans. Fortunately, the technology is rapidly evolving. Future modeling techniques, where TTS voices are made from mathematical models of its human counterparts, will be lifelike enough to simulate human speech. They will also allow more rapid voice creation, allowing a previously unachievable level of personalization, where each person could even pick his or her unique voice for a virtual assistant. Modeling technology will also make possible the combination of different voice traits. For example, the deep qualities of a voice similar to James Earl Jones could be combined with the unorthodox speaking style of someone like Jack Nicholson. Microsoft took a page from the gaming world by basing Cortana on the character from the Halo video game series. Perhaps future voices in our devices will be as readily available to manipulate to create a cacophony of recognizable personal assistants from favorite film and TV actors, radio hosts, family members, comedians -- the sky would be the limit. Whether it's a character from our favorite game or movie, or a persona created by users themselves, we could allow our virtual assistants the freedom to keep us entertained as well as informed. While there is a fine line between personalization and novelty, I see us on a collision course for having more intelligent conversations with our digital assistants in the years ahead. The gadget-oriented systems of today will continue to grow and adapt to our ever-expanding needs, and the more they learn about us, the more they can assist us. When looking at the challenges facing humanity, whether it's eradicating disease, solving our planet's renewable energy needs, or even colonizing other worlds, it's worth pondering if it will be the humans or the intelligence systems that we create that will tackle these problems. And will we be listening if it's the virtual assistants that are doing the work?","Microsoft added the voice of Cortana to its Windows Phone 8.1 .

"London (CNN) -- Five men picked up in a series of recent terror-related arrests have now been charged, London's Metropolitan Police said Friday. Four of the men, who range in age from 20 to 24, were charged under the Terrorism Act and are accused of taking an oath of allegience to ISIS, according to a statement from police. The extremist group operating in Iraq and Syria has urged lone followers in the West to stage terror attacks in their home countries. The fifth man arrested was charged with a firearms offense, according to police. Three other men arrested in the same series of raids over the last 10 days have been released. A woman who was arrested was released on bail until next week, police said. Authorities arrested the suspects after searching residences and vehicles in west and central London. At the time of the arrests, authorities said they may have foiled an early-stage terror plot with the arrests.

"(CNN) -- A private Venezuelan television station openly critical of President Hugo Chavez said Friday it will pay a hefty fine after the country's highest court ordered that its assets be seized. The supreme court's announcement, which came down Thursday evening, ordered seizure of the broadcaster's property and equipment for failure to pay a $2.2 million fine levied last year. Globovision is currently fighting the fine in court, and accused the high court of interfering with their appeal process. The station also questioned why the supreme court ordered seizures worth $5.7 million, more than double the value of the original fine. The high court's ""grotesque and despotic"" decision forces the station to pay the original fine immediately, before its validity is decided in a lower court, Globovision said. In its statement, the court said the seizure amount was the calculation of twice the original fine, plus the costs of executing the action. Globovision is Venezuela's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of President Hugo Chavez. The seizure announcement comes days before the electoral campaign officially kicks off. The original fine stems from Globovision's coverage of a standoff at the Rodeo II prison in June and July. The station violated a law that prohibits stirring anxiety in the public and instigating intolerance for political reasons, officials charged. These are violations under a media responsibility law passed in December. The stated goal of the law is to establish ""social responsibility"" in those who provide television, radio and Internet service. The law affects all text, images, sound or context sent or received in Venezuela. Globovision defended its coverage of the prison standoff, which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops. But not paying the fine immediately could risk the station being shuttered, Globovision said. ""Globovision is very clear about its responsibility to forge ahead, to stay open and to remain the principal space for criticism and free, independent news,"" the station said in a written statement. Chavez loyalist Diosdado Cabello, president of the country's national assembly, said on his Twitter account that Globovision ""still believes it is above the law and the time to pay arrived today."" Over the years, the government has launched various investigations into Globovision -- looking, for instance, at its reporting about an earthquake before an official report had been issued, and failing to pay about $2.3 million in taxes. Station officials have said the charges are politically motivated. In 2010, the government secured a 25.8% interest in the broadcaster when it took over two companies, one owning a 20% stake in Globovision and the other, a 5.8% stake.","Venezuela's supreme court orders the seizure of Globovision's assets .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. is urging Pyongyang to release an American held captive after reports that the man attempted suicide in a North Korean prison. Swedish diplomats met with Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. State Department official confirmed Friday. He declined to release details about the 31-year-old's condition, citing respect for the family's privacy. ""We reiterate our urge for the North Korean government to release Mr. Gomes on humanitarian grounds,"" said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department. ""A Swedish official had been granted consular access eight times, including today's visit,"" Toner said. ""I think we're concerned about his welfare and -- as we would with any American citizen."" North Korea's official news agency reported Friday that the Boston-area native serving an eight-year sentence in North Korea recently attempted suicide. Gomes attempted to take his own life ""driven by his strong guilty conscience, disappointment and despair at the U.S. government that has not taken any measure for his freedom.,"" state-run Korean Central News Agency said. The news agency said the Swedish Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in North Korea, had ""acquainted itself with the condition of the patient at the hospital."" Calls to the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang were unanaswered over the weekend. The Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it does not comment on individual cases and declined to confirm or deny its involvement. Gomes was arrested after crossing the North Korea-China border on January 25. In April, he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor for what state media described as ""a hostile act committed against the Korean nation."" The American was, according to South Korean news reports, an English language teacher with strong Christian convictions, who had taken part in anti-North Korean protests in the South. Last month, the news agency reported that North Korea may consider a tougher punishment for Gomes if the United States ""persists in its hostile approach"" toward Pyongyang. Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had crossed the border last March and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Robert Park, a Korean-American Christian evangelist who was arrested after entering the country on Christmas Day, had given a media interview in which he stated his aim to force change in North Korean human rights conditions. He was released in February after telling North Korean state media that he had been wrong about human rights conditions there.","Swedish diplomats meet with Aijalon Mahli Gomes .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as champions Real Madrid secured their first win of the La Liga season with a 3-0 defeat of Granada in the Santiago Bernabeu Sunday. The Portuguese star was making it 150 goals in just 149 games for the Madrid giants, but he limped off in the second half after a hefty challenge which saw Borja Gomez sent off for a second yellow card. Real beat Barcelona to win the Spain Super Cup in midweek, but had taken a single point from their opening two league games. Despite prompting from new signing Luka Modric from Tottenham, Real were uninspired in the opening half and Ronaldo owed his opener to a mistake by Antonio 'Tono' Rodriguez in the Granada goal as a shot from an acute angle squeezed through his legs on 25 minutes. Real improved after the break and substitute Angel Di Maria set up Ronaldo for his second, his initial shot saved by Tono before knocking in the rebound. Gonzalo Higuain, who came on for Ronaldo, scored the third after good work by Karim Benzema. In the late evening kick off, Barcelona saw off Valencia 1-0 in the Camp Nou for their third straight win. A blistering shot from Adriano put Barca ahead after 23 minutes of the first half, but they were unable to press home their advantage, with Cesc Fabregas wasting a great chance after being put through. They had to survive some nervous moments in the last few minutes as home goalkeeper Victor Valdes was called into action. In other matches Sunday, Rayo Vallecano drew 0-0 with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao saw off Valladolid 2-0.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A light-weight gun named after an Indian gang rape victim has triggered a wave of criticism from advocates who call it ""abhorrent."" Last week, an Indian state-run gunmaker introduced the .32-calibre revolver, made of titanium alloy, calling it a ""valuable contribution to women's security."" The 500-gram firearm is called Nirbheek, meaning fearless in Hindi. The name was ""inspired by Nirbhaya,"" said Abdul Hamied, the general manager of the Indian Ordnance Field Gun Factory. Nirbhaya is the name given by the Indian media to the 23-year-old woman who was raped and beaten by several men aboard a public bus on December 16, 2012. She later died. The brutal attack provoked outrage across India and led to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Hamied said the project was conceived more than two years ago -- before the bus rape happened. ""It can serve as a deterrence,"" Hamied said. ""There's something you can do to prevent these attacks. You can also enthuse confidence among women."" The lightness of the revolver makes it more suitable for women, he said, adding that he expected male buyers as well. Since its introduction last week, the factory has sold just 10 of the Nirbheek weapons. Wrong message . Binalakshmi Nepram, founder of the Control Arms Foundation of India, described the new gun as ""an insult."" ""Women in India feel this gun is not going to help in security,"" she said. ""And we do not believe the gun is a solution to ending sexual violence."" She added that it sent the wrong message. Rather than prioritizing security for women, ""the government is introducing expensive weaponry to sit in handbags. It's an abhorrence to women,"" she said. The gun costs 122,000 rupees, (around $2,000), putting it above India's average annual per capita income, which is around $1,410. When asked what kind of the clientele Hamied was looking for the new handgun, he conceded it was likely unaffordable for those outside middle and upper income groups. ""It's not for poor women,"" he said. Owning guns . India also has strict controls on gun ownership, with licenses difficult to obtain. ""Gun licenses are given rarely -- only to those with money and clout, and that means overwhelmingly men. Poor women in India are unlikely to have the means or the access to own a gun,"" said Ruchira Gupta, a women's rights activist who is founder of Apne Aap Women Worldwide. Aside from the guns being out of reach for poor women, Gupta agreed it projected the wrong message. ""Nirbhaya was a victim of violence caused by a desire of six men to project their masculinity through domination. Ultimately we have to challenge the culture of domination and violence through nonviolence not through introducing more tools of violence,"" she said. So far, the gun factory in the northern Indian city of Kanpur has received 50 to 60 inquiries about the product, Hamied said. He didn't have a breakdown of how many of the gun's potential buyers were women. Madison Park wrote and reported in Hong Kong. Harmeet Shah Singh reported in New Delhi.","New gun for women in India raises criticisms .

"(CNN) -- A superb free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo gave Manchester United a 2-1 home win over Blackburn to move them eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table. Ronaldo celebrates his late free-kick as Manchester United edged closer to retaining the Premier League. United's record-breaking run of clean sheets came to an end at Old Trafford, but  Ronaldo's moment ensured Sir Alex Ferguson's side remain well on course to lift their third successive title. United took a 23rd minute lead when Wayne Rooney celebrated his first start since returning from a hamstring injury, by taking advantage of a mistake from defender Ryan Nelsen to score the opening goal. However, nine minutes later United conceded their first league goal in 1,334 minutes when Roque Santa Cruz slipped the ball into an empty net after goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak, standing in for the rested Edwin van der Sar, and Rio Ferdinand got in each others way. Jonny Evans looked to have put United back in front on the stroke of half-time but his header from Nani's corner was harshly disallowed for a push. Blackburn nearly took a shock second-half lead when Nelsen struck the post when left unmarked in the area and he was made to pay for that miss when Ronaldo curled home a spectacular free-kick from the left on the hour mark. Both sides had half-chances to add to the scoresheet, but United held on to take the victory, although Liverpool can reduce their lead to five points again on Sunday if they beat Manchester City at Anfield. Elsewhere, Nicolas Anelka's first half-strike gave Chelsea a vital 1-0 victory at Aston Villa in Dutchman Guus Hiddink's first match in charge, lifting the London side above their opponents and into third place. French international Anelka, the league's top scorer, struck his 21st goal of the season after 19 minutes to earn the Blues their first win at Villa Park for 10 years and keep alive their faint Premier League title hopes. It was Anelka's first goal in nine league games and brought an end to Villa's 13-game unbeaten sequence stretching back to early November. Frank Lampard created the goal with a superb piece of skill which enabled him to race clear of Curtis Davies and Stiliyan Petrov before sliding a pass through to Anelka, who showed great composure in dinking the ball over goalkeeper Brad Friedel and into the net. Villa could have levelled in the in the 33rd minute when Ashley Young's curling free-kick struck the crossbar. Emile Heskey was the first to react to the rebound but he headed well wide. However, that was as good as it got for the home side as Chelsea enjoyed the bulk of the chances in the second half. Didier Drogba could have wrapped up the points after a mistake by Carlos Cuellar, but he lofted his shot over the bar, while Friedel denied Jose Bosingwa from close-range before producing another superb save to keep out Michael Ballack. Meanwhile, fifth-placed Arsenal failed to capitalize on Villa's defeat, drawing 0-0 at home to Sunderland to lie six points behind Martin O'Neill's side and in real danger of missing out on the Champions League for the first time since Arsene Wenger took over as manager in 1996. Even Andrei Arshavin's debut for the club failed to conjure up a goal, as Arsenal played out a third successive Premier League goalless draw -- although they did extend their unbeaten run to 13 matches. Elsewhere, Bolton continued their climb away from the relegation zone with a 2-1 home win over West Ham while Stoke remain fourth bottom after conceding an injury time goal to draw 2-2 with Portsmouth in a match where all four goals were scored in the final 15 minutes. Meanwhile, Middlesbrough remain second bottom of the table as they were held 0-0 at home by Wigan, making it a club record 14 Premier League games without victory.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores the winner as Manchester United beat Blackburn 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration has denied that its agents required a 95-year-old woman to remove her adult diaper last week before allowing her to pass a screening checkpoint at Northwest Florida Regional Airport. ""While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,"" the agency said Sunday night in a statement. ""We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally, according to proper procedure and did not require this passenger to remove an adult diaper."" A response released earlier Sunday by the TSA said that the agency had reviewed the circumstances ""and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure."" The woman's daughter, Jean Weber, told CNN on Monday that the TSA agents acted professionally and never ordered the removal of her mother's diaper. However, Weber said the agents made it clear that her mother could not board the plane unless they were able to inspect the diaper. According to Weber, it was her idea to remove the diaper so it could be inspected and they could make their flight. ""They were doing their job according to the instructions of the TSA and their policies,"" Weber said, later adding that the options offered them were to remove the diaper or ""she was not going to get on the plane."" On Sunday, Weber told CNN that the June 18 incident occurred when she and her mother were traveling from northwest Florida to Michigan, where her mother was planning to move in with other relatives prior to moving into an assisted-living facility. ""My mother is very ill, she has a form of leukemia,"" Weber said Sunday. ""She had a blood transfusion the week before, just to bolster up her strength for this travel."" At a security checkpoint, a TSA officer ushered the wheelchair-bound woman into a glassed-in area where a pat-down was performed, Weber said. Weber said an agent told her ""they felt something suspicious on (her mother's) leg and they couldn't determine what it was"" -- leading them to take her into a private, closed room. Soon after, Weber said, a TSA agent told her that her mother's Depend undergarment was ""wet and it was firm, and they couldn't check it thoroughly."" But her mother had no clean diapers in her carry-on luggage and the departure time for the plane was approaching, Weber said. ""They said, 'You can get her luggage back to get more out of her luggage,' but the luggage was checked and I didn't know how long it would take to get her luggage,"" Weber said. ""I asked if I could take the wet Depends off and they said yes but said I had to take her back to the lobby of the airport -- to the restroom out of the screening area."" She said she and her mother then went to a bathroom and removed the wet diaper, then went back through the screening checkpoint. Weber said her mother, a nurse for 65 years, ""was very calm"" despite being bothered by the fact that she went on to complete her journey without underwear. By this weekend, the elder woman -- who was not identified by name -- was doing ""fine"" in Michigan with her relatives, Weber said Sunday. This is not the first time that the TSA's pat-downs of passengers have come under fire, nor the first time that the agency has rallied behind its officers and policy. Last year, the administration announced it was ramping up the use of full-body scanning and pat-downs to stop nonmetallic threats, including explosives, from getting on planes. The goal is to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted on Christmas of 2009 by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the Netherlands to Michigan. The TSA estimates that only 3% of passengers are subjected to pat-downs -- and then only after they have set off a metal detector or declined to step into a full-body scanner. Yet the new policy has triggered an uproar online and in airports, from a small but vocal number of travelers who feel their rights and privacy were being violated. The federal safety agency has made some adjustments to its policy, but no major changes. ""Every traveler is a critical partner in TSA's efforts to keep our skies safe,"" Administrator John Pistole, who ordered the new approach, said last fall. ""And I know and appreciate that the vast majority of Americans recognize and respect the important work we do."" More recently, outrage erupted over a video-recorded pat-down of a 6-year-old passenger last April at New Orleans' airport. The video, which was posted on YouTube, shows the girl protesting the search by a female security officer at first, though she complies quietly while it is under way. Pistole addressed this controversy at a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee meeting last week, explaining the pat-down was ordered because the child had moved while passing through a body imaging machine. He told committee members that ""we have changed the policy (so) that there'll be repeated efforts made to resolve that without a pat-down."" The next day, TSA spokesman Greg Soule said that the new policy -- which will apply to children age 12 and younger -- was in the process of being rolled out.","NEW: The woman's daughter says the TSA agents acted professionally .

"(CNN) -- More than six years have passed since Steven Hayes broke into the Cheshire, Connecticut, home of the Petit family, setting off a deadly chain of events that ended in the death of a woman and her two daughters. But even with time, Hayes struggles to explain exactly what happened and why. ""I started to lose it,"" he told the New Haven Register. ""I looked out the window and saw an unmarked police car. And I just snapped."" Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky have been tried in the case, convicted and sentenced to death. The two men entered the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit and forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000. They then raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, 48, and molested 11-year-old Michaela before tying her and 17-year-old Hayley to their beds and setting the house afire. The girls died from smoke inhalation. Their father managed to escape from the basement. ""I wasn't thinking right; I don't know what I was thinking. It was so unlike me. I'd never done anything like that,"" Hayes told the Register during an hour-long interview from prison. He said it took him a year to even remember what happened in those final moments. ""I was told it was rage and stress or something. I just know that for a couple of minutes, I became somebody else,"" he said. ""I'll never forgive myself for that."" William Petit, who remarried last year, did not respond to Hayes' comments. But his sister-in-law, Cindy Hawke-Renn, said they were ""too little, too late. ""How do you plan such behavior and allow people to die at your hands and burn alive, especially when you have children of your own? Snapped? Doesn't sound like an excuse to me,"" she told the Register. Hayes said he was sorry for what he did and expressed feelings of ""guilt, shame and remorse"" about the deadly 2007 home invasion. He reportedly tried to commit suicide before his trial started and told the Register that he wishes he had been successful. ""I don't deserve to live,"" Hayes told the newspaper. ""I don't want to live."" However, he added, he no longer thinks about killing himself. ""I realize now I've got to live with this pain. It's something I'm supposed to live with,"" said Hayes.","Steven Hayes spoke to the New Haven Register from prison .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A radical Islamic cleric who faced charges relating to terrorism was killed in a daylight ambush Monday morning in Kenya's main coastal city, Mombasa, Kenya Police said. Aboud Rogo Mohammed was accused supporting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia and was blacklisted by the United States and U.N. Security Council. He also faced charges before a Kenyan court for planning terror attacks in Mombasa . ""We have received reports that Aboud Rogo Mohammed has died,"" said Eric Kiraithe, the Kenya Police spokesman. ""We are taking this matter very seriously. It is disappointing to us, because we had a case in court and we had evidence to go to its logical conclusion."" But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed the shooters were Kenyan police. Kiraithe dismissed that claim and asked for the public to give the police information. ""That can only be nonsense,"" he said. ""For what conceivable reason would that happen? What we need is for everyone to cooperate without any fear. We have a witness protection program now."" Rogo's wife said the cleric was traveling with his family in a van on the Mombasa-Malindi highway when they were ambushed by a group of men who shot her husband more than a dozen times. She said she was shot in the leg and Rogo's father was shot in the hand. Their van, a 14-seat white Nissan, was riddled with bullets and splattered with blood. Police tried to take away Rogo's body, but a group of supporters refused and took it away to be buried in the Muslim public cemetery. The shooting sparked protests by Mombasa's Muslim community. Anti-riot police responded with tear gas. A government vehicle was burned near a mosque where Rogo once preached. A U.N. report in July said that Rogo ""threatened the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, by providing financial, material, logistical or technical support to Al-Shabaab."" It went on to claim that he was a key recruiter of Kenyan Muslims to fight with Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group that is trying to overthrow the Somali government. Journalist Bihoff Mukoto contributed to this report.","Aboud Rogo Mohammed was accused supporting Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Faced with a deluge of opposition that included pressure from lawmakers and internal dissent, one of America's leading breast cancer advocacy groups on Friday reversed itself on a decision that would have cut off funding to some Planned Parenthood projects. ""We want to apologize to the American public for recent decisions that cast doubt upon our commitment to our mission of saving women's lives,"" the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation said in a statement. ""We will continue to fund existing grants, including those of Planned Parenthood, and preserve their eligibility to apply for future grants, while maintaining the ability of our affiliates to make funding decisions that meet the needs of their communities."" The group's earlier decision not to renew part of its longstanding partnership with Planned Parenthood, which operates hundreds of family clinics that perform abortions, triggered strong emotions across the country. It provoked objection even from some of its own affiliates. Planned Parenthood said funding from the Komen foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers. In the last five years, grants from the group have directly supported 170,000 screenings, making up about 4% of the total exams performed at Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide. In Washington, 26 Senate Democrats had signed a letter calling on Komen to reconsider. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime Planned Parenthood supporter, pledged $250,000 in matching grants to help make up for the loss in funding. ""Politics have no place in health care,"" the mayor said. ""Breast cancer screening saves lives, and hundreds of thousands of women rely on Planned Parenthood for access to care. We should be helping women access that care, not placing barriers in their way."" Bloomberg's gift came on top of $400,000 that Planned Parenthood reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the initial announcement. By Friday, the group had raised more than $3 million. ""It's a testament to America's compassion and sincerity,"" said Barbara Zdravecky, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida. Addressing the controversy, Zdravecky said only about 3% of the group's services provide for abortions, a hot button issue in presidential politics, while the majority of the group's work is based on prevention, screening and family planning. An anonymous donor had also offered $300,000 in matching grant money earlier this week, Zdravecky said. ""Today, the interests of women's health prevailed over partisan politics,"" said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-New Jersey). ""The Komen Foundation did the right thing."" Other lawmakers expressed outrage over Friday's announcement. Republican Rep. Renee Ellmers added that the group's ""original stance to stop funding pending an important congressional investigation was an act of courage and prudence, making their sudden reversal today appear hollow and weak."" Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum said he was ""deeply disappointed "" in the decision. CREDO, which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to Planned Parenthood, said Thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the Komen Foundation to reverse its decision. ""The (earlier) move is clearly connected to attempts by Republicans in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood,"" the organization said in a statement. ""In responding to questions about its decision, the foundation cited as its rationale a sham 'investigation' into Planned Parenthood launched by Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns,"" who the group called ""one of the most militant anti-choice members of Congress."" In September, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, on which the Florida congressman sits, began an investigation into Planned Parenthood over the organization's ""compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions."" The group said Tuesday that the Komen Foundation had ""succumbed to political pressure"" by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings amid increased scrutiny by Congress over how Planned Parenthood provides abortion services. But the American Life League said in a statement that the foundation's decision was justified. Planned Parenthood ""is currently the focus of a congressional investigation, and multiple affiliates are under state investigations,"" it said. ""Planned Parenthood operatives are lashing out at Komen across the Internet and throughout the media, in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint Komen's policy as cowardly and politically motivated."" The Komen Foundation had also denied that its decision stemmed from politics. ""We've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing,"" said Nancy Brinker, CEO and founder of the group. In all, grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 Planned Parenthood clinics, she said. ""We don't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased."" Brinker was a political appointee of the George W. Bush administration, in which she served as U.S. ambassador to Hungary and as chief of protocol. Susan G. Komen was Brinker's sister. Komen Foundation President Liz Thompson said the funds would have been redirected ""to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly."" She said there was ""amazing consensus"" among foundation board members about the decision, which was made ""over the better part of two years."" That consensus did not include Dr. Kathy Plesser, a member of the foundation's medical advisory board in New York, who had pledged to resign if the decision was not overturned. ""I cannot as a physician and advocate for women's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction,"" Plesser said. ""A big part of what Komen does is reach underserved communities of women. With this (earlier) decision, they're not living up to this mission."" Mollie Williams, the group's managing director of community health programs, left Komen this month. ""It was an honor to oversee and expand their public health efforts during my six years there,"" Williams said. ""At the same time, I respect the work of Planned Parenthood, including their lifesaving efforts to detect cancer in its earliest stages. The divide between these two very important organizations saddens me."" It wasn't immediately clear whether she had resigned. Thompson said it's policy not to release information about employees other than start and end dates.","Donors rush to support Planned Parenthood .

"(CNN) -- I never thought my Afghan translator would save my life by killing two Taliban fighters who were about to kill me. Janis did just that. I'm here today because he had my back in a way I only thought an American soldier would. On April 28, 2008, I found myself in the worst ambush of my life -- surrounded by 45 Taliban fighters, out of grenades, and running low on bullets. We had been fighting nonstop for an hour. A mortar round landed within a few meters of my position and sent me flying into a ditch. Coming into to consciousness I realized I would likely die on that desolate Afghan hillside -- the mortars were too close and accurate to miss me again. At that moment, I felt a body slam into the ditch next to me and simultaneously heard the unmistakable sound of an AK-47 firing next to my head. I turned and saw my Afghan interpreter Janis Shenwary glaring down the barrel of his rifle at the bodies of the two Taliban fighters he had just killed. They had me dead to rights until Janis acted to save mine. On that April day he taught me the true price of loyalty and brotherhood forged through combat. The Taliban retaliated by placing him on the top of its kill list. For the next five years, we tried to secure him and his family the U.S. visas he clearly had earned. After an extensive effort that involved a national media campaign, the legal and political guidance of the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project and the Truman National Security Project, working with more than a dozen members of Congress, we eventually prevailed. He now lives in Washington with his family. Together, we run No One Left Behind, an organization dedicated to ensuring we fulfill our nation's promise to bring these allies to America after their service and provide them with housing, furniture, and employment assistance. We consider keeping that promise a matter of national security -- nothing less than the credibility and honor of the United States is at stake. Wars have consequences, many unforeseen. One of the most profound and seldom-discussed consequence is what happens to our Iraqi and Afghan allies. The majority of the Iraqi and Afghan people did not seek these wars -- they were at best begrudging participants hopeful that our promise of a better life came to pass. Moreover, most of these people did not pick up arms and fight us -- indeed, the bulk of the fighting in both wars has always been confined to limited segments of the population. Most important, many of these people chose to fight with us because we implored them to -- and now they are going to die because we failed to truly defeat our common enemies and we're apparently comfortable with abandoning our allies as we retreat. A common truth among U.S. military veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars (especially those of us who served on the front lines) is that our interpreters most likely saw more and worse combat than the majority of us. As a result, we tend to view our ""terps"" as full and equal combat veterans. They may have not been full soldiers, but they wore our uniforms, ate our food, bled our blood, saved our lives countless times, and fought and killed our enemies. When we left, they remained behind to join our replacements for yet another tour. And we told them we would give them all U.S. visas if, after at least a year's worth of faithful and honorable service, they found themselves under duress. Almost all interpreters face some threat -- being a collaborator also has consequences. But many end up on the Taliban or al Qaeda's hit lists. And that's where we can't understand our government's treatment of these fellow veterans. If they were American citizens, we'd spare no expense protecting them and helping them flee to the safety of U.S. soil. But, because they were born Afghan or Iraqi, they're somehow subject to a lower standard of treatment. The truth is, these translators did a lot more than most Americans to protect and defend our country. They have earned their place in America. Sadly, the bureaucrats in Washington do not feel as strongly about saving these allies as the veterans who actually fought these wars. Sometime in this week or the next, the State Department will run out of visas it can issue to Afghans. To its credit, the State Department has pleaded with Congress to pass the Afghan Allies Protection Extension Act of 2014, which would renew the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program for another year and add 6,000 new visas for eligible Afghans. The State Department estimates that it has a backlog of 6,000 Afghan applicants. If Congress fails to pass the law by September 30, 2014, the program will end and these applicants, many who have been waiting years for a ruling on their application, will likely never receive the visas they so bravely earned. We will simply abandon them to a gruesome and torturous death at the hands of the Taliban. As an American soldier and a former Afghan translator who lives in America and dreams of the day he becomes a citizen, the prospect of abandoning our allies and breaking our promise disgusts us. How many times in the last century have we vowed ""never again"" after profound human suffering? We said it after we left Saigon in 1975. And again as we watched from the sidelines in horror at Rwanda in 1994. I fear we may be already saying it in Iraq. The coming tragedy in Afghanistan is entirely preventable. We haven't yet abandoned our closest Afghan allies to Taliban slaughter. All we have to do is have the courage to act -- if we don't soon, we'll once more absently vow ""Never Again.""","Matt Zeller's Afghan translator saved his life by killing two Taliban fighters .

"(CNN) -- In the escalating conflict between the White House and Congress over Operation Fast and Furious, the stakes are high for each side. On Thursday, the House plans to vote on whether Attorney General Eric Holder should be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over Justice Department documents related to the controversial gun-walking program. Congressional lawmakers leading the charge see themselves as fulfilling a core prerogative of the legislative branch: to conduct investigations of possible wrongdoing or incompetence within the executive branch. The House, they would argue, cannot properly fulfill this duty without access to key documents. The Obama administration also sees itself as carrying out important institutional functions of the executive branch: to protect the privacy of internal deliberations and enable the Justice Department to conduct its own inquiry without outside meddling. To some political observers, this skirmish is just another political ploy by a Republican-led committee that wants to embarrass the president in an election year. Others disagree and see the president as acting in bad faith by asserting executive privilege to withhold the documents. Fortune: The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . Inevitably, executive privilege disputes result in accusations of political gamesmanship. It's impossible to know the true motivations of those involved, but we can evaluate the constitutional merits of the president's action. Executive privilege has a long history in our system of separated powers. The phrase never actually was used until the Eisenhower era, but presidents going back to George Washington have at times exercised some form of what we now call executive privilege. It is recognized as the right of the president and certain high-level executive branch officials to withhold information (documents and testimony) from those who have compulsory power -- Congressional committees or judicial entities such as special prosecutors. Some of the most contentious disputes in U.S. history -- Watergate, the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- have centered on executive privilege claims. Presidents marshal support for executive privilege claims by arguing that the requested documents or testimony encompass one or more of the following: presidential communications, internal deliberations, national security matters and information pertaining to an ongoing law enforcement investigation. Obama's claim on the Fast and Furious documents relies on the internal deliberative process rationale and the ongoing law enforcement investigation defense. Ultimately, the president's claim fails because it is too broad and does not overcome the strong presumption in favor of congressional access to information when there are allegations of misconduct in the executive branch. Furthermore, the longstanding standard for any executive privilege claim is that the president must be protecting information that, if released publicly, would cause some substantial harm to our national interest. The president cannot assert this power merely to avoid the release of potentially embarrassing or politically inconvenient details. What happens if Holder is cited? Fast and Furious is a department-level program seemingly far removed from presidential oversight and direction. The very act of Obama using executive privilege in this case creates so many questions that Congress would be negligent in its duties to not press the president to properly explain his position or disclose the subpoenaed documents. As for the accusation that House Republicans could be playing politics, that is certainly plausible. But concerns about a Justice Department program that appears to be designed to allow government-owned guns to be given to Mexican gangs, without a plan for how these weapons would be tracked, overcome any argument about the political motivations. Any discussion about the program being ""botched"" is mere speculation until Congress receives all the relevant documents about how it was formulated and implemented. Finally, even if the Obama administration's account of Fast and Furious is accurate, what is the point of stonewalling Congress? Holder has already given the House some documents, which entail the deliberative process, so the primary justification for making the executive privilege claim seems makeweight. Only full disclosure will help to reveal the truth of what happened with Fast and Furious, and from there, perhaps Congress will be able hold government officials accountable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark J. Rozell and Mitchel A. Sollenberger.","The House plans to vote on whether to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt .

"Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Work began Tuesday to exhume the body of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat amid an investigation of his 2004 death. The exhumation process, which started with the removal of the mausoleum's glass and its marble tombstone, could take up to two weeks due to the delicate work that needs to be done by hand, a Palestinian source said. The exhumation comes after French authorities opened a murder inquiry into his death this year after high levels of a radioactive substance were found on some of his personal belongings. Read more: Palestinian leader signs off on Arafat exhumation, PLO official says . The inquiry was launched after Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, lodged a formal legal complaint for murder. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation of Arafat's body from his mausoleum, which is in the Palestinian presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Read more: Arafat's widow wants body exhumed after test for radioactivity . A CNN crew at the scene saw a huge tarp surrounding the mausoleum and said workers were starting to remove the tombstone. Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. In the days before his death, Palestinian officials said that he had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said he ""totally"" ruled them out. Read more: French prosecutors launch murder inquiry in Arafat's death . But a Swiss doctor has said that investigators had found high levels of toxic polonium-210 on some of Arafat's belongings. Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, said his researchers had tested Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the distinctive black-and-white headscarf he often wore. A body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope, while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. A becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity. The fabric of Arafat's clothing, without body fluid, contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. Suha Arafat told CNN she wanted her husband's body exhumed so investigators could be ""100% sure"" of the presence of polonium.

"(CNN) -- Fighting between Thai and Cambodian troops flared again briefly on Saturday morning, after clashes over an ancient temple claimed by both countries erupted along the border on Friday. A Thai Army spokesman said one soldier was killed in the latest round of gunfire, and four others were injured. That brings the weekend death toll to two people. Earlier, the country's health minister told the MCOT news agency that one Thai villager was killed by artillery shells fired by Cambodian troops. Fighting took place on Friday and Saturday near the Preah Vihear temple, an 11th century structure which straddles the boundary between Cambodia and Thailand. The building itself sits on a cliff in Cambodian territory, but the most accessible entrance to the site is on the Thai side. State media for both countries confirm that there was an exchange of gunfire and artillery on Friday afternoon for about two hours. Both sides are pointing the finger at the other over who fired the first shots. The United States urged Thailand and Cambodia on Friday to show ""maximum restraint"" in the wake of clashes over an ancient temple claimed by both countries. Events along the Thai-Cambodia border were being closely monitored, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley, and both sides were called on to ""take all necessary steps to reduce tensions and avoid further conflict."" Conflict over the Preah Vihear site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was ""an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture."" But Thailand says that the 1.8 square mile (4.6 square kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th century during the French occupation of Cambodia. In July 2008, the United Nations approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the U.N. believes has outstanding universal value.","NEW: Thai officials: One soldier and one civilian have been killed in clashes .

"(CNN) -- An Army psychiatrist accused of opening fire and killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, will begin trial proceedings in three months, a military judge ruled. Maj. Nidal Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with a 2009 attack at the post's processing center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq. The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, ordered Hasan's court -martial to begin May 29 with jury selection and testimony to begin on July 1. The start of Hasan's court-martial has been repeatedly delayed since it was initially set to begin in March of 2012, most notably after an appeals court delayed the case over the question of whether the Army major's beard could be forcibly shaved. Army regulations prevent soldiers from wearing facial hair while in uniform. Hasan, who is still considered a soldier, is a practicing Muslim and maintains he has the right to wear the beard under U.S. laws protecting religious freedoms. The case resumed after a higher court dismissed the order that Hasan be shaved and replaced the judge in the case. On Thursday, Hasan's attorney requested a change of venue, telling the court that his client could not get a fair court-martial. Osborn did not immediately issue a ruling. Fort Hood shooting victims want rampage labeled as terrorism . If convicted, Hasan faces a possible death penalty. The November 5, 2009, attack left 13 dead and 32 people wounded in what has been described as the worst mass shooting on a U.S. military instillation. Hasan was paralyzed from the waist down after police exchanged fire with him. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, he was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings, but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. Hasan had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations tied to the Fort Hood shootings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent radical Yemeni-American cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.

"(CNN) -- Glass, Google's high-profile entry into the world of wearable tech, may help launch a revolution if it's released later this year as expected. But test models already on the street have begun playing a more unlikely role -- as symbols in a simmering fight over Silicon Valley's impact on the city of San Francisco. It's a local story, but one with ramifications everywhere as Google on Tuesday made the connected headsets available to the public for the first time in a one-day sale. While our smartphones drop easily into pockets and tablets get zipped up in cases or backpacks, wearables such as Glass are, quite literally, in your face all the time. The $1,500 device, which displays Web content on a tiny screen, signals its wearer as a likely member of an affluent tech elite. And Glass also can discreetly shoot photos or video, which some people view as invasive. That's caused unease for some folks and, in some cases has led to arguments, altercations and even attacks against people wearing the technology. Kyle Russell, a reporter for Business Insider, wrote Sunday that he was walking home after covering a protest march against a Google employee who reportedly had bought a property and then evicted its tenants. He was wearing, but not using, the eyewear ""when a person put their hand on my face and yelled, 'Glass!' In an instant, the person was sprinting away, Google Glass in hand."" Russell says he ran after the woman, who then ""pivoted, shifting their weight to put all of their momentum into an overhand swing. The Google Glass smashed into the ground, and they ran in another direction."" Tension city . In the column, Russell said he thinks the protest and attack Friday were linked, though he does not think the woman who did it was at the march. ""My love for gadgets makes me look and sound like one of the people whom residents of the city have come to feel oppressed by,"" he wrote. ""The individual who smashed my Google Glass on Friday -- because of political beliefs or a personal impact that has been made by the tech industry -- felt that it was appropriate to destroy my personal property in protest against what I seemed to stand for, based on my appearance; never mind the irony in choosing to assault someone based on their appearance as a way to preserve San Francisco's culture,"" he wrote. On Monday, a Google spokesman condemned the attack. ""Targeting anyone for a crime because of what they wear is wrong,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""We have reached out to the person to see what we can do to help."" In recent months, tensions have run high in San Francisco over the perceived role that tech-industry giants have had on the city. Protesters complain that an influx of highly paid tech workers is driving up rents, forcing out longtime residents and robbing the city of its famously eccentric character. Related story: Would you want Google Glass in class? Most of the anti-tech fervor has focused on big-name companies such as Google and Twitter and the private bus systems that ferry their employees from the city to various corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. But individual employees are increasingly being targeted, too. Just last week, protesters picketed in front of the private home of Kevin Rose, co-founder of Digg and now a partner with Google Ventures. The protesters, who posted signs calling Rose a ""parasite,"" claimed his group, which helps Google decide which startups to invest money in, has helped to inflate prices in the city. Friday's march targeted Jack Halperin, an attorney for Google, who protesters say bought a building, where he intends to live, and evicted tenants who had been renting there. Glass as a flashpoint . But while the tensions over housing in San Francisco have been bubbling for some time, it's relatively new for Glass to be targeted, either over privacy concerns or as a presumed symbol of the tech industry as a whole. In late February, a woman says she was attacked at a bar on San Francisco's famous Haight Street after fellow patrons began heckling her and trying to rip Glass off of her face. In a video Sarah Slocum shared with KRON-TV, a woman can be heard saying ""You're killing the city"" while approaching Slocum and apparently trying to rip the headset off of her face. Another man is shown similarly trying to grab the device. Slocum said the man eventually took the headset and ran out of the bar with it. She was able to retrieve her Glass but says her purse and phone were stolen. Google is clearly cognizant of the concerns some people have about Glass and has acted to encourage ""Explorers"" -- people who have been publicly field-testing the devices since early last year -- not to behave in ways that stoke anti-Glass sentiment. In February, the company issued a list of tips for Explorers that included not being ""creepy or rude (aka a 'Glasshole')."" Other advice included always asking permission before taking a photo or shooting a video of someone, and being careful not to ""Glass out,"" or just sit idly with the device on when others are around. It's hard to know whether the San Francisco attacks were just isolated incidents or whether others might be targeted similarly. One suspects that when the digital headsets become widely available, presumably later this year, people will become more accustomed to seeing them. Slocum, the woman attacked in the San Francisco bar, hopes potential users won't be discouraged. ""I hope this incident doesn't deter people from wearing Google Glass, because 95% of the time, my experience is 180 degrees different,"" she told KRON. ""Most people are just excited, curious. I usually end up demonstrating them, showing them to people, letting them try them on.""","Two recent cases saw Google Glass users attacked in San Francisco .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish fishing boat repelled an attack by suspected pirates Sunday morning in the Indian Ocean off the African coast, Spain's ministry of defense said. The Spanish Ortube Berria fishing vessel was in waters southwest of the Seychelles when pirates aboard two skiffs opened fire on the ship with light arms and a grenade shot from a launcher, according to a defense ministry news release. The Seychelles are a group of islands located north of Madagascar and southeast of Somalia, whose coastal waters have become known for piracy. The attack happened at about 5:40 a.m., the ministry said. A private security company aboard the fishing vessel returned fire and thwarted the attack, the statement said. No one was injured, and the ship did not suffer any material damage. Following the attack, the Ortube Berria was sailing southward away from the area, the defense ministry said. Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 11, according to information from Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon. Earlier this month, the crew of another Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, was released by Somali pirates after 47 days in captivity. The Alakrana was hijacked off the coast of Somalia. On Sunday, the commander of a European Union anti-piracy operation, deployed a Portuguese frigate based in the area toward the site of the attack, Spanish authorities said. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Spanish fishing boat repels attack by suspected pirates in Indian Ocean off African coast .

"(CNN) -- He was an outstanding talent who never made it in the NBA, before he established himself as one of the most famous American players in European basketball history. But basketball is just one of the many talents in Darryl Middleton's locker. He's a co-owner of a Spanish restaurant where he also cooks. Middleton has come a long way since he had a dream of becoming a U.S. basketball star. As he puts it: ""Everybody wants to go to the NBA."" In 1988, drafted in the third round by the Atlanta Hawks with the 68th overall pick, Middleton appeared to have the world at his feet. But those feet could not dance their way past his new teammates -- the way was blocked. ""I knew it would be difficult because the team that drafted me had too many good players,"" Middleton told CNN's Human to Hero series. Nicknamed 'Future' So Middleton packed his bags, left the U.S. and headed for Turkey to begin a 25-year odyssey where he would change clubs 15 times and play in five different countries. One of the most successful Americans to ever play in Europe, he was the MVP in the Spanish league in 1992, 1993 and 2000 and won the Euroleague with Greek side Panathinaikos in 2002. Not bad for a man who didn't pick up a basketball until the age of 15. ""When I first started I was playing as if I had two left feet,"" he said. ""I had to learn because everyone else my age was already playing. ""I would stand on the side and dribble the ball by myself while everybody else was dunking and jumping. It was embarrassing."" That embarrassment was the driving force behind Middleton's determination to succeed. Instead of moping on the sideline, he began an intensive program of training to help propel him towards the top of the roster. He started to tape NBA games and take notes on the way players moved, which foot they jumped off and then tried to replicate those steps in training. Each day he would get up and go to the park in the summer and play in the morning or practice by himself, sometimes playing for five different teams around New York. His extra work did not go unnoticed. Nicknamed 'Future' by his high school coach, who clearly believed his student had talent, Middleton began to fulfill his promise. Uzi machine guns . He won a scholarship to Baylor University and his draft to the Hawks followed almost expectantly -- but that's where it all began to unravel and he headed to Europe. Forget that he couldn't even pronounce the names of half the teams his agent was suggesting -- he boarded a plane for Turkey to embark on an adventure he's still living. Middleton readily admits he didn't know that they even played basketball in Turkey, and when he touched down to be greeted by armed guards wielding Uzi machine guns, he realized that he was entering a very different world. Not that it seemed to bother him on the court. Playing in Mersin, a large city and a port on the Mediterranean coast of southern Turkey, he was voted MVP in 1988 and began to enjoy life after adapting to life away from home. ""I had never left the States and being in Turkey at that time was strange,"" said Middleton. ""The people was good to me but still, I was away from home, the food was different, they spoke another language, and I didn't know what they were saying. ""The coach helped me a lot. He took care of me, treated me like family and that helped. Normally that doesn't happen in New York -- the coaches just bring you into the team and you're on your own."" Mersin was the first stop on a tour which would take in Italy, Spain, Greece and Russia. It was in Greece with Panathinaikos where Middleton won the Euroleague in 2002 on top of four Greek league titles and two domestic cups. Master chef . Further success followed in Spain with Girona where he won the FIBA EuroCup in 2007 some 12 years after helping FC Barcelona win two league titles. Voted MVP in the Spanish league three times during his career, it's no real surprise that Middleton chose to remain in Europe than return to the U.S. He considers himself European, speaks Spanish and while he continues to play at the age of 47, he has turned his hand to a new love of his -- cooking. Middleton co-owns a restaurant in Alicante on the Mediterranean coast, where he produces some impressive tasting cuisine. He can make a mean dessert and his big hands so used to the shape of a ball have become more delicate in their approach to rolling cannelloni. It was only when he arrived in Barcelona in the 1990s that he discovered he was just as capable of creating souffles as the was netting three-pointers. ""My plan was never to be a chef or to cook but you need something else, you need a hobby,"" he said. ""That was a good hobby for me. I love to cook, I always cooked for my players. I go home to the U.S. and cook all the time so I ended up just loving it. ""Every year, I go back to cookery school whenever I can and just try different things. ""I'm at the restaurant 10 hours a day and it's good to see people come, eat something and love it. That's a good feeling. ""It's like basketball -- people come to the game, you play, you do well and then after that, they congratulate you. It's kind of the same. Putting a smile on someone's face."" Hoop mentor . Now 47, Middleton knows he won't be putting smiles on people's faces for much longer with a basketball. After an adventure which began in Turkey over two decade ago, he is more likely to be found perfecting his apple pie or cheesecake rather than shooting hoops. Not that he's retired -- not yet. He still trains three days a week with Benidorm, a team which plays outside of the top league. Now he finds himself giving advice to the next generation, just as he did with Marc Gasol, a former teammate who plays for Memphis Grizzlies in the NBA. Voted an NBA all-star in 2012 and awarded the best defensive player of the year gong in 2013, Gasol first met Middleton at Girona. ""When Marc first came to play with us he was overweight,"" jokes Middleton. ""But he definitely had something. ""He came to our team in Girona and I liked him. He worked hard every day and I worked with him. ""I beat him up every day, sometimes I hit him. He was about to fight me because I just love competing. ""I love to make a guy get better and better and Marc was of those players I helped. I was very proud of him when he want to the NBA - he's one of the best centers there."" While Gasol has gone on to establish himself as one of basketball's biggest names in the U.S. Middleton has no desire to return across the Atlantic. Now a 'grandpa' figure to those he plays with, he is happy to spend the rest of his time by the tranquil waters of the Mediterranean while basking in the Spanish sun. ""This is a great life,"" he says. ""The food is great, the food in the States, I'm not too much crazy for anymore. ""I don't eat fried foods or fast foods. I'm more European now - even the way I dress or talk. I just love it here."" Raise a glass of Rioja -- this is one odyssey which won't be ending any time soon.","Darryl Middleton is one of the USA's most successful basketball players outside the NBA .

"Washington (CNN) -- The whole point of the founding of this country was that government wasn't supposed be a family business, but we've got dynasties nonetheless. The sixth American president, John Quincy Adams, was the son of the second president (John Adams), after all. Now there's Debbie Dingell, the much younger wife of octogenarian John Dingell, running for the seat he announced last week that he'll leave after 58 years. That's a record, by the way. There's been a Dingell on Capitol Hill every year since 1933... since Franklin Roosevelt was president and there was a Depression going on. That's a much better record than the Kennedys. There were two years -- between 2011 when Rep. Patrick Kennedy resigned, and 2013 when Rep. Joe Kennedy III was sworn in -- without a Kennedy on Capitol Hill or any elected office since 1947. So add the Dingells, on a smaller scale, to the Bushes and the Clintons. Not a presidential cycle goes by without somebody talking about a Clinton or a Bush running. It's too much for one dynasty's matriarch. ""Kennedys, Bushes, Clintons, there are just more families than that,"" Barbara Bush said recently. That hasn't stopped her son Jeb, the former Florida governor, from teasing a bid for president and arguing his name would actually hurt him. ""I get the point. It's something that, if I run, I would have to overcome that. And so will Hillary, by the way. Let's keep the same standards for everybody,"" he said last week in New York. Jeb Bush might or might not run for president. But the Bush dynasty will live on. Jeb's son, George P. Bush, is the odds-on favorite to win in his campaign for Texas land commissioner this year. There are a lot of smaller political families in the 50 states. Up on Capitol Hill, take the U.S. Senate, which has 100 members. A full third -- 33 of them -- are the father, son, mother, daughter, husband or wife of at least one other public official, according to a CNN analysis. There are Udalls and Landrieus, Murkowskis and Pryors, Pauls and Roberts. And many more. In the Senate, politics is the family business . Why so many family names in American politics? In recent years on Capitol Hill we've seen Pauls, Ron and Rand; Levins, Sander and Carl; and Udalls, Tom and Mark. The brand alone won't win an election, but it brings instant name recognition. And in this era of big, expensive campaigns, name recognition can be priceless. Some dynasties are harder to maintain than others. The Liz Cheney for Senate campaign didn't last long. And the attempt to reboot the Quayle name foundered when former Vice President Dan Quayle's son, Ben, lost his House seat after one term. And the Nunns -- former Sen. Sam Nunn's daughter, Michelle, is a Democrat running in a red state for the U.S. Senate seat in Georgia. So are the Carters -- former President Jimmy Carter's grandson, Jason, is running for governor there. CNN's Dennis Ting contributed to this report.","Politics is often a family business -- not exactly what the founding fathers intended .
Nonetheless, our country has a long history of political dynasties .

"(CNN) -- It was the threats that took the fun out of ""Family Funday."" A Muslim group had sold more than 4,000 tickets to the private event, set for this Sunday at a theme park in suburban London, when park officials canceled it last week. This week, officials went a step further, also closing the 150-acre park's 150-room hotel for the weekend, a park spokeswoman said Thursday. The event was to have been held at Legoland Windsor Resort, 30 miles west of London. It was to have been ""open to people from all faiths and cultures in an open and welcoming environment without the promotion of any particular ideology,"" according to the website for the Muslim Research and Development Foundation. But now -- after critics of the group filled the park's Facebook page with threats -- it's not open to anybody. ""Sadly, our right-wing extremists took a huge offense to it,"" park spokeswoman Liz Edwards said. ""It's the saddest thing."" The hotel's closure was also based on concern over safety, she said. ""We wanted to just ensure that the whole site was secure,"" Edwards said. Those who had booked rooms were given refunds, but the move didn't satisfy Sarah Shenton Plews, who posted on the park's Facebook page that she was ""Extremely upset!"" and asked, ""Can u arrange for someone to come round and tell my 5 yr & 8 yr???! Well??"" In response to the posting, the hotel cited the threats: ""Your Safety and security is our number one priority so we've made the decision to close the whole Resort, including the Hotel for the weekend."" Legoland said it took down its Facebook page for a couple of days at the request of the Thames Valley Police. The Muslim Research and Development Foundation cited far-right groups linked to the English Defence League and ""Christian patrols"" for the decision to cancel. ""We should not be intimidated by violent threats to our way of life,"" the group said, adding it's a charity that has consistently promoted nonviolence. ""Unfortunately, during the last few weeks leading up to the event, several right-wing groups including the (English Defence League) and Casuals United along with others threatened both the visitors and employees of Legoland in relation to this planned event. They threatened staff at Legoland, staff at MRDF and aimed to disrupt families on the day of the event."" The Muslim group did not immediately return a call and e-mail seeking further comment. A posting on Casuals United's blog denied its members had made any threats. ""We are hardly Nazis, we are British people who are standing up for our country,"" the entry said. ""Call us Nazis all you want, we don't care. We stop Islamic extremists, we get results. Any venue this group (tries) to book will get the same treatment."" The English Defence League describes itself as a human rights organization working ""to protect the inalienable rights of all people to protest against radical Islam's encroachment into the lives of non-Muslims."" It says it is not a far-right group. In a statement, the group accused the Muslim Research and Development Foundation of being led ""by a notorious hate-preacher who has made it quite clear that he is opposed to almost every standard of democracy, decency, morality and inclusiveness that we British see as the cornerstone of our culture"" and said it was pleased the event had been canceled. The foundation's chairman, Sheikh Haitham Al-Haddad, has denied he is extremist. The English Defence League added it ""wholeheartedly"" condemned any threats of violence. ""In a country with a long and honorable tradition of peaceful protest there is absolutely no excuse for this and the EDL affirms its commitment to nonviolent action."" In a statement, the Thames Valley Police said it initiated an investigation after being notified about the online threats February 11 but had made no arrests. ""As there is an ongoing police investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further,"" police said. In November, another event by the Muslim group -- held at the Chessington World of Adventures, Legoland's sister park about 45 minutes away -- went off without threats or complaints, park spokeswoman Edwards told CNN. ""We have no idea why this has been different."" Sunday's cancellation is the first by the park since it opened in 1996, she said. CNN's Lucy Pawle contributed to this report.","Legoland Windsor Resort cancels a Muslim group's plans for ""Family Funday""

"(CNN) -- A 13-year-old girl is dead and her mother is behind bars, accused of stabbing her ex-husband and trying to kill her children by poisoning them. Officers in Casa Grande, Arizona, responded to a 911 call on Christmas Day. A man said that his ex-wife, 35-year-old Connie Villa, had stabbed him but that he had managed to escape and was driving himself to a hospital, police said in a statement. When officers arrived at the home, they found Villa with stab wounds, holding a knife to her chest. They managed to subdue her and conducted a sweep of the home. Police found the body of Aniarael Macias, Villa's daughter, in the bathroom. ""Although an autopsy for Aniarael was conducted yesterday in Pima County, the results of which did not identify a cause of death, investigators feel the evidence found at the scene of the crime along with interviews and medical information of the surviving children, give our Department cause to believe Connie Villa was attempting to end the lives of all of her children and her ex-husband, Adam Villa,"" the statement read. Connie Villa faces one count of first degree murder in the death of her daughter. She is also being charged with four counts of attempted murder of her ex-husband and her three surviving children, ages 3, 5 and 8. Police say she forced her children to take prescription narcotic drugs. The three children had trace amounts of opiates in their systems. All are in good condition and were placed with the family of their father, Adam Villa, 33. He is in stable condition. Connie Villa was released Sunday from Maricopa Medical Center, where she was treated for what investigators believe were self-inflicted stab wounds. She was arrested the same day. According to Thomas Anderson, a police spokesman, she has made an initial appearance in court. No bond was given. Aniarael's father released a statement asking for privacy and prayers. ""On behalf of Michael Macias, Ania's father, Vera Macias, Ania's grandmother and extended family, we request that the focus of this tragedy be a celebration of our precious Ania's life. She was a gentle, kind and beautiful spirit who was taken from us much too soon. Michael and his family are heartbroken,"" it read. ""We are writing this statement in hopes that the media and other outlets will allow Michael and our family to grieve peacefully. We thank everyone for the outpouring of support for our family. We appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts. We pray that justice will be served.""","Connie Villa faces one count of murder in the death of her daughter, Aniarael .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India plans the maiden test flight this week of its longest-range nuclear-capable missile, which can travel more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles), military officials said. The Agni V rocket could be launched between Wednesday and Friday, said Ravi Gupta, the spokesman for the country's Defense Research and Development Organization. ""It's the most advanced missile so far,"" he said. In November, India successfully tested the fourth version of Agni, meaning ""fire"" in Hindi, with a range of 3,500 km. Built years earlier, Agni I could travel 700 km, according to Indian defense authorities. India says that it pursues no aggressive designs and that its military program is based on building a credible minimum deterrent with a ""no-first-use"" policy. ""Our missiles are purely for deterrence,"" said Gupta. The flight of Agni V would be a significant move to demonstrate India's technological competence, said Uday Bhaskar, a strategic expert. But the home-grown missile, he said, would undergo several tests more before it becomes fully operational. ""Yet, the first test of Agni V will enhance India's technological profile,"" he said. A successful experiment, Bhaskar said, would bring India closer to the group of nations capable of building intercontinental missiles. Currently, the five permanent member nations of the U.N. Security Council are thought to have developed such technology, he said.","The launch of the missile is expected between Wednesday and Friday .

"Zahko, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. warplanes carried out airstrikes in northern Iraq near ISIS-controlled Mosul Dam early Saturday morning, the Kurdish news agency Rudaw reported, citing eyewitnesses. CNN confirmed that a U.S. and Iraqi military operation aimed at retaking the country's largest hydroelectric dam from the so-called Islamic State was scheduled to begin early Saturday morning (Friday at 6 p.m. ET). The operation was to begin with U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes against ISIS positions, with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces following up on the ground. U.S. fighter jets began carrying out the strikes early Saturday morning local time, Rudaw reported. U.N. resolution targets ISIS . News of the airstrikes unfolded the same day the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution aimed at curbing the support -- money and arms -- flowing to the al Qaeda splinter group that has aided its rapid and brutal advance across Iraq. ""It has seized some of the country's precious natural resources and taken control of critical infrastructure,"" Samantha Power, the U.S. representative, said, referring to ISIS. ""Now (ISIS) has the ability to block the flow of electricity and control access to the water supplies on which people depend."" ISIS seized control of Mosul Dam this month following fierce fighting. The dam sits on Iraq's Tigris River about 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the city of Mosul, which fell to the extremist group in June when it swept from Syria into Iraq. Should the dam fail or ISIS fighters open its floodgates, massive flooding could result. The resolution sanctioned six people, described as financiers and supporters of ISIS' actions in Iraq and Syria, by freezing their assets and banning them from traveling. While the resolution called for the use of economic sanctions and military force, if necessary, to ensure that ISIS militants ""disarm and disband,"" it stopped short of authorizing the immediate use of U.N.-sanctioned military action against ISIS. Under the resolution, a team charged with monitoring the activities of ISIS has been ordered to investigate the extremist group's resources, funding and recruitment and report back with recommendations to the Security Council within 90 days. Yazidi men killed, women abducted . ISIS fighters swept into a Yazidi village in northern Iraq on Friday, killing at least 80 men and taking more than 100 women captive, officials told CNN. The report of the brutal attack on the village of Kojo comes a day after U.S. President Barack Obama -- citing the success of targeted American airstrikes -- declared an end to an ISIS siege that had trapped tens of thousands of Yazidis in mountains. Fighters with the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, attacked Kojo after surrounding it for days, a Kurdish regional government official and a Yazidi religious leader said. The women abducted from the village were being taken to the ISIS-controlled northern cities of Mosul and Tal Afar, the official said. CNN cannot independently confirm the killings and abductions, but the claims are similar to reports provided by survivors of ISIS attacks in Iraq. Who are the Yazidis? EU considers arming Kurds . The plight of the Yazidis and the threat posed by ISIS to Iraq's Kurdish regional government prompted the United States to conduct targeted airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops. After an emergency meeting Friday of the European Union's foreign ministers, the group said it welcomed U.S. action and that its member nations were responding to a call from Iraq's Kurdish regional government for arms and ammunition. But most world leaders and diplomats are pinning their hopes on Iraq's prime minister-designate, Haider al-Abadi, to bring together Iraq's ethnic and religious groups to fight a common enemy in ISIS. Who is Haider al-Abadi? Abadi was endorsed late Thursday by Prime Minister Nuri al-Malki, who gave up the fight to keep his post for a third term. U.S. airstrikes carried out . As details of the ISIS attack on the village of Kojo emerged on Friday, the U.S. military said it carried out two airstrikes south of Sinjar. After receiving reports from Kurdish forces that ISIS was attacking the village of Kojo, ""U.S. aircraft identified and followed an (ISIS) armed vehicle to a roadside area south of Sinjar,"" according to a statement released by the U.S. Central Command. ""At approximately 10:10 a.m. ET, U.S. aircraft struck and destroyed two vehicles in the area."" The statement did not detail what type of vehicles nor did it offer any further details of the ISIS attack on the Yazidi village. The reports of killings and abductions in Kojo follow reports last week of the ISIS attack on Sinjar, where dozens of men were reportedly killed and women and children were abducted. Who are the religious and ethnic groups under threat from ISIS? The Yazidis, one of Iraq's smallest and oldest religious minorities, are among 400,000 people that the United Nations estimates have been driven from their homes since June, when ISIS swept across the border from Syria into Iraq. Of those displaced, more than 200,000 have poured into Iraq's northern Dohuk province in recent weeks. Refugee camp populations have swelled since ISIS began its assault against Yazidis, Christians, Kurds and Shiites. While airdrops and airstrikes saved those stranded from starving and provided safe passage off out of the Sinjar Mountains, the Yazidis and others are arriving by the thousands at camps in and outside Iraq. After the rescue: A Yazidi family's harrowing flight to escape ISIS . Anna Coren reported from Zahko, Iraq, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- For Uganda's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community, 2013 strengthens us with fresh resolve. But a new year also torments us with old anxieties. Uganda is my home, but every day I must fight tooth and nail to remain. I inhabit a land and a paradox where my right to have a consensual relationship with an African woman is illegal -- ""un-African""-- and where my daily work is a life and death matter. Since 2009, my community has faced the potential passage of an anti-homosexuality bill that threatens Ugandans in same-sex relationships with life imprisonment (there are conflicting reports on whether the original death penalty provision remain). This year, many Anglican Church officials and other leaders have declared the legislation's speedy passage as their New Year's resolutions, with the bill scheduled for discussion when Uganda's parliament reconvenes in February. As a transgender man, I am not safe. But as a Ugandan, I am here and I remain optimistic. Existing out in the open is ordinary for most people, but visibility is magical for those of us who once roamed the land like ghosts. ""There are no homosexuals in Uganda,"" our leaders said not too long ago. They cannot say that now. They say I am evil. They say my love is illegal. But in 2013, they can no longer say I am not here. I am fighting to end discrimination as the Ugandan government cracks down on all human rights activity. To speak out about injustice is deemed rebellion against democracy, and to advocate for LGBTI rights is to be out of your mind. The AIDS and LGBTI empowerment workshops I facilitate get shut down by Minister of Ethics and Integrity Rev. Fr. Simon Lokodo even though HIV infections and inequality have not gone away. The increased fervor to pass the anti-gay bill has re-opened the wounds of past tragedies and threatens to create new ones. The fear is still fresh on the second anniversary of the murder of David Kato, my colleague, whose gruesome death changed me and Uganda's LGBTI community forever. Seated in the same office at the gay rights organization, Sexual Minorities Uganda, known as SMUG, David and I had committed to ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. We refused to stay invisible, to remain dehumanized as ghosts. As a result, we found ourselves on a Ugandan newspaper's list of 100 homosexuals. The story's banner: ""Hang Them."" David was subsequently killed. But he was not silenced: I still hear his voice telling us not to hide, or else ""they will keep saying we are not here."" I am here, still, in 2013, but I dread things as simple as shopping at a kiosk for groceries, because the owner has told me he doesn't sell to ""such people."" If I insist, he said, he will ""teach me how to be normal."" A full night's sleep is thwarted by the fear of a stranger who has followed me home or the neighbors who have formed a mob. My personal struggle is a small reflection of the entire LGBTI community's everyday apprehension. With action on Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill looming, the lives of the nation's LGBTI are threatened. These are not nameless faces, but real people like my girlfriend, who trembles at the prospect of coming out. People like one trans woman who in September was brutally beaten in public by friends who discovered her identity, and another who was dragged to the police in full glare of the public. Even heterosexual Ugandans -- including family and friends who fail to disclose LGBTI loved ones to authorities -- would face criminal charges if this bill were to pass. But I can report some good news. Before David Kato's murder, he was alive to see us win a lawsuit against the newspaper that called for our hanging. Indeed, the Ugandan courts' impartiality in our cases helps me stay optimistic. And I hope to win a U.S. lawsuit against American evangelist Scott Lively for the anti-gay terror he exported to my country. The past five years have also brought progress outside the courtroom. Just a decade ago, I couldn't have imagined discussing the rights of LGBTI people with motorbike taxi drivers and members of parliament alike. While I've lived through the homophobia-fueled murders and suicides of friends, I also photographed my country's first Pride march last  August, where we proudly waved both the Ugandan and rainbow flags side by side. In drag and plain view, LGBTI Ugandans celebrated life in the face of legislation that calls for our death. ""As long as you refuse to be a victim, and you seek to empower yourself and others, whatever's going on will get better,"" President Bill Clinton has said. I believe him, and beyond that, I believe in myself. Those who wish me harm may control the laws, but they will never steer my destiny. Despite the injustice that follows LGBTI Ugandans into a new year, our desire for freedom has taken deep root. The roots will one day prove deeper than their hatred, deeper than our closets. That's what keeps me optimistic. And that's why they cannot say I am not here. Uganda is my home and I intend to continue living here as I am. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepe Julian Onziema.","Pepe Julian Onziema: New year fills LGBTI community in Uganda with resolve--and anxiety .

"(CNN) -- Staunton, . Your mother and I are so proud that in less than a week you'll be graduating college, and from my alma mater, no less! So this seems an opportune moment to share some thoughts about what you might look for in a career. And as luck would have it, I've just finished a new book, ""Capital in the 21st Century,"" which has helped crystallize in my mind some things you ought to consider. The book has caused a predictable stir among the pro-equality set because the author, Tom Piketty is a French economist with the gall to propose a global tax on wealth. But putting aside this naÃ¯ve, socialist claptrap, the book is a veritable treasure trove of advice on getting into (or staying in) the top 1%. The book confirms what you already know firsthand: The rich are getting richer; the really rich are getting really richer; capital is hot; labor is not. The obvious implication is that you must find a job where the distinction between capital and labor is blurry. A job where you can take a slice off the top by getting paid as if you owned a piece of action even though you don't. Because without some capital working on your behalf, no amount of even the hardest and most skillful labor will get you anywhere near the top. (How many doctors or engineers join the country club these days? Virtually none.) The great news is that there is a record amount of capital out there to work on your behalf. Piketty estimates that total capital is up almost threefold since I graduated from college 30 years ago. And these days, the real owners of capital don't seem to notice if people take a little off the top or are largely powerless stop it when they do. This was not always the case. Indeed, Adam Smith -- the first economist -- felt that even a ""principal clerk"" (his word for CEO) would always be paid based on his ""labour and skill"" and never in ""proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management."" Fortunately, times have changed in part because economists -- Smith's intellectual heirs -- invented myriad ways like the ""principal agent problem,"" ""competitive assignment models,"" or the ""marginal product of labor"" to justify otherwise outrageous levels of compensation, provided there is enough capital in the picture. Smith must be turning in his grave! Now you may be wondering: ""How much capital will I need working on my behalf?"" It's a tricky question, but Piketty provides the answer. Let's assume that you won't settle for mere membership in the top 1.0% but have your sights set on the top 0.1% with a corresponding annual income of roughly $4 million. Piketty's analysis of long-run returns (4% to 5%) suggests that this would require you to have roughly $100 million of capital working on your behalf. Although this seems daunting -- it's what the average American makes in 2,000 years -- fear not, for there are a few places where this type of money can be found: . Listed stocks: The average Fortune 500 company has a market value of $28 billion (280 times more than you need) and its real owners -- the shareholders -- are virtually powerless to stop senior management from taking 3.0% or more off the top. So even if the company's performance is lackluster, and the pot is split between you and four or five other top guys, there's plenty to go around. So while the corporate ladder can be long and greasy, it's worth the climb. I'd suggest you steer clear of smaller companies as they're just as hard to run as the bigger ones but don't hold enough capital -- the average Russell 3000 company has a market value of only $1.4 billion -- to be worth your while. Venture-capital-backed start-ups are also a decent bet provided you get in early and abandon ship at the first sign that the organization is not steadily progressing toward an IPO, or a buyout from Facebook, Google and the like. You might try a few ventures in your 20s and then go back to business school if it hasn't worked out. Private Equity and Hedge Funds: This industry is a dream come true. The standard take is generous -- a 2.0% fee plus 20% profit share -- which should net out to at least 3.0% assuming average performance and even after deducting the operating expenses of the fund. At 3.0%, you'll need $130 million working for you, which is more than achievable when private equity and hedge fund assets are a record $4.5 trillion (35,000 times more than you need) despite lackluster aggregate performance. This mountain of capital attracts a lot of competition, so don't be discouraged if you fail to break into the industry the first few times. Just keep at it, but please don't be tempted to cheat, as the government appears to be getting tougher on the insider stuff these days. Asset Management: This is a decent fallback if the hedge fund thing hasn't worked out by age 35. The take is much lower -- probably 0.6% after costs -- so you may need $600 million or more working on your behalf but don't be daunted. Despite strong evidence that the industry destroys value compared with lower-cost index funds, it still manages trillions. And the lifestyle is decent as many people secretly accept that they can't beat the market so they don't work that hard trying. Personal Services: If you're satisfied with being toward the middle of the top 1% then consider offering personal services to those with capital or access to it. They tend to be very brand/quality conscious and willing to pay top dollar for services, particularly when spending the real owners' money. Most well-paid service positions are in investment banking, law, and management consulting, though the occasional doctor, psychotherapist, real estate agent, or art adviser can make the cut. It goes without saying that you must steer clear of government and the nonprofit sector at all costs. Although the Citizens United decision suggests that the Supreme Court may one day allow it, explicit profit sharing by government officials remains strictly illegal at the moment. As a result, you should only consider public service as second career after you've made the money you need. The nonprofit sector is even worse because it holds little capital, has no profits, and generates nothing but a ""social"" return that would hardly pay the bills even if you got to keep it all. Finally, never fear that mooching off someone else's capital is somehow second-rate compared with earning income from your own. I've never felt that way, and nothing could be further from the truth. You'll seldom be exposed to meaningful losses (even the London Whale gave back only two years of compensation), and your slice is often in addition to, not in lieu of, a decent salary. Furthermore, if you mooch long enough, you can build your own capital provided you avoid profligate spending, multiple divorces and the like. I'm not denying that there is a certain nostalgic appeal to building your own capital the old-fashioned way by starting a business, or by saving gradually over a lifetime of work. But these are risky and time-consuming strategies in the low-growth, high-capital environment you'll likely be living in. Son, the time for internships is over, and now your real quest begins. In the 21st century, a man without capital runs a grave risk of finding himself squeezed towards the bottom of the top 10% and possibly even lower. This is not a place you want to be. Somewhere out there is a $100 million slice of capital with your name on it just waiting to be found. Your mother and I have given you everything money can buy, and your children deserve no less. I know that you won't disappoint us. Dad .","John MacIntosh writes letter to imaginary son turning Piketty's controversial book on its head .

"(CNN) -- The candidate who will face Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a runoff election next month has said he will not join Karzai's government if the incumbent wins another term, but instead will remain in opposition. Abdullah Abdullah, who served as foreign minister in Karzai's government until quitting nearly four years ago, said he would congratulate Karzai if he ""is elected through a transparent and credible process."" ""My trust in becoming a candidate was not to be part of the same government, part of the same deteriorating situation,"" told CNN's John King in an interview taped for broadcast on Sunday's ""State of the Union."" ""Mine was for a change in this country. Mine was for bringing hopes for the people of this country, and making the people of Afghanistan true participants in their politics, in the governance, in the developmental process, in the security situation and as a whole."" Abdullah and others charged massive fraud in the August 20 vote. The initial results gave Karzai the win, but a subsequent review by a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly one-third of Karzai's votes because of ""clear and convincing evidence of fraud."" The result left Karzai short of the 50 percent need to avoid a runoff. After a flurry of meetings with U.S. and U.N. officials, the Afghan president agreed to the November 7 vote. In a separate CNN interview to be broadcast Sunday on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" Karzai insisted that while there were ""mistakes"" and ""some incidents of fraud"" in the election, ""the election as a whole was clean."" Abdullah rejected that notion. ""To call this as clean elections, I think this, with all due respect to Mr. Karzai, it's a bit of ignorance,"" he told King, adding that ""unfortunately, the government was involved."" ""Yes, it was a step forward that the people of Afghanistan participated in the elections,"" he said. ""One chapter is behind us,"" he said. ""It led to the runoff. And we need to get it corrected in order to open the door for the new chapter. So denying it is not a solution. Rather admitting it and correcting it, that will be responsible leadership."" Karzai said the second round of voting must take place or else ""we would be insulting democracy."" But he also said he had decided after agreeing to the runoff that ""all that was said (about fraud in the election) was mostly wrong."" ""There were some mistakes. There were some instances of fraud, but the nation as a whole was clean and the result was clear. I decided for peace, for stability and for the future of democracy in Afghanistan and for the future of institutional order in Afghanistan to call for a runoff,"" he said. The Taliban called for a boycott Saturday of Afghanistan's upcoming presidential run-off election and repeated threats to disrupt the vote. ""The Islamic Emirate is once again warning all the compatriots to not participate in that American fraud process, and like the first round, they have to listen to their consciences,"" said a Taliban statement. It said the Taliban is ready to ""collapse"" the electoral process and any participant who gets hurt will only have themselves to blame. Meanwhile, in Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama's special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, said that the election process had worked as it was supposed to. ""From the beginning ... I said publicly that this election would be imperfect,"" Holbrooke said. ""I said it on the record. And there were many irregularities. But in the end, the process worked, and I want to stress that. The Election Complaints Commission declared that neither candidate got 50 percent, although one came very close, and that the top two candidates were President Karzai and Dr. Abdullah and they should have a runoff."" Holbrooke added that it was ""reasonable to hope"" for fewer irregularities in a runoff. CNN's Chris Lawrence and Thomas Evans contributed to this report.","Runoff against Hamid Karzai will take place November 7 .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A young Kenyan lawmaker known for his flashy dressing was kicked out of parliament this week after he showed up wearing sunglasses and earrings. Gidion Mbuvi attended a parliament session in a pale suit. An uproar ensued when lawmakers questioned his accessories, which included earrings on both ears and aviator sunglasses. ""I'm representing the youth in this house,"" Mbuvi said at the session Tuesday. ""I think the honorable members should concentrate on constituencies instead of interfering with me."" Other lawmakers concurred while others slammed his attire. ""In the history of this world since God created the world, men have never imitated women,"" said Bifwoli Wakoli, the assistant minister of lands. Mbuvi was admonished and asked to leave the session. ""The speaker vehemently says that the way the honorable Sonko is dressed today does not depict, in the eyes and opinions and the conscience of the chamber ... a dress befitting the dignity of this house and a member of parliament,"" said Farah Maalim, the deputy speaker. ""You will remain out of the house until you are dressed properly."" The controversial member of parliament represents the capital Nairobi.

"(CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II cheered Estimate on to success at the Gold Cup in 2013 but now her her five-year old filly is in the dock. Buckingham Palace confirmed to CNN Tuesday Estimate had tested positive for banned substance morphine. The Monarch was present at Ascot racecourse last year to see her horse claim glory in one of the world's most prestigious races. Estimate narrowly missed out on defending that crown last month, after which the positive sample is thought to have been taken. A statement released by the Palace said initial findings showed the positive test came from consumption of a contaminated feed product. Her Majesty has been informed of the situation, it said. Estimate, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, could now be stripped of that second place finish. A statement by John Warren, the Queen's Bloodstock and Racing Advisor, said the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) had informed the Palace of the result of post-race samples on July 17. ""Five horses, under the care of various trainers, were affected,"" it continued. ""I can confirm that one of those horses was Estimate, the five year-old filly trained by Sir Michael Stoute and owned by The Queen. ""Initial indications are that the positive test resulted from the consumption of a contaminated feed product. ""Sir Michael is working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables.

"(CNN) -- Stephen Gallacher became the first man to make a successful defense of the Dubai Desert Classic title as tournament favorite Rory McIlroy had a day to forget Sunday to fall back into a tie for ninth. Overnight leader Gallacher looked to have blown his chance as he went to the turn with four bogeys, but he recovered magnificently on the back nine of the Majils course to claw back the shots with four birdies. His level-par final round of 72 left him on 16-under 272, a shot clear of Argentina's Emiliano Grillo, who had set the clubhouse pace after finishing with a spectacular eagle for a 66. McIlroy, who had narrowly missed out on a $2.5 million prize for a hole in one Saturday, proceeded to miss out on victory after falling away with a 74. He had started the round two behind playing partner Gallacher, but three bogeys in four holes after the turn scuppered his chances. ""It was just one of those days,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I think anything that sort of could go wrong did. Okay I hit a couple of loose drives, but I didn't really get away with them or stuff like that. Just sort of, you know, one of those days."" Gallacher, who had played the opening two rounds in the illustrious company of world number one Tiger Woods and McIlroy, admitted he had made it hard for himself after an appalling start, but his victory has boosted his chances of making the European Ryder Cup team. ""I never do anything easy I'm afraid,"" Gallacher told the official European Tour website. ""What a day -- my emotions are gone. ""To win it on the 25th anniversary, it was a good field with all the champions playing, makes it even more special."" The 39-year-old, a nephew of former European captain Bernard Gallacher, lives just 50km from Gleneagles, where the 2014 contest is being staged and wants to get his qualification points in early. ""I'm playing in all the events now and hopefully the Masters so that will be brilliant. You don't want to leave it too late so hopefully I can build on it,"" he added. Grillo finished alone in second place, his best result of his career, with France's Romain Wattel and Brooks Koepka of the United States a further stroke back on 14-under-par. Woods birdied his final three holes for a 71, but finished well off the pace on six-under and tied for 41st. ""Unfortunately I turned it around too late,"" he said. Meanwhile, Kevin Stadler overhauled former Masters champion Bubba Watson to win the Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale on the PGA Tour. It was Stadler's first win in 239 starts after he carded a three-under 68 to win by a shot from Watson on 16-under 268. Overnight leader Watson had a five-foot par putt on the final hole to force a playoff, but missed it to leave his partner to lift the trophy.","Stephen Gallacher wins Dubai Desert Classic for second year in a row .

"(CNN) -- ""Drop to the ground; take cover by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and hold on until the shaking stops."" This is the official advice issued by FEMA for anyone unlucky enough to be caught in an earthquake. But even following this advice isn't always going to be enough, particularly if you have nothing solid to shelter beneath. This was the concern guiding Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno when they dreamed up the earthquake-proof table -- an invention that aims to provide affordable protection to people in earthquake-prone areas of the world. ""The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem,"" says co-inventor Arthur Brutter. ""At the beginning I wanted a solution to help in natural disasters ... I looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in Haiti and they really shocked me."" The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic event that devastated the small Caribbean island and its surrounds. Official estimates suggest that up to 200,000 people died in the destruction. After seeing photographs of the aftermath, Brutter resolved to build a product to help save lives of people trapped in structurally unsound buildings during earthquakes. Brutter, alongside his former lecturer Ido Bruno, devised a cheap reinforced table that would be light enough for two school children to be able to lift, yet still strong enough to withstand up to one ton of pressure from above. Brutter says that the geometries of the earthquake-proof table are designed to spread weight evenly across the table's surface, ensuring that the structure holds its shape, even when subjected to significant down-force. The earthquake-proof table ""transforms energy and absorbs it,"" says Brutter. ""When something falls on the table it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side."" In the event of a building's collapse, the tables are also designed to form passageways through the debris to help assist in rescue efforts. The table was initially tested by the Israeli military and is currently awaiting official approval of the world-leading Structural Engineering department of Padua University, Italy, where more tests have been carried out. Brutter and Bruno estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings. Dr Richard Luckett, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, says that this estimation strikes him as reasonable: ""there are a lot of cities in regions where large earthquakes can be expected and many of these are in the developing world."" Since its invention last year the earthquake-proof table has been nominated for a number of awards including the Design Museum's design of the year award in London. It has also been acquired by New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for its permanent collection of architecture and design. Bruno says the awards are nice, but what is more important is to see the product adopted broadly, and used to save lives. ""It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it (the earthquake-proof table) to be used to save lives."" Monique Rivalland contributed to this story .","Israeli designers build affordable earthquake-proof table .

"(CNN) -- I was in Florida this week, not for the vigils and protest at the Sanford courthouse, but as a guest of an organization that changed this country's political, cultural and moral trajectory through its protest and more importantly through its organizing before I was even born. As I sat on a panel on civic engagement at the NAACP convention in Orlando, looking out at the crowd of still passionate, but aging warriors of grassroots organizing who fought injustice, I couldn't help but think in the face of this tragedy fanning a deep hunger for action -- what would Fannie Lou Hamer do? What would Baynard Rustin do? What would Cesar Chavez do? What would some of the organizing pioneers of the movements that changed our country do in the face of such injustice and subsequent unrest growing out of this irreconcilable moral incongruity? The acquittal of George Zimmerman is triggering a truly grassroots hunger for action to help heal the hurt the community feels. There needs to be a modicum of moral satisfaction to help heal the divide. And yes moral, because while pundits can argue all day about the legal correctness of the verdict, one has to submit that letting an armed grown man off scot-free after he stalked and killed a teenager who was doing nothing more than walking home with candy does not sit well in the court of moral opinion. There being no consequence for killing an unarmed child who wasn't bothering anyone has to be in conflict with our nation's moral compass or we have to admit that our moral compass is at best broken and at worst a convenient lie. This moral distress needs a positive outlet. So what is the community to do now? (I initially wrote ""What is the progressive community to do now?"" But I quickly checked myself because, frankly, the so-called mainstream progressive political organizations that always, always have something to say around gender issues or immigration or marriage equality issues have been deafeningly silent up to this point on the issue of the Zimmerman verdict.) The community (and define community as a coalition of the willing, not simply by race) now must take a page from the NAACP organizer's handbook and give this dissatisfaction an avenue toward a positive reaffirming conclusion in the absence of justice from the courts. And frankly, I don't think there is a court solution now that will make Zimmerman do time for the murder. My fear is that the current round of protest and vigils will go the way of Occupy Wall Street which in the end, I'm sorry, was a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing in a political, economic or even a cultural sense. No one in the halls of Congress or Wall Street today fears or is inspired to action because of those protests. And that's a shame, but as is often typical of movements on the left that tend to resemble cat herding, nothing happens much beyond speeches -- as opposed to recent movements on the right such as the tea party uprising. They organized into something that for better or worse has defined much of the policy debate for the last couple of years in this country. What must we do now? Organize! Organize the hurt and frustration into a set of actions that will have policy ramifications and drive the political debate in this country. So yes protest, but at those protests hand out registration forms and targeted street maps for registration drives in those areas where the protests are being held. Split the marchers up into groups, hand out hoodies and have them fan out across the communities in hoodie registration drives. Borrow from Howard Dean's 50-State Strategy and organize neighbor to neighbor canvassing programs where people inside the community are engaging the people they live beside in those communities in a conversation about why this matters. Don't allow politicians who need the votes of our community to avoid addressing laws that will make this sort of profiling and murder more difficult in the future. Hold those politicians accountable at the federal level, but more importantly at the state level where most of these laws are written. And if need be, yes, organize primary challenges to state senators and city councilmen who don't seem to get it. Define an agenda that starts with gun control and anti-profiling legislation and challenge politicians to sign on or get primaried. By the way, you will be surprised by how few votes you need to win most state senate races. In politics we love to simplify complex political narratives with tags like ""Soccer Moms"" or ""Nascar Dads"" that defines an election cycle -- Let's bring organizing power to our protest so that 2014 is defined by the Trayvon voter! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cornell Belcher.","Cornell Belcher: What would civil rights pioneers have done about verdict?

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ray J Norwood has been charged with four misdemeanors in a case in which he's accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks, smashing a police car window and spitting on a cop. The Los Angeles County district attorney on Monday filed the charges against the singer stemming from an incident at a Beverly Hills hotel on May 30, a court filing said. Norwood, 33, is infamous as Kim Kardashian's partner in the sex tape that launched her reality show career. A police spokesman said Norwood's initial hearing is set for Friday, although he does not have to attend since the charges are misdemeanors. The criminal complaint lists four counts: sexual battery, vandalism, resisting arrest and battery. Ray J's publicist declined to comment about the charges. Beverly Hills police arrested him at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on May 30 after a woman complained that he ""grabbed her buttocks,"" a police statement said. Although the initial police report said it was decided that the ""contact was incidental,"" the complaint alleged that it was sexual battery because Ray J did ""unlawfully touch an intimate part"" of the woman for the ""specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual abuse."" The vandalism, battery and resisting arrest charges filed by the Los Angeles County district attorney stem from what happened after police arrived at the hotel. Norwood ""became belligerent with the valets and refused to leave,"" despite repeated requests by hotel security, the police statement said. ""After the uniform police officers took Mr. Norwood into custody and placed him in the rear of a police vehicle, he became belligerent and used his feet to shatter the side window of the police vehicle,"" the police statement said. ""Mr. Norwood was subsequently removed from the police vehicle in order to restrain his feet; at which time he became combative and spat into the face of one of the officers.""

"London, England (CNN) -- The law of the land could be fuel for growth -- at least that's the hope of the Africa Justice Foundation, which launched earlier this month. The initiative was co-founded by leading barrister Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, with the aim of strengthening Africa's legal systems to encourage growth and attract investment in the continent. Through the scheme African lawyers will be able to apply for a scholarship and work placement program. Learning materials and training are being offered to all professionals in the field, and the foundation is also running a number of community justice projects, such as creating an online case-law database in Rwanda. CNN's Max Foster discussed the new initiative with Cherie Blair. CNN: Why did you become involved in the charity? Cherie Blair: The thing I found when talking to governments, starting with the government of Rwanda, was that often people would bring things to them without actually asking them first what it is they actually wanted. For example, when I was talking to the government about it they were saying that actually a big gap in Rwanda is people who are trained legal draftsmen; that's people to actually draft the legislation. It may sound silly but it's a very technical skill and if you don't get proper laws drafted in the right way than there can be a lot of confusion. CNN: So would you say that a lot of government work is being held up in the legal process? CB: When you think of what you need in a legal system in a country that is developing, obviously you need your basic criminal law, your basic law between citizens, but as an economy develops you also need a pretty vigorous and efficient commercial-law sector. Now, if you've been in a country that hasn't had much of that in the past and then you turn around and expect your judges and your administrators to know what to do clearly they are going to need training. CNN: Some concerns among Africans is that you're dealing with some areas that don't even have clean water -- should you not be investing in that instead of the legal system? CB: Well I absolutely think you should be doing both. Absolutely, food, water and electricity are important but at the end of the day all of those issues involve legal problems as well, particularly things like contracts for electricity. If you don't have a legal system that is there to administer that, if you don't have a developing economy that can actually deliver the money that will pay for that then you're not going to be able to feed as many people or provide as much clean water. CNN: As a big, prominent Western figure, what about the concern that you're patronizing the local legal system by training, for example, Rwandan lawyers in Britain, rather than encouraging the Rwandan Law School? CB: Well, of course, we are first of all working with the Rwandan Law School and it is why we are concentrating on this area of commercial law and particularly international law. We are not going in to teach Rwandan family law or indeed Rwandan criminal law. It is more to provide the particular technical expertise which Rwandans are perfectly capable of developing but they need to have some help. If we can train some key people then the idea is, whether it's the law professors or the people in the ministry, the idea is that it will then cascade down. CNN: What shocks you most about the legal systems in Africa, sometimes? CB: We need to see a lot more reform of the legal procedure to make it more responsive, to make it better at using technology, which can help. One of the projects we have in Rwanda, for example, is just to gather a proper database of all the laws in Rwanda which will then be open to the public. We have such databases here (in Britain) and to have something like that there so the law is accessible is important. For that you need investment first of all to gather the laws and then you need to make them available.","The Africa Justice Foundation was co-founded by Cherie Blair .

"(CNN) -- Viewers have learned that television's no-nonsense Judge Judy cuts through the bull and gets to the heart of the matter. Judge Judy says Americans have the fortitude to get through this economic crisis. On Monday night's ""Larry King Live,"" Judge Judy turned her sharp legal mind to matters of the economy, sharing why she thinks Americans have what it takes to navigate the hard months ahead. And she also has some advice for President Obama and sharp-worded assessments of Bernie Madoff and AIG bonuses. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King, host: The polls show the public worried about the economy. You had Warren Buffett on, and we had him on. And he called it an economic Pearl Harbor. When you look around, what's your take? Judge Judy Sheindlin: A lot of people are scared. A lot of people who had money don't have money anymore. A lot of people who didn't have a lot of money have a lot less. And I think everybody is frightened because for the first time -- at least in my memory -- people like Warren Buffett are saying that this is not a good thing. However, I do believe that this is a great country. And I do believe that. I think the fundamentals of America are strong. This country has a wonderful spirit. And I think that, in the end, the spirit will take it through. It may take a couple of years. I wish I were younger so that I would have more years to enjoy it. But I think we'll be fine.  Watch Judge Judy's entire interview with Larry King » . King: Do you think the president is setting the right tone? Judge Judy: I resent it when any part of the government refers to people who have money in the pejorative. When states and cities and our country say we're going to tax the rich -- and that word rich or wealthy doesn't sound like it comes from success of hard work, but from something negative -- I resent it. ... I don't mind paying more taxes. It's not going to impact on my lifestyle. I would say we respect those people who realized, through their hard work, the American dream. And what we're asking them for is a little more of a sacrifice, because the people at the low end can't give anymore. That would make me at least feel as if I was giving more, but it was appreciated. King: So don't seem like it's a slam at being rich. Judge Judy: Right. King: The top-named villain of the piece, when the history of this era is written, will be Bernie Madoff. What do you make of that whole story? Judge Judy: I think he has -- or had -- the ego the size of Noah's ark and very little conscience. King: Why do you think he confessed to all this? He could have gotten on a plane and gone to Brazil, where we don't have an extradition treaty. ... And so he [gets] life in prison . Judge Judy: Maybe he never thought it would happen. I don't know. I think that the book hasn't yet been written on Bernie Madoff. King: Anyway, we've got a King Cam question relating to the Madoff case. Let's watch and then we'll get Judge Judy's answer. Randy: Hi, Judge Judy. My name is Randy. And I just wondered what kind of sentence would you give Bernie Madoff if you were giving him a sentence? Judge Judy: Well, Bernie Madoff is 70 years old. And I think if he's sentenced to 30 years in prison, that's an appropriate period of time. And if he lives to be 100 and he is eligible for parole and makes parole, so be it. ... I was surprised he didn't kill himself, quite frankly, weren't you? King: Yes, I was. ... We took King Cam to the streets to see what all of you are talking about. Most people wanted Judy to answer one thing in particular. Debbie: I was just wondering what you think about the AIG bailout and giving over $160 million in bonuses? Judge Judy: We now own, you and I, 80 percent of AIG. And the excuse given for paying out these bonuses were that they were contracts and you can't void those contracts without consequences. And I think it's sort of interesting that you can't void contracts because these people were engaged in actions that were irresponsible, reckless and caused substantial damage. How can they void the contracts of police officers and firemen and other civil servants who they're forcing to take furlough days despite the fact they have contracts? They're forcing them to take furlough days to make up budgets. King: Are we going to get it [AIG bailout money] back? Judge Judy: I don't think you'll ever see it back. I think that these people know that money is never coming back. But it seems to me if a company isn't working, there comes a point where you have to say that's what Chapter 11 is for. King: Your parents were shaped by the Great Depression, right? How did they handle money? Judge Judy: My parents were generous. My mother always said it's nice to give with a warm hand. So I think that that shapes the way I deal with my children and money. ... I think that maybe we'll get back to more basics. Maybe people will understand that they have to have something in the bank because in hard times, you never know when they're going to turn around. Never. And I also think that while banks and financial institutions have to bear a great deal of the blame for where we are, I don't pass over the individual and individual responsibility. If you're earning $50,000 a year, you have no business buying a million dollar house. ... King: Proposition 8, it bans marriage of two [people of the] same gender. The high court of the state of California heard the appeal of the vote of the people. What do you think? Judge Judy: We've got a lot of trouble in this country. We've got a lot of trouble in the world. Why the state should be interested in proscribing the word marriage from two people who love each other, who are responsible, tax-paying, productive people, who have created a family ... why the state would have an interest in proscribing that kind of conduct, I don't understand. I understand the anger about poverty. I understand the anger about AIG. I understand the problem about the banks. I understand the problem about Afghanistan and the Taliban and everything else. But I don't understand the preoccupation with gays being permitted to marry.","Judge Judy tells Larry King that Americans can buckle down, get through crisis .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A hospital in northern Afghanistan admitted 160 schoolgirls Tuesday after they were poisoned, a Takhar province police official said. Their classrooms might have been sprayed with a toxic material before the girls entered, police spokesman Khalilullah Aseer said. He blamed the Taliban. The incident, the second in a week's time, was reported at the Aahan Dara Girls School in Taluqan, the provincial capital. The girls, ages 10 to 20, complained of headaches, dizziness and vomiting before being taken to the hospital, said Hafizullah Safi, director of the provincial health department. More than half of them were discharged within a few hours of receiving treatment, Safi said. The health department collected blood samples and sent them to Kabul for testing. Last week, more than 120 girls and three teachers were admitted to a hospital after a similar suspected poisoning. ""The Afghan people know that the terrorists and the Taliban are doing these things to threaten girls and stop them going to school,"" Aseer said last week. ""That's something we and the people believe. Now we are implementing democracy in Afghanistan and we want girls to be educated, but the government's enemies don't want this."" But earlier this week, the Taliban denied responsibility, instead blaming U.S. and NATO forces for the poisonings in an attempt to ""defame"" the insurgent group. Taliban tightens grip on Afghan schools . There have been several instances of girls being poisoned in schools in recent years. In April, also in Takhar province, more than 170 women and girls were hospitalized after drinking apparently poisoned well water at a school. Local health officials blamed the acts on extremists opposed to women's education. While nearly all the incidents involve girls, earlier this month, nearly 400 boys at a school in Khost province fell ill after drinking water from a well that a health official said may have been poisoned. The Taliban recently demanded the closure of schools in two eastern provinces. In Ghazni, the school closure was in retaliation for the government's ban on motorbikes often used by insurgents. People in Wardak said the Taliban has been a little more lenient and has allowed schools to open late after making changes to the curriculum. Tortured Afghan teen: 'The same should be done' to attackers . The battle indicates broader fears about Afghanistan's future amid the drawdown of U.S. troops in the country. NATO leaders last week signed off on U.S. President Barack Obama's exit strategy from Afghanistan, which calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school. The schools began reopening after the regime was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. However, observers say abuse of women remains common in the post-Taliban era and is often accepted in conservative and traditional families, where women are barred from school and sometimes subjected to domestic violence. Afghan Education Minister Dr. Farooq Wardak told the Education World Forum in London in January 2011 that the Taliban had abandoned its opposition to education for girls, but the group has never confirmed that.

"Near Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- In the wake of Russia's invasion of Crimea, the mood here Tuesday was tense, but the streets appeared eerily calm. Ukraine's Crimea region has become the flashpoint in a geopolitical crisis that has embroiled London, Washington, the United Nations and NATO. In the days since they crossed the border into this strategically important peninsula on the Black Sea, Russian forces have surrounded 10 Ukrainian military bases -- 16,000 troops in the past week, according to Ukrainian officials. There has been no fighting -- or loss of life -- but there were ample signs of preparation. The situation in Simferopol, Crimea's regional capital, is almost surreal. Rumor, confusion and outlandish claims mix freely -- and reality is difficult to pin down. On the surface, the capital seems undisturbed. Shops are open, people sit in cafes, the buses and trams are running normally. And then there are pockets -- especially around the parliament and other Crimean government buildings -- where the discord hangs in the air. These places have moved firmly into the pro-Russian camp, where the Russian and Crimean flags are flying and the yellow-and-blue flag of Ukraine is not. Knots of men, most of them burly, middle-aged and chain-smoking, gather outside the buildings recently taken over by pro-Russian parties. They say they are defending the rights of Russians in a country led by people they see as ultranationalist Ukrainians. They say they relish the prospect of a referendum this month that could see Crimea ""decoupled"" from Ukraine. On the streets appears a truckload of men in uniform, not Ukrainian, for sure, but not identifiably Russian. They are close to Ukrainian military compounds, where troops remain inside, largely out of sight. Similar standoffs are playing out around barracks and bases in far-flung corners of Crimea. Here, there has been no violence. Instead, the hint of camaraderie among fellow soldiers can be discerned. People anxiously await what comes next . But among Ukrainians and Tatars, a predominantly Muslim group, living here, there is a sense of foreboding, one that most of them are reluctant to express. There are no pro-Kiev demonstrations, perhaps for fear of the consequences. And so people go on living their lives as best they can, waiting anxiously for what comes next. On Tuesday, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) southeast of Simferopol, about 100 Russian soldiers at a Ukrainian military base were digging in against a backdrop of rolling hills. They parked their troop-moving vehicles, excavated a series of mini trenches in the dirt and erected mess tents. Apparently oblivious to the international tensions over Russia's moves, they were carrying on civil conversations with Ukrainian soldiers and moving about freely. It all appeared fairly friendly. The Russian soldiers treated their presence as nothing special, even as it made nearby residents uncomfortable. A supporter of the Ukrainian forces had driven all the way from Yalta to offer food. ""I'm Russian and I want to say I don't need any protection from any brother nation or anyone else on my land. We will solve our problems through talks not fights,"" the man told CNN. Blocking food deliveries at the gate was a pro-Russian ""self-defense"" group, which hopes a referendum will split Crimea from Ukraine. ""It will mean either we have full autonomy or we disconnect from Ukraine and join fully with Russia. That can only be positive,"" said Sergei Golovko, a member of the group. Much of the tension here stems from generations of heritage and tradition. Ethnic Russians have lived in Crimea for centuries, and many of the current generation look upon Moscow's forces as friendly protectors. That view may not be shared by many of those Crimean residents with Ukrainian roots. This unease manifests itself in small ways. On one side, wives of Ukrainian soldiers complained it would be difficult for their husbands to swear allegiance to pro-Russian leadership when they had already done so to Kiev. On the other, residents sometimes approached Russian soldiers and shook their hands -- slapping them on the back in signs of support. The Russian soldiers seemed to be trying to keep it low-key. Their uniforms bore no Russian army insignia that might inflame anti-Russian Ukrainians. Standoff near air base . But forces remained poised to react to the slightest provocation. As more than 100 unarmed Ukrainian soldiers tried Tuesday morning to return to Belbek Air Base, a Ukrainian military base north of Sevastopol, Russian forces fired warning shots over their heads. Video shot by one of the Ukrainian soldiers showed the Ukrainians continuing to move forward. In the video, a Russian, holding his weapon, orders them to halt their advance: ""I have orders; I will shoot you in the legs if you come any further."" The Ukrainian commander responded that they had no weapons and that the Russians were in control. The two sides then negotiated, and 15 of the Ukrainian soldiers were granted passage onto the base. The commander told CNN he had been ordered to surrender the base by noon, but the deadline passed without incident. He said he had been told to sign a document swearing allegiance to the local government, but he was unwilling to do so and continued to take orders from Kiev. On the road to the base, pro-Russian civilians blocked the entrance to journalists. On the other side of a barricade stood Ukrainian soldiers. Beyond them, at the main entrance to the base, were Russian soldiers, CNN was told. The commander said he had tried to speak through an intermediary with the Russian forces to arrange a meeting to defuse the situation but had not succeeded. The base's structure complicated the situation -- it is home not only to Ukrainian service members but also to their families. And even the source of much of the tension was uncertain. One Ukrainian military commander said he had received anonymous phone calls threatening him and his family if he did not surrender to Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to acknowledge the forces here are even Russian, but a commander of troops -- who are wearing Russian uniforms without identifying insignia and driving vehicles bearing Russian plates -- was frank. He told CNN he came from a Russian city near Crimea and had been dispatched by his commanding officer from Sevastopol to a ferry port on the eastern side of the Crimean peninsula. A different feel in Kiev . The mood was different hundreds of miles away in Ukraine's capital of Kiev, which is more European in its location and self-image. Protesters waved posters depicting caricatures of Putin and declared their willingness to fight against Russian forces, if necessary. The newly installed, pro-European interim central government is shaky, at best. Ousted President Viktor Yanukovych fled more than a week ago in the wake of protests in Kiev's Independence Square, where snipers from nearby rooftops killed scores of demonstrators. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived Tuesday in Kiev and surveyed a makeshift memorial to the dead before meeting with the Ukrainian interim administration about the Russian incursion and a promised $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to help the country rebuild its shattered economy. Flowers and flags marked the spot of the killings. One person left a poem that read, ""Mother, I'm sorry I had to go. I was shot by the police because I couldn't turn back."" An acting president and an acting prime minister have taken the reins of power. A crisis in Crimea is the last thing the new government needs or residents want. ""The amount of propaganda Russia has poured onto Ukraine is hard to comprehend,"" said Maia Mikhaluk, a freelance photographer and Christian ministry worker in Ukraine. ""Putting troops on Ukrainian land is going to bring the very opposite result from what Putin expected: I believe it's uniting Ukraine."" Russian state-run TV offered a different view, blaming the crisis on far-right radicals aided by the West. Russian news reports note that Ukrainians had called for a ban on teaching the Russian language in schools. That proposed ban has been rescinded, but the reports created an emotional reaction among Russians. CNN's Diana Magnay, Ben Wedeman and Tim Lister reported from Crimea, Elise Labott from Kiev, Phil Black from Moscow, and Thom Patterson and Tom Watkins wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: A supporter of Ukrainian forces says talks, not fights, will solve problems .

"(CNN) -- Sweden won't exactly confirm that it's been looking for a foreign submarine in the country's territorial waters. But if it finds something it doesn't like, it is ready to do whatever is needed to force it to the surface, a Swedish military spokeswoman said Tuesday. Swedish media have reported that the military has been looking for a mystery underwater vessel, possibly Russian. The search began Thursday after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, reported The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. ""We don't know what it is,"" but we ""are prepared to use anything necessary to bring the vessel to the surface if we need to,"" Swedish military spokeswoman Therese Fagerstedt told CNN on Tuesday. Helicopters, battleships and minesweepers searched waters off Sweden's capital, Stockholmm on Tuesday, The Local reported. Thursday's radio transmissions were being sent to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm on the Baltic's southern shore, according to The Local report. There were also reports that a foreign vessel was spotted in the waters near Stockholm. Russia on Sunday denied it has any vessel in Swedish waters. Moscow suggested the vessel may belong to the Netherlands and have been involved in naval exercises off Sweden, according to a report from Russia's Itar-TASS news agency. The Dutch were quick to respond, saying a sub involved in the exercises was anchored in Tallinn harbor of NATO-ally Estonia for the weekend, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. U.S. officials told CNN there are no U.S. submarines or surface ships in the immediate area. U.S. intelligence doesn't know of any Russian assets in that area, the officials said. Why would a Russian sub snoop around in Swedish waters? Johan Wiktorin of the Swedish Royal Academy of War Sciences gave three possibilities to The Local: . ""They could be mapping the waters in order to be able to navigate them in the event of hostilities,"" Wiktorin is quoted as saying. ""They could also be installing equipment, like sensors, that could track or get an observation of our units in that area,"" ""Or they could also possibly reconnoiter our (defense) systems."" CNN's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","Helicopters, battleships and minesweepers hunt for vessel .

"(CNN) -- A teenager is being held on 19 counts of animal cruelty linked to a month-long killing spree of pet cats in the Miami area, police said. Tyler Hayes Weinman, 18, was charged with 19 counts of animal cruelty in Miami, Florida, on Monday. Tyler Hayes Weinman, 18, also is charged with 19 counts of improper disposal of dead animals and four counts of burglary, police said. Weinman lives in Cutler Bay and has lived with his parents in Palmetto Bay, the two towns where police said 19 cats were mutilated and killed. Pet owners and police began discovering disfigured cats May 13. One pet owner, Donna Gleason, said her family cat, Tommy, was ""partially skinned"" and left dead in her yard. Police said 34 cats have been found dead in the towns, but only 19 mutilated cats could be linked to a serial killer. Police confirmed that some of the cats were killed by dogs, said Maj. Julie Miller of Cutler Bay police. Weinman, who works odd jobs but spends most of his time at home and unemployed, had been a person of interest for several weeks, Miller said. He was arrested Saturday.  Watch the teen suspect's first court appearance » . The police are looking into whether any people Weinman associates with might have been accomplices in the killings.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When people think of coffee, words such as caffeine, aroma and energy may spring to mind. 'Good breath,' however, certainly isn't one of them. Mel Rosenberg at work in his 'smell laboratory' found that coffee can lead to good breath. So researchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel, were in for a surprise when their study into the relation between coffee and bad breath, showed that coffee can actually lead to good breath. Breath specialist Mel Rosenberg of the university's Faculty of Medicine found that there are certain components in coffee that inhibit the bacteria that lead to bad breath -- preventing these bacteria from making their presence felt, or smelt. ""Everybody thinks that coffee causes bad breath,"" Rosenberg told CNN ""and as a latte drinker, I believe that too."" But the malodor doesn't necessarily come from the coffee itself, said Rosenberg: ""We think that coffee, which has a dehydrating effect on the mouth, can ferment into bad breath when mixed with substances such as milk."" This meant that until recently, coffee was up there with not eating a healthy breakfast, not drinking enough water and consuming alcohol as causes for unpleasant mouth odors. But until Rosenberg's study, no one had ever scientifically shown the link between the consumption of coffee and bad breath. Rosenberg's team wanted to prove just that. They did the research by taking saliva and incubating it with different brands of coffee including the Israeli brand Elite coffee, Landwer Turkish coffee, and Taster's Choice. ""We thought this coffee and saliva mixture would have a terrible odor, but incredibly it had the opposite effect."" Rosenberg -- who also created popular mouthwash Dentyl pH -- is now thinking about creating a mouthwash, toothpaste, or chewing gum based on coffee. The effects could be similar to plant extracts such as clove oil, which have also been shown to have anti-bacterial properties that prevent bad breath. But first Rosenberg would have to find which of the hundreds of components in coffee are the ones that have these beneficial properties. ""That will take a long time"" said Rosenberg. ""But this research has already been a lesson in humility, showing that assumptions are not always correct."" Rosenberg -- who also writes children's books such as 'Mel the Smell Dragon' -- told CNN. ""And sometimes, getting it wrong can create even more interesting outcomes.""","A new study surprised researchers when it found coffee can lead to good breath .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama plans to nominate James Comey to replace Robert Mueller as FBI director, officials familiar with the nomination process said Wednesday. Comey is a former prosecutor who worked in New York and Virginia, where his caseload included terrorism, organized crime and fraud prosecutions, the latter including executives from WorldCom, Adelphia and Imclone, an official biography notes. He served as a deputy attorney general in President George W. Bush's administration beginning in 2003. Comey testified to a Senate committee in 2007 that he considered resigning his high-profile administration position over a disagreement about the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program. That happened in 2004, when he was acting attorney general while John Ashcroft was hospitalized following emergency gall bladder surgery. Government officials had told CNN that Comey had ""vigorously opposed"" aspects of the warrantless wiretapping program and refused to sign off on its continued use. Comey's opposition prompted then-White House chief of staff Andrew Card and then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to visit Ashcroft, the attorney general, in the hospital. Comey was in the room at the time, and he recalled later that ""I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man."" The program was reauthorized the next day without a Justice Department signature, and Comey prepared a letter of resignation, he recalled. But he didn't turn it in, staying at the Justice Department until 2005. From there, Comey worked as a senior vice president and general counsel for the aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin. More recently, he had been general counsel at the Connecticut-based money management firm Bridgewater Associates. Currently, Comey is a board member of HSBC Holdings and a Hertog Fellow in national security law at Columbia University's law school, his profile on the school's website says. Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he hadn't heard anything from the White House about Comey's nomination. That said, the Iowa Republican lauded Comey for having ""a lot of experience on national security issues, ... and (he) has shown integrity in dealing with these matters."" ""But if he's nominated, he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry,"" Grassley said, referring to Comey's time with Bridgewater Associates. ""The administration's efforts to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal, and (the FBI) would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues in this lucrative industry."" If nominated and approved by Congress, Comey will replace the man who will have led the FBI for the past 12 years -- officially starting the job days before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and later seeing the agency through terrorism and other high-profile cases. Mueller's term had been set to expire in September 2011 -- per the 10 years that FBI directors typically serve -- but, at Obama's request, Congress approved a two-year extension. He's now scheduled to step down in September.","NEW: A GOP senator questions Comey's work in the hedge fund industry .

"(CNN) -- She was sitting across from me on the bus in Odessa when we struck up a conversation. Her daughter, maybe 2 years old, was playing with her cell phone. Dressed casually in jeans and a shirt, she told me she had finished university and was entering law school. Her husband was a linguist. They lived in Kiev, but had come to the coastal town of Odessa for vacation. She asked what I do. This was midway through my four years of living in Odessa. I told her about my organization, This Child Here, and how we work with orphanages and shelters to help Ukrainian children. Aside from spending on what you would expect on the kids -- clothes, food and medicine -- I told her that I've paid for horse therapy, sailing lessons, martial arts, English and math lessons, dance classes and more. She listened patiently. Then she said, ""I am an orphan."" This shocked me. ""Where did you grow up?"" ""In an orphanage in a small town in west Ukraine,"" she said. ""I had two sisters, there was no father around; mom couldn't take care of us. My sisters and I were separated."" I told her, ""I have never met an orphan who went to university and started law school. Would you mind telling me how you did this?"" Above the noise of the bus, she said, ""You can't believe those people who tell you, 'Your mother is an alcoholic, your father doesn't want you. You will never be anybody.' You have to believe in yourself."" Russia warns of civil war if Ukraine uses force to quell eastern revolts . A common reason children end up on their own, in an orphanage, or on the streets, is that they were abused. Ukraine is a country that has been abused. The Revolution of 1917, WWII, Stalin's starvation of millions, the collapse of the USSR, have all left their marks on Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin is continuing the abuse now by sending troops, tanks and soldiers to Ukraine. First Putin took Crimea. Now, pro-Russian protesters are calling for regional independence in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Donetsk, Kharkiv and Luhansk. This comes on top of the news that a Ukrainian naval officer was shot dead by a Russian soldier in Crimea. No one knows what will happen next. Putin is working from the view that Russia is the parent and Ukraine is a child. But Ukraine isn't interested in hearing that narrative any more. The abuse that Ukraine has suffered in history is bad enough. But the attitude that says ""We own you"" is even worse. This conflict is not about Russians versus Ukrainians. Many people in Ukraine speak Russian. They were Russian, now they are Ukrainian. Language isn't the issue. Some Russians have been living in Crimea for generations. They live in harmony with their Ukrainian neighbors. Crimea is their home. There are also Russians who moved to Ukraine for personal, family or business reasons. Ukraine is a developing country, with more freedom to start a business or to be left alone. Wages are low, but there are many opportunities for growth and investment. Until the events in Kiev and Crimea, people didn't think in terms of who was born in Russia and who was born in Ukraine. Now, that may be changing. Putin was enraged by the political fallout in Kiev in February when the Ukrainian parliament impeached pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych after he fled the capital, setting the country up for a new presidential election on May 25. By annexing Crimea, Putin is punishing Ukraine for standing up for itself. But Ukraine is a country learning to believe in itself. Brooks said it to his team, at least in the film version, ""Miracle on Ice,"" as they faced the older, seasoned Russians on the ice. I say it to Ukrainians so engaged in this struggle, ""You were meant to be here. ... This is your time. Their time is done. It's over.""","Pro-Russian protesters are calling for independence in eastern Ukrainian cities .

"(CNN) -- It's a horror show that has played out across Syria for 19 months. Those grieving the dead are themselves targeted by gunfire or deadly blasts. That cycle of death played out again Tuesday when mourners gathered to grieve a man who dared speak out against the Syrian government. A car bomb silenced them. ""Children's bodies were maimed and burnt. I saw pieces of human flesh and blood on the street,"" witness Ahmed Al-Muadami said. This day, mourners came to honor one of 14 men who died after his arrest by Air Force Intelligence -- a much feared security apparatus that dissidents accuse of hunting down anti-government activists. Word spread quickly Tuesday that a Damascus hospital had a collection of unidentified bodies. The families of the 14 men rushed to the scene -- only to discover the bodies of their loved ones bore signs of torture. The outrage boiled over in the Damascus suburb of Muadamiyet al-Sham, where a funeral procession for one of the men morphed into a protest against President Bashar al-Assad's government. Then came the explosion near the Al-Zaitoona mosque, which is a popular gathering site for anti-government protests. ""It was a car bomb parked next to the mosque where the people were gathered. The explosion killed at least 13 people and wounded over a hundred,"" Al-Muadami said. ""One child was extremely disfigured ... we couldn't identify him."" Amateur videos reportedly from the scene show a grisly aftermath. One man carried the lifeless body of a child, his face charred black and gray. ""Look at this, Assad!"" the man screamed. ""Is this your gift to us for the Eid? Look at this, you murderer!"" The Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha begins Friday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos or reports of violence, as the Syrian government has restricted access to international journalists. The Damascus suburbs have seen fierce fighting for months. Opposition activists say the government has committed massacres, while the government says it is fighting armed terrorists. International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi is trying to broker a cease-fire by Friday. But the odds seem daunting. On Tuesday alone, at least 100 people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs; 50 were from Muadamiyet al-Sham, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The activist network said residents in the town called for blood donors after the explosion.","13 people are killed in an explosion at a funeral of an opposition activist .

"(CNN) -- A high school senior's lawsuit against her mother and father for financial support and college tuition hit a hurdle Tuesday when a New Jersey judge denied the teenager's request for immediate financial assistance from the parents. Rachel Canning, 18, alleges in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, and that she is unable to support herself financially. The lawsuit asks that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school, pay her current living and transportation expenses, commit to paying her college tuition and pay her legal fees for the suit she filed against her parents. Her parents say she left home because she didn't want to obey their rules. Judge Peter Bogaard denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses at a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court. Another hearing will be held in April on other issues in the suit, including whether Canning left home of her own accord, the judge said. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School in Denville, says in court documents she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment, alleging, among other things, that her mother called her ""fat"" and ""porky"" and that her father threatened to beat her. ""I have been subjected to severe verbal and physical abuse by my mother and father,"" Canning wrote in a court certification. ""I am not willingly and voluntarily leaving a reasonable situation at home to make my own decisions. I had to leave to end the abuse."" Canning left her parents' home at the end of last October. After spending two nights at her boyfriend's home, she moved into the home of her friend in a nearby town, where she has been staying ever since, according to court documents written by the parents' attorney. Fair or outrageous? New Jersey teen sues her parents to pay up for college . Canning seeks a court's official declaration that she is unemancipated, meaning her parents would still be required to support her financially. She also is suing to reimburse her friend's parents, John and Amy Inglesino, for legal fees that they have been paying since the lawsuit was initiated, according to the suit. Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth Canning, claim that allegations of abuse are completely unfounded. ""We were always her support team, cheering her on or defending her whenever she had a problem,"" wrote Elizabeth Canning in a court certification. She claims that her daughter was never forced out of the family's home, but rather ""took it upon herself to run away so that she could live her life without any parental supervision and without any rules."" Canning was suspended from school for truancy last October, according to court documents filed by her parents' attorney, Laurie Rush-Masuret. Her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend, who was also suspended from school. Car and phone privileges were also taken away. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. Once she left home, her parents notified Morris Catholic High School that they would no longer pay for their daughter's tuition, the documents state. ""They stopped paying my high school tuition to punish the school and me, and have redirected my college fund indicating their refusal to afford me an education,"" Rachel Canning stated in court documents. The situation around the teen and her family initiated an investigation by New Jersey's Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP), which received allegations that Rachel was being abused. The teen wrote in court documents that her school contacted the state agency. When DCPP staffers interviewed the teen, her parents, and her two younger sisters, they ultimately ""determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded,"" a letter from DCPP states. Sean Canning, a retired Lincoln Park police chief and current business administrator for the town of Mount Olive, told CNN affiliate WCBS that he and his wife are ""distraught."" ""We're being sued by our child. I'm dumbfounded. So is my wife. So are my other daughters,"" he said. ""Living in our house, there's very few things. There's minor chores, there's curfews. When I say curfew, it's usually after 11 o'clock at night."" Sean Canning wrote in court documents that the Inglesinos, for taking in his daughter, had ""enabled the situation to an absurd level. Under the guise of good intentions, they have arrogantly placed themselves in our stead and operated under the belief that their parenting style is superior to our own."" CNN's attempts to reach John or Amy Inglesino were unsuccessful. Stephanie Frangos Hagan, a family law attorney and New Jersey State Bar Association family law officer, said to her knowledge, a case like this is unprecedented. Though Canning is 18 years old, New Jersey law does not consider a person to be emancipated unless that person has left ""the scope of his or her parents' authority,"" according to Hagan. ""A parent is not obligated to contribute to the support of an emancipated child,"" said Hagan. ""A child is emancipated when he or she is beyond the control of the parents. Is she truly beyond the scope of her parents' authority, as a result of her own voluntary acts? That's for the judge to decide."" ""The argument (she) is making is that she didn't leave home voluntary. She's saying 'I was thrown out,'"" Hagan said. Neither Rachel Canning nor her parents testified at Tuesday's hearing, but it saw a reunion between the daughter and her estranged parents, the first one in over four months. While Sean Canning was seen speaking to Rachel, Elizabeth was seen briefly weeping after being seated. The parents' attorney, Rush-Masuret, told CNN that Elizabeth Canning is too upset about the situation to even talk about it. She said the Cannings have told their daughter to come home, and she has refused. ""To be clear, my clients never abandoned nor abused their child and they have asked her to come home. They simply sought to exert their own parental judgment and reasonable household rules which she is not willing to accept,"" Rush-Masuret said in court Tuesday. Rachel Canning's attorney, Tanya N. Helfand, said Sean and Elizabeth Canning are being ""negligent and irresponsible."" ""Normal healthy parents want to help their children. They want their children to go to college. They want to help them with their difficulties,"" Helfand said in court. ""You may not get along wonderfully every single day with your teenager. That doesn't mean that you abandon them and you say, 'Guess what, you're on your own.'"" Judge Bogaard denied the request for the last semester of high school tuition because the school said she could continue anyway, since she is an honor student. And Rachel Canning wrote in her court certification that ""The peer ministers at Morris Catholic have decided to raise funds to pay ... tuition so I don't have to leave early."" As for why he denied the request for immediate financial assistance, the judge indicated he didn't see an emergency situation, and would make further decisions at the next hearing. The teen wrote in her court certification that she aspires to be a biomedical engineer. Her first choice for college is the University of Delaware, from which she has yet to hear back from regarding her admission decision. She said taking legal action was necessary to ensure that she is able to accomplish her future goals. ""I am a very good student. I have no drug problems. I am a good athlete. I work at a job outside of school,"" she wrote. ""My parents simply will not help me any longer...(They) should be required to provide for my support and education until I can stand on my own two feet. In order to do this, I had to take legal action."" Girl costs father $80,000 with 'SUCK IT' Facebook post .

"(CNN) -- There is a new strategy in the battle over abortion rights. I don't quite know what to call it, but I haven't seen anything like it since the fictional 47-year-old Maude Findlay chose to abort her fetus on TV's ""Maude"" in 1972. Back then, the idea was to portray a woman's choice realistically, but boy, did CBS pay a price. As the Chicago Tribune noted, the United States Catholic Conference promptly organized a campaign against ""Maude."" It worked. ""Maude's Dilemma,"" which played in two parts, drew huge audiences, but when CBS repeated them in 1973, ""nearly 40 affiliates chose not to air them, not one corporate sponsor bought commercial time, and CBS received more than 17,000 letters of protest."" Lesson learned! After that, while abortion was not exactly taboo, it certainly was, shall we say, a decision no TV character made without dire consequences. I still remember watching the soap opera, ""The Young and the Restless,"" with my grandma. The character Ashley Abbott unexpectedly got pregnant, had an abortion and promptly started carrying around a baby doll. She ended up in a mental institution. Fast forward to 2014, and things are changing. Not only are some TV shows, like ""Parenthood,"" portraying abortion without shame, but activists are too. As in posting their abortions online for everyone to see, as Emily Letts did. ""When I realized I was pregnant, I realized this was an amazing opportunity to help women,"" Emily Letts told my producer. ""I wished I could show (women) what it looks like, that a first trimester surgical abortion takes 3 to 5 minutes, and your greatest risk of having the procedure is infection."" Letts, then 25 and an abortion counselor at Cherry Hill Women's Center in New Jersey, videotaped her surgical abortion procedure and posted it to YouTube early this year, later entering it into a contest sponsored by an organization called, ""The Abortion Care Network."" She came in first place. Extreme? You betcha. After all, extremism works in America. In-your-face behavior seems to be the only message that gets through the other noise. Abortion rights activists have told me that such ""extremist tactics"" have been an effective tool of the anti-abortion side of the debate for decades. If the group, Created Equal, can project bloody, allegedly aborted fetuses on a 10-by-12-foot screen next to Philadelphia's Liberty Bell to try and prove that abortion is murder, then why shouldn't women who have abortions use extreme methods to try and prove it's not? ""There's an entire war against women's' uteruses in America,"" Letts said. ""We believe that in order to truly change legislation and the politics of shame and violence on women, we need to change the culture. We believe we need to start speaking, we need to share our stories."" According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, 46 states now allow individual healthcare providers to refuse to participate in an abortion. Twenty-six states require a waiting period for women seeking an abortion. And 39 states now require that abortions be performed by a licensed physician. And if you think THAT last stat is not the biggest win of all for the anti-abortion side, you'd be wrong. After Texas passed a law this summer requiring, among other things, doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 13 miles of the clinic where an abortion is performed, clinics were initially forced to close. Had the U.S. Supreme Court not intervened, only 8 clinics would have served a state with a population of 26 million. As Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee told me, her side is winning. The tide, she says, has turned, and no pro-choice, extremist agenda will reverse it. ""I don't think women standing up and saying I've had an abortion, and I'm proud of it is going to have much of an impact,"" Tobias told me. She says abortion can't be de-stigmatized. ""They (women) still know it's wrong."" Eric Ferraro, from Planned Parenthood, says it isn't quite that simple. ""Women have a wide range of experiences when they have an abortion. Some feel a deep sense of relief, some feel a deep sense of regret ... and everything in between."" Is it possible every one of the more than 40 million women around the world who have abortions every year wind up carrying around a baby doll like the soap opera character Ashley Abbott? Not Jenny Kutner, who writes for Salon.com. She decided to write about her decision to have an abortion after her IUD failed. ""I always felt strongly about sharing these stories,"" Kutner told me. She said she wanted to remove ""a stigma around abortion"" she doesn't think should exist. ""I did not want to feel shame."" And two months after she terminated her pregnancy, she still feels she made the right decision. ""I had a remarkably average story to tell. Stories that ""don't get told because of the stigma'."" Politicians are sharing their stories too. And I'm not just talking about Wendy Davis, the state senator and now Texas gubernatorial candidate, whose filibuster against abortion restrictions catapulted her onto the national stage. Gone is the Clinton mantra, ""safe, legal and rare."" Today, politicians, like Lucy Flores, are talking about their own abortions. As Slate.com reported, Flores, a state representative in Nevada, told voters she had an abortion at 16. All six of her sisters had gotten pregnant as teenagers, and she did not want to face the same hardships they endured. ""I don't regret it,"" Flores told Slate. ""I don't regret it because I am here making a difference, at least in my mind, for many other young ladies and letting them know that there are options and they can do things to not be in the situation I was in, but to prevent it."" The question is: Can abortion really be ""de-stigmatized?"" It's difficult for me to accept that abortion is a ""simple medical procedure,"" but I'm not all women. My abortion rights friends find parts of the strategy to remove the stigma ""horrifying"" (the abortion contest), but other parts of the strategy effective (Kutner's sharing her ""unremarkably average"" story). My anti-abortion friends are unmoved. They could not think of any strategy that would change how they feel about voluntarily ending a pregnancy. As a wise man in the news business once told me, ""It's an issue you can't win,"" because ""no one changes their mind."" But, then again...","Carol Costello: New strategy over abortion rights recalls Maude dustup in 1972 .

"(CNN) -- A marine expedition of environmentalists has confirmed the bad news it feared -- the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" extends even further than previously known. Organized by two non-profit groups -- the Algalita Marine Research Foundation and the 5 Gyres Institute -- the expedition is sailing from the Marshall Islands to Japan through a ""synthetic soup"" of plastic in the North Pacific Ocean on a 72-feet yacht called the Sea Dragon, provided by Pangaea Exploration. The area is part of one of the ocean's five tropical gyres -- regions where bodies of water converge, with currents delivering high concentrations of plastic debris. The Sea Dragon is visiting the previously unexplored western half of the North Pacific gyre -- situated below the 35th parallel, and home to a massive expanse of plastic particles known as the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" -- to look for plastic pollution and study its effect on marine life. Leading the expedition is Marcus Eriksen, a former U.S. marine and Ph.D student from University of Southern California. ""We've been finding lots of micro plastics, all the size of a grain of rice or a small marble,"" Eriksen said via satellite phone. ""We drag our nets and come up with a small handful, like confetti -- 10, 20, 30 fragments at a time. That's how it's been, every trawl we've done for the last thousand miles."" Eriksen, who has sailed through all five gyres, said this confirmed for him ""that the world's oceans are 'plasticized.' Everywhere you go in the ocean, you're going to find this plastic waste."" Growing glaciers smother climate debate . Besides documenting the existence of plastic pollution, the expedition intends to study how long it takes for communities of barnacles, crabs and molluscs to establish, whether the plastic can serve as a raft for species to cross continents, and the prevalence of chemical pollutants. On a second leg from Tokyo to Hawaii departing May 30, the team expect to encounter material dislodged by the Japanese tsunami. ""We'll be looking for debris that's sub-surface: overturned boats, refrigerators, things that wind is not affecting,"" Eriksen said. ""We'll get an idea of how much is out there, what's going on and what it's carrying with it, in terms of toxins."" Scripps Institute graduate Miriam Goldstein was chief scientist on a similar expedition to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 2009. According to her research, there has been a 100-fold increase in plastic garbage in the last 40 years, most of it broken down into tiny crumbs to form a concentrated soup. The particles are so small and profuse that they can't be dredged out. ""You need a net with very fine mesh and then you're catching baby fish, baby squid -- everything,"" Goldstein says. ""For every gram of plastic you're taking out, you probably take out more or less the equivalent of sea life."" Scientists are worried that the marine organisms that adapt to the plastic could displace existing species. Goldstein said this was a major concern, as organisms that grow on hard surfaces tend to monopolize already scarce food, to the detriment of other species. ""Things that can grow on the plastic are kind of weedy and low diversity -- a parallel of the things that grow on the sides of docks,"" she says. ""We don't necessarily want an ocean stuffed with barnacles."" Sea-level rise: Impacts and mitigation measures around the world . Eriksen says the mood on the Sea Dragon has been upbeat, with crew members playing a ukulele and doing yoga, ""but the sobering reality is that we're trawling through a synthetic soup."" Also on board is Valerie Lecoeur, founder of a company that makes eco-friendly baby and children's products, including biodegradable beach toys made from corn, and Michael Brown from Packaging 2.0, a packaging consultancy. Eriksen says they have been discussing the concept of ""extended producer responsibility"". ""As the manufacturer of any good in the world today, you really can't make your product without a plan for its entire use, because you could eventually have 7 billion customers buy your product,"" he said. ""If one little button has no plan, the world now has a mountain of buttons to deal with. There is no room for waste, as a concept or a place -- there's just no place to put it anymore. That's the reality we need to face. We've got this plastic everywhere.""","A research expedition has found plastic in the last unexplored part of the ocean .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- U.S. and Iraqi officials met Sunday to kick off a review stemming from a deadly September firefight -- involving a Blackwater USA security detail -- that reportedly left 17 people dead. Lawyer Hassan Jabbar lies in a hospital last month after he was allegedly injured by Blackwater contractors. While Iraqi officials say the victims were innocent bystanders -- most of them civilians -- Blackwater says its contractors were part of a U.S. State Department security entourage that came under fire in a Baghdad square. Meanwhile, a three-person panel's official Iraqi probe into the incident -- ordered by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki -- raised the number of Iraqis killed to 17 and determined Blackwater's gunfire was unwarranted and that its guards should face trial, the government told The Associated Press. However, an order from the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority appears to shield security contractors from Iraqi laws. The first meeting of the Joint Commission on Protective Security Detail Operations was chaired Sunday by Iraqi Defense Minister Abdulqadir Mohammed Jassim and Patricia Butenis, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy, according to a joint statement. The pair ""expressed the mutual commitment of the Iraqi government and the U.S. government to work together to evaluate issues of safety and security related to personal security detail operations in Iraq,"" the statement said.  Watch how supervision has been tightened on contractors » . The objective is to recommend ways to ensure that private security details do not endanger public safety, the statement said, adding that Jassim and Butenis ""agreed to continue their coordination and to complete the process of inquiry in order to prevent the recurrence of any incidents in the future."" The September 16 shootout has sparked intense Iraqi and U.S. criticism of private military contractors. It also has prompted initiatives to reexamine contractors' roles in Iraq. Iraqi and Blackwater officials have starkly different accounts of what happened during the firefight. Iraqi officials said Blackwater bodyguards indiscriminately opened fire in Nusoor Square, killing civilians and a traffic police officer. According to a senior Iraqi investigator on Sunday, 17 people were killed and 24 more were wounded. The State Department has said only that ""innocent life was lost."" Blackwater, however, said its contractors ""acted lawfully and appropriately in response to a hostile attack."" ""The 'civilians' reportedly fired upon by Blackwater professionals were in fact armed enemies, and Blackwater personnel returned defensive fire,"" the company has said. The FBI has assumed the lead from the State Department on the U.S. investigation. Triple bombing kills 11 . Three separate bombs killed at least 11 civilians and wounded 12 others Sunday around Baghdad, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. One bomb exploded in the Baladiat area of eastern Baghdad, killing five civilians and wounding five others. In southern Baghdad's Dora district, another bomb killed three civilians and wounded three others. A third bomb went off near the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, killing three civilians and wounding four others. Also on Sunday, six unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. That brings the total number of bodies found this month to 50. In September, 301 bodies were found in Baghdad -- the lowest number this year. In August there were 428.  E-mail to a friend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Private military contractor Blackwater USA ""delayed and impeded"" a congressional probe into the 2004 killings of four of its employees in Falluja, Iraq, the House Oversight Committee said Thursday in a report. Family members of the slain Blackwater employees listen during a congressional hearing earlier this year. Blackwater contractors Jerry Zovko, Scott Helvenston, Mike Teague and Wesley Batalona were ambushed, dragged from their vehicles and killed on March 31, 2004. The burned and mutilated remains of two of the men were hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River, an image that fueled American outrage and triggered the first of two attempts to retake the city from Sunni Arab insurgents. The company stalled the committee's investigation into the incident by ""erroneously claiming"" documents related to the incident were classified, trying to get the Defense Department to make previously unclassified documents classified and ""asserting questionable legal privileges,"" according to a report from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's Democratic staff. According to Blackwater's reports on the killings, the men killed in Falluja had been sent into the area without proper crew, equipment or even maps. One company document found a ""complete lack of support"" for its Baghdad, Iraq, office from executives at the company's headquarters in North Carolina, the committee report states. ""According to these documents, Blackwater took on the Falluja mission before its contract officially began, and after being warned by its predecessor that it was too dangerous. It sent its team on the mission without properly armored vehicles and machine guns. And it cut the standard mission team by two members, thus depriving them of rear gunners,"" the report states. In a written response to the report, Blackwater called it ""a one-sided version of this tragic incident."" ""What the report fails to acknowledge is that the terrorists determined what happened that fateful day in 2004,"" the company said. ""The terrorists were intent on killing Americans and desecrating their bodies. Documents that the committee has in its possession point out that the Blackwater team was betrayed and directed into a well-planned ambush."" The report notes that members of the now-defunct Iraqi Civil Defense Corps ""led the team into the ambush, facilitated blocking positions to prevent the team's escape, and then disappeared."" Blackwater did not discuss details of the report's findings, noting the incident is still the subject of a lawsuit by the slain contractors' families. The committee's chairman, California Democrat Henry Waxman, has scheduled a hearing Tuesday on Blackwater's operations in Iraq. The company's chairman, Erik Prince, is scheduled to testify at that hearing. The committee previously disclosed that the day before the fatal mission, the manager of Blackwater's Baghdad office warned his bosses he lacked armored vehicles, radio gear and ammunition. During February's hearing and in a subsequent written response, Blackwater general counsel Andrew Howell told the committee that documents on the attack had been classified by the U.S. government. But the Pentagon later told the committee the documents had not been classified. In addition, Blackwater made ""multiple attempts"" to get the Defense Department to declare company and Coalition Provisional Authority reports on the incident classified, the report states. The Pentagon refused. The families of the slain men have sued Blackwater Security Consulting, one of the most familiar of hundreds of private military contractors operating in Iraq. The families allege the company failed to provide their relatives with adequate gear and weaponry. Blackwater has denied the allegations and argued the men agreed to assume the risks of working in a war zone. Thursday's report adds to the intense scrutiny the company has faced since it was involved in shootings September 16 in western Baghdad. Iraqi authorities said Blackwater guards protecting a U.S. Embassy convoy opened fire indiscriminately, killing as many as 20 civilians. Blackwater said its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on the convoy. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte on Thursday told a Senate committee that ""something went tragically wrong"" in the Baghdad incident, and that the State Department and Iraqi authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. He said Blackwater guards had fired their weapons on 56 of the 1,873 escort missions they have conducted in Iraq in 2007, ""And each such incident is reviewed by management officials to ensure that procedures were followed."" ""I personally was grateful for the presence of my Blackwater security detail, largely comprised of ex-Special Forces and other military, when I served as ambassador to Iraq,"" Negroponte told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday in response to questions. ""Their alert and controlled posture kept me safe -- to get my job done."" E-mail to a friend .","House probe: Blackwater tried to delay, impede investigation into 2004 killings .

"(CNN) -- He was the ""Blade Runner,"" the miracle man and the Paralympic athlete that could take on the very best able-bodied competitors. It was a high-profile career that inspired millions, earned lucrative sponsorship deals and bridged the gap between Olympic and Paralympic competition. Yet those remarkable sporting triumphs and the fame and fortune it brought Oscar Pistorius receded into the distance as the South African stood motionless in the dock in Pretoria as he received a five-year sentence for the fatal shooting of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. In the most favorable scenario for Pistorius, he could be released from prison in 10 months under house arrest. But even then, former athletes, officials and marketing experts believe a full comeback will be extremely difficult. The competition ban . A dramatic return in time for the 2016 Paralympics is out of the question after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) stated that Pistorius would be banned from competing for five years. The IPC had previously stated that the South African would be allowed to compete in Rio if he was not in jail. While there is a possibility Pistorius may be out of prison before the Games begin in Brazil, the IPC has since clarified that this will also include any period that Pistorius serves out under house arrest. ""We've been quite clear throughout this process we would respect what sanctions the judge put down,"" IPC director of media and communications, Craig Spence, told CNN. ""Oscar can resume his career if he so wishes once he's served his sentence in full,"" Spence added, before clarifying that the IPC's position may change should the sentence be reduced or lengthened. Since bursting on to the scene at the Athens Games of 2004, Pistorius has been the Paralympic movement's poster-boy. Spence acknowledged the huge impact Pistorius has had but he pointed to the wealth of talent and inspirational athletes competing at the London Paralympics to emphasize the strength and depth that now exists in para sports. ""What London 2012 showed for us all is that the Paralympic movement is more than one athlete. There were lots of athletes that made the headlines in London ... and the Paralympic movement has continued to go from strength to strength since (then)."" The IOC, meanwhile, refused to be drawn on whether today's sentencing meant Pistorius would be able to compete in future events. ""We take note of the court's decision,"" said the IOC in a statement. ""This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius. We hope very much that time will bring comfort to all those concerned but at this stage we have no further comment to make."" The sporting condition . Pistorius will be 32 in 2019 when his five-year sentence is up. The Tokyo Olympics of 2020 could still offer a shot at sporting redemption but there will clearly be a question mark on whether Pistorius' athletic powers will be on the wane by then. Former Paralympic athletes like Britain's Dame Tanni-Grey Thompson have previously stated that even making the 2016 Olympics having missed months of training and competition would have been difficult for Pistorius. Members of the Pistorius family also recently told CNN's Robyn Curnow that the athlete's future career is not part of his immediate plans. Instead, he would focus on his life in jail, potentially starting a running or gym club whilst behind bars. His uncle, Arnold Pistorius, told reporters earlier Tuesday that ""Oscar will embrace this opportunity to pay back to society. As an uncle, I hope Oscar will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration. As a family, we are ready to support and guide Oscar as he serves his sentence."" The sponsors and the brand . Even if Pistorius does manage to make a miraculous sporting comeback, it is highly unlikely he will be as big a draw to sponsors and fans as he has been in the past. The athlete's image was pulled from billboards across South Africa after his arrest in 2013 and sponsors suspended their deals. ""This is the end of his brand,"" said Simon Chadwick, professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University, who added that Pistorius' transgression was very different to the indiscretions of sports stars like Tiger Woods or Lance Armstrong, who lost sponsors. ""None of those people actually killed anyone. It's going to be very, very difficult and very risky for a commercial partner to associate with Pistorius,"" Chadwick said. ""It will reflect too negatively for (anyone) to make a commitment to Pistorius. I think as a global and an international property, this is it, it's over, it's the end."" However, there are commercial options potentially still available to Pistorius. ""If he comes out of prison and seeks in some way to redeem himself -- maybe if he was to become a very high profile campaigner for women's rights or for ending violence against women -- and was seen to be taking what has happened ultra-seriously, certain types of brands could be interested,"" Chadwick said. ""That's a real outside chance and Pistorius would have to work very, very hard."" The second option would be if he was able to attract lots of small sponsor. ""He was a trailblazer in the sense he put the Paralympic movement on the map and in short he'll be cheap,"" added Chadwick. ""Small brands trying to raise awareness might choose to associate with the athlete,"" but any campaigns would likely be ""very low key and possibly domestic."" Another option is for Pistorius to cash in on giving his side of the story. ""The third way back for him would inevitably be book deals, maybe a deal for TV -- commercially it may well be he makes money that way,"" Chadwick said. ""What Pistorius needs right now is very careful advice from representatives who really do know what they're doing. ""On the one hand there are commercial opportunities there for him but they need to be handled very gently and very thoughtfully.

"(CNN) -- Two men convicted of killing a British soldier on a London street last year were sentenced Wednesday, one to life in prison and the other to a minimum of 45 years. In a brutal attack recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale hit soldier Lee Rigby with a car then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in May 2013. The Islamic converts, through testimony or their lawyers' arguments in court, indicated they killed Rigby for Allah. Cellphone footage replayed at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. They were convicted of murder in December. Adebolajo will spend life in prison. Adebowale received a sentence of at least 45 years. Rigby, who had served in Afghanistan and was off duty when he was killed at the age of 25, left behind a wife and a young son. The prosecution had asked for the maximum possible sentence: life imprisonment without parole. But defense lawyers argued Wednesday for leniency. Barrister David Gottlieb told the court that the victim was chosen because he was a member of the armed forces and that no one else was hurt in the attack. Prosecutor Sue Hemming said the pair ""reveled in one of the most appalling terrorist murders I have ever seen."" ""Not only was the attack brutal and calculated, it was also designed to advance extremist views,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""As a solider, Fusilier Lee Rigby was targeted in a clear act of revenge, deliberately carried out in full view of members of the public for maximum impact."" Family members attended court Wednesday to hear the sentences handed down. Outside the court, demonstrators from the English Defence League, a far-right group, carried signs calling for capital punishment to be restored. Britain abolished the death penalty in the 1960s. 'I am a soldier of Allah' At the trial, the prosecution said that the pair -- both born and raised in Britain by families of Christian Nigerian origin -- deliberately attacked an unarmed man from behind, using a vehicle as a weapon, and that they murdered him and mutilated his body. At trial, Adebolajo denied the charges of murder on the grounds that he had acted from religious conviction. He converted to Islam in 2002 to 2003, while at a university. Adebowale, who did not take the stand, converted to Islam more recently, in 2008 to 2009. In court, Adebolajo gave a matter-of-fact account of his actions. He declared himself a warrior for Allah and said he saw al Qaeda as his ""brothers in Islam."" He testified the only way he knew that Rigby was a soldier was because of his backpack. Summing up the case before the jury deliberated, Judge Nigel Sweeney reminded jurors of what happened in the 13 minutes between Rigby's body being dragged into the middle of a road near the Woolwich barracks and the arrival of police. The judge also cited details of Adebolajo's police interview and witness testimony, including that he loved al Qaeda and that he had tried to cut off Rigby's head because it was the proper method under Allah. When asked at the trial what his defense to the charge of murder was, Adebolajo said: ""I am a soldier. I am a soldier of Allah."" May: 'Sickening and barbaric' Though Adebowale did not give evidence at the trial, his lawyer, Abbas Lakha, echoed Adebolajo's testimony regarding their intent. The judge told the jury that the defense's argument -- that Rigby's killing was an act of war or of retaliation -- did not apply. Adebolajo and Adebowale were found not guilty of attempted murder of a police officer in the case. The prosecution had argued that when they ran toward the police vehicle that responded after Rigby's murder -- with Adebolajo holding a knife and Adebowale a gun -- they intended to kill an officer. However, the defense argued that the two men wanted to be killed by police. The gun was not loaded. At the time of the verdict, Home Secretary Theresa May said the ""sickening and barbaric murder"" of Rigby had ""united the entire nation in condemnation."" ""Violence and extremism of any kind have absolutely no place in our society and cannot be justified,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Russian and American leaders paint starkly different pictures of Ukraine, blaming each other for a crisis that shows no signs of simmering down. A defiant Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that masked gunmen are fueling anarchy in Ukraine. He decried what he called an illegitimate government that illegally seized power in a coup with U.S. backing, arguing that his country has a right to use military force. U.S. President Barack Obama and his country's top diplomat said Ukraine's new government is democratically responding to the people's will. They warned of invading forces and a desperate Russia breaking international law. ""President Putin seems to have a different set of lawyers making a different set of interpretations,"" Obama said, ""but I don't think that's fooling anybody."" Putin blamed Western powers, particularly the United States, for causing what he called ""anarchy and armed coup"" in Ukraine. ""I have a feeling people in America sit in some lab doing experiments, like on rats,"" he said, ""without knowing consequences."" The conflicting descriptions are enough to give you whiplash. Ukraine's shaky new government is caught in the middle, and it's clear that world powers don't see eye to eye over basic facts about what's happening. Here are some of the questions at play, with a look at how key players are weighing in: . What's happening in Kiev and Crimea? Russia's take: . Putin described a country in chaos. ""Military men are walking around Kiev in masks still now. They wanted to humiliate someone or show their force,"" he said. ""I think this is very stupid."" United States' take: . The streets in Kiev are ""calm and friendly,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, and Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea have ""stood their ground but never fired a shot, never issued one provocation, have been surrounded by an invading group of troops."" What we've seen: . In Crimea, the situation is calm but tense, CNN's Ben Wedeman and Clare Sebastian report. Russian forces have surrounded 10 Ukrainian military bases. There's been no fighting -- or loss of life -- but there are ample signs of preparation. There's a ""war of information"" in the region ""between those who watch Russian state TV and those who are getting their news from the West, none of them listening to the calls from Kiev for unity in this country,"" CNN's Diana Magnay reported. In Kiev, there are still barricades and battle scars from recent fighting before Viktor Yanukovych's ouster, CNN's Anderson Cooper and Elise Labott reported. Protesters there are waving posters depicting caricatures of Putin and declaring their willingness to fight against Russian forces, if necessary. In Crimea: 'I feel unsure about what will be tomorrow' Who's in charge of Ukraine? Russia's take: . Viktor Yanukovych remains Ukraine's elected leader, and Ukraine's new government is illegitimate. ""The legitimate president is only Yanukovych,"" Putin said. ""There are just three ways to dismiss the president from power: death, his personal request and the third one, impeachment. ... This procedure was not followed."" United States' take: . Yanukovych abandoned his post last month, refused to sign a transition deal, fled the country and was then voted out of office by Ukraine's democratically elected parliament. ""He broke his obligation to sign that agreement and he fled into the night with his possessions, destroying papers behind him,"" Kerry said in Kiev on Tuesday. ""He abandoned his people and eventually his country."" Ukraine's take: . Ukraine has a legitimate government and is set to have new presidential elections on May 25. ""Let's give an opportunity for that to work,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Yuriy Sergeyev said. But not everyone in the country agrees. Some support having closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych, for his part, said in a news conference from Russia last week that the planned May 25 elections would be illegal, insisting that he was still in charge and wanted to lead his country to peace, harmony and prosperity. U.S. strategy for Ukraine crisis: Money talks . How many Russian troops are inside Ukraine? Russia's take: . Part of the Russian Navy is based in Crimea, but Putin hasn't acknowledged sending any additional troops to Ukraine. He told reporters Tuesday that the surge in forces in Crimea were local self-defense groups pushing for the will of the people to be respected. Asked whether they were Russian, he said the uniforms the troops are wearing could be purchased at a store. United States' take: . Kerry sounded shocked by Putin's explanation Tuesday. Putin, he said, ""is insisting against all evidence everywhere in the world about troops being in Crimea that they're not there."" Russian forces ""have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Sunday, with estimates of 6,000 Russian ground and naval forces in the region . Ukraine's take: . Russia has sent military ships, helicopters and cargo planes to deploy 16,000 troops into Crimea since February 24, Sergeyev told the United Nations on Monday. Does Russia have a right to send more military forces into Ukraine? Russia's take: . Yes. A treaty between the neighboring nations allows Russia to have up to 25,000 troops in Crimea, Russia's U.N. envoy said Monday, adding that Yanukovych asked Russia to send military forces. Putin said Russia has no plans to take over Crimea. ""If I take the decision to use military force, it will be completely legitimate and correspond to the international law,"" Putin said, ""because we have the request of the legitimate president and also (it) corresponds to our duties and corresponds to our interest in protecting the people who are close to us historically and have connected culturally."" United States' take: No, and Putin is playing a dangerous game. Obama said Tuesday that the Russian President doesn't have the right to use force to influence the neighboring country. Russia ""has chosen aggression and intimidation as a first resort,"" Kerry said Tuesday, accusing the country's government of ""hiding its hand behind falsehoods, intimidation and provocations."" Ukraine's take: . No. Russian troops amassing in Crimea and near the border with Ukraine are an ""act of aggression."" If judged by the numbers, Ukraine's military loses war with Russia . Why is the tense standoff unfolding now? Russia's take: . Parliament approved Putin's use of military force to protect Russian citizens inside Ukraine. ""This corresponds to our national interest to protect these people, and this is a humanitarian mission. We are not trying to enslave people, or dictate anything to anyone,"" Putin said. ""Of course, we can't stay aside if we see the people persecuted, bullied or killed. We very much hope it will not come to this."" United States' take: . Putin, the administration believes, is threatened by challenges to his influence, especially popular uprisings against governments that are supportive of the Russian leader, a senior Obama administration official said Tuesday. ""They are externally taking over and trying to annex Crimea,"" Kerry said. Ukraine's take: . There's no evidence of any threat to Russians inside Ukraine. Russia wants to annex Crimea.

"(CNN) -- We all like to think medical care is about science, but too often it's about professional interests. Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography. The headline was simple: Mammogram screenings don't reduce cancer death rates. The reaction by some American mammographers was predictable -- discredit the study. It's predictable because it is exactly what they did when they didn't like the first findings of the study published more than 20 years ago. The effort by the American College of Radiology to discredit the Canadian trial relies on two allegations: . The investigators were cheating: Let's look at the background on this. Randomized trials are a critical tool for clinical researchers. Study participants are placed at random in either one group (in this case those who get mammograms) or the other (those who do not). Who is in which group is solely based on the play of chance -- a flip of a coin. The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one. It sure was taken seriously by Canada's National Cancer Institute. It launched a two-year independent review of the entire randomization process. In 1997, the review found no credible evidence of cheating. But that didn't stop the allegation from being trotted out last week. The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women. The rate of death in the two groups was exactly the same, every year, for 25 years. That can't happen by cheating -- that can only happen when the groups are formed solely by chance. Canada is a Third World country: More specifically, the Canadians used old mammography machines that produced inadequate images, interpreted by inadequate mammographers. It sounded as if Canada were Botswana, as if the nation had only recently gotten electric power and was still struggling to train doctors. For mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography, this is an odd allegation. Why? Because the other trials used even older technology. In fact, one of the trials most favorable to screening -- the Health Insurance Plan of New York's -- dates from two decades before Canada's, in the early 1960s, when mammography technologies were primitive. Yet, in both New York and Canada, outmoded technology did exactly what it was supposed to do. It found small breast cancers. Armed with these two allegations, the mammographers followed a well-worn strategy: Make the allegations often and loudly enough and maybe they will stick. To be clear, not all mammographers share this view. A new generation has openly acknowledged the problems of mammography. But many in the old guard are more likely to attack any suggestion that screening doesn't work as well as advertised, characterizing researchers who raise the possibility as ""malicious"" or ""dangerous"" and questioning the editorial policies of the journals that publish their work. It's time to stop the unfounded allegations. It might be standard procedure for politics but not for science. Too much energy has been devoted to discrediting the Canadian study and not enough to understanding it. To make sense of information the Canadian trial offers, you need to understand its unique design -- specifically what is being compared with what. Most of the other randomized trials simply compared regular mammography with doing nothing. In the Canadian trial, one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses. The other group received the same regular physical exam plus regular mammography. In other words, the trial tested the usefulness of adding mammography to a physical exam in an effort to detect abnormalities that are too small to feel. And the trial showed that finding these ""too small to feel"" abnormalities doesn't help women live longer. That's really important information. It doesn't mean that mammography can't help at all -- it is extremely challenging to standardize a physical exam of the breast across an entire population. It does mean, however, that if we are going to do mammography, we should be using it to find big, important things -- not small, unimportant things. Further, the Canadian trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real: One in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis happens when cellular abnormalities meet the pathologic definition of ""cancer,"" yet never progress to cause clinical disease. Overdiagnosed women are told they have cancer, are treated for cancer, yet their ""cancer"" is not destined to cause them any problems. It is important to recognize this estimate doesn't include the smallest, earliest form of breast cancer found only by mammography -- ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS. If overdiagnosis is a problem in invasive cancer, you can imagine it might be a greater problem for a smaller, earlier form of cancer. Even mammography's old guard objects to having DCIS included in estimates of the amount of overdiagnosis. Why do they object? Because so much of DCIS represents overdiagnosis, including it makes the estimate even higher. It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information. It's too much like asking the dentists for balanced information about routine dental X-rays. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H. Gilbert Welch.","A recent Canadian study found that mammogram screenings don't reduce cancer deaths .
Mammographers slammed it, saying researchers cheated and screening machines were old .
Gilbert Welch: Cheating charges unfounded, and pro-screening studies used older machines .
Welch: The real problem is that mammography results in women getting treatment they don't need ."
"(CNN) -- Yuriy Krocha's three children have a lot of questions about the situation in Ukraine. His youngest daughter, 8, pointed to a world map a couple of days ago and asked, ""Papa, Russia is so big. Why does it need our small peninsula?"" Krocha, 42, and his family live in Simferopol, the regional capital of Crimea, Ukraine. Soldiers without national insignias -- but whom everyone presumes to be Russian -- started showing up on Thursday, he said. That day, Krocha said he got a call from his children's school to take them, because teachers were afraid to let them go on their own, and they had to stay at home Friday. The downtown was blocked by police from Thursday until Sunday, Krocha said. It felt surreal, he said. ""I was afraid, but I prayed to God."" Russian forces have surrounded 10 Ukrainian military bases -- 16,000 troops in the past week, according to Ukrainian officials. No fighting or loss of life has been reported, but Crimean citizens such as Krocha are nervous about what will happen next. Many ethnic Russians live in Crimea, where support for Russia is strong. Part of Russia's navy -- the Russian Black Sea Fleet -- has a base in Crimea's city of Sevastopol that has been there for 230 years. Krocha is a Russian-speaking Ukrainian and his wife is Russian. This week their children are back in school, and the streets are open again. In that respect, life has returned to normal, but having Russian troops present is ""not OK,"" Krocha said. Not far from the parliament, soldiers are stationed in and outside of armored cars on one side of the street, Krocha said. He sees no reason for them and it's unclear to him what the troops are protecting. Meanwhile, Krocha has noticed gas prices rise some 25% over the last 10 days, and many foods have become more expensive too. A local market was out of two kinds of rice, canned meat and other products yesterday, he said. ""There was panic and people tried to buy much more than they usually buy,"" he said. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday that his country's aims were preserving democracy, protecting millions of Russians in Ukraine and stopping radical extremists. He said ousted President Viktor Yanukovych remains Ukraine's elected leader and has asked Russia to send troops. Other diplomats at the meeting asked for the withdrawal of Russian troops and called for a mediation to resolve the crisis. Ukraine crisis: Russia stands firm despite rebukes, threats of sanctions . Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday his military isn't planning to seize the Crimean peninsula. Any action would ""only be to protect local people,"" he said. Ukraine looks for 'sign of hope' from Russia over Crimea . In the coastal Ukrainian city of Yalta, Alex Shiroki hasn't seen any firsthand evidence of a Russian invasion, but remains ""gloomy"" about the uncertain situation. Shiroki has seen no Russian troops, protests, or other abnormal sightings in connection with the situation this week. When Yanukovych fled on February 22, supermarket shelves were sparse for two or three days, but they were currently stocked, and prices did not appear to be rising, he said . His friends tell him that in Sevastopol, about a 52-mile drive away on the peninsula, there are soldiers standing around doing nothing. Shiroki can only speculate about what that means. ""For me, it seems like big talks are going (on) behind our backs,"" he said. ""That's why the troops are doing nothing, because they have no order. They don't want to start a war themselves maybe. I don't know. Maybe everyone's waiting for talks to end, for some decision to be made."" He worries about being cut off from gas, electricity or Internet. More philosophically, he said he doesn't want to live in a Russian region under Russian power. ""The worst feeling is that I feel unsure about what will be tomorrow,"" he said. ""My thoughts are: This won't end fast. This invasion, this Russian position, won't be resolved in a month. Not even in two months I think."" Shiroki, 35, was born in Crimea, while Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union. The region is mostly Russian-speaking, with people preferring Russian movies and news, he said. ""Here in Crimea it's hard to identify your nationality,"" he said. Shiroki's family, also living in Yalta, is divided. His aging father says he isn't afraid of anything. One sister tells Shiroki they should think about how to get out if the situation becomes deadly. The other sister completely supports Russia. ""I can't even talk to her because she turns very aggressive if I criticize Russian ways,"" Shiroki said. Most people he knows over 30 seem to support Russia, while younger people do not, he said. Regardless of opinion, lots of people are talking about the situation most of the day, he said. If living in Yalta becomes dangerous, Shiroki said he will try to find a way out, and perhaps go to Poland. Krocha doesn't want to leave Simferopol, where he is a minister in a church. He feels responsible for staying and helping people there. He might reconsider if war breaks out, but for now, he says, ""It's my calling to be here."" But his children want to know: If Crimea becomes part of Russia, will we move? What if there is war? Krocha told his daughter that Russia has not taken Crimea yet, and hopes it will not happen. ""We hope that it will stay in Ukraine, and we will not have to move from this place where we all were born,"" he said. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark.

"(CNN) -- U.S. and Cuban officials held migration talks for the first time in more than two years on Wednesday. Some saw the meeting as a sign that long-frigid relations between the two nations are slowly thawing. But others said that the meeting was overshadowed by the Cuban weapons shipment to North Korea uncovered by Panamanian authorities this week. American and Cuban officials met in Washington for the first time since January 2011 to discuss implementing 1994 and 1995 agreements that regulate travel between the United States and Cuba, known as the U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords. ""The U.S. delegation highlighted areas of successful cooperation in migration, including advances in aviation safety and visa processing, while also identifying actions needed to ensure that the goals of the accords are fully met, especially those having to do with safeguarding the lives of intending immigrants,"" the State Department said in a statement after Wednesday's meeting. For its part, Cuba's delegation said ""the meeting took place in a climate of respect."" But after the meeting, it appeared that key sticking points between the two countries remained unresolved. The State Department said the United States repeated its call for Cuba to release Alan Gross, a State Department contractor who has been jailed in Cuba since 2009. And the Cuba delegation once again criticized U.S. migration policies toward the island. Under migration accords with Cuba, the United States gives at least 20,000 Cubans a year visas to immigrate to the United States legally. But the United States' so-called ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy means Cubans who reach American soil are not sent back to Cuba, which Cuban authorities say leads to an increase in illegal journeys. In a statement, the Cuba delegation said it ""reiterated its willingness to maintain these exchanges in the future, given their importance to both countries."" But will concerns over Cuba's weapons shipment that Panama seized from a North Korean boat this week put a stop to such talks? Cuba has said the 240-metric-ton weapons stash consisted of obsolete equipment it was sending to North Korea for repair. Panama has asked the United Nations to investigate whether the shipment violates the organization's North Korea weapons bans. In the meantime, several U.S. lawmakers who are critics of Cuba's government have said the situation is a warning sign that U.S. officials can't ignore. ""While we are in these discussions ... what does the Castro regime do? It is violating international laws. Why are we having these talks? We should suspend these talks because of this violation,"" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol Wednesday. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a frequent Cuban government critic, described the weapons shipment as a ""flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions."" ""I believe that this revelation, in addition to Cuba's failure to address its abysmal human rights record, should finally prompt the (Obama) administration to re-calibrate its misguided and naive Cuba policy,"" Rubio wrote. ""The administration should immediately reverse its January 2011 decision easing restrictions on people-to-people travel and remittances sent to Cuba; as well as immediately halt granting visas to Cuban government officials."" But others argued that it would be unwise to cut off talks over the matter. ""I do not think it should affect the conversations, because there is much at play, and things have advanced a lot, and it is a conversation that is beneficial for the United States and beneficial for Cuba,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank. If anything, the seizure of the North Korean boat shows the importance of more dialogue with countries like Cuba and North Korea, said Antonio Betancourt of the Universal Peace Foundation. ""What creates the problem are the sanctions. This is part of a problem that is going to continue with Cuba and is going to continue with North Korea until...they negotiate an exit so they can become part of the international community,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""When one is forced to live in darkness, the same darkness creates a lack of transparency."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Wednesday that the issue of the ship was unlikely to be a topic during the migration meeting. ""I would say that we have told the Cubans that we will discuss with them very soon the ship,"" she said, ""but we're focused on the migration talks, specifically on migration-related issues."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Some say talks are a sign that frigid U.S.-Cuba relations are slowly thawing .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Fresh from a landslide victory, Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party celebrated in a parade, as supporters lined the streets in the capital, waving flags of the party and holding balloons. Modi's party won 282 of 543 parliamentary seats, according to the country's election commission, bringing a clear majority and a resounding mandate to a single party to rule the world's largest democracy. Modi, 63, is expected to officially be sworn in as India's new Prime Minister on May 21. He will have to shoulder great expectations, as voters flocked to his party on his pledge to reform the nation's slowed economy. Prime Minister says goodbye . Meanwhile, outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh submitted his resignation and made his last address to the nation, recalling his background from the subcontinent's bloody division into India and Pakistan in 1947. ""I owe everything to this country, this great land of ours where I, an underprivileged child of (the) partition, was empowered enough to rise and occupy high office. It is both a debt that I will never be able to repay and a decoration that I will always wear with pride,"" Singh said. Singh, 82, leaves the office with a divided legacy. While his performance as finance minister in the 1990s has been praised for opening up India's economy, his recent years as Prime Minister were pockmarked by a spate of high-profile corruption scandals involving his Congress Party, as well as stalled reforms and a drop in growth. ""Friends, I am confident about the future of India. I firmly believe that the emergence of India as a major powerhouse of the evolving global economy is an idea whose time has come,"" Singh said in his TV address. He concluded his speech by wishing Modi's government well and saying he prayed for ""even greater successes for our nation."" Modi's background . Modi is widely viewed as pro-business and pro-growth. India's stock market surged Friday as initial results suggested a huge lead for Modi and his party. The former tea seller sprang into the national spotlight for his work in the state of Gujarat, where he cultivated an image of a man who gets things done. Gujarat, which contains 60 million people, has seen China-like rates of growth in recent years, which the rest of the country has eyed enviously. The ""Gujarat model"" of development means a focus on infrastructure, urbanization and eradicating red tape. His past is not without controversy. Throughout his campaign, his relationship with the country's huge Muslim minority came under scrutiny. In 2002, Gujarat state was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Modi, the state's chief minister, was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, but a Supreme Court-ordered investigation absolved him of blame last year. The United States denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the anti-Muslim violence, but on Friday, President Barack Obama called Modi to congratulate him on winning the election and to invite him to Washington, according to the White House. The visa issue could add to what has already been a strained relationship between the two nations -- complicated by a case involving an Indian diplomat who was arrested last year in New York.

"(CNN) -- In a rare interview with an American television network, Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad denied he is responsible for the violence engulfing his country and distanced himself from the behavior of his armed forces. ""They are not my forces,"" al-Assad told ABC's Barbara Walters in an interview that was broadcast Wednesday. He was responding to a question about whether he thought his forces had cracked down too hard on protesters over the past nine months. ""They are forces for the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country. So they are not my forces."" Wouldn't al-Assad, the commander in chief, have had to give the order for any military actions? ""No, no no,"" he said. Not by your command? ""No,"" he said, ""on no one's command. There was no command to kill or to be brutal."" Al-Assad said those members of the armed forces who ""went too far"" have been disciplined. ""Every 'brute reaction' was by an individual, not by an institution, that's what you have to know,"" he said in the interview. ""There is a difference between having a policy to crack down and between having some mistakes committed by some officials. There is a big difference."" ""We don't kill,"" al-Assad said. ""It's impossible for anyone in this state to give orders to kill."" ""No government in the world kills its people, unless it's led by a crazy person,"" al-Assad said. Defections continued Wednesday from al-Assad's forces, some of whom rose up against the regime in a counterattack in Idlib province, near the Turkish border, according to the opposition Free Syria Army, which said it had seized and destroyed a number of military vehicles, including three tanks. Two al-Assad soldiers were killed and more than 50 were wounded, it said. Instability and violence have been raging in Syria since mid-March, when the al-Assad regime responded brutally to peaceful protests. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, citing 4,000 deaths in Syria, told CNN he thought al-Assad had gone too far and pledged that the world body was prepared to help. ""It is important, first of all, that he stops killing people, and he engage immediately with all political forces and their own people, including opposition to find a way out, so that all the people of Syrians can enjoy genuine freedom and democracy."" Reports and images of violence have led powers such as the Arab League, Turkey, the United States and the European Union to impose sanctions against the regime. A U.N. report said the security and military forces have committed crimes against humanity, and several observers, including U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, have urged the International Criminal Court to take up the issue. Despite international outrage, violence continues as deaths have mounted. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group that organizes and documents protests, said at least 16 people were killed Wednesday by security forces. CNN is unable to verify the reports because Syrian officials have restricted access to the country by reporters. While activist groups blame Syria's military and security for deadly violence, Syrian officials have said they are battling ""armed terrorist gangs"" that target civilians. Al-Assad says that most of the people killed, including 1,100 soldiers and police, have been government backers. Yasser Tabbara, a Syrian-American activist with the opposition Syrian National Council, said al-Assad's denial that he controls the army -- despite the fact that he is Syria's commander in chief -- ""signals that he is prepping himself for a defense in case of a criminal indictment."" Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told CNN, ""The interview clearly shows, we've actually known this for a while ... this is a man who is just on another planet. He's just in denial of reality. This is the challenge. We've been trying to devise a strategy that deals with him as a rational player."" ""It's now clear he is a madman in complete denial of the situation in Syria, as thousands of videos and journalist reports clearly demonstrate. The question is: What is the most efficient way for the Syrian people and the international community to deal with such a madman?"" Mark Toner, State Department deputy spokesman, said he finds it ""ludicrous that he is attempting to hide behind some sort of shell game, but also some sort of claim that he doesn't exercise authority in his own country."" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said, ""The increase in death and body counts this month highlights that the Syrian government relies increasingly on its security and military apparatus as its only solution in the face of increasing isolation at home and overseas."" Syria is among the Middle Eastern and North African countries wracked by the ""Arab Spring"" demonstrations that arose after the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman in January. Subsequent uprisings ousted two of the region's longtime autocrats, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, and Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh has agreed to step down by February.

"(CNN) -- Central Texas, especially that sweet spot halfway between Dallas and Austin where small swaths of the legendary old prairies remain, is an earthly paradise. Blowsy live oaks spread their heavy limbs beneath cloud-spattered skies, while creeks and rivers—most prominently the meandering Brazos—ripple alongside gently rolling pastures gilded with waving grasses. These natural glories are precisely what led Laura and George W. Bush to choose the area for their Prairie Chapel Ranch, the retreat they completed in 2001, just after he became the 43rd president of the United States. Occupying some 1,600 acres near the flyspeck town of Crawford, about 25 miles west of Waco, the property is anchored by a strong but relatively modest home that quietly honors its location. During the eight years Mr. Bush was in office, the ranch served as the Western White House and welcomed numerous heads of state—from Russian president Vladimir Putin to Saudi king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz—some of whom were coaxed to join the leader of the free world as he raced along the property's 40-mile network of bike trails. And, of course, there are the well-known stories of the president spending his vacations clearing brush, often in searing heat, sometimes encouraging aides to join him. Architectural Digest: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen's Custom Chateau . These days the Bushes live in Dallas, also home to the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which opened last year on the campus of Southern Methodist University. But they regularly make the trip south to Crawford, where the former president is just as likely to be found handling a fishing rod or paintbrush as he is a chain saw. The ranch remains an essential getaway for the couple, a place to unwind and spend time with their daughters, Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager, as well as Jenna's family, and to entertain close friends like Deedie and Rusty Rose, prominent cultural leaders in Dallas. In fact, it was Deedie Rose who helped the Bushes find their architect, David Heymann, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Architecture. ""Deedie and Rusty love the way David sites buildings,"" says Mrs. Bush, relaxing on a shady terrace that overlooks a shimmering lake where her husband often casts lines for bass. (The largest caught to date, the former president reports, was a ten-pounder.) ""So when we bought this property, Deedie told me, 'I have your architect,' and, of course,"" she jokes, with a slightly arched eyebrow, ""I always do what Deedie says."" (Rose was a member of the committee that selected Robert A.M. Stern to design the Bush center.) Architectural Digest: Ralph Lauren Shows Off His Incredible Car Collection . The former first lady notes that when she was growing up in Midland, Texas, her father built spec houses—""one story and low to the ground, a style you saw a lot in the '50s and '60s."" She and Mr. Bush had a similar type of residence in mind for Crawford, mainly, she explains, ""because we wanted the house to fit into the landscape."" And she means fit literally. Heymann's design carefully nestled a single-level, three-bedroom limestone structure and an adjacent two-suite guesthouse into an almost imperceptible rise amid an existing grove of live oaks and cedar elms. Wrapped by deep roof overhangs—some up to ten feet wide—that serve to deflect the region's broiling sunlight and torrential downpours, the dwelling features tall windows that add a romantic transparency to its unpretentious countenance. ""We wanted to see and enjoy the beauty as much as possible,"" says Mr. Bush. To answer the couple's desire for indoor-outdoor living, many of the windows are also doors that open to covered terraces and walks, buffalo-grass lawns, and the tree-shaded swimming pool. When the doors are flung wide, the home becomes a veritable pavilion, capturing passing breezes and filled with birdsong. The configuration also reduces the need for internal corridors—often the Bushes navigate the place by strolling out one door and in through another. ""It's slightly motel-ish, but we love that,"" Mrs. Bush says lightheartedly. Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Jaw-Dropping NYC Penthouse . The former first lady worked closely on the project with Heymann, who found her to be a highly perceptive accomplice. ""She has a lot of experience from seeing the carefully organized houses that her dad built, and she has a very, very good eye,"" he says. Early in the construction process Mrs. Bush pointed out that the masons' work on the Texas Lueders limestone that clads the exterior (and some interior) walls of the residence was absolutely perfect—and thoroughly wrong. The Bushes wanted to have a subtly rustic, handcrafted look, and Heymann had deliberately chosen to use the so-called rough-back pieces that were traditionally thrown away in the trimming process rather than smoothly finished blocks. ""We had to take away their levels,"" the architect recalls, adding that the stone was relaid the old-fashioned, slightly irregular way, with taut string and appraising eyes. Architectural Digest: Radical Houses Around the World . An advocate of sustainable design, Heymann incorporated into the compound a number of green features, including a geothermal energy system for heating and cooling. Rainwater runs off the house's standing-seam metal roof and into a gravel-filled moat, where it filters into a 42,000-gallon cistern concealed beneath the rear terrace and is recycled to irrigate the lawns.

"(CNN) -- Is Gail Kelly the most powerful woman in Australian business? She's got to be up there. This is the chief executive of the country's second largest bank -- Westpac -- overseeing a whopping US$613 billion in assets and over 36,000 employees. It's quite a portfolio, and all the more impressive considering the 57-year-old mother-of-four started out as a bank teller a little over 30 years ago. Born in South Africa to British parents, Kelly originally taught Latin at high schools, before working at Nedcor Bank in Johannesburg -- becoming head of human resources just five months after giving birth to triplets. The family moved to Sydney and in 2002 Kelly became the first female CEO of a major Australian bank -- the Commonwealth Bank. Today she is the 62nd most powerful woman in the world, according to Forbes, but admits the notoriously male-dominated banking world has been a ""tough area to crack."" Now the boss at Westpac, Kelly made it her mission to have 40% women in senior management positions by 2014 -- a target she smashed in 2012. How has she achieved her phenomenal success and what is her vision for the future of Australia's oldest bank? CNN's Leading Women sat down with the financial trailblazer to find out. ""I grew up in a very strong, nuclear family. My father was a sportsman. He represented South Africa in a couple of sports, so he was a very positive person and someone who encouraged you to be your best and give your best with everything that you do. And so I grew up in this environment that was nurturing, supporting, but certainly encouraging."" ""42% of our management team are women. So we've reset the goal to 50% by 2017. Because that's when Westpac becomes 200 years old as an institution -- the oldest bank, and indeed the oldest company in Australia. So that's a lovely point to reflect on."" ""When I got to be a CEO I said: 'Right. I'm now going to tackle gender inequality head-on. I'm going to make a difference, and lead by example, and actively put in place policies and practices to support women.'"" ""The banking world is a particularly tough area to crack for women. I was in a forum yesterday where there would have been 60 leaders of banks and insurance companies and I was literally the only woman."" ""My husband being a paediatrician was awesome. With four children -- three of them triplets -- I needed a lot of help and support at home. He did more than his fair share of everything in the home and I could not have done what I've done without that."" ""Nelson Mandela was an outstanding leader and a mentor for me. I was in South Africa at the time he was released. I was in South Africa when he was inaugurated as the first president. And he - after the 27 years of imprisonment, a lot of it in solitary confinement - truly understood that his vision, his purpose, was to transform South Africa, a reconciled South Africa."" ""My advice would be: dig deep. Gather all your courage in your hands. You've been offered this opportunity because you are worthy. You don't have to be 100% ready for this job. You don't have to be 80% ready for this job. You do need support around you and you do need a determination and a preparedness to work hard. But back yourself.""

"(CNN) -- What's Hawaii without palm trees? That's a question the island state hopes it won't have to answer as it attempts to stave off an invasion by the coconut rhinoceros beetle, an unwanted visitor that's already done extensive damage on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. Big, hungry and hard to kill, the coconut rhino beetle bores into the tops of coconut palms, eating growing tissues, drinking the sap, ripping into the bases of fronds and exposing the plant to disease. Then it crawls off to breed, preferably in piles of mulch or trash. Adults can grow up to two inches long and live to the ripe old age of three months. ""This beetle is really tough, and most of the pesticides that are legal for use in Hawaii do not work on it,"" said Darcy Oishi, the state Agriculture Department official in charge of containing the beetle. The first specimens in Hawaii turned up on a golf course on the military's Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, outside Honolulu, in December. About 500 pheromone-baited traps have been deployed within a one-mile radius of the site; authorities have urged the public to look out for the beetle and clear away any debris that might make for a beetle's love nest. Other alternatives under consideration include possibly releasing a fungus or a virus known to attack the insect in its native habitat in tropical Asia, Oishi said. Not known how they reached Hawaii . The source of the infestation on Oahu is unclear so far. Oishi said there's no evidence they stowed away aboard a military ship or plane. And since Honolulu's international airport is located just across a highway from the golf course, they might have reached Hawaii via civilian aircraft. ""What we have found is one major breeding site and a few minor breeding sites, all in close proximity to each other, and we are currently working with the Navy and the USDA plant protection and quarantine service to deal with the issue,"" Oishi said. So far, scientists have found a relatively small population of several thousand. An uncontrolled infestation would pose a ""tremendous"" economic risks to the state, he said. ""Do people want to go to a Hawaii that is without palm trees?"" Oishi asked. The coconut is no longer a cash crop on Hawaii, ""but it's super-important as an ornamental plant."" Islanders still eat its meat, drink its milk and the husks and fibers have a variety of uses in native Hawaiian cultural practices. And the beetles might not stop at the palms: They could also attack valuable crops and ornamental plants, he said. The coconut rhino beetle has been turning up across the Pacific islands since the 1940s. In 2007, it reached Guam, probably in a shipment of construction material from Asia, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Efforts to wipe them out have been unsuccessful, said Aubrey Moore, a University of Guam entomologist who is advising Hawaii on what has and hasn't worked there. ""Eradication isn't impossible, but it's highly improbable at this time,"" Moore said. ""So now we're trying to learn how to live with it. And the same thing will happen in Hawaii if they don't start doing something right away."" ""We can expect to lose about 50% of our coconut palms when it's all over, and that's looking really sad,"" he said. Tackling a problem before it blossoms . But Hawaii has some advantages that Guam didn't -- including plenty of natural beetle predators such as birds. Most of Guam's avian life was wiped out by another invasive species, the brown tree snake, which arrived around 1950. Birds, rats and mongoose, which were introduced to Hawaii in a 19th century attempt to control rats, are already attacking the rhino beetles, Moore said. Ants and other beetle species may also help by eating the rhino beetle's larvae. And Oahu is bigger than Guam, which is located about 1,500 miles south of Japan in the Northern Mariana Islands. The smaller the island, the more susceptible to damage from invaders, Moore said. ""They have significant resources that we never had,"" he said. ""The USDA's taking this very seriously, and they have a big group of people there."" But the one breeding site identified so far on Hawaii is ""pumping out adults like crazy."" Faced with a fast-breeding, invasive menace, Hawaiian officials are also discussing whether to resort to more advanced biological control mechanisms. Growers in countries such as the Philippines, where coconuts are still a cash crop, use sawdust laced with a fungus that attacks the coconut rhino beetle in traps and breeding sites; a Malaysian virus that attacks them has been used to control the population in Samoa and Fiji. But neither measure has been approved by U.S. regulators. Oishi said those steps are being studied in Hawaii, but will require extensive studies under ""very contained conditions."" Then they would have to be approved by both state and federal agencies, which will require their own environmental assessments. In the meantime, the battle against the beetles -- a grubby struggle, fought tree-to-tree and mulch heap-to-mulch heap -- will grind on. ""We will have to be monitoring this project for at least a year, probably more along the lines of three years,"" Oishi said. Lionfish infestation in Atlantic Ocean a growing epidemic .

"(CNN) -- The 10-year-old American girl went to the Vatican on a prayer of maybe, just maybe, meeting the Pope this week to deliver an important message. Her prayer was answered, against all odds. But for a while, Jersey Vargas' pilgrimage seemed doomed when a bystander pushed the little girl in a pink hat out of the way as the Pope approached a Vatican grandstand filled with supplicants and the faithful. Jersey wept. ""I had to get through a fence, and I was waiting for a long time,"" said the 10-year-old girl from Panorama City, California, near Los Angeles. ""But when Pope Francis was getting near me, there was a woman who pushed me because she didn't want me there because Pope Francis was coming near. So I started to cry because when she pushed me, it did hurt."" A Good Samaritan saw the weeping child and gave her a front-row position to see Pope Francis. It worked. Pope Francis barely saw Jersey standing eye-high at a white-draped railing. He approached her. He touched her head. He blessed her. The family now has photographs of the extraordinary encounter between their small daughter and the people's Pope, who's increasingly shown a penchant to enter a crowd and mingle. It was then that Jersey delivered a message that she had carried for more than 6,300 miles. ""I told him, 'Please help my family because we are suffering and my dad is suffering deportation and it's not fair. Other children are suffering because their parents are getting separated,'"" Jersey recounted. She was referring to how U.S. immigration policy -- a vexing issue that has left Congress polarized and gridlocked about how to reform it -- breaks apart families by deporting parents who are undocumented immigrants while allowing their U.S.-born children to remain in the country, left in the care of relatives or on their own. Her message on Wednesday just happened to be delivered as President Barack Obama was about to visit Pope Francis at the Vatican. In fact, the two leaders discussed immigration reform on Thursday, though no formal agreements were made, the Vatican said. Jersey even gave the Pope a simple gift during their chance meeting. The offering was a cloth napkin, embroidered with an image of two birds, made by Jersey's mother. The birds represented her mother and father. Also embroidered on it was a legend: ""Nest of Love,"" it said. But that nest isn't complete because her father faces deportation. ""Pope Francis had it in his hand,"" she said of the napkin. ""I told him about my family, and that's when he blessed me and touched my head."" The girl was flanked by chaperones and fellow members of a group called Hermandad Mexicana (Mexican Brotherhood), which trekked to the Vatican to bring attention to U.S. immigration reform efforts. To get the Argentina-born Pope's attention, they carried a banner that stated in Spanish: ""Dear Pope Francis, Help us legalize our parents."" Lola Vargas, Jersey's mother, said she's so happy that her daughter was able to talk to the Pope. ""She told me what happened and what she told the Pope. I am so proud of her and she represents other kids who are in the same situation,"" the mother said. Jersey's father, Mario Vargas, 43, was arrested in Blount County, Tennessee, for driving under the influence last September, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. He was later convicted of the charge, officials said. At the time, Mario Vargas was working a construction job, said family attorney Alex Galvez. The father was then transferred to Louisiana because there was no ICE detention center in Tennessee. ""The police took him into custody and forgot about him for two months,"" Galvez said, ""He was recently turned into ICE when the police filed the deportation proceedings two weeks ago."" Galvez said he spoke to the judge a week ago and presented the family's situation. The judged asked for the family to post bail of $15,000 but the family's attorney was able to reduce the bond to $5,000. Galvez said Jersey's father was released on bail Friday, but the family still faces a legal battle in his ongoing deportation proceedings. Galvez hopes to transfer his case to Los Angeles and said Mr. Vargas will be returning home with his family this weekend. Jersey's visit was part of a campaign where 11 immigration activists, plus some relatives, traveled to Rome hoping to talk to Pope Francis and ask him to speak to Obama about immigration reform. Doris Benavides of the Los Angeles Archdiocese said Archbishop Jose H. Gomez has been a big supporter of children like Jersey and their crusade for reform. Earlier this year Gomez relayed more than 1,000 letters to Pope Francis from children whose families members were facing deportation or were deported. ""Archbishop Gomez met Jersey at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels and thinks she is poised and articulate and has never met anyone like her,"" said Benavides. Gomez helped the group by sending a letter to the Vatican requesting 17 tickets for the group, so they could have a viewing space Wednesday outside the Vatican, Benavides said. The 17 tickets were granted. But Jersey was lucky enough that she was able to get very close and deliver her message. The Los Angeles Archdiocese believes that this visit to Rome will open a dialogue on how important immigration reform is. ""Jersey's story will help see the suffering caused in families by a broken immigration system,"" said Benavides. The archbishop also posted a comment on his Facebook page. ""Please keep praying for Jersey and for all the families who are suffering because of our broken immigration system,"" he said. Jersey hopes that her messages will be heard. ""I am very proud of myself because I already accomplished my mission, that was to talk to him and to please stop deportations because the kids are suffering,"" she said.","Jersey Vargas, 10, travels to the Vatican with family and church members .

"(CNN) -- The dispersant used on the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill appears to be breaking up within weeks and is less toxic than similar products, according to preliminary testing by the Environmental Protection Agency. Paul Anastas, the agency's assistant administrator for research and development, told reporters Wednesday the agency is making no new recommendations until further tests are conducted. But he said there is no sign that dispersants are remaining in the water or settling to the bottom, and that the Corexit 9500 being used by oil company BP is among the least toxic to small fish and mysid shrimp of the eight products tested, Anastas said. Mysid shrimp are a tiny type of shrimp commonly used in tests of toxins in seawater. Anastas said all the dispersants tested are ""not without toxicity,"" and the studies have not examined the effects of the biodegraded products or of the combination of dispersants and the crude oil that has been gushing into the Gulf since late April. But a New Orleans-based environmental group is expressing qualms about the dispersant and the massive amounts being dumped in  the Gulf. ""This has never been done, this kind of volume, this kind of application,"" said Aaron Viles of the Gulf Restoration Project. ""It's all really a giant science experiment, and we're terribly concerned that in the long run the impacts are going to be significant, and we really don¹t know what we're doing to the ecosystem."" The group is calling for an immediate end to BP's use of dispersants in the Gulf. ""We're two months into this disaster, two months plus. So it seems like we'd start to have some answers by now as to what the better alternatives are,"" Viles said. ""We're very concerned that BP is using a product that they know that they have on hand, and that they're not really being challenged to use better products."" The government's Deepwater Horizon Response website reported earlier this week that more than 1.5 million gallons of dispersants have been used in the battle against the oil spill. That includes more than a million gallons in surface dispersant and more than 500,000 gallons in subsea dispersant. The EPA acknowledges that's much more than has been used before in responding to an oil spill. The EPA ordered BP to sharply cut back its use of Corexit in May amid concerns about its safety. It initially tried to force BP to use another dispersant on the spill, but the company said no safer products were available in large enough quantities.","NEW: 1.5 million gallons of dispersants used in battling spill .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will work with the Haitian government and with international and private aid groups to protect Haitian children who might be at risk because they were orphaned or separated from their parents by the earthquake, the State Department said Thursday. ""We have concerns about traffickers, we have concerns about pedophiles,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said at his midday briefing. ""We've seen a couple of cases of those in recent days. So this is just something we are working collectively with those organizations that are actively trying to help children, people on the ground, be alert for this kind of danger."" Asked whether any children had been brought illegally to the United States, he said, ""Not to my knowledge."" ""A number of people, including many, many children, have been displaced, separated from their families. This poses great risk, and particularly for children, [of] a higher vulnerability to human trafficking,"" Crowley said. ""Haitian police have had child protection brigades in place for some time. Obviously, we are working with them but also trying to supplement the capability on the ground."" U.S. officials from the departments of State, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services have been working together in recent weeks to make sure that the Haitian government grants its approval before any adoptions proceed. Since the earthquake, 500 Haitian children whose cases had long been under consideration have been approved for U.S. adoption and brought to the United States. In a news release issued later, Crowley said the State Department's ""Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons has been engaged on this issue prior to the earthquake and in its aftermath."" While UNICEF -- the United Nations' children's fund -- ""has taken the lead role in overall child protection and safety in Haiti since the earthquake, we are working to supplement their efforts in combating child trafficking,"" he said. Steps being taken by the State Department and other organizations, he said, include registration of unaccompanied children, helping ""remobilize the Haitian Police's Child Protection Brigades,"" and ""rebuilding the capacity of Haitian [non-governmental organizations] already working to protect child domestic servants, known in Haiti as restaveks."" He said the department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons had been working to fight child trafficking in Haiti even before the earthquake. Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday that after the quake, because of the growing number of orphans, illegal child trafficking is ""one of the biggest problems that we have."" ""There is organ trafficking for children and other persons also, because they need all types of organs,"" Bellerive said. He did not give specifics but when asked whether there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, ""The reports I received say yes.""

"(CNN) -- ""Interracial/interethnic marriage is a great way of fighting war, hatred and prejudice. Think about it. If we all are mixed, who can we hate?"" wrote a reader about a CNN.com story on race and marriage. That comment was one of the thousands of responses to the story about a new study from the Pew Research Center that found interracial and interethnic marriages are at a record high of about one in seven. About 14.6 percent of newly married couples reported in 2008 that they married outside their race or ethnicity, according to the Pew report released Friday. In 1980, about 6.8 percent of newlywed couples surveyed said their spouse was of another race or ethnicity. Overall, reader reactions voiced support for mixed relationships, with many commenters proudly identifying themselves as being in an interracial or interethnic relationship. ""I've been happily married in a mixed race marriage for seven years. To anyone who would like to oppose mixed race marriage: What gives you the right?

There are cultural differences, but if anything, they have helped me to grow as a person. She is wonderful and so loving and I feel truly blessed and happy. The racism that some people show on here is truly sad. We are expecting our first child -- a boy -- in September."" Another couple talked about their wedding ceremony, which celebrated their cultural differences. Reader cellblock131 wrote, ""I am Hispanic and married a white woman. ... When it came to our wedding, we had a mixture of both cultural practices. For example, my dad read passages in Spanish, then her dad read them in English. The reception had traditional white American dances, plus Mexican in the mix. It was a wonderful wedding."" One reader identified only as Guest said he won't date outside his race. ""I care what race the women I date are. I am a white male. I date only white females. Sure there are attractive women in other races but I stick with my own. It's America land of the free,"" wrote Guest. AntigoneR ignores people's objections.""I can only speak for myself, but I really don't care how many people accept or do not accept my interracial relationship. I don't recall asking their opinion. Having said that, I'm glad to see that the trend in society is more accepting, and that racial barriers are crumbling. I wish it were faster."" One commenter echoed a common view among the Millennial Generation, found in an earlier study this year from the Pew Center that reported 85 percent of 19- to 28-year-olds accept interracial and interethnic relationships. SIR10LY wrote: ""It's 2010. I can't even believe this is still an issue! If two people love each other, let them be. ... If you're opposed to it, get with the times already!"" Children of mixed marriages also shared their views. Reader Anex wrote, ""Product of an Interracial marriage and darn proud of it! I'm a happy mutt!"" Other readers pointed to the challenges of marrying someone outside their race. ""But one thing the article does not mention is divorce among interracial couples is much higher than same-race couples. Challenges in understanding, family relations and pressures overall are higher. People should know what they're getting into,"" warned a reader. WHATRU wrote, ""I'm an Arab, my husband is white. It gets more complicated after you have kids. The cultures and beliefs are just too different. It is easier to marry your own kind."" Reader Toadlife wrote that racial discrimination can also be difficult. ""Race matters because racial discrimination continues to happen all around us to this day. If you think otherwise, you are naive and probably white and have all white relatives. Thankfully, we've come to a point in our society where race is not a determining factor in one's fate, but it can still be an obstacle from time to time,"" Toadlife wrote. Reader nal4america said her decision about whom to date is influenced by what race she grew up with. ""I'm of West Indian decent and I grew up in a small town in Utah. I am so used to dating outside of my race that I don't even date men of my race simply because I am not attracted to them. I think the environment you grow up in plays a huge factor in the mate you select. I am 95 percent certain my husband will be of a race other than my own and that's fine because I believe in the American Race."" Native Americans had yet another take on the situation. ""... [T]here can never truly be justice and real harmony on stolen land ... just like there can never be peace and harmony in a house that's been burglarized and its inhabitants marginalized and oppressed ... ask an Apache or Navaho or black American if they are happy to live in a society dominated by white people. The indigenous were here for many thousands of years before the Europeans destroyed the culture and lands of the indigenous almost worldwide,"" wrote hotepk. ""...What must happen is either they go back to Europe or pay restitution -- like any other convict guilty of a crime -- otherwise there will continue to be struggle."" Ndngirl2010 responded:  @hotepk--I am full blooded Navajo and I'm fine with living alongside whites and get this --*gasp*-- I married one! A majority of my family doesn't harbor any animosity toward any other race. Let bygones be bygones and, instead, focus on the future."" The readers who responded to CNN's coverage on the Pew Research Center study seemed to acknowledge the growing blurring of races and ethnicities. Reader HalfBaked shared: ""My wife's biological mother is Filipino/Mexican and her biological father is Scottish. She was adopted at birth into a German-Jewish family. My mother's side is Italian/Turkish and my father was Hungarian. Our kids are about as 'mixed' as you can get.""","CNN.com readers have strong reactions to a story on race and marriage .

"(CNN) -- Every day, 10 women are killed in domestic violence cases in a country known for its glorious models, according to a new study released Sunday. And it takes a high-profile incident -- such as the case against a Brazilian goalkeeper who is the prime suspect in the disappearance and murder of a woman -- to bring attention to the problem, said Women's Affairs Minister Nilcea Freire. The government-sponsored study, called Map of Violence 2010, found that 41,532 women were murdered in Brazil between 1997 and 2007. Last week, Brazilians were shocked by the details emerging from the case of Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes Das Dores de Souza, who is accused of overseeing the kidnapping and dismembering of former lover Eliza Samudio, with whom he fathered a child. Samudio's body remains missing a month after her disappearance. And Souza has refused to answer questions on his alleged involvement, police said. ""When cases emerge involving famous persons,"" Freire told the official Agencia Brasil, ""that's when society becomes aware of what is not being printed... that women are violated, subjugated daily through inequality."" Freire said studies show that most women are victimized by men they knew well. Samudio claimed recently, in a television interview in front of a police station, that Fernandes threatened to make her disappear -- and refused her pleas to acknowledge the paternity of their son. Like Samudio, who sought help from police several times before she was killed, Brazil's women's police stations -- which handle gender-based cases -- register an exorbitant number of complaints of threats that see no prosecution. Freire said that a law allowing gender-based crimes against women to be judged in special courts should have been respected in the Samudio case. Named after Maria da Penha, a woman who became a paraplegic after suffering numerous beatings at the hands of her husband, the law also allows for an aggressor to be arrested not only for the act of committing a crime, but preventitively. Several other high-profile murders committed against women have gained national attention. Attorney Mercia Nakashima's body was found floating in a man-made lake in Sao Paulo last month. The 28-year-old's boyfriend turned himself in and has been named a prime suspect. Estado de Sao Paulo journalist Sandra Gomide was shot in the back and head in 2000. The main suspect, her former boyfriend, Antônio Marcos Pimenta Neves, was a former director for the newspaper. According to local reports, Neves served seven months in prison.","Study shows that about 10 women are killed daily in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Jason Mraz pulled up to the studio near Burbank Airport on his scooter, like a kid anticipating the start of a new school year. But in this case, it was the first day of rehearsal with his new band. ""I invited a lot of people to come audition, a lot of people that I love and have always wanted to work with, but I couldn't hire everyone,"" said the San Diego-based singer-songwriter. ""I could only fill five positions. It felt like I was breaking up with people. I had to call people and be like, 'I'm sorry, it's not going to work out.' "" The break-up theme is front-and-center on ""I Won't Give Up,"" the lead single off of Mraz's fourth studio album, ""Love is a Four Letter Word."" ""It's not a break-up album. It was certainly written at a time when I wasn't certain what was going to happen inside of a relationship,"" he told CNN, settling into a couch. He's referring to his broken engagement to fellow singer-songwriter Tristan Prettyman. But the two-time Grammy winner says the message is more figurative than literal. June 2011: Mraz, Prettyman split . ""It's an album of love songs, but not just through the filter of romanticism. It's also through compassion and empathy and love of our natural world. At the end of the project, I still didn't feel like these 12 songs summed up what love is. I was like, 'I don't know. Love is a four letter word.'"" And so is the word ""tour."" Mraz's ""Tour is a Four Letter Word"" kicks off on June 8 in Pusan, South Korea, and hits the United States the following month in Honolulu, Hawaii. In the meantime, he's devoting much of his passion to the newly launched Jason Mraz Foundation. "" 'Jason,' in Greek history, means 'healer,' "" he pointed out. ""So I really wanted to take that on, not only in my music, but in my work in the world."" Mraz sings at Sundance . The foundation supports a variety of causes, from education and the environment to addiction assistance and human rights. He's also been outspoken about his support for marriage equality. ""Traditional marriage between a man and a woman, and trying to put that into a law or a rule, is basically saying that gay people aren't real. Well, gay people are very real. It is treating our gay and lesbian citizens like second-class citizens. I think it is the final step in the civil rights movement,"" he said. For Mraz, that's what his song, ""I Won't Give Up,"" is all about. ""It's about not giving up on a dream, or the integrity of who you are,"" the singer said. ""There is no dream too big or too small. Everyone has one thing that is worth fighting for.""","Jason Mraz's fourth album, ""Love is a Four Letter Word,"" has been released .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, obsession took hold of Republicans in Congress. In the third week of January 2011, John Boehner's newly-elected House held its first-ever vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and go back to letting insurance companies do whatever they want. Fast forward to today -- nearly 50 votes to repeal or undermine the law later -- and it's clear to the American people that Republicans in Congress aren't on their side. Pick an issue: Jobs. The economy. Education. Infrastructure. Minimum wage. Unemployment insurance. Immigration reform. The list of failures, neglected issues and missed opportunities goes on and on -- and shows without question that Republicans are on the side of special interests and the Tea Party, not the American people. No wonder poll after poll still shows House Republicans standing at record lows. Americans don't need a pen and a phone, we need a job and a paycheck . Boehner's misguided agenda and one-note tenure have ignored what the American people want. In fact, independent, mainstream polls show that most Americans want to improve and fix the law, not repeal it. Americans know what repeal would cost them: giving the power back to insurance companies to discriminate, deny care, drop coverage, raise rates and drive hardworking Americans into bankruptcy. On the Affordable Care Act and so many other issues that matter to the middle class, the message House Republicans have sent is clear: They are not on the side of hardworking American middle class families, and instead will do everything in their power to protect those who need help the least: the Washington special interests. Obama, the pain and fear must be named . While House Republicans have obsessively voted to turn our health care system back over to insurance companies, that is far from the only damage they have inflicted on the people of this country. Their disastrous government shutdown -- which they launched to oppose the Affordable Care Act -- cost our economy $24 billion. They won't extend unemployment insurance for struggling Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own and who are looking for work -- all while they make sure that Big Oil gets its $40 billion in subsidies. They refuse to raise the minimum wage, while seeking maximum tax cuts for the rich. They have yet to pass anything that remotely resembles a jobs bill. Those wrong priorities will come back to haunt them in November. A few Republicans are making the first motions to run away from this unpopular approach and to deny their repeal-only agenda. They're hoping that voters will think that they've woken up and found some common sense -- but voters won't forget nearly 50 votes, and they won't forgive them for turning their backs on hardworking people. This year's State of the Union is a defining test for Obama . Republicans' flawed priorities are hurting real families in this country. With every repeal vote, John Boehner might get a kick out of conservative news headlines and the talk radio echo chamber, but what regular Americans see is a politician who cares more about wealthy insurance company contributors than helping their families. Voters will have a choice this fall between Republicans' wrong priorities, and problem-solving Democrats who have dedicated their lives to helping middle class families get ahead. I believe that choice will be clear. Obama's message: A dysfunctional Congress, but we'll get it done anyway . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rep. Steve Israel.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- A 15-month-old was hospitalized after a behind-the-bar mix-up at a Michigan Applebee's restaurant that left the toddler sipping alcohol instead of apple juice. Police were called to the Madison Heights restaurant on Friday evening after the parents of Dominic Wilson Jr. noticed their son acting strange during a family dinner. ""He was saying 'hi' and 'bye' to the walls,"" said Wilson's mother, Taylor Dill-Reese, 18. ""He laid his head down like he was sleepy, then woke up and got really hyper."" At first, Dill-Reese blamed his odd behavior on lack of sleep. But at the end of the meal, she said Wilson's father was stunned by what he tasted after taking a sip of his son's juice. The juice was an alcoholic concoction that was stored in a mislabeled container, according to a Madison Heights Police Department news release. ""The container was apple juice but it had margarita mix in it,"" Dill-Reese said. Wilson was immediately rushed to the hospital, where his blood alcohol content was measured at 0.10, Dill-Reese said. ""They said if he had drank that whole cup he would have died,"" she said, adding that she and her family will never return to the eatery. ""It was unreal,"" she said. ""You don't expect to go to a family restaurant, and your 15-month-old gets served alcohol."" Dill-Reese said the child is doing OK but they are taking him to see a doctor because he's ""not eating like he used to."" Dill-Reese said she and her boyfriend -- both of whom are under 21 and not legally allowed to drink -- were both drinking smoothies during the meal. ""Obviously any situation like this is unacceptable,"" Applebee's officials said in a statement. ""We are working with local authorities and conducting our own investigation to assess exactly what happened.""

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Stories rule our lives. When we were young, we told our parents detailed narratives, which originated from our imaginations. As we grew older, we told stories (er, lies) to our parents to keep us out of trouble. And we shared anecdotes with our friends to make ourselves appear interesting enough to make them like us. Now as we try to ""make it"" in the real world, telling a good story can help our careers, says Peter Guber, author of ""Tell To Win: Connect, Persuade, and Triumph with the Hidden Power of Story."" ""It occurred to me that everybody in business shares one universal problem: To succeed, you have to persuade others to support your vision, dream or cause,"" Guber writes in his book. ""Whether you want to motivate your executives, organize your shareholders, shape your media, engage your customers, win over investors or land a job, you have to deliver a clarion call that will get your listeners' attention, emotionalize your goal as theirs, and move them to act in your favor. You have to reach their hearts as well as their minds -- and this is just what story telling does."" Simply put, if you can't tell it, you can't sell it. The best part is that anyone can tell a story, Guber says. ""You don't need a special degree to tell the story of your company, brand or offering and make it a powerful call to action. You don't need money or privilege. This really is a vital skill that's freely available to anyone."" The key is knowing how and when to tell a story effectively, whether it's in an interview, at a networking event or if you're making conversation with the CEO. ""In any situation that calls for you to persuade, convince or manage someone or a group of people to do something, the ability to tell a purposeful story will be your secret sauce,"" he says. ""Purposeful"" is the key word, Guber says. ""Purposeful stories have a goal, a call to action that tellers want their listeners to do. The power in telling a purposeful story makes the purpose -- the object of the story -- emotional rather than intellectual, and aspirational rather than inspirational,"" he says. What you want to avoid is informational storytelling. While you should of course share facts about yourself, especially in terms of figure or data where possible, it's more important to put that information in the context of a story. ""Very few people remember facts, figures and data. Research on memory absolutely shows that you can remember details of things much more effectively when they are embedded in a story,"" he says. ""When you bond information with emotion, which is the catalyst in every story well told, the information is then experienced, ingested, emotionalized and thus recalled and acted upon more effectively."" Of course, not everyone has inherent storytelling skills, but that doesn't mean they can't be learned. ""Practice, practice, practice. You will tap into your inherent resource,"" Guber says. ""Be clear to yourself about what your intention is, that you want to be heard and felt and what you want as your goal."" Here are 12 quick tips to remember when telling purposeful stories that could help boost your career, from Guber's book. 1. Data dumps are not stories -- dump them, don't tell them! 2. A purposeful story is a call to action -- be sure to make your call. 3. Successful stories turn ""me"" to ""we"" -- align your interests. 4. Be sure your story tells what's in it for them. 5. Be interested in what interests your listeners and they'll find your story interesting and your goal compelling. 6. Remember, the context in which you tell your story colors the story you tell. 7. Your firsthand or witnessed experiences are the best raw material for your story. 8. Employ the element of surprise. 9. Craft the beginning to shine the light on your challenge or problem. 10. Shape the middle around the struggles, then meet the challenge. 11. End with a resolution that ignites in the listener your call to action. 12.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- College senior Kyla Berry was looking forward to voting in her first presidential election, even carrying her voter registration card in her wallet. ""Vote suppression is real. It does sometimes happen,"" said Daniel P. Tokaji, a law professor at Ohio State University. But about two weeks ago, Berry got disturbing news from local election officials. ""This office has received notification from the state of Georgia indicating that you are not a citizen of the United States and therefore, not eligible to vote,"" a letter from the Fulton County Department of Registration and Elections said. But Berry is a U.S. citizen, born in Boston, Massachusetts. She has a passport and a birth certificate to prove it.  Watch some of the concerns of voting experts » . The letter, which was dated October 2, gave her a week from the time it was dated to prove her citizenship. There was a problem, though -- the letter was postmarked October 9. ""It was the most bizarre thing. I immediately called my mother and asked her to send me my birth certificate, and then I was like, 'It's too late, apparently,' "" Berry said. Berry is one of more than 50,000 registered Georgia voters who have been ""flagged"" because of a computer mismatch in their personal identification information. At least 4,500 of those people are having their citizenship questioned and the burden is on them to prove eligibility to vote. Experts say lists of people with mismatches are often systematically cut, or ""purged,"" from voter rolls. It's a scenario that's being repeated all across the country, with cases like Berry's raising fears of potential vote suppression in crucial swing states. ""What most people don't know is that every year, elections officials strike millions of names from the voter rolls using processes that are secret, prone to error and vulnerable to manipulation,"" said Wendy Weiser, an elections expert with New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. ""That means that lots and lots of eligible voters could get knocked off the voter rolls without any notice and, in many cases, without any opportunity to correct it before Election Day."" Weiser acknowledged that ""purging done well and with proper accountability"" is necessary to remove people who have died or moved out of state. ""But the problem is it's not necessary to do inaccurate purges that catch up thousands of eligible voters without any notice or any opportunity to fix it before Election Day and really without any public scrutiny at all,"" she said. Such allegations have flared up across the United States during this election cycle, most notably in Ohio, where a recent lawsuit has already gone to the U.S. Supreme Court. There, the state Republican Party sued Ohio's Democratic secretary of state in an effort to make her generate a list of people who had mismatched information. But Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said generating such a list would create numerous problems too close to the election and possibly disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters. The Supreme Court last week ruled against the GOP on appeal of a lower court order directing Brunner to prepare the list. In Florida, election officials found that 75 percent of about 20,000 voter registration applications from a three-week period in September were mismatched due to typographical and administrative errors. Florida's Republican secretary of state ordered the computer match system implemented in early September. In Wisconsin, Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen sued the state's election board after it voted against a proposal to implement a ""no-match"" policy. The board conducted an audit of its voter rolls and found a 22 percent match failure rate -- including for four of the six members of the board. The Brennan Center has also documented cases across the country of possible illegal purging, impediments to college student voting and difficulties accessing voter registration. A lawsuit has been filed over Georgia's mismatch system, and the state is also under fire for requesting Social Security records for verification checks on about 2 million voters -- more requests than any other state. One of the lawyers involved in the lawsuit says Georgia is violating a federal law that prohibits widespread voter purges within 90 days of the election, arguing that the letters were sent out too close to the election date. ""They are systematically using these lists and matching them and using those matches to send these letters out to voters,"" said McDonald, director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project in Georgia. ""It's not, you know, an individualized notion of people maybe not being citizens or not being residents. They're using a systematic purging procedure that's expressly prohibited by federal laws."" Asked if he believed that eligible voters were purged in Georgia, McDonald said, ""If people who are properly eligible, are getting improperly challenged and purged, the answer would be 'Yes,' "" he said. Elise Shore, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said letters like those sent to Berry appear to violate two federal laws against voter purging within 90 days of the election. ""People are being targeted, and people are being told they are non-citizens, including both naturalized citizens and U.S.-born citizens,"" said Shore, another plaintiff in the Georgia lawsuit. ""They're being told they're not eligible to vote, based on information in a database that hasn't been checked and approved by the Department of Justice, and that we know has flaws in it."" Georgia's Secretary of State Karen Handel, a Republican who began working on purging voter rolls since she was elected in 2006, said that won't happen. If there are errors, she said, there is still plenty of time to resolve the problems. iReport.com: Are you voting early? Handel says she is not worried the verification process will prevent eligible voters from casting a ballot. ""In this state and all states, there's a process to ensure that a voter who comes in -- even if there's a question about their status -- that they will vote either provisional or challenge ballot, which is a paper ballot,"" she said. ""So then the voter has ample opportunity to clarify any issues or address them,"" Handel added. ""And I think that's a really important process."" Handel denied the efforts to verify the vote are suppression. ""This is about ensuring the integrity of our elections,"" she said. ""It is imperative to have checks and balances on the front end, during the processes and on the back end. That's what the verification process is about."" So someone like Kyla Berry will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot when she votes, but it's up to county election officials whether those ballots would actually count. Berry says she will try to vote, but she's not confident it will count. ""I know this happens, but I cannot believe it's happening to me,"" she said. ""If I weren't allowed to vote, I would just feel like that would be ... like the worst thing ever -- a travesty.""","Kyla Berry got a letter saying to vote, she must prove she's a U.S. citizen .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A goodwill basketball game between a U.S. college and a Chinese military team turned into an ugly brawl, leaving a black-eye on sports diplomacy. The game between the Georgetown team, which is in on a trip to China, and the Bayi Rockets escalated into an on-court fracas Thursday. With about 10 minutes left into the exhibition game and the score tied at 64, players exchanged blows, triggering a bench-clearing melee. Match organizers failed to keep order on the court. Irate Chinese spectators hurled plastic bottles onto the court as the Georgetown players headed for the locker room. The American collegiate team is on a 10-day trip as part of a program to promote goodwill through sports. The goodwill match coincided with Vice President Joe Biden's official visit to China. A day earlier, Biden watched another exhibition game between the Hoyas and another Chinese team. Few mainstream Chinese media reported the Thursday fracas. The brawl forced the game to end early, Chinese newspaper Yangzi Evening News reported. It was ""very physical from the beginning"" and the situation deteriorated, says the report. ""All substitute players from both teams got involved after the brawl broke out."" An amateur video on YouTube shows a Chinese player pushing a U.S. player to the ground and punching him repeatedly. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. The Bayi Rockets is an army team that plays in the China Basketball Association, the local professional league. Most of their players serve in the People's Liberation Army. CNN could not reach the Bayi Rockets for comment, but Georgetown head coach John Thompson III expressed his regrets. ""Tonight, two great teams played a very competitive game that unfortunately ended after heated exchanges with both teams,"" Thompson said. ""We sincerely regret that this situation occurred."" The brawl drew comments on Chinese social media, with links to video posted on Chinese websites. However, some of the video postings have been deleted without explanation. Many comments criticize Bayi Rocket players. ""(The players') Basketball skills are not very hot but their temper is hot,"" says @alesfu on Tencent Weibo, China's second-largest social media. @Chinanoe writes: ""Most of sportsmen have muscular limbs with simple mind."" For decades, Chinese sports promoted the slogan ""friendship first, competition second."" In recent years, however, competition for prizes, honor and fame have sometimes trumped sportsmanship. Violence and brawls have erupted in some team sports like basketball and soccer games. In October, an exhibition match between China and Brazil national teams ended in a bench-clearing fistfight. The next day, the Chinese national federation apologized to Brazil. China's head coach, Bob Donewald, an American, along with three players and three match officials were suspended for a few games by the Federation of International Basketball Association.","The brawl starts about 10 minutes left into the exhibition game .

"Washington (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama invited more than 20 accomplished women to the White House on Wednesday, asking them to serve as mentors for area high school students. The women, along with the first lady, fanned out across the District of Columbia and surrounding suburbs in the afternoon visiting six local high schools encouraging the teenagers to follow their dreams and work hard to get there. ""There is no magic to being here. You know, Barack and I were not born with silver spoons in our mouths and connections and money and resources. A lot of why we're where we are today is because we worked hard. We felt a deep passion for getting our education,"" the first lady told students at Ballou High school in Washington. She recalled having to get up as a child at 6:30 a.m. to ride a bus for an hour and a half to attend a better high school across town, for better preparation for college. ""I know what it feels like to struggle to get the education that you need. In so many ways, I see myself in you all,"" Mrs. Obama shared. ""And I want you to see yourselves in me, so that you're not looking at me just as the first lady of the United States."" Mrs. Obama's events on Wednesday were scheduled as part of the end of National Women's History month. At Washington's Woodson High school, the four mentors included an Air Force general, a TV network executive, an actress and a gymnastics champion who all answered questions for more than 20 female students. ""Good, old-fashioned hard work, that is the only thing that separates you from the crowd,"" said actress Rashida Jones, currently starring in the television series ""Parks and Recreation."" ""Don't feel like you have to be defined by your circumstances,"" she added. Olympic gold medalist Dominique Dawes told the students that they should keep their attitudes positive. ""Whenever I've gone into something with a negative attitude, something negative has come out of it,"" she said. The students had several questions for Gen. Dana Born, currently dean of the faculty at the Air Force Academy in Colorado, including what it was like to be one of the few women attending the Air Force Academy when she began several decades ago, and whether or not she had ever felt discrimination for being a woman. Born told the students that they needed to find their strength and then ""practice, practice, practice"" to reach success. Nina Lederman, vice president for program development at Lifetime Networks told the students that she had originally wanted to be an actress, but when it became apparent that she didn't have the acting talent, she shifted to a career in production. All 20 of the women mentors returned to the White House on Wednesday evening for dinner in the East Room with about 120 area students.

"Singapore (CNN) -- Dr. George Khoo vividly remembers the opium dens. Fifty years ago, they lined the street just down from his small Singapore clinic. It was the time just before independence in 1965, before the shiny skyscrapers, velvet freeways and almost-painfully spotless streets. Many of his patients were addicts struggling to unhook, he writes. Many would not come to the clinic. He had to go into the dens to find and treat them. ""It was hard treating them in the pitch darkness,"" he recalled. ""I had to call out their names and they would call out to me. I would then give the injection, but I never really knew for sure who exactly I was treating."" Khoo's gritty memories have been captured as part of a unique, crowdsourced history project that Singapore has commissioned ahead of its 50th anniversary of independence in 2015. The goal of the Singapore Memory Project is not to produce a slick history. ""We're not going for certain types of people,"" said Memory Project director Gene Tan. ""What we're looking for is specificity. It's the messiness of it, of the lives people lived and the communities they lived in, that we want to have."" So far, Singaporeans have sent in more than 400,000 memories -- including text, audio, still images, even e-books and video uploaded to the project's website or through a free iPhone app available on iTunes. With the support of 120 partner groups and 130 volunteers, the project hopes to record 5 million Singaporeans, virtually everyone in the country. Before the economic boom . Along Singapore's shoreline in the years after independence, fishermen would lay their morning catch on the beach where vendors from the nearby ""hawker"" stands would buy fish to serve at their small, hot food shacks, recalled Faridah Anom. Today, that site is home to a row of terrace houses. ""Everything is gone,"" Anom said. ""It was so long ago."" It was only the 1960s, the 1970s. But in Singapore, that was another eon. In 1965, the year of independence, Singapore's per capita GDP was $516. Last year, it was about $60,000 -- among the top five in the world. That mammoth growth has dramatically transformed Singapore's landscape in just a few short decades, from rows of hardscrabble fishing shacks and bungalow neighborhoods to a towering glass, steel and concrete wonderland of efficiency, wealth and dazzle. Little remains of what was there just a short time ago: Many of the houses, the stores, the neighborhoods and the communities have been transformed. Hamzah Yaacor, 17, only remembers today's booming Singapore. As a volunteer for the Singapore Memory Project, Yaacor and two other students are interviewing seniors along a just a few streets for a small book of interviews titled ""Streets We Remember."" Yaacor said he is learning more than he ever did in school about Singapore's history from people like Anom. ""You start talking about their memories, and they just open up,"" Yaacor said. ""Looking at this personal history, it's more authentic."" Singapore schools, he said, teach history as a blanket of facts, figures, dates and places. But he said it's actually more like a patchwork quilt, something that he and his fellow students hope to capture for the Memory Project. All the memories collected have fallen into two broad categories: individual recollections about Singaporeans' communities, their friends, their schools, the way they were. The other are collective memories -- the experiences and objects that nearly everyone shared. Big and small memories . James Seah was 11 years old in 1961 when a massive fire tore through his neighborhood, Singapore's Bukit Ho Swee squatter settlement, destroying some 2,000 homes. ""Dark billowing smoke filled the sky, the smell was toxic,"" Seah recalled in his Singapore Memory Project blog post. ""People were screaming and shouting 'Fire, Fire' ... I had never seen a big fire that burnt down houses and places before. I had not read about it, or watched it on television (monochrome TV broadcast in Singapore only began in April 1963) or at the movies. He described a feeling of ""excitement rather than a fear of danger."" ""My mother and I ran as fast as we could as we fled from the burning houses,"" Seah said. ""There was a stampede. The older and weaker people were carried by younger and stronger ones."" The Bukit Ho Swee fire left four dead and thousands homeless and is one of those moments in Singapore's history where most people alive at the time remember where they were when they learned about the massive blaze. Other memories focus more on Singapore's rapidly evolving culture, including one e-book focusing on the traditional games children played, arranged by clicking on alphabet letters made to look like children's blocks. Another e-book covers the playgrounds that have been swept away by the city-state's rapid development. Ruth Ann Keh, 17, and two of her fellow students compiled the memories of people living in the Rochor Centre complex that is slated to be torn down in 2016 to make way for a new expressway. Many residents have lived there for decades, and neighbors were like family. One resident told Keh the story of a birthday party some boys held years ago on an open deck, and how all the neighbors came down. ""What struck me the most was the sense of family,"" Keh said. ""All the people I talked to mentioned the bond. Now, you don't know your neighbors. It's not as it was before. But it is possible to have a sense of neighborhood. It's just a matter of making time."" Sharon Ng recalled fond memories of growing up watching her grandmother use a bucket instead of a cash register at the Kian Guan sauce factory. ""Inside, my father, uncle and one hired worker would sit on small stools or on the floor, hard at work six days weekly making chilli, tomato and soya sauces, bottling them and tying the bottles expertly with thin rope-like twine in packs of six or 12,"" Ng wrote in her Singapore Memory Project post. ""Grandma sold sauces at the ground floor shop while the rest were sold to other businesses. All her takings were kept in an iron pail on a pulley. She just pulled the rope down, put in the money and the pail went up."" A generation's gift . Singapore's Memory Project is about a country getting personal with itself, and project director Tan said most of the posts are ""very emotional."" ""There's a lot of longing in all the memories -- longing and attachment to people who are gone, places that are gone,"" he said. But he said there's also celebration about the stability that Singapore enjoys today. ""There's a great sense of relief of where we are today,"" Tan said. In the process, the Memory Project staffers say, they are learning things about themselves that they never expected. They thought the project was about talking to others, about something external. But they've realized that documenting Singapore's history is about them, too. ""We started out with a lot of arrogance,"" Tan explained. ""We started with an intent to hack into other people's memories. What's humbling is there's nothing to hack into, but only things to discover."" Singapore is a young country that has packed more history into its few years than most others. But in a place where most everyone came from somewhere else, the Memory Project is helping define what it means to be Singaporean. It is bringing texture to the life of the nation, endowing a diverse people with a common identity, a way to look forward together. The submissions also make for astonishingly interesting reads. ""This is the gift of our generation,"" Tan said. ""History is not just for the leaders. It's about random people, too.""","Singapore is using crowdsourcing to compile its recent history .
The city-state will celebrate 50 years of independence in 2015 .

"(CNN) -- Getting hired or promoted in today's competitive environment is no easy feat. But, then again, neither was our pitch for MasterCard. The rules of the game were made clear: whichever advertising campaign had the best consumer test score would be declared the winner and awarded the MasterCard account. Yet, despite the fact that our now famous ""Priceless"" campaign did not fare well in testing, we won the business, and the rest is history. Fifteen years later, ""Priceless"" remains one of the most recognizable ad campaigns in recent history. So why did we win the business, defying set rules and what early testing said would be a failure? According to MasterCard's CMO Larry Flanagan, it was because of our ""core"" -- we were a fighting and a cohesive team of competitors, who believed with every ounce of our beings that this campaign would crush their long-standing competitor, Visa. In other words, we had tapped their ""hidden agenda."" The hidden agenda is the unspoken, visceral, emotional motivation that is behind every decision. Whether deciding who wins the billion dollar deal ... or the job, the hidden agenda is always at work. Your mission is to connect to it, and here's how: . Do your hidden-agenda homework . It's not enough to know factoids about the company. That's table stakes. Do your homework about the emotional state of the company. Are they on a high, yet searching for the next big thing? Are they in crisis and in need of a turnaround? Are they guided by a value system that drives the decisions they make? It turns out that every decision stems from a hidden agenda, which can be found in three forms: . â€¢ Wants are about people viewing their circumstances through the lens of ambition and confidence. â€¢ Needs are about viewing circumstances through the lens of fear or concern. â€¢ Values are about people viewing the world entirely through the lens of their belief systems. In addition to understanding the company's hidden agenda, study the person who will be interviewing you to determine their hidden agenda. Connect with your real ambition . I had breakfast a few weeks ago with a very compelling young man. This electrifying fellow was exuberant, quirky bordering on eccentric, and without pretense. He spoke of what he hoped to create in his life, and I hired him on the spot. Your real ambition is a deep desire to create something special that doesn't yet exist. It's bigger than mere ambition because it's noble. When the person you are trying to reach is touched by your real ambition and makes common cause, they'll hire you. Try this: Think about what you want to accomplish, but precede with the words ""I will ..."" Make sure it is seemingly impossible, devoid of practicality and utterly fantastic. You can create a shared bond with your interviewer, because they see you both share a common vision. See also: Is happiness the secret of success? Bond with your credo . A company is many things, but it is a community first. Each community has a set of values that bind them; I call it a credo, Latin for ""I believe."" Dig deeply and look behind the facts and figures. What does the company you're applying to believe? If you want to be part of it, know it and connect yourself to it. Try this: Take out a sheet of paper, and write ""I believe that ..."" What words would you select? What values would you express that would make you proud for others to see? Connections are made because of the beliefs you share. You'll be hired, because your interviewer will see that your credo syncs perfectly with theirs. Ignite with your core . Your core is what makes you stand out from the pack. While many people have similar traits, your core is comprised of a set of skills, abilities, and strengths that, together, are completely unique to you. And as was the case with MasterCard, your core will be seen as something the company needs -- the ""answer to their prayers"" and a means by which you can help them. See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' Critical to your core is authenticity. As a wonderful mentor once told me when I was presenting what I thought was a perfect version of myself and thinking that the real me was no road to glory: the person you are is the person they want to see. They are hiring you, not a manufactured version of something or someone else. Try this: Ask five people who know you well and support you to write down the key characteristics they associate with you. Not only will you be staggered by what you'll get, but you will also feel proud and affirmed. You mobilize people to hire you, because their vital needs are satisfied by the authenticity and sincerity of your core. Your pursuit for the promotion or job of your dreams is not a fact and figures game -- it is a human game. When you make a profound connection with the emotional desire of your boss or interviewer, the facts and figures will take the backseat, every time.

"Washington (CNN) -- When he won re-election by a landslide last year, Chris Christie's calling card became the Republican who can get Democratic votes. This week, the New Jersey governor travels to three blue states -- Illinois, Connecticut and Michigan -- to show Republicans gubernatorial candidates how it's done. It's a busy travel schedule that comes as government sources say they have no evidence so far that Christie was personally involved in last year's George Washington Bridge scandal. The governor has long said he had no previous knowledge of the plot to close down access lanes to the country's busiest bridge out of apparent political retribution. Christie is clearly relieved. ""You're always grateful to hear that the things that I said appear like they're going to be confirmed, if these reports are accurate,"" he said during an ""Ask the Governor"" radio program on Thursday. The M.O. of the GOP historically is to have an establishment candidate in waiting -- someone who came close before but lost, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, or someone who captures the money and momentum early on, like George W. Bush. That hasn't happened so far in the 2016 presidential cycle, which has allowed Christie to remain viable. Still, it's not as if the bridge scandal ever stopped him from preparing a potential 2016 White House run. He's been getting in better shape since he had lap-band surgery in February 2013. Republican sources confirm to CNN that Christie has lost 85 pounds. He revealed that at a private fundraiser hosted by key GOP donors including David Koch, The New York Times first reported. In fact, CNN is told Christie discussed his weight in response to a donor's question about his health. Christie has largely taken questions and jokes about his health in stride. At an event in New Jersey with Romney earlier this month, Christie played along as the 2012 GOP nominee recalled a story about how he prepared a large meal for Christie recently, only to realize the governor was trying to lose weight. ""I brought out all this food and put it out in front of the table,"" Romney said. ""And Chris sat there and picked at a couple pieces of lettuce."" Still, it's Christie's political prep that is most telling. He has been using his platform as chairman of the Republican Governors Association to travel around the country and campaign for candidates on the ballot this year. It's a job that also lets him meet people who could be helpful in any presidential run, especially the early contest states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Despite the bridge scandal making headlines not long after Christie became chairman, the governor has still raised a whopping $75 million for the organization. How to campaign without campaigning . He's also going to key swing states such as Florida and North Carolina, as well as some red states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Oklahoma -- where the New Jersey governor could use some get-to-know-ya time. But along the way, he has seen firsthand evidence of conservative skepticism about the Garden State governor's ideology. The group Judicial Crisis Network, for example, spent money on negative ads in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina as Christie was visiting the states. The ads blasted Christie for appointing liberal judges to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Another potential problem for Christie - especially among the fiscal conservatives in his party, is that New Jersey's credit rating has been downgraded eight times since he became governor in 2010. Christie aides argue the reasons for the downgrading go back to fiscal decisions made before he was elected governor five years ago. But for fiscal conservatives looking for a presidential candidate who can get the country out of debt, it could be a deal breaker politically.","Chris Christie has lost 85 pounds as he gears up for a possible White House run .

"(CNN) -- Malala Yousafzai stared death in the face a year ago when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head. The militants still want to kill her, but she has learned to turn the other cheek, she said. The Pakistani Taliban issued a new death threat this week against the 16-year-old. She has been fighting for years for the right of girls to get an education, putting her at odds with the Islamist militants. Jon Stewart asked her what she would do if a Taliban assassin came calling again. ""I'll tell him how important education is, and that I even want education for your children as well,"" she said Tuesday. And I would tell him, 'that's what I want to tell you, now do what you want.'"" Fighting the Taliban is important, but through peace, dialogue and education, she said. But the Taliban often prefer to let their guns do the talking. They would target her again, if she came back to Pakistan, a spokesman for the militant group told CNN on Monday. Malala has lived outside of her homeland ever since she was shot last year. Spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said the teenager was targeted because she was used in propaganda against the Taliban. Gordon Brown: How Malala forced terrorists onto defensive . ""The girl has been used by the Pakistani administration for propaganda against the Taliban and had been involved in a fake-anti Taliban and anti-Islam propaganda and was targeted,"" Shahid said. ""Yes, if there is any opportunity we can target, she would be on our hit list again."" The Taliban would target her again if given the chance, he said, just as it would target anyone who opposes the group. He denied she was targeted for promoting education for girls. ""Taliban are not opposed to girls education, if it's within the ambit of Shariah and Islamic education, but they could not support anti-Islamic agendas and Westernized education systems,"" Shahid said. The militant group destroyed over 170 schools between 2007 and 2009, the U.N. said. Malala was 15 when gunmen jumped onto her school bus in Pakistan's Swat Valley on October 9, 2012, and shot her in the head. She survived and underwent brain surgery in Britain. She recovered and addressed the United Nations in New York on her 16th birthday, July 12. ""They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed,"" she said. ""And then, out of that silence, came thousands of voices."" The Taliban's actions sparked large protests in Pakistan and condemnation worldwide. In a BBC interview published Monday, she said the Taliban are ""misusing the name of Islam."" ""Killing people, torturing people and flogging people ... it's totally against Islam,"" she said. Taliban to Malala: Why we shot you . The Taliban banned girls from schools in the Swat Valley in 2009. Malala anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls' education, telling CNN in 2011, ""I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk. I have the right to go to market. I have the right to speak up."" This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world. Malala's name has been mentioned in speculation about the Nobel Peace Prize, due to be announced Friday. Her memoir, ""I am Malala,"" will be published Tuesday. And on October 18, she is expected to attend a ""Youth, Education and the Commonwealth"" reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. In the BBC interview, she said she wants to return to Pakistan someday and continue her fight. ""I will be a politician in my future,"" the told the BBC. ""I want to change the future of my country and I want to make education compulsory.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for Omar Gonzalez, who is accused of jumping the White House fence, after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial. U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer expressed concern that the initial mental exam, ordered by a magistrate judge, was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it. David Bos, the federal public defender representing Gonzalez, objected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial. The 60-minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense. But the result, finding Gonzalez not competent, can't be ignored, Collyer said in court Tuesday. Bos told the judge: ""There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial."" Nonetheless, he withdrew his objections and agreed to allow his client to undergo a fuller competency examination to try to undo the results of the initial examination. The judge delayed arraignment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week. Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion, setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures. He was found with a folding knife and told a Secret Service agent ""that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people,"" according to an agent's affidavit filed in court. His family has said Gonzalez, an Iraq War veteran, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia. The incident came amid a series of disclosures about Secret Service lapses that cost the agency's director, Julia Pierson, her job. Collyer said that during the initial examination, the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings. The judge suggested that Gonzalez's mental issues, which she didn't describe more fully, could be resolved with medication. The judge also raised concerns that the government's handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for Gonzalez to be examined at a federal Bureau of Prisons facility. She gave one example of an unnamed defendant who sat at the District of Columbia jail for months before anyone noticed he hadn't received the tests that were ordered. The problem, she said, was that sequestration has cut resources for the Bureau of Prisons and finding a bed can take time. Collyer ordered the mental health screening to be done in 30 days and set a new hearing for December 3 at 10:30 a.m.","Omar Gonzalez is accused of jumping the White House fence in September .

"(CNN) -- You don't have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to be wowed by the custom bikes created by Paul Teutul Sr. and his sons as seen on the Discovery Network's ""American Chopper"" for a decade and now airing on CMT's ""Orange County Choppers."" Teutul, or ""Senior"" as he's called, left the U.S. Merchant Marine and eventually opened his first business, called ""Paul's Welding,"" according to the Orange County Choppers website. After he grew his welding shop into a 30-employee business called ""Iron Works,"" his passion for customizing motorcycles grew in leaps and bounds. But a constant companion on Senior's ride was alcohol. ""Back in the day, I kinda started early drinking and getting high,"" he says. ""If drinking was in the Olympics, I would have been a gold medalist."" But he also says he thought he would grow out of what he now recognizes as addiction. That didn't happen. ""What it does is it gets progressively worse, and I think that I finally got to the point where it kinda just took over my life completely,"" he says. Teutul says there's a long history of alcoholism in his family: ""My uncle was an alcoholic, my mother was an alcoholic. And you know -- most of them died from that."" Eventually, he realized everything he had built was at risk if things didn't change. ""I was fortunate -- in 1985, I was running a business, I had a small wielding shop, and I just got lucky,"" he says. I went to a 12-step program and then I just kept going."" Just because he stopped drinking, however, didn't mean his buddies did. ""It's tough when you're not drinking and you've got two people on either side of you in a truck knocking down shots of Black Velvet (whiskey) and drinking beers and you're in the middle."" It wasn't easy, he says. For nine years straight, he was afraid to miss a meeting. ""It did take me two years before I wasn't thirsty anymore."" He says he doesn't go to meetings these days and that he never feels like drinking. But Teutul says given his past experience, he will not drink again. Senior just celebrated 29 years of sobriety, which he describes as ""quite the trip."" ""When you get sober, you put things in play and they happen,"" he says. ""You think a lot clearer. Your whole attitude changes, you kinda learn how to live all over again, which is a tough thing by itself."" And it's a message he continues to share. ""My life's an open book, ""says Teutul. ""I know people that had problems and I think that I've been a power of example to them. I've heard from people that they've turned their lives around from me sharing my experience, so it's all good.

"(CNN) -- Speaking off the cuff is always a bit of a tightrope act for the occupant of the nation's highest office, and even more so when it's in front of a room of reporters. President Barack Obama teetered on that high wire Thursday when he said that he and his advisers ""don't have a strategy yet"" for dealing with ISIS in Syria. The comment, which set off an instant firestorm of commentary, seemed to feed into the narrative cultivated by critics of the President that he has no coherent strategy. ""Obama has given up even 'leading from behind,' "" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted. ""Now, as the world watches, he insists he has no strategy at all."" Obama's no 'strategy yet' comment sparks a political uproar . Here are a few times when other U.S. politicians found themselves in similar territory: . President George H.W. Bush and the 'amazing' supermarket scanner . Born into a wealthy family, schooled at an elite Massachusetts boarding school and then Yale, the nation's 41st President had more than a couple of strikes against him when it came to an elitist, out-of-touch public image. Whether the image was true or not, it was driven deeper into the public consciousness after a widely mocked 1992 encounter with a mock-up of a grocery store scanner. Media accounts of the encounter said the President appeared to be ""amazed"" and ""bewildered"" by the technology, which by then had long been in common use. "" 'If some guy came in and spelled George Bush differently, could you catch it?' the President asked 'Yes,' he was told, and he shook his head in wonder,"" wrote Andrew Rosenthal in The New York Times. The mythology has some flaws, Bush defenders say. According to an Associated Press article published not long after the encounter, the scanner's manufacturer defended the President, saying the scanner actually was pretty advanced for its day. ""The whole thing is ludicrous,"" the AP quoted the company man as saying. ""What he was amazed about was the ability of the scanner to take that torn label and reassemble it."" President Jimmy Carter and the 'malaise' speech . Carter never uttered the word ""malaise"" in his July 15, 1979, televised address on what he saw as a growing ""crisis of confidence"" in the country. But it, perhaps more than any other single word, came to describe Carter's presidency. Here's what he actually said: . ""It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will. We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation."" And, he warned, it's ""threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America."" The speech didn't go over well with many who saw Carter as an ineffective hand-wringer who had no business possessing the inspirational bully pulpit of the presidency. Historian Sean Wilentz wrote in his 2008 book, ""The Age of Reagan"" that Carter ""appeared to be abdicating his role as leader and blaming the people themselves for their own afflictions."" ""It was a form of anti-politics unlike any Americans had ever seen -- the chief magistrate, who was supposed to inspire the nation and lift it out of its slough of despond, was instead complaining about unrelieved anguish and emptiness,"" Wilentz wrote. But, like Bush's grocery store moment, the narrative had a flip side. According to author Kevin Mattson, Carter's approval ratings jumped after the speech, and mail poured into the White House from citizens who wrote they were moved to action by the speech and what they saw as refreshing honesty from a politician. President Ronald Reagan and the 'bomb' joke . Making a voice check before his regular weekend radio speech at the height of the Cold War in August 1984, Reagan joked, ""My fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which outlaws Russia forever. The bombing begins in five minutes."" While it was just a joke made by a man well-known for his love of quips and never meant for public consumption, the comment embodied beliefs among critics of Reagan as a dangerous hawk obsessed with doing battle against an ""Evil Empire,"" his finger eagerly hovering over the trigger of America's nuclear arsenal. Al Gore and the Internet . Ask anyone about Gore these days, and you're likely to hear about one of two things: His concern about climate change and how he purportedly claimed in 1999 to have invented the Internet. While Gore was only vice president at the time, he was thinking about running for the President's job, and the statement helped saddle him with an image as pompous and self-aggrandizing. Like Carter and the ""malaise"" speech, Gore never used the word, ""invented."" This is what he actually said, during an interview on CNN: ""During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet."" Many techies took Gore's side, saying that while neither he nor any other single person created the Internet, he was, in fact instrumental in helping build out Internet infrastructure. But tech nerds were no match for the power of late-night television jokesters or, ironically, the power of the budding Internet. To wit, even today, you can still find the claim all over the Internet. Michael Dukakis and the (cold) death penalty response . It happened on October 13, 1988, during a presidential debate between Dukakis and then-Vice President George Bush. The mediator, CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw, asked Dukakis that if his wife were raped and murdered, if he thought he'd support the death penalty for the killer. ""No, I don't, Bernard, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.

"(CNN) -- Oh, San Francisco. It's almost not fair. It's not enough that you have spectacular views, rich culture, delicious food, a legacy of great music, cable cars and one really cool bridge. Now your Giants are back in the World Series for the third time in the last five seasons. Really? Come on. This embarrassment of riches is just one more reason for the rest of us to envy you. And maybe plan a visit. Because -- who are we kidding? -- if we could afford it, many of us would love to live in San Francisco, or at least swing by more often. Some of us even left our hearts there. As the Giants prepare to face the upstart Kansas City Royals on baseball's big stage next week, here are just a handful of reasons why San Francisco is already a winner. Giants in their field . For all their recent success, it's hard to dislike the Giants. They've got Buster Posey, the aw-shucks MVP catcher who may be the West Coast's answer to Derek Jeter. They've got a chubby player whose nickname is Kung Fu Panda. They've got another called The Freak. They also play in one of the most scenic ballparks in the majors, with its bay views and fleets of kayakers beyond right field, hoping for a waterlogged home run. The Giants won it all in 2010, and again in 2012. If this even-numbered pattern keeps up, the Royals are in trouble. City by the Bay . Fisherman's Wharf. Ghirardelli Square. Coit Tower. Golden Gate Park. The Haight. Nob Hill. San Francisco's landmark attractions, and neighborhoods, are almost too numerous to name. But the jewel in the city's glittering crown has got to be its singular location on a hilly peninsula surrounded by dramatic water views. Where else can you take a boat ride past arguably the nation's most magnificent bridge (the Golden Gate) and most infamous prison (Alcatraz), set against a glittering city skyline and a backdrop of mountains? Another view: 7 reasons why Kansas City's a winner . Hollywood north . Yes, the movie industry is headquartered eight hours' south in Los Angeles, but a trip to San Francisco will satisfy even the most passionate film buff. Fans of Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" can view the Dante Building at 1606 Stockton Street, where the rifle-toting ""Scorpio killer"" staked out a rooftop. Visit Fort Point, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, to see where Kim Novak jumps into the bay in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" or retrace Steve McQueen's classic car chase down the city's streets in ""Bullitt."" Younger moviegoers may want to follow in Robin Williams' heeled footsteps by strolling past the ornate Victorian home, at 2640 Steiner Street in Pacific Heights, where parts of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" were shot. San Francisco treats . Once you get past the Rice-A-Roni jokes, and the sourdough bread and the Ghirardelli chocolate (go ahead, we'll wait), you'll find a vibrant food scene highlighted by fresh seafood, Pacific Rim accents and the still-pervasive influence of Bay Area farm-to-table pioneer Alice Waters. For a smorgasbord of fresh flavors visit the Ferry Building, where you'll find purveyors of artisanal ice cream and olive oil and a bustling farmers market on weekends. Or splurge in one of the city's finer restaurants, from State Bird Provisions (contemporary American) to Flour + Water (Italian) to Traci des Jardins' new Commissary (Spanish-Californian) at the Presidio. Welcome, one and all . From the Summer of Love to the gay-rights movement and beyond, San Francisco has long been a bastion of tolerance. The city encourages people to be themselves, and eccentricity is welcome. Look no further than the Bay to Breakers, an annual 7-mile footrace/carnival/street happening where runners cross the city wear wacky costumes or sometimes even nothing at all. One race-day tradition has runners tossing tortillas at each other while waiting to cross the starting line. Music . The city's hippie culture that flourished during the 1960s gave birth to some of the most recognizable music the world has ever known. From Jefferson Airplane to the Grateful Dead, the city nurtured many beloved folk, rock and psychedelic bands and supported other acts that passed through to play at the legendary Fillmore. Back in the day, that iconic concert hall, with promoter Bill Graham, hosted such world-class artists as Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and Creedence Clearwater Revival. And from ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" by crooner Tony Bennett to Journey's ""Lights (When the Lights Go Down in the City),"" San Francisco's beauty has inspired many a love song. Lombard Street . You've probably seen it in pictures or movies: the serpentine block of Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth that's sometimes called the ""crookedest street in the world."" Hop in a car, pop some Dramamine and then zig-zag through eight sharp downhill turns for an iconic San Francisco experience. As long as you drive under 5 mph, you shouldn't be too concerned about the 27-degree slope. Those who would rather keep their brakes intact can walk down the street -- or up, if you're feeling energetic -- on a railed staircase. Or for a lower-stress experience, just climb on the Powell-Hyde cable car line and enjoy the views with your hands free to take photos.

"(CNN) -- Can the world agree that 2013 will be the year when a girl's right to education will finally be won -- even in the most remote and once lawless corners of the globe? Last October, shocked by the attempted murder of the 15-year-old Pakistani girl Malala Yousufzai, three million people around the world rushed to sign a petition demanding universal girls' education. The Pakistani government then agreed for the first time to legislate compulsory free education and provided stipends for three million children. Only this week Shahnaz Nazli, a brave 41-year-old teacher on her way with her child to work at an all girls' school, was shot dead and joined an ever-lengthening list of teachers and students murdered because of their support for the basic right of girls to go to school. The murder demonstrates yet again that in parts of the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan, and Africa, intimidation and violence are the daily reality of life for many girls who want to go to school and the many educators who want to teach them. Even today, five months after Malala's shooting in the Swat Valley, her school friends remain in fear of violence simply for attempting to return to school. A new petition, launched this week on www.educationenvoy.org -- with its first signatories, Malala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin -- calls for an immediate tightening of security protection for pupils and teachers when going to school in Pakistan. It is because of the tragedies that befell Malala and her school friends -- and now Shahnaz -- that in Washington in three weeks' time the U.N. and World Bank will bring together the countries that are off-track in securing universal primary education to devise a plan to move further and faster to universal education by the end of 2015, the date by which the Millennium Development Goals are to be met. The atrocity against Shahnaz -- murdered only 200 meters from the all-girls school where she taught in Khyber tribal district -- is a stark reminder of the continuation of the threats, intimidation, shootings, arson attacks and sometimes even murder that are the Taliban's weapons of a war against girls' opportunity. They also remind us that the silent majority who once stood in the face of these threats will be silent no more and that public revulsion against the violence has strengthened the resolve of girls to go to school. Over the past several years, Pakistani Taliban militants have destroyed hundreds of schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Last year Al Jazeera showed how Shabeena, the headmistress of a state-run girls' primary school in the troubled province, was battling to keep girls in school in spite of the threats. The film features Afshan, one of six daughters of a night security guard, determined to secure an education. It also tells the story of Zarina, whose fight to stay in school required her to resist her family's plan to marry her off at the age of 14. What's happening in Pakistan is also occurring in Afghanistan where, despite the removal of the Taliban from the control of the national government, local teachers and pupils are under pressure to stay away from school. Last year an investigation was carried out into allegations that Taliban extremists were poisoning school girls through infecting their school water. Still women run schools, sometimes going underground, claiming they are offering only sewing lessons. There are many reasons why 32 million girls are not at school today. For some there are no schools to go to and no teachers. Seven million are laboring in fields, mines, factories and in domestic service or they have been trafficked. Others still are child brides, forced out of school and into loveless marriages, often undergoing early pregnancies that put their lives at risk. But most of them are victims of unfair discrimination against girls, an assumption that girls do not need to be educated to play their part in the world. This week's tragic killing near the Afghan border -- just five months after the shooting of Malala and her friends on a bus -- also reminds us that the discrimination against girls that provoked Malala's shooting has not gone away, and that the struggle of families in Malala's own community in the Swat Valley is far from over. Injured with Malala were her friends Shazia Ramazan, who has had to relearn how to use her left arm and hand, and Kainat Riaz. I have spoken to them twice on the phone about their desire to continue their education and their ambition to become doctors. These sentiments were also expressed to the physician Seema Jilani in her New York Times piece. According to recent reports that have been sent to me, armed policemen have had to be deployed to the homes of Shazia and Kainat as well as other girls to shield them from harm. While Kainat says that things are better than four years ago, it is nonetheless the case that the girls still need police escorts to go to school. You can sign the petition supporting the girls and teachers who are demanding they go to school free of intimidation and violence at www.educationenvoy.org. On that site you can also see the details of our plans to meet Malala's ambition, for every girl should go to school.

"San Jose, California (CNN) -- A California jury Thursday acquitted a man charged with assaulting a retired Catholic priest, in a case that prosecutors had described as a vigilante attack. William Lynch, 44, was accused of confronting the Rev. Jerold Lindner, 68, during a visit at Sacred Heart Retirement home for Jesuit priests in Los Gatos, California, where Lindner had been living since retirement in 2001. Prosecutors claimed that Lynch walked into the retirement center on May 10, 2010, under the pretense of delivering news about a relative, and attacked his former pastor. Lynch and his younger brother had claimed more than a decade earlier that Lindner sexually molested them during church-led camping trips in northern California when they were 7 and 5 years old. Pennsylvania: Catholic cleric behind bars in landmark sex abuse case . During Lynch's assault trial, Lindner denied abusing the boys and maintained his innocence from the witness stand. But two days into Lindner's testimony, his attorney notified the court that his client was invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would not testify further for fear of a perjury prosecution. Lynch also took the witness stand and testified that he only had wanted the priest to sign a confession, and he said he had punched him after experiencing an irrational fear triggered by memories of the alleged abuse. Lynch's defense attorney, Pat Harris, claimed Lindner was responsible for his client's actions. ""Society is the victim in all this ... because there's a man sitting up there at Los Gatos who is a rapist, who molests children, and he's allowed to go free,"" Harris said. The statute of limitations on criminal molestation allegations had expired when Lynch and his brother went public with their allegations in 1997. But in a civil lawsuit that was settled in 1998, Lynch and his brother asserted that Lindner sodomized them and forced them to have sex with each other while Lindner watched. In that suit, Lynch and his brother received a $625,000 settlement with the Jesuits of the California Province. In the assault case against Lynch, he faced four counts stemming from the 2010 incident. The jury Thursday acquitted him on three counts and was unable to reach a decision on the fourth charge. The judge declared a mistrial on that count, and dismissed the charge. Connecticut priest charged with possession of child porn . Dozens of Lynch supporters, including his parents, gathered with demonstration signs outside the Santa Clara County Courthouse proclaiming the defendant's innocence. Before the trial, prosecutors offered Lynch a plea deal offer that would have required a year in jail. In closing arguments, prosecutors urged the jury to refrain from being swayed by Lynch's emotional testimony describing the alleged childhood trauma he claimed to have endured at the hands of Lindner. After the verdict, Jim Muyo, a spokesman for the California Province of the Society of Jesus, released a statement saying they respect ""the legal process and the findings of the judge and jury in the case of William Lynch.""

"(CNN) -- Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made a ""statement to his detriment"" during a prison visit by his sister, federal prosecutors said in a court document. The statement was made in the presence of an FBI agent, who was in the room during the visit under special restrictions, according to documents filed in federal court in Boston on Friday. Tsarnaev, in the presence of the agent, ""was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent."" The document did not say what the statement was. The suspect's alleged statement surfaced during the prosecution's opposition to a defense motion to do away with restrictions known as Special Administrative Measures, or ""SAMs,"" which include that prison visits be monitored. A defense motion to vacate the measures -- which was unsealed Friday -- describes the SAMs as ""unlawful and unwarranted."" The measures were imposed in August and restrict Tsarnaev's access to mail, media, the telephone, and visitors. The defense motion claims the SAMs ""impose extraordinary and severe restrictions impairing the ability of defense counsel to provide competent representation."" Tsarnaev, 20, is being held without bail on federal charges in connection with the April 15 bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others. He's also charged with the killing of an MIT police officer several days later. His trial is set for November 3. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner."" The government argued that the defense motion was not about the restrictions, but about the fact that Tsarnaev allegedly made a detrimental comment in front of an FBI agent, according to the court document. The defense motion ""has nothing to do with the SAMs and everything to do with the fact that Tsarnaev, despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the Federal Public Defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent,"" the court document states. The government said the FBI agent was in ""a legally obtained vantage point making his ability to see and hear all which occurred lawful."" Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon before allegedly killing a police officer three days later. The attacks triggered the massive manhunt. Police shot and killed the suspect's brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, during the manhunt. Calls to Tsarnaev's attorneys were not immediately returned Saturday.

"(CNN) -- The letter is signed ""cordially"" but students who received the instruction to stop handing out condoms on campus say they were taken aback by demands they feel could go as far as threatening their rights. Various dorm rooms at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, have a ""Safe Site"" symbol on their door. That signifies that inside are male and female condoms, personal lubricant and safer sex information, according to BC Students for Sexual Health. ""If you are in need of condoms, you may knock (on) one of these doors and just ask!"" the group's website says. Lizzie Jekanowski, chair of BCSSH, told CNN that the college has always been aware of the group's activities. ""We've had a positive and open relationship with the administration up to this point,"" she said. But earlier this month, college administrators sent letters to students whose dorm room doors have the logo saying that distributing condoms on campus ""is not in concert with the mission of Boston College as a Catholic and Jesuit university."" ""Should we receive any reports that you are, in fact, distributing condoms on campus, the matter would be referred to the student conduct office for disciplinary action by the University,"" concluded the letter sent by dean of students Paul J. Chebator and director of residence life George Arey. ""Private universities have the right to set their own policies and to discipline students who violate their policies. The distribution of condoms is incongruent with the university's values and traditions,"" Jack Dunn, spokesman for Boston College, told CNN on Wednesday. ""The university has commitments to uphold in regards to Catholic social teaching. Students are aware of that when they enroll here. This is a group of students who are trying to challenge those commitments in a very public manner,"" he said. The BCSSH group is not recognized by the university and gets its funding elsewhere. It claims to be the only resource on the Boston College campus that provides free sexual health programming, information and physical resources for students -- mostly from dorm rooms. Every three to four weeks, the organization also hands out condoms on public sidewalks, which is what the university so vehemently opposes. Dunn said the college administration reached out repeatedly but unsuccessfully about the matter but Jekanowski said the ""abrupt e-mail"" was the first warning. ""It's disappointing that they sent a very threatening letter to individuals that are stepping up and providing resources to students that Boston College is not,"" Jekanowski said. The group's next stop was to check in with the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, which said Boston College could be violating the rights of students by threatening disciplinary action against them. ""While Boston College is religiously affiliated it's not a church,"" Sarah Wunsch, an attorney at ACLU of Massachusetts told CNN. ""The religious freedom is that they can speak out; they can express their values and views and can try to persuade people of them, but not to the extent of punishing those who have a different view of contraception,"" she said. For now, Jekanowski is hoping to be able to sort things out with the college. But if a legal resolution was sought, one expert says Boston College has a strong case. ""I think it's one thing if it's off-campus. But on campus grounds, I suspect that the university is on firm legal footing there. It does have the right to set its own policies,"" Sunny Hostin, CNN legal contributor said. ""You can't force a private institution to allow that,"" she said. Boston College is a private university, founded in 1863, that is ""committed to maintaining, and strengthening the Jesuit, Catholic mission of the University,"" according to the school's website. A total of 14,600 students are enrolled.","Student group providing contraception says it offers a service Boston College does not .
But the college says they're challenging its Catholic and Jesuit traditions .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The ring awarded to Muhammad Ali when he became boxing's first three-time heavyweight champion has been returned to Ali's former wife six years after she loaned it to a friend who was dying of cancer, her lawyer said. ""It's been a long road,"" said Veronica Porsche, who was married to Ali for 10 years. That road ended Monday when a federal judge ruled against the friend's widow, who claimed it was a gift, not a loan, attorney Darren Enenstein said. Collector Keya Morgan, who is an Ali family friend, said the gold and diamond ring is the ""holy grail"" of boxing memorabilia. Ali got it after the September 1978 decision against Leon Spinks that made him a three-time champ, Morgan said. Porsche, who is a clinical psychologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, loaned it to Dr. William Young in summer 2004 after she learned he was suffering from cancer. Young had treated her husband, who had died from leukemia earlier that year, she said. ""He had always been so supportive of us."" ""It was a natural thing,"" she said, because Young was a fan of her former husband. Porsche thought the ring would give the doctor hope and inspiration in his battle with cancer, she said. When Young died in November 2004, he still had the ring, she said. ""I didn't want to ask his widow immediately, so I waited a month or so and then I couldn't find her,"" Porsche said. ""She had left town."" After six years of trying to find the ring, a private investigator located Phyllis Young in Phoenix, Arizona, and began a legal battle that ended this week, Enenstein said. When Porsche filed a lawsuit against the widow seeking the ring, Young counter-sued claiming it was given to her husband by Ali as a gift. ""The ring was my husband's to keep and an assurance of the personal bond between them, my husband and Muhammad Ali,"" Young said in her suit. While the doctor had treated the boxer once or twice, they were not close friends, Porsche said. Muhammad Ali signed a sworn statement to help his former wife's legal battle for the return of the ring, Enenstein said. It was handed over to Porsche in a Los Angeles courtroom on Monday after U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson threw out the widow's counterclaim, he said. The ring will eventually go to Laila Ali, the 32-year-old daughter of Porsche from her marriage with Ali, she said. The couple's other daughter, Hana, already has the ring the boxer was given when he became a two-time heavyweight champ.","Ali's former wife loaned the ring to a friend dying of cancer in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- ""Back in my day, we used to walk five miles uphill, carrying all our books in the blistering cold and the pouring rain..."" You know the line. It's been uttered by grandparents and parents time and time again. They can't help but recap how their experiences were so different from kids' today. And when it comes to walking to school, they couldn't be more right. Forty-five years ago, nearly 48% of students walked to school. Thanks in part to the proliferation of automobiles and school systems that feed larger regions, that number has dropped dramatically. Five years ago, barely 13% of students walked or biked to school, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. But October 8 is International Walk to School Day. It's a day dedicated to celebrating all the benefits of walking. This global event encourages students around the world to get out and get moving, combating childhood obesity by upping students' activity levels. By getting more children and parents out walking, organizers say, they're creating a sense of community, helping others learn safe places to walk and cutting down on fuel emissions and traffic congestion caused by long carpool lines and big, yellow school buses. In Somerville, New Jersey, there's a different school bus making the rounds and picking up students near Van Derveer Elementary School. It's called a walking school bus, and it has been rolling -- stepping, really -- for more than 10 years. ""It's just the coolest thing,"" said Susan Haynes, principal of Van Derveer Elementary School. At that time, Haynes was the newly minted principal with this dilemma on her desk: In New Jersey, bus service isn't required if students live within 2Â½ miles of school and all Van Derveer's students fall within that range. Budget cuts meant the district's free shuttle service would be eliminated. Cuts as extreme as those in Somerville aren't common, but the savings can be substantial, said Jim Crane, project manager for the National Center for Safe Routes to School. Inspired by international programs, district leaders in Somerville implemented the walking school bus, which is still running today. Participants say the walking school bus has built a greater sense of community. Parents, teachers and volunteers -- all on foot -- pick up students along a designated route on their way to school. Firefighters, police officers, even Sparky -- mascot of the Somerset Patriots baseball team -- participate on occasion. As they walk to school in sun, snow and rain, the bus continues to grow. Special days have been designed to draw extra attention to their everyday initiative. Walk to School Wednesdays and Foot-It Fridays are a direct result of student feedback and involvement. One-third of the student body participated in the school's most recent Walk to School on Wednesday. ""It's kind of like you're driving in a real school bus, but you just walk all the way to the school,"" fifth grader Makhia Robinson said. Sometimes, even, uphill. How do your kids get to school?

"(CNN) -- Some reviewers have called ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Steven Spielberg's World War II film about D-Day and the search for a soldier, one of the greatest war movies. Military historian Antony Beevor begs to differ. Not only is it not the greatest war movie, it's not even the best cinematic depiction of D-Day, says Beevor, author of the newly published ""D-Day: The Battle for Normandy"" (Viking). He admires the famed Omaha Beach opening -- ""Probably the most realistic battle sequence ever filmed,"" he said -- but described the rest of ""Saving Private Ryan"" as ""ghastly."" ""It's sort of a 'Dirty Dozen' cliche of the worst form,"" he said. He has expanded on the criticism in a lecture. ""Spielberg's basic story line had great potential. It shows the tension between patriotic and therefore collective loyalty, and the struggle of the individual for survival: those mutually contradictory pressures, which in many ways lie at the heart of war,"" Beevor observed in the talk. If any filmmakers wish to take on D-Day again, Beevor's book provides enough material for a dozen screenplays. Making use of first-person accounts stored in the National Archives, as well as a wealth of other material, Beevor depicts in painstaking detail not only the D-Day landings by American, British, Canadian and Free French forces, but also the subsequent battle for the whole of Normandy that proved pivotal in defeating Nazi Germany. Beevor says a director would do well to remember that the Allied effort to retake the continent extended well beyond that single day of June 6, 1944. ""D-Day, although an iconic moment, was not actually the end of it. Films like 'The Longest Day' and 'Saving Private Ryan' almost give the impression that D-Day was 'it' and then the next thing people know about was the liberation of Paris,"" he said. ""But in fact it was the fighting in Normandy which was far worse. Casualties on D-Day were far lighter than expected -- [military leaders] had expected 10,000 dead and only 3,000 died. ""The real fighting and the real casualties,"" he added, ""came in the Battle of Normandy."" So what does Beevor prefer in the way of a Hollywood treatment of D-Day? Another project Spielberg had a hand in, ""Band of Brothers."" ""On the whole I think [it] was pretty close to the truth,"" Beevor said of the 2001 HBO miniseries, which Spielberg and Tom Hanks executive produced. He called it ""incomparably more realistic"" than ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""The improvement was presumably due to the fact that it was a pretty faithful adaptation of the book by Stephen Ambrose,"" he said. A major problem with ""Ryan,"" Beevor said, is the climax of the film. ""The U.S. Air Force arrives in the nick of time just like the U.S. cavalry in 1950s cowboy films. And to cap it all, the final frames are of Pvt. Ryan, standing in old age amid the rows of white crosses in a military cemetery, saluting his fallen comrades as tears run down his cheeks."" That's Spielberg ""milking our tear ducts with both hands,"" Beevor said. But then again, the historian believes Hollywood is not well cast in the role of purveyor of history. ""The central problem is that historical truth and the needs of the movie and television industry remain fundamentally incompatible. Hollywood has to simplify World War II according to set formulae,"" Beevor said in his lecture. ""Its films have to have heroes and of course baddies. There are seldom shades of gray."" Among WWII films, Beevor praises two from 2006 directed by Clint Eastwood (and produced by Spielberg), ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"". ""But they are the exception which proves the rule that you do not need to resort to the tricks, the false claims of truth and even the clichés of the platoon movie,"" he said. And the best war movie? Beevor looks away from Hollywood for his answer: 1965's ""The 317th Platoon,"" a French film set during that country's war in Indochina.","Antony Beevor, author of new book on D-Day, not a fan of ""Saving Private Ryan""

The museum in question would have to be Amsterdam's Cheese Museum, a tiny two-floor celebration of Dutch cow creations just over the canal from the Anne Frank House.

The result is De Kattenkabinet -- several rooms of a well preserved 1880s canal house crammed with cat collectibles and feline-themed paintings and sketches from artists including Rembrandt and Picasso. Meijer continues to occupy the building's upper stories, as do four other felines, including Lily, a 19-year-old tortoiseshell cat who enjoys the attention of visitors.

It lies some distance out of the city center, but the Dutch Funeral Museum is worth the trip just to marvel at Amsterdam's absurdly well planned suburbs. The museum is housed in what's left of the former home of a cemetery director, close to the entrance of the graveyard he used to supervise. Despite its gloomy subject matter, the Funeral Museum is surprisingly un-macabre, with informative and matter-of-fact displays on different Dutch burial rituals and the paraphernalia of death. Just as well, really, otherwise no one would want to visit the rather pleasant and airy cafe at its entrance. Eccentric exhibit: Black, square noses, designed as the grieving equivalent to a clown's red nose. Dutch Funeral Museum, 124 Kruislaan; +31 20 694 0482 . Museum of Bags and Purses . Another collection crammed into a grand canal house that justifies the entrance fee almost as much as the items on display. This serious display of historic handbags and larger luggage starts off sedately with a selection of dainty, metallic numbers favored by royalty. It explodes into life with more contemporary baggage, some shaped like hats or stags. There are an eyebrow-raising ""Guardian Angel"" knife and gun bags designed by Vlieger & Vandam Bags.

Max Euwe Chess museum . Sure, there's nothing too extraordinary about a museum exploring the checkered history of one of the world's oldest games -- but this goes further, focusing on one single player. This diminutive facility on the first floor of a notorious former prison charts the life and times of Max Euwe, the Netherlands' only world chess champion. It's an affectionate tribute to Euwe, who died in 1981, and perhaps only one for chess aficionados -- but there's also a great chance to stick your nose into working offices based in the same building. There's a giant board outside the building where you can watch talented teenagers wipe the floor with professorial old chessmen straight out of central casting. Eccentric exhibit: A chess wall of fame featuring grandmasters such as Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Chess Museum, Max Euwe Plein 30A; +31 20 625 7017 . National Museum of Spectacles . A museum for people who enjoy trying on other people's glasses -- and let's face it, that's everyone. Housed in and above a genuine optician's shop virtually unchanged since customers first squinted through its windows in the 19th century, this shop charts 700 years of serving the shortsighted. Once you've viewed eyewear ranging from early owl-like nose-perchers to the chunkier frames sported by Buddy Holly and Elvis Costello, you can enter the shop and purchase your own pair. Eccentric exhibit: Masquerade masks with built-in lenses -- for those who want to recognize other people, but not be recognized. Spectacles Museum, 7 Gasthuismolensteeg; +31 20 421 2414 . Pipe Museum . In a city where there's an entire industry based around smoking certain substances, it stands to reason there's a museum dedicated to the pipe. This is no novelty head shop though -- it's a serious study of toking devices that hark back 2,500 years to the days when coughing up lumps of tar was considered healthy. Space in this lovely 17th-century canal house is given over to pipes designed for smoking stuff stronger than a bowlful of shag -- and these are out-smoked by elaborate European fumers designed for more pedestrian fare.

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN)  -- If it weren't for the Internet, Murong Xuecun might still be working as a sales manager at a car company in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu. That is what he was doing when he started writing his first novel on his office's online bulletin board system back in 2001. The Internet is increasingly being seen in China as a tool for literary empowerment, analysts say. Week by week when he got home from work, Murong would post new pieces to a story that painted a bleak yet honest picture of modern urban life in the city where he lived. It contained tales about sex, love, gambling and drugs and became so popular that it soon appeared on numerous other online forums. Today the 35-year-old is considered one of the most famous authors to have emerged in contemporary China. His debut work, ""Leave Me Alone: A novel of Chengdu,"" has been read by millions of Chinese ""netizens"" -- steady Internet users -- and adapted for film and television and translated into German, French and English. He also is viewed as a pioneer of what has become nothing short of a literary renaissance online in the country, particularly among young Chinese writers. This is a constituency that has struggled to find a platform for their work in a publishing industry that is viewed as conservative as it often faces state censorship. Instead of remaining silent, a new generation of authors has found its voice on the Web. ""It is a very big revolution,"" said Yang Hengjun, a political espionage novelist who published his first work online. ""When you write something on the Internet that you can't do in reality and you cause a change, that is revolutionary."" The past decade has seen the blossoming of countless literary Web sites and online forums hosting stories from thousands of aspiring authors. Their work is read by millions of Internet users, leading some to assert that in the future all writing, even reading, in China will take place in cyberspace. ""It's an inevitable trend due to the rapid development of the Internet and conceptual change of people,"" said Hou Xiaoqiang, head of Shanda Literature, a division of Shanghai-based Shanda Interactive Entertainment, the largest online entertainment provider in China. ""Ordinary people have started to realize the world ought to be dominated by them, rather than some media or elite,"" Hou added. ""Online authors are breaking the rules and using totally fresh concepts."" Shanda Literature operates three of China's biggest literary portals, including Qidian, one of the most popular. Collectively, the Web sites receive more than 200 million daily page views and have published nearly 30 billion Chinese characters, according to Shanda Literature's company data. Shanda generates revenues through online advertising and by charging readers small amounts to access popular stories or works from famous authors who have been contracted to write. However, the company is increasingly trying to earn money by licensing online novels to film studios, music producers, game developers and book publishers while protecting the intellectual property rights of its authors. Shanda owns the rights to more than 200,000 works and has already sold a number of licenses to other entertainment companies, including a popular ""Tomb Raider"" novel that is being adapted for film by Hong Kong director Johnnie To Kei-Fung. ""Literature is the starting point of all means of entertainment,"" Hou told CNN. ""It can provide numerous blueprints for games, music, movies and dramas. A lack of good stories is the main reason of the underdevelopment of entertainment [in China]."" Many of China's usually young and often female cyber-writers are posting their work online with the hope that, like Murong's novels, their stories will be read by millions, ultimately becoming books or movies and turning the authors into celebrities. The online Chinese literary scene is, in some ways, like a TV reality show. Bookstores now have sections devoted to Internet novels published as paperbacks, while a number of other influential writers have emerged from the Web over the years, including Annie Baobei, whose books about love and loneliness in Chinese cities have sold more than a million copies. ""In America, people have the American dream. In China, people have the online dream,"" said Dai Yingniao, a college junior who says almost all of her friends read online fantasy novels about time travel, romance or some mixture of the two. These genres are mostly read by ordinary girls who find life boring, said Dai, noting her roommate especially fancies a novel from the Qidian Web site called ""The Legend of Little Beauty."" ""I prefer real literature rather than imaginary works,"" added the 20-year-old. She then described a cyber-novel she is planning to write about a princess who lives during the Qing Dynasty. After leaving her home in Beijing, the princess returns to find she no longer recognizes her family or the society she had lived in a few years before. ""I just want to convey my opinions about today's life,"" Dai said. ""Sometimes euphemism is more powerful."" Today it is more accepted for Chinese publishers to take risks with voices emerging online, many now printing stories that simply would not have been possible a decade ago. Publishing houses often peruse Web sites for talent whose writing can be brought to readers who are not logged on. ""Publishers can come in and say there are readers for this, and this is the demographic and if we want to hit young adults, then this is a great voice,"" said Jo Lusby, the manager of Penguin China. ""[The literary Web sites] are now a very natural part of the publishing scene in China. It is really a convergence of print and online writing."" Yet despite what has been a gradual commercialization and subsequent opening up of the Chinese publishing industry during the past few years, many of the writers who are able to self-publish with freedom online find they still can face substantial censorship when their works are adapted for offline audiences. ""Offline publishing is still tightly controlled and not easy to change,"" said Yang Hengjun, whose spy novels are banned in the country. ""Any Internet novel is largely edited when it goes to publishing."" In the long run, however, Yang said he believes the freedom of literary expression on the Internet will spur even further liberalization in the Chinese publishing industry. ""It is a good thing and it is a promising thing,"" said Yang. ""Nowadays for more and more people if they want to express themselves, they can go online.""","China now has the most Internet users in the world .

"(CNN) -- The city of Cleveland, Ohio, demolished the house in which convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell hid the bodies of his victims, officials said Tuesday. A jury convicted him in July for kidnapping, abuse of corpses and the aggravated murder of 11 women around Cleveland from 2007 to 2009. In August, he was sentenced to death. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains in Sowell's home. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated Cleveland neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one initially realized it was the smell of decaying human flesh, instead assuming that it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. In a letter to the families of Sowell's victims, Blaine Griffin, executive director of the Cleveland Community Relations Board, said the demolition ""is an important step in helping our community heal and move forward."" ""In order to prevent actions that would be disrespectful to the memory of your loved one, your family and our community, the demolition will be performed in such a way that no piece of the property will remain,"" Griffin wrote in the letter. CNN's Maggie Schneider contributed to this report.","NEW: The city of Cleveland demolishes the house of Anthony Sowell .

"(CNN) -- A day of kayaking and backpacking on Hawaii's Big Island changed in an instant as the might of the Pacific Ocean swept six teenagers into the surf. One remains missing. The group of 12 students and their guides, who were on their way to a waterfall, were taking a break at a tide pool 15 feet above the swirling ocean and 50 feet inland when rogue waves hit. ""(T)he waves were totally unexpected,"" Abbott Wallis, founder and executive director of tour operator Bold Earth Teen Adventures, said Sunday. The surf sucked two of the teenagers into the sea Wednesday and left four others clinging for their lives along the cliff and rocky shoals. Kayak guides ""immediately dived into the water at risk to their own lives"" and rescued five of the teens, said Bari Sims of Hawaii Pack and Paddle. The sixth, 15-year-old Tyler Madoff of White Plains, New York, has not been found. Authorities suspended search operations for his rescue Thursday evening. The other student swept out to sea remains hospitalized after his rescue, but is expected to recover. One of the kayak guides resuscitated him at the scene. ""I can't convey my shock and sorrow,"" Wallis said. ""We're doing all we can to support the families and students. As a parent myself, I can only imagine what the families are feeling right now."" Tyler's father, Michael Madoff, strongly criticized Bold Earth, but said the family would not seek legal action against the tour operator. ""People of Bold Earth Expeditions have shown poor judgment and extremely poor character,"" Madoff said Sunday. ""None of the Bold Earth people stayed on site to continue the search for our son Tyler."" ""We're devastated by this,"" Wallis said in response. ""There's nothing Mr. Madoff can say that we disagree with."" A statement from the company says Bold Earth has served nearly 12,000 students on six continents since it was founded in 1976. Wallis said last week's accident was the first significant incident in the company's history. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","One kayaker has been missing since last week .

"(CNN) -- Ohio University student Taylor See and her friends expected some controversy to arise from a project to raise awareness of what it means to dress up as an ethnic stereotype for Halloween. But they weren't expecting the comparisons to robots or dogs. The campaign, ""We're a culture, not a costume,"" features students of different races holding pictures of costumes of racial or ethnic stereotypes: a geisha, a suicide bomber, a Native American, a ""Mexican on a donkey,"" a person with their skin painted black and a metal grill in their mouth. Brainchild of Students Teaching About Racism in Society, the campaign drew international media attention, generated intense online debate and perhaps most telling, it became the object of several Internet spoofs. The memes also come in various forms: a real golden retriever with a picture of a man in a dog costume, a na'vi from the film ""Avatar"" holding a picture of a man painted blue, a LOLcat, a dalek with a picture of a dalek, a unicorn with a unicorn, and so on. See, who designed the imagery, never expected it to get this big. Her first reaction? ""Wow. A conversation is happening, because that's all we wanted, to make people think."" Then came the realization that their original message was getting lost in the mockery, she said. ""These people that are putting out characters of vampires, dogs, robots, they don't have anything better to do with their time?"" she said. ""It's silly. We're talking about actual race, actual people that are actually affected. I guarantee you robots and dogs are not affected by what we're trying to say."" The most startling was an image of a monkey holding a picture of the black student featured in the original poster, she said. ""That was just awful. The fact that people think that's OK shows why this discussion is still important and relevant, unfortunately,"" she said. By their nature, these kinds of memes have a way of trivializing the original message, especially when it comes to ad campaigns or PSAs dealing with social issues, said Brad Kim, editor of knowyourmeme.com, a site that tracks viral stuff on the Web. This campaign in particular has a high ""exploitability"" quotient because it's about race and stereotypes, perennial hot topics on the Internet, where people can comment anonymously and therefore more freely than they would face-to-face, he said. The posters' design also sets up the objects for exploitation, practically beckoning people to deploy their Photoshop skills to play around with various themes, he said. Kim cited a derivative featuring grunge icon Kurt Cobain holding a picture of the lead singer of Nickelback. ""This would be a perfect example of a movement or campaign with a fixed set of messages that turned into a visual mad lib and turned into something bigger,"" he said. ""I don't think they're all necessarily arguing against the campaign or lashing out against it, but it does the subtle job of trivializing the subject's topic, which is the Internet's subtle way of saying, 'No, I beg to differ.' "" Most of the reaction the campaign received directly has been positive, said the group's president, Sarah Williams. Other schools in the United States have asked for permission to use the posters, along with a primary school teacher from South Korea. ""Our main purpose was to have a dialogue and discussion and make people think and we've definitely hit a nerve with people,"" she said. On the other end of the spectrum, they've also received hate mail, including an e-mail with the n-word. Some criticism takes the students to task for being too sensitive and taking themselves too seriously. Others questioned whether the same concept applied to white people, or costumes of leprechauns or rednecks. ""I find this article offensive and stereotypical. Just because I'm white doesn't mean that I take my Halloween costume as anything more than a costume. Get a life Ohio University,"" one CNN.com commenter said. ""Whew. I'm going to wear a XXXL suit and stuff it full of pillows, draw some fake beard on my face, add some extra chins, shuffle around dancing badly and go as Chaz Bono. But I'm white, so this is not offensive,"" said another. The idea to highlight the issue of racial and ethnic costumes resulted from the prevalence of students going in blackface last Halloween to dress like rappers and Tiger Woods, Williams said. An off-campus party last year also encouraged guests to come painted black and dressed ""ghetto."" ""We don't think we're being too sensitive. I think that's just the reaction from the majority culture,"" Williams said, ""It's hard to put yourself in that position of being a minority when you're not a part of the minority. Usually the majority culture can exploit and make fun of that."" Stereotypes have the power to hurt, especially when they embody false or archaic notions about someone, added See, who is black. Not all Mexicans travel on donkeys or wear sombreros, just like not all of them are illegal. And not all black people are rappers or young single mothers or behave like Tiger Woods. ""I fight every day to prove I'm not a stereotype,"" she said. ""I get good grades, I try to be articulate, but it's frustrating because costumes like that tell me that all of my efforts are fruitless because this is what people think of me at the end of day.""","""We're a culture, not a costume"" ad campaign goes viral, generates race debate .

"(CNN) -- A children's book about gun rights has benefited from an unexpected boost in sales after it became the subject of a mocking segment on ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" last week. ""My Parents Open Carry"" is the story of a typical Saturday for 13-year-old Brenna Strong, running errands with her parents while they carry handguns in plain sight, or ""open carry."" ""If you open carry and have a difficult time explaining why to your family and friends, or if you want to learn about the open carry of a handgun, or if you've wondered if open carry is right for you, then this book is what you need,"" is how the book's website sums up the plot. Published by White Feather Press, the book was made available in 2012 on limited release and picked up by Amazon in February of this year. Its appearance on ""Real Time"" on August 1 increased sales dramatically, with orders pouring in, according to White Feather Press founder Skip Coryell. ""Sales were weak for the first few years,"" Coryell said. ""But after it was trashed on the show, sales have gone up."" ""It happened overnight,"" he said. ""Took me by surprise as a publisher."" The book was featured on the ""New Rules"" portion of Maher's show, during which Maher commented on the book's cover illustration, asking ""if mom and dad are both safe because they're packing, why are they using their daughter as a human shield?"" Open carry has been a hot topic of conversation with several state legislatures debating its merits. Georgia recently passed legislation that allows gun owners to openly bear firearms in public places, such as bars, schools and churches. Georgia law allows guns in some schools, bars, churches . On Amazon, ""My Parents Open Carry"" has a total of 115 reviews. All but 11 of them are one-star or five-stars, and many of the reviews have been posted in days following the show. Most of the reviewers admit to not having read the book. Some say they have, though, such as ""Ken,"" who posted a five-star review on August 5: . ""I did purchase the book and found it to be very helpful to my daughter. She was able to easily relate to the characters and apply their situation to our family. I would recommend this book to anyone that carries a firearm with kids ages 5-10."" The authors, Brian Jeffs and Nathan Nephew, are founders of the nonprofit group Michigan Open Carry, Inc. When they started the group in 2009, Jeffs said that it wasn't widely known what open carry was, or that it was legal in the state. ""Our organization provided educational materials and seminars on the legality of open carry,"" Jeffs said. ""We answered many of the same questions over and over as well as debunked the myths surrounding the practice."" Jeffs decided that they should write a book answering the most common questions they got about open carry. ""Since so many books were for adults, I thought a nice change would be a kid's book."" As expected, the reactions to the book have been mixed, and Jeffs said he's gotten death threat e-mails from anti-gun critics. Opinion: Gun law packs dangers, police chief says . Despite the threats, the authors already have plans to write a sequel to the book, and Nephew is working on an outline. According to the book's website, the illustrator, Lorna Bergman, is also from Michigan, and enjoys deer hunting and shooting. ""While we strongly support providing children with information that will protect them from gun violence, this book crosses the line from information into the realm of indoctrination,"" a representative from Parents Against Gun Violence told CNN in an e-mail.

"(CNN) -- Children can't light up, but there are some who suffer the effects of nicotine exposure as they labor in U.S. tobacco fields. There is not an exact figure for how many children work in America's tobacco fields, but Human Rights Watch interviewed nearly 150 for a new report on the dangers these workers face. ""I would barely eat anything because I wouldn't get hungry,"" one child worker, Elena G., 13, told the human rights group. ""Sometimes I felt like I needed to throw up. ... I felt like I was going to faint. I would stop and just hold myself up with the tobacco plant."" Nearly 75% of the children interviewed reported similar symptoms -- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness, irritation and difficulty breathing. These are symptoms of acute nicotine poisoning, Human Rights Watch said. And nicotine is not the only danger. Exposure to pesticides from adjacent fields and accidents with sharp tools are also common, the report said. ""Once they sprayed where we were working. We were cutting the flower and the spray was right next to us in the part of the fields we had just finished working in. I couldn't breathe,"" Jocelyn R., 17, told HRW. ""I started sneezing a lot. The chemicals would come over to us."" Altria, one of the biggest cigarette makers, does not employ its own farmers but maintains strict standards on the contractors it buys tobacco from, company spokesman Jeff Caldwell said. His company's view is not that the HRW report is critical of the tobacco industry, but that it asks for cooperation with various interests to protect the safety of workers, especially minors, he said. ""Our tobacco companies do not condone the unlawful employment or exploitation of farm workers, especially those under the age of 18,"" Caldwell said. Altria requires that its growers follow certain guidelines that specifically include best practices for labor management when it comes to harvesting tobacco. Issues such as avoiding acute nicotine poisoning and heat stress are addressed in the guidelines, he said. U.S. tobacco companies intend to work together to further discuss the topics in the report, he said. The study focused on four tobacco-growing states: North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. Children can legally work in the tobacco fields, and some as young as 11 and 12 years old do. These children primarily work during the summer to help support their families. The majority of them were Hispanic children of immigrants who lived in nearby towns, the report said. ""As the school year ends, children are heading into the tobacco fields, where they can't avoid being exposed to dangerous nicotine, without smoking a single cigarette,"" Margaret Wurth, a co-author of the report, said in a news release. ""It's no surprise the children exposed to poisons in the tobacco fields are getting sick."" Many of the children the group spoke with reported working long hours without overtime pay or enough breaks, HRW said. One of the recommendations of the report is that no one under 18 be allowed to work in tobacco fields, due to the risks that such exposure can bring.
