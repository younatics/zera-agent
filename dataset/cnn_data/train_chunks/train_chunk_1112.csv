"Police in Georgia on Friday served a warrant for a probation violation at the trailer park home of a man and his son, a 17-year-old aspiring Marine. In the process of serving the warrant on the boy's father, an officer fatally shot the teen. His crime: according to his attorney, he did nothing more than answer the door while holding a controller of a Nintendo Wii. Police in Euharlee, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Atlanta - however, claim that Christopher Roupe pointed a gun at the female officer when he opened the door, which prompted her to fire a live round at the aspiring military man. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Christopher Roupe, 17, planned to join the Marine Corps. after he finished high school . Mistake: Police claim Roupe was holding a gun. Witnesses, however, say he was holding a Nintendo Wii controller . No witnesses reported seeing the boy holding any weapons, and authorities won't say whether a weapon was found at the scene. 'It just doesn't add up,' Cole Law, who is representing the Roupe family, told wsbtv.com. As for the claim that Roupe was holding a gun, Law says he's seen no evidence supporting the officer's claim. 'We don't know where that statement came from. The eyewitnesses on the . scene clearly state that he had a Wii controller in his hand. He heard a . knock at the door. He asked who it was, there was no response so he . opened the door and upon opening the door he was immediately shot in the . chest,' Law said. Scene: Officers were serving a warrant on Roupe's father for a probation violation when they shot the boy . Roupe was a student at Woodland High School and was an active member of the school's ROTC program. Friends say he was a nice young man who always looked out for his friends. 'He was a good kid. He always hung out with me and he took up for me,' friend William Corson told the station. After hearing the shots, neighbors in the small trailer park rushed to Roupe's home to see what happened. 'When we got up there, they said there was a Wii remote in his hand and . she shot him,' said Tia Howard, who lives a few doors down. Another neighbor says he saw the officer who pulled the trigger after the shooting. Witnesses: Roupe family attorney Cole Law says he's seen no evidence to suggest the boy was holding a weapon . 'This is tragic. She came out of this house. She put her head in her hands and she was sobbing. Supposedly, he opened the door with a BB gun and in my opinion I think he was playing a game with his neighborhood buddies,' said neighbor Ken Yates. The officer who fired the fatal shot has been placed on administrative leave as the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident. Once the investigation is complete, the GBI will turn its findings over to Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Rosemary Greene's office. Roupe's funeral is planned for Friday.","Police went to the 17-year-old's home to serve a warrant on his father over a probation violation .

"Cruel: Lynda Williams has testified how she was 'creeped out' after snipping a baby's spine . A woman who worked at a Philadelphia . abortion clinic has testified how she was told snipping babies' spines after they were born was 'standard procedure' to bring about 'fetal demise'. Lynda Williams, 44, said  her former boss Dr. Kermit Gosnell taught her how to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps'. As she testified in the murder trial against Gosnell, she added that patients were often given pain medication that did not work during procedures, and that he would slap their legs if they squirmed. Gosnell, . 72, is charged with murdering seven babies at Philadelphia Women's . Medical Society and with the death of a woman, who suffered cardiac . arrest after she was given too much anesthesia. He performed illegal, late-term . abortions and when the babies were born alive, he would sever their . spinal cords to kill them, prosecutors have claimed over the four-week . trial. Williams herself has pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree murder to escape a possible death penalty or life sentence. She admitted to cutting the spine of one baby and . administering the anesthesia in November, 2009 when patient . Karnamaya Mongar went into cardiac arrest. On trial: Kermit Gosnell, pictured, is accused of killing the babies at the Philadelphia Women’s Medical Society clinic and a 41-year-old woman who was administered too much anesthesia and suffered cardiac arrest . On Tuesday, she testified that she . Gosnell taught her to snip the babies' necks, a practice she carried out . once when he was away from the clinic. She . said she took a baby that had been delivered in a toilet in the second . trimester - between 12 and 24 weeks of pregnancy - and saw its arm move before she snipped its spine, The Delaware News Journal reported. 'I only do what I’m told to do,' she told the jury. 'What I was told to do was snip their neck.' When . Gosnell returned, she told him about how the newborn moved and he said . it was simply an 'involuntary response', insisting the baby was already . dead because of drugs the mother had taken. She . said it was the only time she snipped a spine because it gave her 'the . creeps' and she insisted she did not know it was murder. 'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009 . Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there . She added it was one of her duties to pick up babies that women would spontaneously give birth to in the waiting room after getting large doses of drugs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Like many of Gosnell's employees, Williams was desperate for work when he gave her a job. She had a poor education and had not even finished eighth grade, although went on to work as an instrument sterilizer. During this job, she met Gosnell who performed abortions at the clinic. But . her life began spiralling out of control when her husband was murdered . in 2008 and she was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She asked . Gosnell if he had any work for her. He hired her to sterilize instrument and soon asked her to carry out ultrasounds, administering intravenous medication and anesthesia to patients. 'House of horrors': Another former employee claimed he saw 100 live babies killed at the clinic, pictured . Unfathomable: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . She . told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients . that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit. She . added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - . and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, . leaving his hand print behind. Her testimony comes a day after another worker, Sherry West, told the court how she was once handed an underdeveloped newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it. Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped'. Some told the court of gruesome . scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with . rusting surgical instruments. Discovery: Investigators found these bags allegedly filled with body parts at the clinic in Philadelphia . Rundown: An internal shot of the clinic, which was allegedly reeking of animal urine and feces . A Grand Jury report said the clinic was . crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and . blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly . sterilized. Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed . into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and . plastic jugs'. 'It . would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is . literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC. But he said he believed the . intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the . women, often extremely poor, who came to him . The doctor: Kermit Gosnell . Charged: Pearl Gosnell . Employee: Elizabeth Hampton . Arrested: Tina Baldwin . Assistant: Sherry West . Worker: Adrine Moton . Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil . Locked up: Stephen Massof . Held: Maddline Joe . 'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said. The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any . babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the . aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.","Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, is on trial for 'murdering seven babies and a woman, 41' at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia .

"British spies employed 'dirty tricks' including 'honey traps' to trap nations, hackers, terror groups, suspected criminals and arms dealers, according to leaked documents. The bombshell revelations have been made public through the release of documents taken from the National Security Agency by whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The Powerpoint slides outline techniques apparently used by the Joint . Threat Research and Intelligence Group (JTRIG), a British spy unit whose . goal is to 'destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt' enemies. British spies employed 'dirty tricks' including honey traps' in a bid to trap nations, hackers, terror groups, suspected criminals and arms dealers . The slides from 2010 and 2012, published by NBC News show that . the JTRIG completed their mission by 'discrediting' adversaries through . misinformation and hacking their communications. Two main methods of attack detailed in the 'Effects' campaigns are cyber operations and propaganda campaigns. The bombshell revelations have been made public through the release of documents taken from the National Security Agency by whistleblower Edward Snowden . JTRIG, which is part of the NSA’s British counterpart, the cyber spy agency known as GCHQ, used Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube for deception, mass messaging and 'pushing stories'. Another strategy is 'false flag' operations - this is when British agents carry out online actions that are . designed to look like they were performed by one of Britain’s . adversaries. The main cyber attack is the ‘distributed denial of service’ (DDoS) attack. This . is when computers are taken over by hackers and they bombard a website’s . host computers with requests for information causing it to crash - . this is a method successfully used by Wikileaks hackers. Earlier . this week it was revealed that JTRIG agents issued their DDoS on . Anonymous chat rooms, preventing its users from communicating with one . another. In one case, reported the BBC, . agents are said to have tricked a hacker nicknamed P0ke who claimed to . have stolen data from the US government. They did this by sending him a . link to a BBC article entitled: 'Who loves the hacktivists?' Eric . King, an attorney who currently teaches IT law at the London School of . Economics, told NBC it is 'remarkable' that the GCHQ has become so adept . at launching DDoS attacks without 'clear lawful authority,'  particularly because the British government has criticised similar strategies used by other . governments. 'GCHQ has no clear authority to send a . virus or conduct cyber-attacks,' he said. 'Hacking is one of the most . invasive methods of surveillance.' According . to notes on the 2012 documents, a computer virus called Ambassadors . Reception was 'used in a variety of different areas' and was 'very . effective.' When sent to adversaries, says the presentation, the virus will 'encrypt itself, delete all emails, encrypt all files, make [the] screen shake' and block the computer user from logging on. One of the ways to block a target communicating reads: 'Bombard their phone with text messages, bombard their phone with calls, delete their online presence, block up their fax machine.' The slide details examples of how this was used in Afghanistan including significantly disrupting the Taliban, sending targets a text message 'every 10 seconds or so' and 'calling targets on a regular basis'. The British cyber spies also used blog posts and information spread via blogs in an operation against Iran. One of the ways to stop a target communicating reads: 'Bombard their phone with text messages, bombard their phone with calls, delete their online presence, block up their fax machine' The same 2012 presentation describes the 'honey trap' method of discrediting a target commenting it is 'very successful' when it works. The individual is lured 'to go somewhere on the internet, or a physical location' where they are then 'met by a friendly face.' It does not give any examples of when the honey trap has been used by British agents, but the same slide also details how 'paranoia' can be heightened by changing a target's photo on a social networking website - the slide reads 'You have been warned JTRIG is about!' A programme called 'Royal Concierge' took advantage of hotel reservation systems to track the  location of foreign diplomats and the slides encourage agents to monitor targets through 'close access technical operations'. It also suggests they question 'Can we influence hotel choice? Can we cancel their visits?' According to reports in Der Spiegel last year, British intelligence tapped the reservations systems of over 350 top hotels around the world for the past three years to set up the programme. Using the GCHQ’s SIGINT (signal-intelligence) program it was used to spy on trade delegations, foreign diplomats, and other targets with a taste for the high life. NBC news reported GCHQ would not comment on the newly published documents or on JTRIG’s operations. In a statement it told them: 'All of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework,' said the statement, 'which ensure[s] that our activities are authorized, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the Secretary of State, the Interception and Intelligence Services Commissioners and the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee. All of our operational processes rigorously support this position.'","Revelations from documents taken from NSA leaked by Edward Snowden .

"US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has proposed reducing the US Army to its smallest size since before World War Two. Under the Hagel plan, which Congress could . change, the active-duty Army would shrink from its current 522,000 . soldiers to between 440,000 and 450,000. That would make it the smallest . since just before the U.S. entered World War II in 1940. The proposal is based around both spending concerns -- as well as President Obama's promises to end two different long-term military campaigns. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel speaks at a news conference at the Pentagon in this October file photo . News of the drone's ability comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two . Army leaders have been . saying for months that they expect their size would shrink as the . nation prepares to end its combat role in Afghanistan this year. Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said recently that whatever the . future size of the Army, it must adapt to conditions that are different . from what many soldiers have become accustomed to during more than a . decade of war. He said many have the misperception that the Army is no . longer busy. ""People tend to think that the . Army is out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and there is not much going on,"" he . said Jan. 23 at an Army forum. ""The Army is not standing still. The . Army is doing many, many, many things in order for us to shape the . future environment and prevent conflict around the world."" Hagel is expected to propose the elimination of Air Force A-10 attack aircraft, like the one seen in this file photo . The budget, however, is expected to have money for the F-35 warplane, like the one seen in this file photo . The . last time the active-duty Army was below 500,000 was in 2005, when it . stood at 492,000. Its post-World War II low was 480,000 in 2001, . according to historical tables provided by the Army on Monday. In 1940 . the Army had 267,000 active-duty members, and it surged to 1.46 million . the following year as the U.S. approached entry into World War II. Navy . Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday that . Hagel consulted closely with the military service chiefs on how to . balance defense and budget-saving requirements. ""He . has worked hard with the services to ensure that we continue to stand . for the defense of our national interests - that whatever budget . priorities we establish, we do so in keeping with our defense strategy . and with a strong commitment to the men and women in uniform and to . their families, Kirby said. ""But he has also . said that we have to face the realities of our time. We must be . pragmatic. We can't escape tough choices. He and the chiefs are willing . to make those choices,"" Kirby said.","Proposed change may include scheduled drop of troops from 570,000 post-9/11 to between 440,000 and 450,000 .

Budget cuts could mean higher casualties and a longer time for success if the US army had to handle two military campaigns at the same time again .
Also expected are reduced housing allowances, increased health-care premiums, and limited pay raises ."
"Warning: Justice Hedley said the couples' conflict had affected the children . A High Court judge issued a stark warning yesterday about the traumatic effects on children when complicated homosexual parenting arrangements unravel. In a case in which a gay man and his lover took the lesbian mother of his children and her partner to court for access rights, the judge expressed frustration at the ‘lack of sufficient vocabulary to explain the true nature of the relationships’. But Mr Justice Hedley was clear about the impact of the couples’ conflict on the two sisters in the case, saying at least one of them had suffered significant emotional harm. ‘The four adults in this case regard the price paid by these two children as an acceptable price for the pursuit of their own adult disputes,’ he said. The identity of the girls, aged six and ten, and their four parents was kept secret in the Family Division judgment published yesterday. The judge said the adults involved were ‘intelligent professional people’ who agreed to have children through IVF ‘with the agreement and co-operation of all parties’. But he warned: ‘The case provides a vivid illustration of just how wrong these arrangements can go.’ The adults involved are the mother of the two children and her lesbian civil partner, now aged 45 and 44, and the biological father of the girls and his long-standing gay partner, aged 50 and 41. The couples met after the women placed an advert in The Pink Paper in July 1999 looking for ‘a gay man or couple who would like to start a family with a lesbian couple’. The men replied, saying ‘we would love to be father and stepfather’. Gay parenting: The case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements . Ruling: The tug-of-love case was heard at the High Court (pictured) After the birth of the first child, the couples maintained friendly relations for several years, but ‘it all went wrong’ in 2008 when they fell into dispute over the children. The judgment quotes a social worker who said the older daughter was caught in ‘a horrendous tangle of emotion and conflict that exists between these adults. The girl is being made to carry the responsibility for the failure of the adults in this system to overcome the conflicts between them.’ Mr Justice Hedley said there was ‘widespread concern at the welfare of the children’. 'Case provides a real warning' He ruled that the two women should be regarded as ‘primary parents’ with the main responsibility for bringing up the girls, but the men should be regarded as ‘secondary parents’. The gay couple should be consulted on issues of health, medical operations, education and moves of house. The judge also made a contact order so they could see the girls at set times. Mr Justice Hedley said: ‘It is all too easy in these cases for biological fathers to see themselves in the same position as in separated parent cases in heterosexual arrangements, whereas this arrangement is, and was always intended to be, quite different. ‘I have tried hard to see whether there are any other concepts than that of mother, father and primary carer, all conventional family concepts. ‘The best that I have achieved . . . is to contemplate the concept of principal and secondary parenting.’ He said gay and lesbian couples should decide in advance who will bring up the children if they choose to have babies. Linzi Bull of the law firm Harbottle & Lewis, which represented the men, said: ‘The case provides a very real warning to couples entering into artificial insemination arrangements.’","Gay man and his lover took lesbian mother and her partner to court over access .

"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper hid in a cupboard for 15 minutes when a masked gunman stormed Parliament in a terrifying attack that left the nation's capital on lockdown. MPs sharpened flagpoles to use as spears and barricaded the doors while Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged dozens of shots with guards inside Canada's Parliament building. He fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial in Ottowa on Wednesday morning. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Stephen Harper was hidden in a cupboard for 15 minutes when a masked gunman stormed the Canadian Parliament building . Zehaf-Bibeau then ran inside the Parliament, where he opened fire before he was shot dead by the House of Commons Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers. Politicians have now returned to the city's Parliament Hill complex, where Mr Harper said the Canadian government would 'be vigilant' to threats but 'not run scared'. 'We will always stand together,' Mr Harper said, vowing to push on with tougher security laws. 'They need to be much strengthened, and I assure you, Mr Speaker, that work which is already underway will be expedited.' Harper was in parliament when the attack began, addressing members of his party on the increased terror threat to Canada. In a televised address to the nation, he said: 'We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.' MPs applaud Kevin Vickers, Sergeant-at-Arms, who shot the gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday . Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the memorial . 'This week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,' 'We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and our institutions of governance are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.' One source told the Globe and Mail that MPs had flanked the doors of their meeting room, preparing to attack the gunman with sharpened flagpoles. 'These guys were up there holding these spears ready to impale anyone who came in,' the source said. A man identified by Royal Canadian Mounted Police as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is seen October 22 as he exits a car and runs toward the parliament buildings .

Ottawa police said there were shootings at the War Memorial and at the Canadian Parliament . Mr Harper was placed in a cupboard - described as little more than a 'cubbyhole' in the Centre Block after the gunfire rang out, the report said. The Globe and Mail's source said many MPs had no idea the prime minister was still in the building. Foreign Minister John Baird said there were no substantiated claims yet that Zehaf-Bibeau was associated with Islamic State. He said he was 'tremendously concerned about the number of Canadians who are radicalised and are fighting in Syria or Iraq, but we don't have any evidence to link the two at this stage'. 'Reports suggest that well in excess of 100 Canadians have gone to fight jihad in the Middle East and that's a huge concern.' Mr Baird also said Zehaf-Bibeau could have done much more damage than he did. 'For several minutes it was complete horror, complete terror, we didn't know whether the door was going to be kicked in, whether there was one or a group of people.'

"Tough: Top state schools are having to choose between up to 18 pupils for each place (picture posed by model) Recession-hit parents are scrambling for a 'Rolls-Royce' state education for their children -  meaning up to 18 pupils are now fighting for one place at the most popular schools, it has been revealed today. Top grammar schools, faith schools and academies are being flooded with applications as many mothers and fathers are struggling to afford private school fees. The most-sought after institutions must choose up to 200 pupils out of more than 1,000 applications a year and are developing more complex admission rules to prevent parents 'playing the system'. England's most over-subscribed state school is the Muslim secondary Al-Hijrah in Birmingham, where 18 students compete for every of its 60 places. It is followed by Herschel Grammar in Slough, which has 14 applicants per place, while across the Berkshire town sits Langley Grammar, which must deal with 13 per place. Experts say these high numbers are driven by people being priced out of private school so targeting stop state institutions instead. 'There are some brilliant supercomps out there, often led by superheads and getting super results,' Janette Wallis, senior editor of the Good Schools Guide told the Daily Telegraph. 'In most cases, however, these highest achieving comprehensives have some element of selection, whether it be geography, church attendance or a percentage admitted on the basis of aptitude.' Currently parents applying for schools for their children can approach between three and six, which all headteachers must treat equally regardless of whether their school is the first choice. Expensive: Experts say years of recession means that fewer parents can afford private fees so target top state schools instead .

However, there are rules preventing parents 'buying' their way into schools by purchasing homes in the catchment areas. Instead many schools hold a lottery, where pupils are chosen by ballot or tests are held and a mix of lower, average and higher ability children are chosen proportionately. A quarter of schools use at least one of these systems. The Government says they are creating more school places. 'We are creating thousands more school places and raising standards throughout the country so that every child has the chance to go to a good local school,' a Department for Education spokesperson said. 'We have made £2.7 billion available since 2011 for those local authorities that face the greatest pressure on places and this month we announced an extra £1 billion to build new free schools and academies and expand existing good schools.'","Top faith and grammar schools dealing with more than 1,000 applications a year, new figures show .

"The owner of an Oklahoma restaurant has been accused of racism and bigotry for refusing to serve customers who are gay, from ethnic minorities, with disabilities, or without jobs. Gary James didn't do much to dispel the allegation when he gave an interview to a local news station from his restaurant in Enid, called Gary's Chicaros. 'I’ve been in business 44 years, I think I can spot a freak or a f*****,' he told KFOR. Outdated: Gary James ideas about who can and cannot dine in his establishment have been met with disgust following an interview he did on local TV . Former customer: Matt Gard says James would not allow him into Gary's Chicaros because he's in a wheelchair . Local man and former longtime customer Matt Gard says James has banned him from his restaurant because of his wheelchair. James denies that the problem is Gard's disability.  'He created an issue. You only have one time here. You create an issue, you're out forever,' he told KFOR. Gard claims that’s just 'a weak excuse,' and that James’ was denied entry because he is disabled and uses a wheelchair. Gard, it must be noted, turned a blind eye to James' apparent discriminatory practices when he was basking in the restaurant owner's approval, but now says James' intolerance is unacceptable. 'He doesn’t like certain people of race, color, ethnicity,' Gard said of James. Surrounds: An outside view of Gary's Chicaros, the interior of which is decorated with Confederate flags and other U.S. paraphernalia . James interview with KFOR's reporter, who is of Asian descent, seemed to confirm Gard's allegations. When asked if he would refer to her using the racial slur 'chink,' James replied that he wouldn't. Well, not unless 'we were drinking and joking around or something,' he said. 'If I reached over there and slapped the s*** out of you, you should be offended. But to call someone a ""chink"" or someone call me a bigot, that doesn’t bother me, why should it bother you?' James proudly wears his restaurant's t-shirt, which spells out the small-town business-owner's creed. The restaurant’s official t-shirt . makes it clear that a 'faggot' isn’t welcome in James’s establishment. It also calls the place a n*****-free-zone, and threatens violence . against Muslims, Democrats, and members of many minority groups. 'I really don’t want gays around. Any man that would compromise his own body would compromise anything,' James told KFOR. Hate on a plate: Gary James wearing his offensive t-shirt that is emblazoned with discriminatory words against black people, Muslims, democrats, women and gays . After his latest press coverage, not even 'great whites' seem keen on patronizing Gary's Chicaros . He is also not willing to serve anyone on welfare, a circumstance many believe he himself may now end up in after his comments. A Facebook page that sprung up in the wake of his interview designates Gary's Chicaros as a gay bar. It's been given 1.5 stars out of five by 885 reviewers, many of whom note instances of discrimination. The restaurant's Yelp page is equally complimentary.

"Abortions outnumber live births among African American women living in New York City, according to a new health report. Newly released Department of Health and Mental Hygiene figures show black women had 31,328 'crude induced terminations' in 2012, compared with 24,758 'live births'. The terminations comprised more than 42 percent of the Big Apple's total number. Birth rate: The report found that the 2012 citywide crude birth rate was 14.8 births per 1,000 population, the lowest rate since 1979 when . the rate was also 14.8 . Changes: New York's abortion rate has fallen below 40 percent for the first time in at least a decade, according to the report . The second highest number of abortions were for Hispanic at 22,917, with this group's live births reaching 36,642. Both groups outnumbered abortions for whites and Asian and Pacific Islanders, which had 9,704 and 4,493 terminations respectively. Women aged 20-29 had the most abortions among all ethnicities, with more women in Brooklyn choosing to terminate rather than have a child. The . abortion ratio citywide fell to just over 37 per cent in 2012 - a record low . since 1970 when abortion was legalized in New York. Anti-abortion and religious groups have hit out at the figures, describing abortion as a 'problem' which the city is failing to adequately address. Statistics: Abortions outnumbered live births among New York City's black community in 2012, according to a new report by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (stock picture) In the interests of the fetus: Religious groups are unsurprisingly outraged at the report's abortion figures, believing that women don't have the right to make decisions about their own bodies .","NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has released pregnancy statistics for 2012 .

"The U.S. Department of Education has released the findings of a 10-year study that reveal almost one in four - 22.6 per cent - of 26-year-olds are still living with their parents. The First Look report followed 13,000 high school sophomores in 2002 through to 2012, when they were all about 26 years old. The statistics give an insight into the lives and living arrangements of millennials, who entered adulthood during the recession. Still at home: The study shows that almost a quarter of 26-year-olds are still living with their parents . The study found that 19 per cent of respondents were living alone, while 42 per cent were living with a spouse or partner. Just 10 per cent were living with roommates as opposed to the almost 23 per cent who were living with their parents. The remaining six per cent had some other living arrangement. According to Pew Research analysis of the 2012 data, rising unemployment . and college enrollment are bases for the trend, as well as a decrease in young people getting married. The work and study situations of the 2002 high schoolers were telling. Overall, those with more school were less likely to still be living at home. Recession: Rising unemployment during the recession is cited as one reason for the increase in young adults residing at home . According to the data, 19 per cent of the group reported they were both working for pay and taking post-secondary courses, while 13 per cent said they were neither working for pay nor studying. Sixty-three per cent were working for pay only, and five per cent were taking post-secondary courses only. By 2012, 33 per cent of those surveyed had earned a bachelors degree or higher. College education: According tothe report, university graduates are less likely to still live at home and less likely to experience unemployment . A full 40 per cent of those who had only a high school diploma and 45 per cent of those who had not finished high school reported having lost a job since January 2006 as opposed to 19 per cent of those with a bachelor's degree or higher had lost a job. Money was a real source of worry for the respondents, 53.8 per cent of whom had made less than $25,000 from employment in 2011. According to a Pew Research Center study released in 2013, 36 per cent of young adults aged 18 - 31 are now living with their parents, which is the highest percentage in four decades.","The U.S. Department of Education released the findings of a 10-year-study that followed sophomore from 2002 until 2012, when they were 26 .

"The technique, which the NHS could soon start using to treat mental health problems, involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands . Experts are calling on the NHS to start using a new self-help technique, called tapping, after its effectiveness in treating a number of conditions was proved. The technique, which involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands, is showing promise as an effective form of therapy for anxiety, depression and anger. It is also known as the emotional freedom technique (EFT). Researchers at Staffordshire University are leading research into the effectiveness of EFT in the UK. Professor Tony Stewart, who led a trial of the treatment in the Birmingham area, said: ‘EFT is a new and emerging therapy that can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions. ‘Patients gently tap with their fingertips on acupressure points, mainly on the head and hands, and relate this to the voicing of specific statements. ‘A growing number of studies suggest EFT is an effective and safe treatment, and with the predicted sharp increase in the demand for mental health services – and a corresponding decrease in NHS resources - we feel that the use of EFT should now be extended.’ The researchers studied 39 patients during the trial and say that most improved significantly as a result of the treatment. Dr Ian Walton, GP and mental health lead for Sandwell and West Birmingham Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘The effective use of EFT demonstrated in this study has not only influenced counsellors and therapists in Sandwell to be trained to use this method of treatment, but also local mental health charities are seeing the value in being trained to use EFT in the work that they do.’ Mark Willets, 39, was first referred to Professor Stewart with depression in 2012 after it started to impact on his family life. He said: ‘I would describe the impact of these sessions like emotional first aid, it would allow me to refocus when I found myself hitting a bad patch and it brought me back into rational thinking. ‘I would say it created a cognitive shift and allowed me to gain a better perspective on the things I had achieved and really helped me to see more clearly and become calm and rational.’ The researchers say that one of the key . benefits of EFT is that, once learnt, it can be easily self-administered . meaning patients can use it on themselves for any issue, whenever it is . required. Dutch pole vaulter Rens Blom believes tapping was responsible for his surprise victory in the 2005 World Athletics Championships . Tapping or the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a new alternative therapy. It is a form of acupressure, based on the same energy points used in traditional acupuncture to treat physical and emotional ailments. Instead of using needles, tapping with the fingertips is used to input kinetic energy onto specific meridians on the head and chest while a person thinks about their specific problem and voices positive affirmations. This combination of tapping and voicing is supposed to clear the 'emotional block' from a person's 'bioenergy system' and restores balance in the body. A further study using Staffordshire University students has provided evidence that EFT could also boost performance in pressurised conditions. Some 100 students were approached randomly to either receive an inspirational lecture or an EFT session ahead of giving a marked presentation. The 50 students who received the EFT remained calmer and achieved higher results. On average, it has been determined that just over five sessions are required to treat clients. This compares well with other therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), where between six and 20 sessions may be required, depending on the condition and severity. Dr Liz Boath, Associate Professor in the School of Social Work, Allied and Public Health at Staffordshire University, said: ‘Both clinical and statistical significance have been demonstrated through our studies, the findings of which have been presented at three NHS conferences. ‘Our view is that all new therapies and treatments start with little or no evidence, and further good quality studies into EFT would confirm its effectiveness, safety and potential within the NHS. ‘It may be a bridge too far for now, but we also feel that EFT could be delivered within communities to provide fast access to mental health services.’ The research was published in the Journal of Psychological Therapies in Primary Care.","The treatment involves tapping acupressure points on the head and hands .

"A white TV reporter who was suspended for claiming that an 'anti-cop mentality' is caused by fatherlessness among young black men appeared on Fox News Wednesday for the first time since his ouster, telling Megyn Kelly that he knew what he was doing when he made his remarks. Sean Bergin was reprimanded by News 12 New Jersey because he voiced an opinion rather than remained objective after an interview with the widow of a black man who shot dead a rookie Jersey City police officer. The widow, Angelique Campbell, told Bergin that Lawrence Campbell should have killed more officers, but she later apologized for her statement. Scroll down for videos . First interview: Ousted News 12 reporter Sean Bergin went on The Kelly File Wednesday to discuss his dismissal over his controversial comments . Accepting responsibility: Bergin, 49, told Fox News host Megyn Kelly he knew he would be reprimanded for expressing an opinion on air . During his appearance on The Kelly File Wednesday, Bergin shed some light on what preceded . the incendiary interview with Angelique Campbell, saying that before . News 12 New Jersey aired the segment, the station had been 'besieged' by . phone calls from local police officers asking them not to run it. According to the veteran reporter, he went to his producer and suggested to shelve the interview with the widow, but since it was a News 12 New Jersey exclusive the station made the decision to air it. After the interview, Bergin concluded his Sunday night report . by saying that the underlying cause of an anti-police mentality is young black . men growing up without fathers. He said: 'It's important to shine a light on this . anti-cop mentality that has so contaminated America's inner cities,' Bergin said. 'The underlying cause of all of this, of course, young . black men growing up without fathers.' Speaking to Miss Kelly on Fox News, Bergin explained that his goal was to provide some balance and context - but he was well aware of the risks. 'There's no doubt that I went off the reservation,' he said. 'I made a couple of rogue remarks at the end... I knew what I was doing.' He . added: ‘I knew there would be some consequences; I knew there would be . some ramifications. I thought maybe I would get a reprimand, maybe a . temporary suspension...’ Ousted: Sean Bergin, a reporter with News 12 New Jersey, has been suspended for voicing his opinions about black families and relations with police and won't be back on air . Bergin, a contracted employee, said the station told him that his . assignments would be cut to one a week and he declined to remain in the . position. The ousted reporter has reiterated that he decided to address the subject of young black men in the context of the officer’s killing because he wanted to send a message. ‘This has got to stop. Somebody has to have the guts to stand up and point at this and say, “Hey man, we gotta start talking about this."" ‘I know it's a touchy subject, I know it’s a sensitive issue… there is shame involved here. Nobody wants  to be known as the man who abandons his children.' The National Association of Black Journalists' president, Bob Butler, challenged Bergin's connection between young black men growing up without fathers and anti-police sentiments and said that Bergin went beyond the standards of a news reporter by inserting his views on the story. 'Are there problems in the inner city with kids without fathers? Yes. But does that make kids violent? No,' Butler said. 'There are a lot of kids without fathers who go to college, graduate and become upstanding citizens. 'He's talking about a social phenomenon where there's lack of opportunity in communities.' But Bergin brushed off Butler's criticism, insisting there there is a clear link between fatherlessness and the negative sentiment many black youths have towards police. ‘I think you can certainly draw a connection between fatherless young men and this feeling of anti-authoritarianism,’ he told Kelly. Asked about the message his ouster from News 12 sends, Bergin responded: 'Don't speak out. Just stay silent. it's safer that way. You'll keep your job.’ When asked if he would have been demoted had he spoken out in support of gay marriage, Bergin replied that it is a question he wishes his former news director would answer. Kelly later posted a message on Bergin’s Facebook page, writing that she had asked Dr Ben Carson, a frequent Fox News contributor, about the reporter’s suspension. ‘Dr. Carson’s response: “Pretty soon people will be afraid to express themselves about anything,”’ she wrote. In an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday, Bergin sounded a defiant note, saying: 'If I had it to do over again, I would . do the exact same thing. 'I broke the rules. I knew I was . breaking the rules. But sometimes you have to break the rules to do the . right thing.' He said that the issue of young black men without fathers deserves more media coverage.

"Sen. Mitch McConnell, the GOP's minority leader in Congress' upper house, strode onto the stage Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference with real firepower: a flint-lock, muzzle-loading rifle hoisted over his head. The weapon was a gift for Tom Coburn, a retiring conservative senator from Oklahoma. But the firearm, though silent, made as much noise as McConnell. Easily the most weakly applauded keynote speaker in the CPAC event's first day, McConnell channeled the late Charlton Heston's famous National Rifle Association moment, when he said the government could take his guns 'from my cold, dead hands!' – and then the moment was over. His speech, if another Republican had delivered it, might have gone over with as much spark as Chris Christie or Donald Trump brought to their moments in the spotlight. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (L) strode onto the CPAC stage with a rifle, which was the most fired-up thing about hsi five minutes on stage . McConnell brought the rifle for Sen. Tom Coburn (R), as a lifetime achievement award from the National Rifle Association . Not exactly Charlton Heston: The film legend famously lifted a Winchester lever-action rifle over his head at the 2003 NRA annual convention, shouting that the government could take his guns 'from my cold, dead hands' Gun rights are a rallying point for many conservatives, and the National Rifle Association had several booths inside the CPAC exhibit hall -- including a laser-sight target practice game . 'The president of the United States is treating our constitution worse than a place mat at Denny’s,' he said. 'I’ve spent so much time over at the supreme court trying to stop these guys that I’m practically on a first-name basis with the bailiff.' But McConnell, known more for his compromising than his fighting, couldn't win over a crowd of the nation's most committed and strident right-wing activists. They came to suburban Washington, D.C. this week to hear Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Sarah Palin, not the senator who is running a dead heat with a liberal's liberal, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes – and still faces a primary challenge beforehand. 'If I'm given the opportunity to lead the U.S. Senate next year, I won’t let you down,' McConnell said Thursday. Few applauded. Danger ahead: Kentucky's Democratic secretary of state,  Alison Lundergan Grimes, wants McConnell's job and she's polling neck-and-neck with him . Misfire: The establishment Republican McConnell brought the house to a dull murmur, compared with the tea party renegades who drove thousands to applaud . Even if the Senate returns to Republican control after November, McConnell might not make it back to Washington to see it. He entered the CPAC stage to the sound of Bon Jovi's 'Living on a Prayer.' So the six-term incumbent is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to court red-meat conservatives, even with gun-rights imagery that better fit NRA honcho Wayne LaPierre, who would speak on the same stage three hours later. He left his tricorn hat and hunting boots at home. The NRA, it turns out, provided the rifle as a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' for Sen. Coburn, since the Oklahoman was one of the nation's most consistent Second Amendment hawks. And McConnell's biggest applause line came when he handed the gun to Coburn. 'This is for you, for your distinguished service,' he said. The annual CPAC conference brings together thousands of prospective presidential candidates, conservative opinion leaders and tea party activists – and a horde of media.","The tepid McConnell's only big applause line came when he presented Sen.

"Support: Nick de Bois, who is urging the government to stop punishing middle class families with the 40p rate . The 40p tax rate is killing ambition and the Chancellor must act to stop punishing middle-class families who are not well-off, a leading Tory warned last night. Nick de Bois, secretary of the influential 1922 Committee, said the Government risked ‘undermining aspiration’ by allowing millions of middle-income earners to be dragged into the 40p tax bracket, which was once reserved for the wealthy. The Government has raised the threshold at which people pay basic-rate income tax to £10,000. But Tory MPs are now lobbying Chancellor George Osborne hard ahead of next week’s Budget because workers are now hit with the 40p rate as soon as they earn £41,450 a year. When Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson cut the top rate of tax to 40p in 1988, just one in 20 taxpayers – some 1.35million – was affected. By 2010, when David Cameron entered Downing Street, there were three million workers paying 40 per cent tax, while today there are 4.4million. Speaking to the Daily Mail, Mr  de Bois warned the number would soar even higher, adding: ‘Paying 40p to the Government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £41,450 is at best demoralising. ‘At worst, it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration. ‘The number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4million this year to more than 6million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation.’ Calling for a rise in the threshold, he said: ‘This tax rate, when conceived years ago, was for the relatively well-off. Yet my constituents who earn that sum of £41,450 are far from “well-off”. ‘Mortgage or rent, season ticket, council tax, household bills, car, insurance – the list goes on, leave little for luxuries one would normally associate with the well-off.’ He pointed out that the net income after tax and National Insurance of someone on £41,450 is just £30,000 – just £4,000 above the household welfare cap of £26,000 a year, adding: ‘Is that not a stark indication of how imbalanced the present threshold is?’ ‘For these middle-income earners who are instinctively striving to improve their lot and yet bearing a considerable price for the failed debt-ridden policies of the last Labour government, what better means to show our support than to make it clear we want to increase the threshold where employees pay 40 per cent tax?’ Nigel Lawson (right) cut the top rate of tax to 40p in 1988 and just some 1.35million were affected. When David Cameron took power, there were three million workers paying 40 per cent tax, while today there are 4.4million . He spoke out as Tory activists went even further, demanding the abolition of the 40p tax rate. David Skelton, of the grassroots Renewal group, which wants the Tories to do more to appeal to northern and working-class voters, said the 45p rate – which applies to those earning at least £150,000 – should kick in on earnings above £62,000. The plan would mean two million middle-class workers would get a tax cut of up to £2,000 a year. But Mr de Bois said he would not back the plan because it would simply move the problem slightly higher up the income scale. Even Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow and a lynchpin of Renewal, says he would rather see further cuts for those on low incomes. Next week’s Budget is expected to increase the basic-rate income-tax threshold to at least £10,500, at a cost of around £1billion, raising the prospect of the 40 per cent threshold being lowered again to limit the benefit to higher earners. But MPs say the time has come for Mr Osborne to do something for the ‘squeezed middle’ earning between £40,000 and £60,000. Mr Skelton said: ‘More and more people on middle incomes have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent rate of tax over the past decade or so. That includes teachers, nurses, bricklayers, police officers and Tube drivers. These are not the type of people who should be paying higher-rate tax.’ Treasury officials decline to comment on Budget deliberations. BY NICK DEBOISConservative MP for Enfield North and Secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchersPublic debate about tax rates in this Parliament has tended to concentrate on the two extreme ends of the spectrum. Labour has made constant reference to those benefiting in the reduction of the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p (despite the fact that just 6.3% of those paying the 50p tax rate would be people earning £1 million or more according to CityAM’s Allister Heath). At the other end of the scale, Conservatives have been right to highlight the success of raising threshold at which people being paying income tax from £6,475 in 2010 to £10,000. Danny  Alexander is simply squabbling when he worries more about who gets the credit for it than who benefits from it. Indeed, all Conservative MPs are rightly proud that it has been a Conservative-led Government that has cut taxes for 24 million people, including lifting 2.7 million out of paying tax altogether. Nick de Bois says the number of middle income earners who are being captured in the so called 'higher' earnings tax rate of 40p has increased . This is no mean achievement during a time of austerity, when balancing the books has been the single most important task for the Government. That task had been made all the more difficult by the top rate of tax being raised to 50p in the last days of the previous Labour government; study after study has shown that this move actually cost money, perhaps as much as £4 billion a year. Full marks go to George Osborne for ignoring the shrill voices of the left and reducing this rate back to 45p. It will collect more tax in total and sends a clear message to both UK and overseas investors. But whilst these debates have raged there is a slow but substantial increase in the number of middle income earners who, whilst having benefited from the new threshold of £10,000, are being captured in the so called ""higher"" earnings tax rate of 40p. The MP says the tax rate, when conceived years ago, was for the relatively well-off. But many of his constituents who earn £41,450 are far from 'well off', he insists . This higher rate kicks in at earnings over £41,450 a year. To be precise the number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4 million this year to more than 6 million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation anymore therefore dragging more people into this tax band. This tax rate, when conceived years ago, was for the relatively well-off. Yet my constituents who earn that sum of £41,450 are far from 'well off'. Mortgage or rent, season ticket, council tax, household bills, car, insurance (the list goes on) leave little for luxuries one would normally have associated with the well-off. Indeed, the net income after tax and National Insurance of someone on £41,450 is £30,000: just £4,000 above the household welfare cap of £26,000 a year. Is that not a stark indication of how imbalanced the present threshold is? For these middle income earners who are instinctively striving to improve their lot and yet bearing a considerable price for the failed debt-ridden policies of the last Labour government, what better means to show our support than to make it clear we want to increase the threshold where employees pay 40% tax? I don't suggest that the Chancellor can do this now or even before 2017, but he can make it clear that this is the direction of travel for the Conservative party. He can take comfort from the fact that presently the top 1% pay a record 29.8% of all income tax, and the top 16% of earners pay 67%. That is more than enough justification to introduce a modest change to the threshold. Let’s face it: paying 40 pence to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £41,450 is at best demoralising. At worst, it can kill ambition and undermine  aspiration.","Nick de Bois says 40p tax rate ran risk of 'undermining .

"An Olympic weightlifter has told how her dream of competing at the Games has finally come true - but not in the way she originally hoped it would. Holley Mangold harboured a dream as a child that she would one day make it to the Olympics. But the 22-year-old athlete, who this year will compete as part of the United States' weightlifting team, says she always thought her Olympic sport would be gymnastics - until her body got in the way. Olympic dream: Holley, who weighs 25 stone, was the only girl to play on her school American football team as a child . Dreaming big: Holley Mangold always hoped to compete as a gymnast at the Olympics but says her body - she weighs 25st - 'had a different plan' Her 25st frame put paid to her long-held ambition to spin round the asymmetric bars or somersault across the floor to music. Instead, she found that she became naturally adept at sports that demanded a stronger physique. At the age of 11 she made it onto the American football team at her local school in the Ohio town of Dayton where she was born and raised. Job satisfaction: 'There's nothing cooler than someone saying ""pick that up"" and you know how to do it' After excelling in the robust sport - she was the first female non-kicker to play in an Ohio Division III high-school football game - she was encouraged to try her hand at weightlifting - and a new obsession was born. Now Holley is a member of the 2012 US Olympic Team as a superheavyweight Olympic weight lifter - and is hoping to better her personal record of lifting a staggering 562.2lbs in the combined snatch clean-and-jerk - 212.2lbs more than her 350lbs weight. Talking of her appearance at the Olympics this year, Holley said her body decided what her path would be - but that all has worked out in the end. 'Kinda thought it was going to be gymnastics,' she told the Observer. 'My body had a different plan,' But despite the enforced change of direction, Holley, who turns cartwheels before she competes to prepare for her performance, has wholeheartedly embraced her talent for hefting huge weights.

Their findings suggest that Holder wasn’t far off when he said that owning the rights to his band’s 1973 hit was ‘like winning the lottery every December 25 for the rest of your life’. Merry Xmas Everybody – thought by the PRS to be the most heard song in the world – is the biggest earner by far, with £512,000 raked in already this year. Raking it in: Slade front man Noddy Holder doesn't have to worry about paying for his Christmas presents . Its closest rival – The Pogues’ Fairytale of New York – lags behind with £386,270. Mariah Carey is third with All I Want For Christmas Is You, the newest song in the top five, which was released in 1994. Office party favourite Last Christmas by Wham! was fourth, followed by Cliff Richard’s Mistletoe and Wine. East 17’s Stay Another Day also makes the list, although purists would question whether it truly is a Christmas song. The lyrics do not contain any festive references – but with the help of a snow-filled video, the track has become a mainstay of Christmas playlists since its release in late 1994. Unfortunately for some, not everyone who sings a Christmas hit retains the rights to make a fortune – no matter how well-loved their hit turns out to be. In 2011, Boney M singer Liz Mitchell revealed she had earned hardly anything from the band’s track Mary’s Boy Child – despite it being one of the biggest-selling singles of all time in the UK. Miss Mitchell complained that all the profits went to her record company instead, adding: ‘If I was to spend time working out what the record company got – and those in that team of people around us – I would lose my mind. ‘Our royalty statement has been minimal and menial. Really ... We get maybe a seventh of one per cent.’","Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody has earned more than £500,000 .

"A bogus lawyer who was ordered to pay £1.4million in legal costs after being exposed by the Daily Mail and then struck off has been ordered to pay a further massive sum after abandoning an appeal. Shahrokh Mireskandari, 53, has been given until April 4 to pay more than £230,000 in additional costs after being condemned by a leading judge for 'wholly abusive, unreasonable and manipulative conduct', including attempting to get the appeal hearing adjourned. Mireskandari was banned from practising as a solicitor after an investigation by the Mail revealed that he had faked his legal qualifications and hid criminal convictions while representing celebrity clients. Labour MP Keith Vaz (left) and race lawyer Shahrokh Mireskandari (right), pictured at a House of Commons function in November 2007 . A solicitors' disciplinary tribunal found him guilty in June 2012 of 104 breaches of the rules governing solicitors' conduct after a six-week hearing. The Mail uncovered the scandal . The tribunal found that while running his London-based law firm Dean and Dean, Mireskandari got into debt, overcharged clients, conducted improper litigation, failed to keep proper records and used clients' cash to pay staff salaries. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) accused him of making 'substantial efforts to derail and disrupt' the hearing. Then Mireskandari, who owned a string of properties in London but has fled to Los Angeles to avoid creditors, launched an appeal against the strike-off order and it was listed for a 10-day hearing in February. But less than a fortnight before it was due to begin he applied for it to be stayed on the grounds of ill health. The application was rejected as 'hopeless' by Lord Justice Moses on February 5, who also described it as 'an abusive application designed to manipulate the court into granting an adjournment'. Later the same week Mireskandari withdrew his appeal. Yesterday, the SRA asked Lord Justice Moses to make a costs order against Mireskandari on an indemnity basis - the highest level available - to show the court's disapproval of his unreasonable conduct, which had led to the authority incurring substantial costs in preparing to resist his 43 grounds of appeal. Agreeing, Lord Justice Moses said: 'If this conduct and litigation does not justify an order I don't know what litigation does.' Formally dismissing Mireskandari's appeal, the Appeal Court judge said: 'This has been wholly abusive and unreasonable litigation.' Disciplinary action was taken against Mireskandari after the Mail revealed in 2008 he had launched his legal career in the UK on the basis of qualifications acquired from a mail drop Hawaii university. At the time he was representing ex-Met assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his race claim against Britain's biggest force and former commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. He was also in close contact with Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, who publicly described him as a 'very, very dear friend' and also as the 'best lawyer in Britain'. In the aftermath of the Mail investigation, Mireskandari faced disciplinary action, his firm was closed down, his close friend the corrupt Met commander Ali Dizaei was suspended and Mr Ghaffur had to drop his £1million-plus race claim. Mireskandari was represented by 17 barristers at the misconduct hearing, but panel chairman Jacqueline Devonish said that allegations of dishonesty had been proved. The Iranian-born crook claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated vendetta by the SRA and the Mail. But the tribunal dismissed this.","Shahrokh Mireskandari, 53, was uncovered as a crook by Mail investigation .

"Phil Neville provides exclusive analysis for Sportsmail in the wake of Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Manchester City in the table-topping Barclays Premier League clash on Saturday. Jose reverts to type . I was watching Jose Mourinho throughout the game and every time Chelsea went forward he was screaming at Nemanja Matic and Ramires: ‘Get back, get back!’ He brought on Gary Cahill and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and he clearly had decided that the one goal was all they would get. And as such, it was a building block on the way to the title. Jose Mourinho was typically animated on the touchline during Chelsea's draw with Manchester City . To me they looked much more like the Chelsea of last season: solid but lacking the creativity in midfield they have had this season. That, of course, was because they were missing Cesc Fabregas as much as Diego Costa. I think City probably have the best squad and Chelsea have the best starting XI in the League. Mourinho hasn’t shaken City off and his team looked tired and vulnerable to injury and suspensions. I still think Chelsea will win the title but there are signs to give City hope. Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa watch on from the stands of Stamford Bridge on Saturday . Will City rue their missed chance? Manchester City were more solid than normal to start with, as though they were expecting a real contest. Yet by the end there was only one team going for it. I’ve played in those games where you gear yourself up, expecting a really hard game. And when it doesn’t turn out that way, you can be kicking yourself. That’s how I think City will feel. By the time they realised the game was there for the taking, it was too late and Chelsea were set in their defensive mode. I think they lacked a little bit of ambition to win the game. Manuel Pellegrini may be left to rue Manchester City's missed opportunities against Chelsea . There is still a long way to go and the important thing is that now they stay in touch with Chelsea until Easter — they can’t allow that gap to grow. But at the end of the season, they may look back at this one and rue their missed chances. The missing man . Might Yaya Toure have made the difference in those final 15 minutes? I thought this was one of the best displays from Fernando and Fernandinho. They were brilliant in stifling Eden Hazard, Oscar and Willian. Apart from Hazard’s cross for the goal, we didn’t see anything of those three. But you just wonder if Toure, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, with his strong personality and his physical strength, might have driven them on at the end. Big men win you big games. Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho tackles Chelsea's Ramires while team-mate Fernando watches on . When Branislav Ivanovic went forward, Sergio Aguero would pull into that left-hand channel. It was a really good tactic but every time he did, City didn’t have a runner who could burst through the middle. Toure would have relished that. Or even Frank Lampard. If they had been really brave and brought him on earlier, it might have just given them that edge. Is Zouma the new partner for Terry? Kurt Zouma looks like a player Jose Mourinho will trust in big games. He’s only 20 years old but he’s picked him against Liverpool and Manchester City, when they were facing quick attackers in Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero. Mourinho obviously feels he needs that extra pace alongside John Terry and in those two you have a perfect mix: the big strong organiser alongside the quicker, sharper man. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand were exactly that and it’s a classic defensive partnership. Kurt Zouma rises above Manchester City midfielder James Milner to win a header . I watched him a lot at St Etienne last season and he’s probably the quickest centre-back in the League. He’s raw at times and just needs to fine-tune his game. He probably will make mistakes but he looks to have won Mourinho over. Chelsea will kick on with Juan Cuadrado . I’m a massive fan of Juan Cuadrado and I think we’re about to see an even better Chelsea side when he joins. Saturday’s tactics were dictated by the loss of Costa and Fabregas. I think Mourinho has concluded he is short of players to come in and he is over-reliant on his first XI. That is why Cuadrado could give them the decisive lift. Chelsea will kick on in their pursuit of the Premier League title with the acquisition of Juan Cuadrado . I first saw him playing for Colombia a year ago and I could not believe his running power. You think Willian runs hard, but this lad is something else. He runs box to box and he’s a typical Mourinho signing. He will double up and defend but will pop up in the box 30 seconds later. He will fit into the Chelsea philosophy. It’s maybe a signing that will push them towards the title.","Phil Neville provides exclusive analysis for Sportsmail .

"West Ham are not worried about any potential FIFA ramifications in their ongoing feud with Senegal over the availability of Diafra Sakho. The striker pulled out of competing in the African Cup of Nations earlier this month on medical advice after sustaining a back injury - but co-owner David Sullivan insists they have done nothing wrong despite the 25-year-old’s involvement with the Hammers. But Senegal coach Alain Giresse bemoaned Sakho’s absence on Monday night after he featured, and score, for West Ham against Bristol City in the FA Cup at the weekend. Striker Diafra Sakho's presence for West Ham United has frustrated Senegal coach Alain Giresse . Giresse has bemoaned Sakho's absence and Senegal have complained to FIFA about the matter . Diafra Sakho's West Ham United team-mate Cheikhou Kouyate showed his support on Wednesday. On his Instagram, alongside a picture of Sakho, he said (translated): ""Ok we stop talking when you do not know the truth about the history of the injury Diafra Sakho ! Please! because enough is enough ! It was his dream to go to the can with Senegal but God decide otherwise , I was present when he was hurt ! Diafra and I had to take the same plane to join the group but unfortunately he could not fly for six weeks ! But could play in three weeks ! The problem is that the injury he had does not support the aircraft for six weeks !!! Want more explanation , or you want to still keep talking ? iamdiafrasakho big brother is coming soon insha allah I do not need t say Hahahaha be strong because I know you boy bandit doooryiiiii la. One love."" Senegal lodged an official complaint with FIFA - demanding that the game’s governing body take action. But Sullivan has emphatically hit back. ‘A top back surgeon said Sakho can’t fly and he still can’t fly, he went by car to Bristol and is going by train to Liverpool,’ Sullivan told Sportsmail. ‘How can we go against medical advice? ‘We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred whilst playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.’ Sakho scored the winner at Ashton Gate on Sunday and is set to be included in Sam Allardyce’s squad to play Liverpool on Saturday. The tournament in Equatorial Guinea runs until February 8, and although Senegal have already crashed out, FIFA can stop Sakho appearing for the Hammers for the duration of the competition. That means he could miss the Premier League games against Liverpool and Manchester United, while they could issue a fine or an even longer ban. Sakho's West Ham United team-mate Cheikhou Kouyata posted his support on Instagram on Wednesday . West Ham owner David Sullian (left) has hit back at the jibes at the club and believes no rule has been broken . Senegalese fans also want the Hammers booted out of the FA Cup. They travel to West Brom in the fifth round next month. Giresse said earlier this week: ‘I’m very surprised to learn that he played. When you cannot fly for six weeks and then suddenly you’re playing a football game. There must be miraculous medicine in England. ‘This sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they cannot catch planes to Africa but who can still play football (for their clubs). It is a debate that deserves more discussion.’ Sakho has come in for criticism on social media after pulling out of the tournament, with one fan writing: ‘Congratulations on your goal, I hope you never play for Senegal again, the Senegalese people feel betrayed.’ Sakho responded: ‘I took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks. Very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger. ‘Sadness because some of your words touched me deep in my person and my heart and this, without you knowing what has really happened. Sakho (second right) headed in West Ham's winner in the FA Cup  against Bristol City . ‘And great anger, because after all my struggles day after day, season after season to finally wear the jersey of my homeland, and my family, the only nation that matters to me - you doubt my love and my patriotism. ‘My absence at CAN 2015 (the African Nations Cup), my first CAN, was not painless. ‘The dream of contributing to the victory of my country got away from me this year, but it is not dead! ‘Never doubt the lion sleeping in me, as I never doubt the passion that burns within you.’","Diafra Sakho pulled out of Senegal's AFCON squad with a back injury .

"The Democratic Republic of Congo fought back from two goals down against their neighbours the Republic of Congo, to win a dramatic quarter-final 4-2. Joel Kimuaki’s header eight minutes from time rounded off an astonishing comeback before Dieumerci Mbokani made the win certain late on in a game which saw six goals, and the woodwork struck twice, in a pulsating 36-minute spell. After a dreadful first half, in which chances had been limited to hopeful long range efforts and a couple of scuffed shots, the Congo derby ignited after the break. Democratic Republic of the Congo's forward Jeremy Bokila (C) celebrates his goal in Bata . Congo's Thievy Bifouma is all smiles as he finds the back of the net in a 4-2 goalfest . There were signs of life from the first seconds of the second half, when Jeremy Bokila had a shout for a penalty turned down, and soon after the striker rattled the crossbar following an excellent knock-down from Dieumerci Mbokani. But just as it looked as though DR Congo were beginning to take control of the game they fell apart. In the 54th minute Dore Ferebory was given the freedom of the penalty box from a free kick, and he stabbed home to break the deadlock. A little more than five minutes later and Claude Le Roy’s side were two goals ahead, following some suicidal defending. Congo's coach Claude le Roy voices his opinions during the Africa Cup of Nations game . DR Congo forward Dieudonne Mbokani celebrates after a neat finish during the game in Bata . First Jean Kasusula gifted the ball to Theivy Bifouma, the tournament’s top goalscorer, then Robert Kidiaba charged out of his goal for no reason. Bifouma fed Dore, who should have taken advantage to grab his second, but when his shot was blocked back to Bifouma, the former West Brom striker made no mistake. In between the two goals the Leopards had come close themselves, Cedric Makiadi curling a free kick beautifully onto the cross bar. Mbokani and Sagesse Babele go flying as they compete for the ball in a hotly contested game . And going a second goal behind seemed to galvanise them, Yannick Bolasie in particular finally finding his best form. The Crystal Palace winger produced some of the magic he has been showing in the Premier League this season to bamboozle his fullback, before squaring it for Mbokani, who couldn’t miss. Suddenly the game was back on, and DR Congo were pushing forward at every opportunity. Bokila, whose finishing had been woeful throughout should have converted a Mbokani knock-down, but fired wide of the far post. DR Congo fansget into the spirit of things as they cheer on their side . But the chances continued to flow, and the 26-year-old eventually managed to find the target. Having seen yet another shot saved, Bokila stayed alive with the ball still in the box, eventually swiveling on it and smashing home from 15 yards. It was a brilliant finish, and had he shown that level of quality earlier in the game DR Congo would have been out of sight. And the comeback was completed six minutes later when substitute Kimuaki flicked a Bolasie free kick into the corner of the net. DR Congo fans put on a colourful affair as they watch their team in the Africa Cup of Nations . The extreme drama could not have been more unexpected after a drab first half. The two countries may share a border, a name and plenty of political disagreement, but the expected bite was entirely lacking from the an opening 45 minutes in which neither side seemed up for the challenge. DR Congo shaded the play, Bokila scuffing two glorious chances, but the majority of the game was played at a pedestrian pace in the midfield, with long shots the order of the day. Only Cedrick Mabwati threatened to stir what crowd there was inside the stadium from their heat-induced slumber, the winger popping up all over the place to torment the opposition full-backs. Thievy (C) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal during the 2015 African Cup of Nations quarter final . But on the other wing, the Leopards talisman Bolasie was strangely subdued. Aside from a man of the match performance in the first game, the Palace winger has not been able to make much of an impression on this tournament, and so it seemed to be proving again. That was until his side really needed him at two goals down, at which point Bolasie sprung into life. His two assists changed the game, and he had a good chance to seal the win himself before Mbokani wrapped up DR Congo’s place in the semi final. It was the Leopard’s first win of the tournament, and will be their first semi-final since 1998. On this evidence, when their backs are against the wall, you wouldn’t write them off from going further.

"174 out of 547 suspected rapists in London in 2011 were foreign as were 40 out of 197 murder suspects . Almost a fifth of all people charged with rape or murder last year were immigrants and some were deported only to return and commit more crime, it was revealed today. Critics say new figures show the Government has an ‘open door policy’ that allows violent criminals from across the world to enter the UK. Freedom of Information data from English and Welsh police forces show last year 91 immigrants were accused of murder while 406 were charged with rape - around one in five of all cases. Fears: Almost one in five rape and murder suspects last year were immigrants and critics say it shows UK border controls are not tough enough . In London 174 out of 547 people accused of rape were from abroad, with the highest numbers from Jamaica, Nigeria, Poland and Australia. While 40 out of 197 charged with murder in the capital last year were not British. One infamous case from 2011 involved illegal immigrant Younas Beraki who was jailed for life after he murdered his ex-lover by pushing her 30ft from a bridge despite being deported from Britain three times. He shoved mother-of-one Genet Kidane on to a busy dual carriageway because he could not accept that she had ended their relationship. Only weeks earlier, the failed asylum seeker from Eritrea in North-East Africa had been deported from the UK for a third time – but he smuggled himself straight back into the country in a lorry. UKIP MEP and the party’s spokesman on home affairs, Gerard Batten, told The Sun: ‘It bears out the public perception that our open door immigration policy doesn’t just attract decent migrants but serious and dangerous criminals.’ Murderer: Younas Beraki, left, sneaked back into Britain in a lorry to kill Genete Kidane, right, despite being deported three times . The official figures also give a regional picture of crimes by immigrants. Kent had the highest amount of non-British murder suspects - 53%, followed by Surrey on 50% and Gwent on 40%. London had a non-uk rape suspect rate of 32% last year, followed by Wiltshire with 30% and Hertfordshire on 27%. These figures, showing up to half of suspects in some areas are from abroad, has raised questions about the monitoring and deportation of people entering Britain. But the Home Office, which runs the UK Border Agency, maintains they have a tight grip on the issue. ‘Those who come to the UK must abide by our laws. We will always seek to deport any foreign criminals as quickly as possible and in 2011 we removed over 4,500 foreign national offenders,’ a spokesman told MailOnline. ‘This included more than 50 individuals convicted of murder, causing a death or attempted murder and approximately 300 sex offenders.’ In April the Mail revealed barely 40 per cent of the foreign criminals released from prison in a border scandal six years ago had been deported. In 2006, the Labour government was rocked by revelations that more than 1,000 foreign nationals had been let out without being considered for deportation. By November last year, fewer than 400 had been removed from the country or deported, and more than 50 have still not been found. Hundreds more remain here despite their cases.","Last year 91 were accused of murder while 406 were charged with rape in England and Wales .

"Alan Pardew suffered his first defeat as Crystal Palace manager in frustrating fashion as his side failed to respond to conceding an early goal against Everton. It was bitty, gritty and grinding from Everton. There were delayed free kicks and balls pettily poked away when the whistle had gone.

Pardew and counterpart Martinez had barely taken up position on the edge of their technical areas when Romelu Lukaku bundled the ball in from close range. Given the contrasting fortunes of the sides in recent times — Palace on the back of four wins since Pardew took over and Everton with just one victory in 13 — the visitor’s early lead was a shock. Only two minutes were on the clock when Steven Naismith was played down the right and had time to power in a low ball. Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni could only palm the cross into the sliding Lukaku. He was lucky, the ball cannoned off his knee and went in. Three minutes later, parity was almost restored when Dwight Gayle cleverly flicked the ball past Joel Robles in Everton’s goal. The effort was bouncing over the line until Phil Jagielka rushed back to clear. ‘Whoever invented that goal-line technology needs a kick up the bum,’ joked Palace manager Pardew afterwards. The resulting corner fell to Yaya Sanogo, whose low shot was destined for the bottom-right corner but the strike was cleared again.

Pardew said last week, following the FA Cup fourth-round win over Southampton, that he would have sleepless nights deciding who to play up front after Gayle, Marouane Chamakh and loan signing Sanogo had all scored. He opted to throw them all into the melting pot which resulted in early Palace pressure, despite going behind. But Pardew’s hand was forced 21 minutes into the match, regardless of his intentions, when Chamakh leapt to head the ball and instead smacked into the back of Seamus Coleman’s skull. Blood spurted from Chamakh’s nose and his face and hands were covered in claret as the striker was carried off on a stretcher. ‘He’s got a broken nose, we fear,’ said Pardew. ‘Fingers crossed he doesn’t get my cold. He wasn’t concussed, but it was a heavy blow to the nose with a cut on it as well.’ Jordan Mutch came on to make his debut following a £5.75million move from Queens Park Rangers on Thursday. Palace proceeded to dominate possession as Everton retreated into their defensive shell for the remainder of the first half and well into the second. Palace’s next good chance came in the 57th minute when Gayle delivered an inviting ball into the box from the left-hand side and Sanogo got a head to it but directed his effort just wide. Their attacks continued to flow —without managing to click in the final third — and so did the blood, this time Scott Dann going down with a cut above the right eye and blood gushing after clashing with Lukaku.

But for all Palace’s dominance without end product, Everton had the clearer chances of the second half. They almost added to their lead on 78 minutes when Aiden McGeady played an angled ball between defence and goalkeeper and Lukaku came sliding in again but could not connect with the ball.

"Move over T-rex, see you later Stegosaurus, adios Argentinosaurus. Scientists have announced that the bones of a new, even larger dinosaur have been found. Argentinosaurus currently holds the record for being both the heaviest land animal ever, and the longest, but the fossilized bones of the biggest dinosaur ever discovered have been found in Argentina. Scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds, as heavy as 14 African elephants. A local farm worker found the remains which were captured by the BBC's Natural History unit. Scroll down for video . The Thigh bones' connected to the...: A technician next to the femur of a dinosaur -- likely to be the largest ever to roam the earth . Boney: One of the paleontologists lies next to the femur of sauropod . What it was like: The newly identified South American dinosaur uses its whip-like tail to fend off predators in this 2014 illustration . Discovery: Paleontologists Jose Luis Carballido (L) and Ruben Cuneo pose next to the bones of a dinosaur at a farm in La Flecha, west of the Argentina's Patagonian city of Trelew . Quite the find: According to paleontologists from the renowned Egidio Feruglio Museum, Jose Luis Carballido and Ruben Cuneo, the fossils are that of a sauropod and preliminary tests dates the fossils at some 90 million years old . How it compares: Size comparison between Argentinosaurus (shown in purple) and a human . Huge discovery: The fossilized bones of the biggest dinosaur ever discovered have been found in Argentina . Tremendous: Its gigantic bones were found by a local farm worker in a desert in Patagonia, the southern Argentine region that has yielded many important dinosaur discoveries . Garguantuan: Its calculated 77-ton weight would have made it as heavy as 14 African elephants, beating the previous record holder, Argentinosaurus, by some seven tons . The fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol. They unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in 'remarkable condition'. According to the measurements of its gigantic thigh bones, the herbivore would have been 40m (130ft) long and 20m (65ft) tall. Palaeontologists think it is a new species of titanosaur – part of a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs that were characterised by their long necks and tails and small heads – dating from the Cretaceous period. The mega dino would have weighed in at 77 tons, making it seven tons heavier than the previous record holder Argentinosaurus. The creature, which lived in the forests of Patagonia between 95 and 100 million years ago, was yet to be named. “It will be named describing its magnificence and in honour to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery,” the researchers said. Residents and technicians gather around the bones of a dinosaur at a farm. They say it is the largest set of remains of a dinosaur ever found to date . Vast: The palaeontologists say the find is thought to be a new species of titanosaur ¿ a huge herbivore of the long-necked sauropod group that lived in the Late Cretaceous period . Stupendous: The bones were initially discovered a year ago in the desert near La Flecha, about 135 miles west of the Patagonian town of Trelew . Dusty work: The fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol (pictured left) Colossal: Scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds, as heavy as 14 African elephants . Long nect: Paleontologists in Argentina's remote Patagonia region have discovered fossils of a creature is believed to be a new species of Titanosaur, a long-necked, long-tailed sauropod that walked on four legs and lived some 95 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period . The discovery came in the same week scientists confirmed the Argentinosaurus to be the biggest of them all. That plant-eating dinosaur weighed a earth-shaking 90 tons when it lived about 90 million years ago in Argentina, although the record has been broken by this new find. Oxford . University palaeontologist Dr Roger Benson, who led the study, says the . dinosaur weigh-in included species ranging from small bird-like . dinosaurs to well-known carnivores such as the Tyrannosaurus rex. The . Tyrannosaurus rex, which weighed 7 tons, was the largest meat-eating . dinosaur in the study, but it is small in comparison to the . Argentinosaurus. Immense: The museum has retrieved some 150 bones said to come from seven individuals, all in remarkable condition . Massive: Given the size of these bones, which surpass any of the previously known giant animals, the new dinosaur is the largest animal known to have walked on Earth . A sparrow-sized bird called Qiliania, which lived about 120 million years ago in China, earned the distinction of being the smallest dinosaur, weighing a mere 15 grams. Dr Benson said Argentinosaurus, which roamed around South America, was about 6 million times the weight of Qiliania and that both still fit within the dinosaur family. 'That seems amazing to me,' he said. The largest meat-eating dinosaur was Tyrannosaurus rex, which weighed 7 tons and is also the largest known land predator of all time. The T. rex edged out another super predator that some scientists had once figured was bigger based on the length of its skull, Giganotosaurus, which lived alongside Argentinosaurus in ancient South America. The study estimated Giganotosaurus at about 6 tons, pretty darned big, but just a bit shy of dethroning T. rex. Remote location: Argentinosaurus also from Patagonia and discovered in 1987 was originally estimated at 100 tons but its weight was later revised downwards to around 70 . Puzzle: One problem with assessing the weight of both Argentinosaurus and this new discovery is that they¿re both based on very fragmentary specimens ¿ no complete skeleton is known, which means the animal¿s proportions and overall shape are conjectural . Introducing: Paleontologist Pablo Gallina speaks to the press about a newly discovered dinosaur discovered in Argentina in Buenos Aires, Argentina . Scenic: The fossils, found in Patagonia, provide the first evidence that the whip-tailed diplodocid sauropods survived well beyond the Jurassic period, when they were thought to have been made extinct . Teamwork: The fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol . Dinosaurs had a remarkable run on Earth. They first appeared about 228 million years ago during the Triassic period, achieved stunning dimensions during the ensuing Jurassic Period and then disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous Period about 65 million years ago. All but the birds, that is. The mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, caused by an asteroid that hit Mexico, doomed most creatures but some birds survived. Benson said this study underscores the reasons that birds made it while their bigger dinosaur brethren did not. Other groups of dinosaurs such as long-necked sauropods like Argentinosaurus, the tank-like ankylosaurs, the duck-billed hadrosaurs, the spike-tailed stegosaurs and the meat-eating tyrannosaurs were essentially locked into a certain ecological niche. But birds filled all kinds of ecological niches with their widely diverse body sizes and 'occupations'. Flying birds lived in all kinds of different habitats, both inland and coastal, and came in a wide range of sizes. But there also were large, ostrich-like flightless birds like Gargantuavis and flightless diving birds like Hesperornis. Groundbreaking: They unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in remarkable condition . Documenting the moment: A film crew from the BBC Natural History Unit was there to capture the moment the scientists realised exactly how big their discovery was . Bones recovered: Gallina and his team of Argentine paleontologists say the 19 vertebrae they recovered in Argentinaís Patagonia region belongs to a new species of Diplodocid they named Leinkupal laticauda, providing what they say is the first evidence that a family of long-necked, whip-tailed dinosaurs survived beyond the Jurassic period, when they were thought to have gone extinc . 'It might be that they were simply much more ecologically diverse and that could have helped them survive an extinction,' said Benson, who also noted that smaller creatures did a better job surviving the asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous. Paleontologist David Evans of Canada's Royal Ontario Museum said dinosaur body size evolved relatively quickly early on in their time on Earth as they invaded new ecological niches, but then slowed down among most lineages. The exception was the maniraptoran lineage that led to birds, Evans added. More than 1,000 species of dinosaurs have been identified but many are known from only fragmentary fossil remains. This study estimated the weight of every dinosaur whose remains are complete enough to contain the bones needed for the study's formula, which is based on the relationship between the robustness of the limbs and the weight of the animal, the researchers said.","New species of titanosaur thought to be as heavy as 14 African elephants .

"A 22-month-old boy fatally overdosed after his mother took morphine and Xanax and used meth before breastfeeding him, authorities have said. Lacey Kertz, 26, was arrested in Jefferson County, Missouri for child abuse or neglect resulting in death on Wednesday, nearly seven months after the death of her youngest son, Carson. The little boy had amphetamines, morphine and meth in his . urine after his death, toxicology reports from the St. Louis County Medical . Examiner’s Office showed, and he also suffered from pneumonia. Dr Michael Graham, who performed the autopsy, previously said the amount of morphine in his system would have been enough to kill an adult without a tolerance for the drug. Arrest: Lacey Kertz, 26, has been arrested seven months after her 22-year-old son Carson, right, passed away from an overdose. She had allegedly used meth and taken painkillers before breastfeeding him . After the toxicology results, the sheriff’s office sent its reports on the case to the prosecutor's office around March. Jefferson County authorities finally arrested her in Barnhart on Wednesday. He passed away on October 28 - the morning after his mother took Vicodin, morphine and Xanax pills and used methamphetamine at their home. She told authorities that she also gave her son two melatonin pills to help him sleep and might have given him Tylenol - but couldn't remember, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Before she put him down to sleep on October 27, she also found him playing with a bottle of Trazadone pills - an anti-depressant - that he had opened and dumped out on to the bed. She said she took one of the pills from his lips and put her fingers down his throat to make him vomit, but it was unsuccessful. Despite him potentially ingesting the pills, she did not seek medical attention, authorities said. She also noted that he started 'acting funny' at around 1.30am, so she held him until he went to sleep. Loss: Carson, right, lived at the mobile park home with his mother and half-brother. After his death, social services noted that the home was covered with trash, rotten food, feces and urine . 'Neglect': Kertz had also seen her son dump out a bottle of painkillers and removed one from his lips, she told authorities. But she did not seek medical attention and he was found unresponsive the next day . He was found unresponsive the next morning inside the home in House Springs. After . his death, Children's Division reports noted that the mobile park home . was filthy. The beds were covered in trash and there were buckets of . urine and feces throughout the house, a report said. There was also rotting food throughout the house and the toilets didn't seem to be working. She also did not have prescriptions for the drugs she took, the Post-Dispatch noted. Kertz was arrested in Barnhart on Wednesday and is being held without bail. Relatives said they were relieved that the little boy was finally getting justice. Rural: The boy was found not breathing in their home in House Springs, Missouri last year . 'It seems like I've been waiting forever for something to finally be done,' Sheryl Sullivan, Carson's paternal grandmother, told the Post-Dispatch. Kertz and her two sons, who had different fathers, had lived most of the childrens' lives with their grandmother. When they moved out, relatives had made several reports to child abuse hotlines about Kertz's drug use and about their living conditions. State Children's Division employees investigated but they records show they did not find anything to give them cause to remove the boys from her care. 'The death of any child is a tragedy, and the Department of Social Services will continue to work closely with law enforcement and the courts on this case to seek justice,' Brian Kinkade, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, said in a statement.","Lacey Kertz 'took morphine and Xanax and used meth before breastfeeding her 22-month-old son Carson in their trash-covered home'

"A former university lecturer who refused to pay his council tax in protest against budget cuts has been jailed for 28 days. Ross Longhurst, 72, was prosecuted over an outstanding £1,028 debt which he owed to Labour-run Nottingham City Council. He arrived at the city’s magistrates’ court holding a placard declaring: ‘Don’t Pay Council Tax’. Strident: Ross Longhurst wielded a loudhailer outside court before he was jailed for 28 days for not paying up . Before the case he said he was prepared to go to prison for his cause to show 'solidarity' with the victims of austerity measures. And once in the dock, he even urged the magistrates to stop paying their council tax and added: 'I encourage everyone in court...don't pay up.' In court Longhurst, from New Basford, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘These (cuts) particularly impact on poor people. We live in a country where the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.’ Magistrates heard Longhurst had refused to pay a penny of council tax since for a year in protest against cuts at the local authority. Nottingham was forced to save £25.5million in 2013 and raised council tax by 1.95 per cent. Anger: Longhurst urged the magistrates jailing him not to pay the tax, which has risen 1.95 per cent . National cuts spanning several years are forcing the council to save £125million a year from its budget in total. The former Loughborough University . social and media studies lecturer admitted a charge of non-payment of . council tax between April 1, 2013 and March 31 this year. As he was led down to the cells by . prison guards he was applauded by his supporters and one could be heard . shouting: 'It's absolutely disgraceful.' Angry: The retired lecturer arrives at court . Longhurst - who had three pensions, . including a teacher's pension and his state pension - was left with a . total bill of £1,028.86. The court heard Longhurst had not . communicated with the council about his financial position, had not . given a statement of means and turned down legal advice from a duty . solicitor. The hearing was . brought following failed efforts to recover the money he owed after the . court made a previous liability order which demanded he pay the full . amount, plus costs of £70. Before the case Longhurst conceded: 'I will have to do the time. 'I'm prepared to do it, because I have made a stand on the matter and I will have to see it through.' He . also accused the Labour-run council of showing 'callous disregard' for . local people and said the Coalition Government was waging a 'war on the . poor'. Nottingham City Council's deputy leader, Councillor Graham Chapman, said after the case: 'By continuing to refuse to pay his council tax, Mr Longhurst unfortunately left the magistrates with no option but to imprison him. 'We have a legal duty to collect it and so had no option but to bring this case to court. 'We have been doing all we can to minimise the impact of the cuts on key services, especially those which are relied on by vulnerable people, and take no pleasure in carrying out the cuts or bringing case like this to court. 'Councillors' allowances have been . frozen for over four years, during which time we have had to save £125 . million from our budget.' Cuts: Nottingham City Council is having to shave a total of £125million a year from its budget . One of his supporters, who did not want to be named, said afterwards: 'It is a travesty that he has been jailed. 'It is disgusting, he is an elderly man who was trying to make a stand, he was trying to make the area a better place and this is why he is now behind bars. 'He has worked and paid council tax, but as all of us do, he got sick of it, he was braver than everyone because he stood up for what he thought was right.'","Former university lecturer Ross Longhurst used a loudhailer outside court .

"Until the execution of his stunning strike to set Newcastle on their way to a first victory of 2015, Remy Cabella had done precious little since his arrival in the Premier League to justify a £12million price tag. In fact, you wondered if a decimal point had been omitted from the fee which brought the France midfielder to Tyneside from Montpellier in the summer. There was one farcical moment before his goal which comically captured Cabella’s struggle, attempting a double step-over only to trip on the ball and watch as it rolled to team-mate Sammy Ameobi – it was his first completed pass of the afternoon.

Sammy Ameobi doubled Newcastle's lead - click here for more from MATCH ZONE . But talent clearly resides within the slight-of-frame playmaker and that much was evident from his opening goal, an uncompromising drill from outside the penalty area to mark his first for the club. Ameobi added an equally sumptuous second after half-time and substitute Yoan Gouffran capped a fine maiden win for interim head coach John Carver, who still harbours ambition of landing the role on a permanent basis. Results like this will certainly help, as will transforming the fortunes of Cabella. ‘I said to him before the game, “I know you have got ability, start doing something for me, give me a goal”,’ revealed Carver, who was this week confirmed as boss until the end of the season. ‘I’m so pleased for him. His all-round performance was excellent and it’s a great finish for the goal. ‘He will get stronger and fitter. It’s hard coming from another league into the Premier League and there will be bad days, that’s what happens with flair players. ‘But the best is definitely still to come from him and we saw what he is capable of today.’ The France international let fly with a powerful left-footed striker from the edge of the area after 40 minutes . Cabella points at himself after giving the away side the lead in the first half as team-mate Ameobi chases the goalscorer .

The Hull defender clearly raised his arm above his head before knocking the ball in with his hand Maradona-style . Elmohamady runs off in celebration as Cabella screams for handball before the goal is eventually ruled . For Hull boss Steve Bruce – a sodden and saddened figure amid a second-half snow flurry – the outlook is bleak. His team remain in the relegation zone, have lost four on the spin and are without a goal in six hours. He hopes to bring in Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N’Doye and Spurs winger Aaron Lennon before Monday’s deadline, and admits his team are slipping into a perilous position. ‘This is when you earn your money as a manager,’ he said. ‘It’s my job to lift the players who are a bit shell shocked. I need to wake the players up because we’re in serious trouble.’ Bruce’s cause is hardly aided by the generosity of his sorry side. They started brightly and had shaded the opening half before Andrew Robertson, the Scotland left back, gifted possession to Cabella. Accepting the errant pass 25 yards from goal, Cabella duly dropped a shoulder to fashion space for the shot and located the bottom corner with unerring accuracy. Such is Hull’s desperation right now that Ahmed Elmohamady then tried his damnedest to replicate Diego Maradona’s infamous handball goal, albeit minus the Argentine’s subtlety and cunning. The Egyptian’s hand was a good foot above his head when he punched home Ramirez’s deadball delivery. Somehow, referee Phil Dowd missed what was a blatant offence and it took the intervention of the fourth official to chalk the goal off. Ayoze Perez takes control of possession as Hull Defender Curtis Davies closes down the Newcastle striker . Gaston Ramirez buries his face into the turf after missing a chance for Hull during Saturday's clash . Despondent Hull players wait to restart the game as they fell to their fourth straight defeat in all competitions without even scoring a goal . The win was Newcastle's first of 2015 and a first for manager John Carver since taking over from Alan Pardew in December last year . Steve Bruce braves the rain as he issues instructions to his players from the touchline during the Premier League defeat . Bruce said: ‘We’re struggling at the moment but we don’t want to see goals scored like that – thankfully, the officials got it right. But I don’t think it was cheating, more just a reaction because he couldn’t reach the ball with his head.’ Bruce was wrong on that, Elmohamady had cheated – his celebration and subsequent protest proved as much. But there was no doubting the legitimacy of Newcastle’s second five minutes after half-time. Again Hull were complicit in the concession – Ramirez passing straight to Ameobi – but the winger deserves all of the credit, striding forward and smashing beyond a helpless Allan McGregor from fully 30 yards. Hull weren’t the only ones guilty of some suicidal defending and Fabricio Coloccini’s blushes were spared when his horribly sliced clearance was headed from the line by Vurnon Anita. Embarrassment was a recurring theme and just moments later Hull forward Nikica Jelavic, unmarked in front of an open goal, failed to adjust his feet in time to turn home Ramirez’s cross. If Jelavic had converted then perhaps Hull might have salvaged an unlikely point. But any hope of rescuing something from the game went when Gouffran saw his 12-yard shot deflected up and over McGregor on 78 minutes. Carver and Cabella were the last two off the pitch at the end, celebrating in front of the 2,500 travelling fans. And the Newcastle boss reflected: ‘It was a great feeling and I’m so pleased with performance. ‘We really grew in confidence and starting keeping the ball after the first goal and were excellent, it was a performance I’ve seen coming. ‘I want this job. Everyone now knows I’m the head coach.’ Victories like this will do his chances no harm at all.","Remy Cabella opened the scoring after 40 minutes with a superb left foot drive from the edge of the box .

"More than 12,000 patients are going to A&E at least ten times a year, figures show. They include more than 150 who turn up every week and a handful who arrive five times a week. Such patients are referred to by  medical staff as ‘frequent flyers’ and they include the homeless, alcoholics, drug abusers and those with mental health problems. Repeat visits: Emergency staff are being put under increasing pressure by patients bypassing their local doctor surgeries and heading straight to A&E . Others who go once or twice a month . tend to be the elderly with illnesses which aren’t properly managed and . migrants who don’t know how to make an appointment with a GP. Senior . doctors warn that already-strained A&E units cannot cope with the . added pressure from these patients and say they need to be cared for . elsewhere by GPs and community health services. Separate . NHS figures show the number of seriously-ill patients arriving in . casualty reached a three year high at the end of last month. A . total of 75,751 patients – mainly elderly – had to be admitted to a . ward from A&E in the week ending December 22, the highest since the . last week of 2011. The . deputy head of the NHS, Barbara Hakin, admitted the figures were a . ‘significant concern’. There are fears elderly patients are not being . properly looked after by carers, community nurses and GPs.Dame Barbara . also warned that the next few weeks would be the ‘toughest of the year’ for A&E with more vulnerable patients succumbing to pneumonia and . other infections in the colder temperatures. Dame . Barbara, who is deputy chief executive for NHS England, also warned . that the number of emergency admissions – patients needing to be . admitted on to a ward from A&E – had risen by nearly a third in a . decade. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients' Association, and Dr Cliff Mann, of the College of Emergency Medicine, said people making repeated visits to A&E put pressure on already overstretched emergency staff . An investigation by . the BBC using the Freedom of Information Act show that 157 patients went . to casualty at least 50 times last year.One visited Luton and Dunstable . A&E 234 times, another turned up at Lewisham in south London, 225 . times and one went to Northern General Hospital in Sheffield on 223 . occasions. Dr Clifford Mann, . president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents . A&E doctors, said: ‘Some individuals attended 250 times a year which . is almost five times a week, whereas others are using it ten times a . year which is more like once a month. ‘There’s clearly a difference between those groups but most of them are to some extent on the margins of society. ‘There . are a lot of problems  associated with drugs and alcohol, some with . homelessness, a lot with mental health problems, isolation and . loneliness for some individuals.’ He . said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s also fair to say that some . people are unfamiliar with the system of healthcare in this country and . in particular the way in which they access general practice.

"Massachusetts' Department of Children and Families has been awarded permanent custody of a 15-year-old girl who has been living in a hospital for more than a year. Tuesday's ruling by a juvenile court judge means Justina Pelletier will likely stay in state custody until she turns 18 - unless her parents can provide new information showing they can care for her. The judge had scathing words for her parents, saying their treatment of hospital staff and their threats to sue treatment centers hindered their daughter from moving closer to home. For more than a year, Lou and . Linda Pelletier have been locked in a custody battle with Boston Children's Hospital and state services, who took over custody of Justina when she was admitted for . flu in February 2013. Scroll down for video . 'Taken': Massachusetts' Department of Children and Families has been awarded permanent custody of Justina Pelletier, pictured with her parents Lou and Linda, after a year-long custody battle . Before the visit, the girl had been . diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle-wasting . illness, by Tufts Medical Center in 2011 and was undergoing a drug . treatment program. But during the treatment for flu at Boston's Children’s Hospital, experts said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. When her parents contested the diagnosis and sought to have their daughter treated by her own doctor, officials reportedly refused and the girl was taken into the custody of the state. Justine was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January 2013 and has remained there since. In Tuesday's ruling, Judge Joseph Johnston faulted the girl's parents for being verbally abusive and haphazard in their decision making, the Boston Globe reported. Distraught: Lou and Linda Pelletier, pictured in their home last November, now have to provide new evidence proving they can take care of their daughter. Their lawyer said they are too emotional to speak .

He wrote: 'This court has considered granting conditional custody to Justina's parents. Unfortunately, there has not been any progress by the parents. 'Rather, the parents, either directly or indirectly, continue to engage in very concerning conduct that does not give this court any confidence they will comply with conditions of custody.' The judge also blamed the Connecticut Department of Children and Families for repeatedly declining to take the case from Massachusetts.

April and Michael Jace celebrated their ten-year wedding anniversary last June. Photos from April's Facebook page show her playing happily with her three children, the oldest of whom is from a previous relationship. Detectives were investigating whether the couple's financial problems or other marital difficulties played a role in the killing. It has emerged Jace filed for bankruptcy in March 2011 citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000. He filed for Chapter 13, restructured his finances and reduced his mortgage, but owed $411,000 on the home where his wife was killed and it was believed to be on the brink of a foreclosure. Police Detective Dean Vinluan said there had been no reports of domestic violence at the home.

"Michelle Jannetta, 31, died at Milton Keynes Hospital after a catalogue of errors by staff. An inquest heard staff accused her of faking illness . A 31-year-old mentally ill patient died unnecessarily because of a catalogue of errors by A&E staff, an inquest has concluded. Michelle Jannetta, from Bletchley, Milton Keynes, died at Milton Keynes Hospital on March 8, 2012, after taking an overdose of painkillers. While at the hospital she was left in the care of unqualified healthcare assistants, was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma, and was not given the antidote which could have saved her life, the inquest heard. Her medical notes were also written on the back of a glove which was subsequently lost, and staff mixed up her blood samples with those from another patient. The coroner, Tom Osborne, delivered a . narrative verdict, which stated that: 'There was a failure to undertake . and report on her regular observations and a failure to recognise her . deteriorating condition or the seriousness of her situation that . resulted in a lost opportunity to render further effective treatment . before she went into respiratory arrest caused by obstruction of her . airway, attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and she died at . 11.18 on 8th March 2012.' Ms Jannetta, who had a history of mental illness, arrived at the hospital’s A&E department at midnight on March 7, 2012. Initially, she told staff that she had not taken any drugs. She later told staff she had in fact taken Tramadol. She was well known to the department’s staff but they failed to administer the antidote which would have counteracted the effects of the painkiller within minutes. Her family’s lawyer, Carolyn Lowe, a partner in the clinical negligence department of Henmans Freeth LLP, told MailOnline: ‘There is no record of anyone having considered giving her the antidote. ‘The whole attitude of the staff was clouded by the fact that she was a regular attender – she was not treated as the vulnerable patient that she was.’ Ms Jannetta was left in the care of a healthcare assistant, instead of a nurse, and only two sets of formal observations were taken during her 11 hours in the hospital. One of these sets of results was written on a surgical glove which was then lost. Ms Jannetta was left in the care of healthcare assistants instead of fully qualified nurses. She was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma. She was not given the antidote which could have saved her life. Her medical notes were written on the back of a glove which was then lost. Her blood samples were mixed up with those of another patient. The second set of observations was taken by a healthcare assistant at 8.30am but she failed to report the seriously abnormal results to her seniors. Ms Lowe said: ‘Either the HCA did not recognise the danger signs or she did, and she failed to pass on the information. ‘If the findings had been passed on, Michelle would have been put on half hourly observations and her rapid deterioration in the following hours would have been spotted. ‘The coroner believes that the observations should have been carried out by a fully qualified nurse because having HCA’s playing this role is a major risk to a patient’s life.’ The inquest also heard that Ms Jannetta had been placed to sleep on her back which resulted in her breathing becoming obstructed and caused her death. While she was in the hospital staff also mixed her blood gas samples with that of another patient. She died at 11.20am after she stopped breathing. Nicola Rose, Ms Jannetta’s sister, said: ‘Michelle may have suffered with mental health issues but to the family she was a fun-loving and caring person who was very much adored by every one of us. ‘Michelle was a very much loved aunt, daughter and sister who we all miss desperately. ‘It has been incredibly difficult to come to terms with her untimely death. We wish she was still here bringing smiles to us all and we'll never forget her. While at the hospital (pictured) she was left in the care of unqualified healthcare assistants, was accused of faking her illness despite being in a deep coma, and was not given the antidote which could have saved her life . ‘We can only hope that her tragic death . will bring a change to attitudes towards mental health patients who are . being treated in a general hospital and make it a safer place for the . vulnerable and those struggling with mental illness.’ Ms . Lowe added: ‘Michelle’s inquest has highlighted the problems that . vulnerable patients with mental health issues can encounter in hospitals . and I hope that the Trust will have learnt lessons from this. ‘I can only hope that the family can . take some comfort from knowing that as a direct result of Michelle’s . death the coroner has written to the Secretary of State for Health . asking her to consider changing hospital policy so that observations . taken in patients who are seriously  ill, like Michelle , are to be . carried out by trained nurses. ‘As the coroner said, this should mean that Michelle has not died in vain.’ She told MailOnline: ‘It is clear that due to staff shortages it has become general practice in hospitals for healthcare assistants to take nursing observations. ‘Whilst this may be acceptable in patients that are not seriously ill, for patients that are very ill or have for example taken an overdose, like Michelle, observations should be taken by fully trained nurses who are able to take them and then to interpret them properly. The hospital has apologised that 'Michelle did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect' ‘If that had been done on the night that Michelle was admitted to hospital then she would most likely still be here today.’ Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of of Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'Our thoughts are with Michelle’s family at this difficult time. 'Michelle sadly passed away in our Accident and Emergency Department in March 2012. We are sorry that Michelle did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect. 'Since Michelle’s death, we have conducted an investigation to ensure lessons are learned. We will be continuing to improve our service in regard to emergency patients. 'The Coroner has issued a Rule 43 to the Secretary of State for Health to express his concerns about the national practice of healthcare assistants (HCAs) taking crucial observations. 'We have already commissioned the Open University to provide training for 50 of our Healthcare Assistants (HCAs) to build on their skills.'","Michelle Jannetta died at Milton Keynes Hospital on March 8, 2012 .

The women were reportedly from Egypt, Tunisia and Sweden, although police were not immediately able to confirm their identities or nationalities. Last week bare-breasted members of the feminist group Femen targeted the motorcade of Tunisian Prime Minister Ali Larayedh to protest the jailing of group members in Tunis. As the Tunisian motorcade left following a visit to European Union headquarters, two women climbed atop a diplomatic car and two others chanted slogans. Security officials dragged the women off the car, and all four ran away from the scene.

Wearing just jean shorts, the women chanted in English 'Free Amina' and 'Women's spring is coming' as people in the crowd attempted to cover them.

"The scathing report will make uncomfortable reading for David Cameron . David Cameron’s controversial foreign aid target is a costly ‘con job’ designed to make the Conservative Party seem more caring, a study warns today. In a scathing assessment, the respected centre-Right think tank Civitas accuses the Prime Minister of using billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to ‘rebrand his party and cement the coalition with the Liberal Democrats’. The study warns that the wasteful Department for International Development is almost beyond reform and suggests it should be effectively shut down. It says future aid spending should be handled by the Foreign Office, which takes a broader view of Britain’s interests, including trade. The study suggests that a third of Dfid’s vast budget should be handed to the Ministry of Defence to pay for ‘dual use’ equipment such as helicopters and ships that could be used in emergency relief missions as well as combat. And it calls for Mr Cameron’s ‘exorbitant and self-indulgent’ target to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid to be scrapped, saying there is no evidence it will help the world’s poor. The findings come as ministers prepare to increase the aid budget by a staggering 30 per cent in the coming year in order to meet the Prime Minister’s target. Total aid spending will rise from £8.65billion in the 2012-2013 financial year to £11.3billion in 2013-2014 – an increase of £2.65billion. Today’s 250-page study will make uncomfortable reading for Mr Cameron, who has stuck to his pre-election aid pledge despite imposing austerity measures on virtually every other area of public spending. The study says there is no evidence foreign aid helps the world's poor such as these refugee children in Somalia . The book, by journalist Jonathan Foreman, questions both the value of the extra spending and Mr Cameron’s motives for ordering it. Mr Foreman says increased aid spending has been used by the Prime Minister to ‘detoxify’ the Tory image, describing it as ‘one of the most expensive marketing campaigns in history’. He accuses Mr Cameron of ‘taking advantage of the real generosity of the British people’, adding: ‘A set of policies trumpeted as manifesting generosity is in fact a cynical, ruthless and morally reprehensible con job pushed by marketing gurus for whom their real-world effects in the underdeveloped world are largely irrelevant.’ Mr Foreman also suggests that Britain’s political elite, who all back the aid increase, are more interested in helping the poor abroad than at home. ‘Such people are perhaps more likely to engage with poor Africans and South Asians on their holidays than they are to encounter needy people in their own country,’ he writes. A Dfid spokesman said: 'Sticking to our pledge is both the right thing and the smart thing to do and will create a safer, more prosperous world. 'Fighting global poverty means tackling the root causes of problems such as disease and terrorism which matter to us here in Britain. 'The Coalition government has radically reformed our development spend by focussing resources on a smaller number of countries and agencies, helping economies to stand on their own two feet and setting up an independent watchdog to scrutinise spending and root out waste.'","Think tank Civitas says foreign aid target a 'con job'

"No contest: Dr Soraya Ann Abbassian has avoided jail time as part of a plea agreement after a woman she was preparing for late night surgery died . A doctor who attempted to perform a late-night tummy tuck on an employee who later died has dodged jail time. Dr. Soraya Abbassian, 45, yesterday plead no-contest to criminally negligent homicide over the death of 59-year-old Judith Ann DesMarets in 2010. DesMarets died four days after Abbassian gave her anesthetic in preparation for free cosmetic surgery, without staff or proper equipment, at Woodland Park Medical Plaza in Oregon. Abbassian didn't have the essential . emergency equipment needed to revive the mother of two after she . suffered a seizure on the operating table. OregonLive.com reported Abbassian performed approximately 15 chest compressions and then called 911. DesMarets . was unconscious on the exam room floor when paramedics arrived and was . put on life support in hospital. She died on December 19. An autopsy revealed DesMarets died in hospital from the toxic effects of the anesthetic. In August 2012, a Multnomah County . grand jury indicted Abbassian on one count each of second-degree . manslaughter and recklessly endangering another. The reckless . endangerment charge is related to a separate procedure. No jail time: Dr. Soraya Abbassian (right) with her lawyer Stephen Houze plead no-contest over the death of her friend and employee during an after-hours surgery . However, after pleading no-contest, the charges were dismissed. KOIN.com reported Abbassian is expected to be sentenced to three . years formal probation and 300 hours of community service on October 14. A no-contest plea means Abbassian does not admit the prosecutors' allegations, but agrees that there is evidence that could lead a jury or judge to find . her guilty. The former Lake Oswega resident has been stripped of her medical license and fined $10,000 by the Oregon Medical Board for 'her disregard of professional ethics, patient safety and . lack of clinical judgment'. The OMB also stated in its report that Abbassian 'failed to conduct an appropriate and sufficient medical evaluation' on DesMarets before undertaking the after-hours procedure. Tragic: Judith Ann DesMarets, 59, (pictured) died from the toxic effects of the pre-tummy tuck anesthetics administered to her by her boss,  Dr Soraya Abbassian . DesMarets, a mother of two, was a hospice nurse at Abbassian's clinic, and reportedly often looked after the doctor's children. Her family said Abbassian was preparing for a tummy tuck, however the exact procedure has not been confirmed because no incisions were made. In 2010, . Abbassian told the OMB that 'she regularly performs dermatological . procedures by herself, without office staff present, in her solo . practice clinic.' The Pennsylvania resident also admitted she had called emergency services to her . clinic six other times for complications. The other recklessly endangering charge which was also dismissed yesterday stemmed from a . procedure on a different patient between July and . September 2010. The unidentified patient told investigators she experienced . dizziness and a rapid heartbeat following the procedure. Tim . Quenelle, an attorney representing DesMarets’ son, said a civil . settlement was reached in September 2011.

Kathleen Haley, executive director of the state Medical Board, which suspended Abbassian's license in December of 2010, said it's the first time in her 19 years with the agency that a doctor has been criminally charged in a case involving the death of an Oregon patient.

"Nicolas Sarkozy has infuriated ethnic minorities by claiming that there are ‘too many immigrants in France’ and that the number arriving should be reduced by almost half. The outspoken claims were made on live TV as the increasingly desperate President tried to persuade people to re-elect him in May. ‘Our system of integration is getting worse and worse,’ said Mr Sarkozy. Outspoken: French President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed on live TV that too many immigrants were living in the country . ‘We have too many foreigners on our territory and we can no longer manage to find them accommodation, a job, a school.’ The conservative President, who is trailing badly in all opinion polls to his Socialist rival Francois Hollande, said he wanted to reduce the number of immigrants from some 180,000 a year to 100,000. His controversial comments came as his wife Carla Bruni caused fury across France by referring to the couple as 'modest people'. The 44-year-old heiress, who is regularly compared to the French queen Marie Antoinette because of her pampered lifestyle, made the claim as she watched her husband take part in a live TV debate. Grilling: Mr Sarkosy, right, speaks to French journalist David Pujadas, left, before taking part in the debate . Speaking about immigration, Mr Sarkozy said: ‘Over the five year term, I think that to restart the process of integration in the right way, we must divide by two the number of people that we welcome, that is to say to pass from 180,000 per year to 100,000.’ Mr Sarkozy said he also wanted to limit the amount of welfare benefits paid to immigrant workers so that only those had lived in the country for 10 years, and worked for at least five, received them. In what appeared to be a specific attack on Jews and Muslims – who make up a community of around 5 million in France and are the largest ethnic minority – Mr Sarkozy had earlier called for all kosher and halal products to be labelled properly. He said that all consumers needed to know whether food had been prepared in accordance with Islamic and Jewish law,as they might object to eating it. Stand by your man: France's First Lady Carla Bruni waits beside her husband before the debate. She caused fury across France by insisting they were 'modest people' Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Muslim faith council, said Islam should ‘not become a target in the election campaign’. Richard Prasquier, president of the . representative council of Jewish institutions, has also expressed . ‘shock’ at the ‘stupefying’ claims being made by Mr Sarkozy and his colleagues. Mr Sarkozy was also attacked for . ‘scape-goating and stigmatizing’ Muslims by Manuel Valls, communications . chief for Mr Hollande’s campaign. Mr Sarkozy is hoping he can win over . those who currently vote for Marine Le Pen’ s National Front (FN), but . his increasingly right-wing agenda is not making him any more popular. Before . his TV appearance on Tuesday night, a CSA poll suggested Mr Sarkozy . would gain 46 per cent of the vote in a second round run-off, compared . to 54 per cent for Mr Hollande. An . editorial in Liberation, the Paris daily newspaper, said the French had . ‘solidly and profoundly fallen out of love with the outgoing . President’. Staring at defeat? Mr Sarkozy trails his Socialist rival Francois Hollande in all opinion polls . Miss Bruni did not help matters when she leapt to her husband's defence as he watched him face searching questions during the TV debate. When Mr Sarkozy was criticised for celebrating his election success in 2007 with rich businessmen friends in an upmarket restaurant on the Champs Elysee, she told journalists: 'We are modest people.' The comment, which was published in a number of Paris newspapers today, was described ironically by the Nouvel Observateur as 'a shock argument'. Italian-born Miss Bruni is not only the benefactor of a multi-million pounds fortune built up by her industrialist father, but also made a fortune as a supermodel during the 1990s. She is frequently likened to Marie Antoinette - the royal who was infamously said to have advised poor people without bread to 'eat cake'. Mr Sarkozy, meanwhile, increased his presidential salary by 140 per cent as soon as he came to power, and then took a holiday on a yacht belonging to a billionaire friend. He and Miss Bruni, who married followed a whirlwind romance in 2008, have since spent millions in taxpayers' money on everything from refurbishing their presidential plane to lavish parties. Two years ago it emerged that they were spending more than £650 a day on fresh flowers for the Elysee Palace alone. The couple also used taxpayers' money to settle £3,000 worth of fines for late payment of electricity and gas bills. Their regular holidays have included staying in a £2,000-plus hotel suite in Mexico, as well as spending the whole of August at Miss Bruni's villa on the French Riviera. Internet news sites were today crammed with comments about Miss Bruni's 'modest' claim, with a poster called 'Jambon' from Nice saying: 'The couple have always taken us for imbeciles.' Marc, from Aubervilliers, added: 'Frankly, which planet does she live on? The hour of democratic judgement is coming.' Despite once describing herself as a Socialist supporter, Miss Bruni has been campaigning on behalf of her husband in recent weeks, describing his policies as 'fabulous'.","'Our system of integration is getting worse and worse,' says increasingly desperate President, seeking re-election .

"Hundreds of thousands of Britons with holiday homes in Spain and France could be prevented from renting them out to tourists. Controversial laws set to be passed could also add hundreds of pounds to the cost of breaks for millions of travellers from Britain. They will no longer be able to pay cheaper rates direct to owners but will have to stay in apartments, villas or hotels operated by major firms. Meanwhile, thousands of second-home owners could end up trying to sell up as the changes make it too complicated and costly to keep the property going. Concerns: British villa owners Philip Edwardes-Ker and Nina Bailey pictured in San Jose, Spain where they let out a three-bedroom property . In France, a crackdown on holiday lets in the capital Paris as well as Lyon and Marseille is expected next week. If the new law is a success, the rest of the country could follow suit. In Spain, the authorities are expected to ban unlicensed rentals next spring. Ryan Levitt, of holiday rental website housetrip.com, warned: ‘This law is closing the door to working and middle-class families who want to book a break to Spain at an affordable price. ‘Instead of being able to share a whole house with friends, you face being stuck with your kids in a cramped hotel room.’ An estimated one million properties in Spain are owned by Britons. Many are inhabited all year round by  expatriates but hundreds of thousands were bought as holiday homes. Until recently, it has been relatively simple for British owners to rent out their properties in the two countries. But under the new rules, those with second homes in Spain will need a licence from the local council, which could incur a fee. Laws: The crackdown could see Brits who own Spanish villas, such as this one located between Maro and Nerja Spain pictured, adhering to much stricter guidelines (library image) They will also have to meet strict conditions, such as being contactable 24 hours a day to deal with problems such as water leaks or power blackouts. Owners will have to pass regular safety inspections and obtain hygiene certificates. Failure to comply will lead to hefty fines. In France, the new law will clamp down on homeowners in the three cities who let their second property to tourists. Anybody – including Britons as well as French citizens  – who rents one out  for any period will be deemed to have changed its use, incurring a hefty penalty. Most British-owned second homes in Spain and France are mortgaged and the owners let them for some of the year to cover bills without making a profit. This means the properties can be very good value for visitors. A family of four could pay £2,500 in high season to share a room in a hotel in Alicante with flights booked through a tour operator. But renting a two-bedroom villa with a private pool would cost hundreds less at £1,700 including flights. Holiday let owners Philip Edwardes-Ker and Nina Bailey fear the shake-up could plunge them into a bureaucratic nightmare. The couple have lived in the scenic Spanish fishing village of San Jose for 13 years, where they let out a three-bedroom, two-bathroom villa advertised through an online booking site. But they fear the introduction of laws forcing holiday home owners to stick to strict conditions could make life harder for them and other Britons in the local Almeria area. Mr Edwardes-Ker, 66, who also runs a holiday rental company, said: ‘We don’t mind sticking to the rules if it’s simply a reasonable set of standards but it will be a pain in the neck if they’re more onerous. Even filling in a simple form in Spain can take two or three days’ work. ‘The authorities often ask for a copy for this and a copy of that to go with the form but then will send everything back a few days later and ask for more information. ‘If the rules are too tough they will force holiday let owners out of the market, which would of course be good for hotels. I hope the authorities realise there is both a market for high class places but also for cheap places for families.’ Tourists can cut costs further by renting bigger villas and  sharing the cost with friends and family. Private rentals have exploded in popularity among the 12million Britons who visit Spain each year. According to La Caixa bank, around three-quarters of overnight stays in Spain last year were in ‘unregulated premises’ such as privately-owned villas  or apartments. Most of these visitors booked directly through the high number of online holiday rental firms which have sprung up over the past decade. Until now, in most parts of Spain, anyone can let out their homes provided they pay full tax and declare all revenues. But the recession-hit country is desperate to boost revenues and officials suspect that second-home owners are not paying  billions of euros in tax. The powerful hotel industry has also been lobbying for the changes as the surge in private rentals is hitting its business. Catalonia, the Canary Islands and the Balearics already have tough restrictions. In the past year, thousands of apartment and villa owners in these areas have been fined up to £15,000 each. Others have been banned from renting out property while  hundreds have put their homes on the market. However, finding buyers has proved difficult because of a glut of sellers. Janet Anscombe, president of a Tenerife support group for those hit by the shake-up, said: ‘The only licences being granted are for hotels. Inspectors trawl the internet and fine people found renting their homes.’ The clampdown will be a  further blow to holiday homeowners in Spain, who have seen the value of their properties drop by up to 50 per cent since 2007. There are 200,000 UK holiday homeowners in France, mostly in Provence, the Dordogne,  Normandy and Brittany. Lawmakers in Germany will vote on similar laws in the next fortnight.","Second-home owners on the continent targeted in controversial new laws .

CLICK HERE for more from Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone . This first defeat under Pulis was greeted by boos. He knows his side must improve but whether that is on the training pitch or in the transfer market remains to be seen. What he would pay for a player like Kane, though. Prior to kick-off, he was clear about his admiration for the striker heading for senior England honours. Saido Berahino, his own player with hopes of a call from Roy Hodgson, has a ‘long way to go’ to reach Kane’s standard, the head coach said. Kane’s brace killed off Albion as the Spurs star took his tally to 20 goals for the season — one more than Sergio Aguero. No Premier League player has more. Another wonderful free-kick from Eriksen set the platform for victory. Four times in 16 games he has scored a decisive goal in the 87th minute or later. Here though, the Denmark international was on target as early as the sixth minute. When Claudio Yacob fouled Mousa Dembele 25-yards out, Eriksen set his sights and sent his shot arcing over the wall and past Ben Foster. Kane scored his first goal nine minutes later. He swept inside Andre Wisdom with ease from the left and smacked his finish past Foster before the England goalkeeper had time to extend his arms. West Brom were lacklustre but sprang to life midway through the half. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (left) greets West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Pulis before kick off at the Hawthorns . Midfielder Eriksen (left) took just seven minutes to get Tottenham off the mark with a superb direct free kick . Pochettino had Hugo Lloris to thank for keeping the gap at two. Victor Anichebe broke at speed and passed to James Morrison, who bent a brilliant shot that was heading for the top corner until Lloris stretched a hand to tip over. Soon afterwards, a free-kick routine involving six West Brom players saw Berahino eventually cut back for Yacob to strike. Again Lloris reacted sharply. Craig Dawson rattled the bar four minutes before the interval, meeting Morrison’s deep free-kick with a fine header, and it appeared West Brom would make a fist of a comeback in the second period. It was not to be. In the 64th minute referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot after Kyle Walker’s cross hit Joleon Lescott on the arm. Kane stepped up and sent his penalty just inside the left-side post at pace. Pochettino said the top four was within reach for his team. ‘If we perform like today, then maybe — we need to be consistent,’ he said. He also stressed he wanted Kane to sign a new contract. ‘Harry wants to stay at Tottenham and Tottenham want Harry to stay a long time.’ The away fans went through their repertoire of songs as the match wore on. The hosts were neutralised and their fans started slinking out well before the final 10 minutes. Pulis said: ‘We started sloppy and gave the ball away too much. This week’s been difficult. I’ve been busy. I’ll be happy as long as we’ve brought in a few players.’ West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster could do nothing about the strike as the ball flew into his net .

"Final plans for a new reversible USB cable were announced last week. But now it appears that Apple is going a step further, with rumours that its Lightning cable will be reversible at both ends. New photos that have emerged of the cable show it has a 'floating' centre. The new photo suggests that Apple’s Lightning cable is set to become even easier to use because it will be reversible at both ends. Sonny Dickson's image hints that Apple's next cable will have a reversible USB port (pictured right), with a floating centre instead of fixed pins (plug pictured left) Apple tipsterSonny Dickson, based in Melbourne, Australia, has shared a photo that suggests the new Lightning Cable is completely reversible at both ends, so the frustration of jabbing at USB ports blindly to insert cables may be over. Just like the USB 3.1 Type-C connector, Apple's new cable will reportedly feature a reversible USB port that will plug into computers more easily, and it could be available as soon as next month. The picture suggests that the cable has a 'floating' centre, instead of pins fixed down one side, so it can be inserted into a USB port either way . Experts say that the cable will use USB 3.0 technology – an improvement on the current cable’s USB 2.0. Last week, the USB Promoter Group unveiled its Type-C plug (pictured) which is reversible and slimmer than previous standards. No release date was announced, but Apple's Lightning connector - which is rumoured to boast a reversible USB port too - could be launched as soon as next month along with the iPhone 6 . Apple launched its Lightning cable alongside the iPhone 5 in 2012 and it was the first charging cable that could be plugged into a smartphone or tablet either way up. It is thought that the new cables might accompany the iPhone 6, which is set to launch on September 9. The USB Type-C connector is a completely new design. It has been created for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks. It claims to be robust enough for laptops and slim enough for smartphones. It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current 2.0 Micro USB. Crucially, it will be reversible, meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in. But Apple's next generation Lightning cable could be reversible at both ends. It might also launch sooner than the Type-C. A USB 3.0 cable would support HD audio, which means that Apple’s earphones could be upgraded and connect through the iPhone's lightning port instead of a standard headphone jack, MacRumours reported. Apple rolled out Lightning cable MFi specifications for headphones in June, which could mean that manufacturers are creating headphones and other devices that can connect to the iPhone 6 via its charging port. With the launch of the highly-anticipated iPhone 6 on the horizon, rumours are circulating about its individual features. The latest model is expected to come in two sizes – with one measuring 4.7 inches corner-to-corner and a larger 5.5 inch version. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera – possibly with changeable lenses – and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5.","Photo showing reversible USB came from Apple tipster Sonny Dickson .

"West Bromwich Albion have revived their interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher after his move to West Ham collapsed. Fletcher, 30, was poised to sign for the Upton Park club after travelling to London on Friday to undergo a medical and discuss terms. Darren Fletcher's move to West Ham fell through after he failed to agree personal terms . Louis van Gaal confirmed after the Leicester win that Fletcher's move had collapsed . However, after further talks, West Ham then tried to make the transfer a loan rather than a permanent deal and Fletcher and United pulled the plug. United had agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer. Manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement. 'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.' Fletcher challenges for possession with Yeovil's Joseph Edwards during the FA Cup tie earlier this month . Fletcher was due to sign a two and a half year deal worth around £60,000 a week. Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season. Fletcher's expected arrival had raised questions over the future of West Ham midfielder Mark Noble with QPR and West Brom showing an interest in the 27-year-old. Noble is out of contract in the summer but has a two year option which if triggered raises his salary to £50,000 a week. West Ham will still consider other short term loan options to provide cover. Speaking after their's 2-0 defeat at Liverpool, manager Sam Allardyce confirmed the Fletcher deal had stalled: . Fletcher (right) is pictured alongside former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as a young child . 'Fletcher broke down on negotiations this morning,' he said. 'I really don't know (what will happen) at this moment in time.' United boss Van Gaal added: 'He is my third captain so it is not a problem for me (if he comes back). Manchester United just want to help him play more. For him now that is a big pity. 'We want to help Fletcher. That is my only concern. I am very happy he is coming back.' Albion moved to make way for Fletcher by opening talks with Burnley over the proposed sale of Graham Dorrans for around £3million. Manager Tony Pulis also has an interest in Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue.","Darren Fletcher looked set to leave Manchester United and join West Ham .

"A heart-rending film about a young father’s battle with motor neurone disease and the letter he struggled to write to his two-year-old son in his last months is to be released later this month. 'I Am Breathing' documents the last months of former architect Neil Platt’s life. Viewers are given an insight into how the disease ravaged his body but the docufilm also celebrates the 34-year-old's indomitable spirit. Neil documented his rapid and steady decline to raise awareness of the neurological disease so a cure could be found as soon as possible - and hopefully before his son, who is also at risk of developing the deadly condition, grows up. Scroll down for the trailer . Neil Platt is pictured with his baby son Oscar in September 2007, just five months before his diagnosis of motor neurone disease. Neil died 12 months later . Neil was diagnosed with MND in February 2008. Months before, he had noticed that his foot was slapping against the ground when he walked. He grew increasingly concerned that he was developing the same condition that had killed his father when he was 51, and his grandfather at 64. Neil underwent a raft of tests and all the results came back clear, but Neil knew that his symptoms were not normal. Eventually he was referred to a neurologist who, taking his family history into account, broke the shattering news to the new father. It is not possible to test for MND specifically - it is only diagnosed after a process of elimination. Over the following few months, the illness took over Neil’s body with unrelenting speed. Neil and Louise married in 2004 aged 29 after a whirlwind romance. They had known each other at university but did not become a couple until a chance meeting at a party after they had both graduated . The speed that the disease took over Neil's body was staggering. Neil is pictured with his then two-year-old son Oscar -  just 9 months after his diagnosis and three months before his death . MND is a terminal illness that  kills . the motor neurones - the nerve cells that send messages to the muscles . so the body can move. There . are 5,000 people living with motor neurone disease in the UK at any one . time, but it’s unusual for it to strike in under-40s; most people . diagnosed are between 50 and 70. The patient eventually becomes . entirely paralysed - unable to move, talk, swallow or breathe, but still . able to see, hear and feel. In most cases there is no obvious cause - . around ten per cent of cases are genetic. Life expectancy is usually . six months to five years and the only licensed treatment is the drug . riluzole, which can slow the progression of the disease, but only for up . to six months. More than £300 million is spent annually on cancer research in . the UK, the average annual spending on MND research is £2 million. He quickly lost the use of his hands and legs and the couple were forced to move from south London to North Yorkshire to be close to Neil’s family who could help care for him. By Oscar’s first birthday, Neil had lost the use of his entire upper body and required a ventilator to push air into his lungs because their capacity had plummeted to just 30 per cent. He was also forced to give up work because not only had his hands stopped working but the ventilator meant his voice recognition software - provided by his employers so he could still do the job he loved - did not work. His wife Louise said that one of the . cruellest reminders of her situation was that as Oscar became more independent, Neil became less so. She said at the time: 'Life seems to work in . cruel way: the week Oscar picked up his spoon to feed himself, I had to . start feeding Neil because he could no longer lift a fork.’ I Am Breathing follows Neil's final months, unable to move without the help of family, friends and a specially-installed winch. While . he still has the ability to speak he reflects on his tragic situation . and, with the help of his wife, puts together a letter and memory box . for his son Oscar. Neil (pictured shortly after the birth of Oscar) noticed that his foot started to slap against the floor when he walked. He was concerned he was developing the same condition that killed his father and grandfather . Neil (pictured with son Oscar after his diagnosis in 2008) was desperate to make sure his son had an idea of who his father was. During Neil's final months he wrote a letter - eventually using voice typing - and filled a box with sentimental objects . Neil is pictured a few months after his diagnosis with wife Louise whilst on holiday in Menorca 2008 . 'I Am Breathing' is a brutally honest account of how motor neurone disease ravages a man and his family. Neil wanted people to know how cruel the disease is and raise awareness and money . Neil remains cheerful and is incredibly witty throughout the film, but he admits he is angry inside. ‘I’m trying to channel [my] anger into raising awareness of this terrible disease. We need . money for more research so a cure can be found. Then there will be no . need for patients facing this to have to even consider assisted . suicide,’ he said. Viewers learn that Neil has made plans to have his ventilator removed when he cannot speak or swallow for himself. He said he could not understand how he would be of any benefit to his wife or son if he were unable to move or express himself. The 11-page letter he struggles to write using new voice-recognition software . - his lips are steadily losing the ability to form words - shares . stories and anecdotes about his life, such as a section explaining how . he and his mother fell in love. The film shows Neil both while he has the disease and before (pictured). We learn that he loved music, mountain walking, music and had a passion for motorcycles . He and Louise met and became friends at . Edinburgh, where both were students, but lost touch until they attended a . mutual friend’s party in London when they were 29. By then, both were working in London - he as an architect, she as a costume designer for film and TV. Within three months of being reunited, the couple were engaged. They married in November 2004 and . were keen to start a family. Louise knew about the high likelihood of the disease affecting Neil . before they wed. Inside the large wooden memory box . there is a watch engraved with Oscar’s name that Neil’s mother gave him . when Oscar was born, his favourite hat, a Zippo lighter, toys he played . with as a child, and his favourite leather jacket. 'I Am Breathing' shows how Neil's close circle of friends were there to help, comfort and laugh with the former architect as his health rapidly deteriorated . Neil tries to anticipate what Oscar . might want to know about his father in a future and tells the story of . his life from his memories and impressions of love, friends and . motorbike rides. In the film Neil is still keen to be a father to Oscar, despite his profound disability. Oscar sits . on his father’s lap and wraps Neil’s arms around him - it’s the nearest . Neil can get to giving his son a cuddle. ‘I take off my mask for a few . seconds and he gives me a huge smile,’ says Neil. ‘It’s wonderful.’ MND is a terminal illness that kills . the body's motor neurones - the nerve cells that send messages to the . muscles so the body can move. A patient's mental capacity and senses . remain entirely undamaged however and, explains Neil, this can be one of . the the hardest aspects of the disease to deal with. Neil (pictured, left, on his honeymoon in Sri lanka in 2004) knew there was a family link to motor neurone disease but had hoped that if he did develop it, it would affect him when he was older . In the film he says that a . simple itch can be incredibly infuriating and agonising because you . don't have the power relieve the . discomfort. There are 5,000 people living with . MND in the UK at any one time, but it’s unusual for it to strike people . under 40. Most people diagnosed are between 50 and 70. The . patient eventually becomes entirely paralysed - unable to move, talk, . swallow or breathe, but still able to see, hear and feel. In most cases there is no obvious cause - around ten per cent of cases are genetic. Neil (pictured before his diagnosis) was outgoing and sociable before his devastating diagnosis in 2008. He remained cheerful and very witty throughout his last months . Neil (pictured in 2005) died in February 2009 . Life expectancy is usually six months . to five years and the only licensed treatment is the drug riluzole, . which can slow the progression of the disease, but only for up to six . months. Shortly after his diagnosis he said in . an interview: ‘Every new disability brings a terrible sense of . disappointment. When Oscar played in the snow for the first time . recently, I’d have given anything to help him build a snowman. Instead, . all I could do was watch. It was heartbreaking. 'But just the other day, he climbed . up my chest, gently removed my ventilator mask and kissed me, then . replaced the mask so I could breathe. Moments like that make life still . worth living.’ Neurologists cannot confirm if Oscar will develop the illness, despite the strong family link. The film ends with Neil's death. Although his death is not captured on film, viewers watch his final days and one of the moments that he realises that 'time is being called at the pub', as he puts it. 'I Am Breathing' will be screened internationally on June 21, MND Global Awareness Day, which will launch the UK cinema release. Half of the screening funds will go to MND Association and 50% will go into development.","Neil Platt was diagnosed with the degenerative condition in 2008 aged 34 .

"An NYPD cop being sued for sexual harassment by a former colleague has hit back, claiming the alleged victim was a willing participant who sent him sexy selfies and gave him oral pleasure in their police precinct. Sgt. David John says Ann Cardenas sent him sizzling pictures, one of which shows the 29-year-old in a cleavage popping cat woman costume, during the two years they worked together at Brooklyn's 83rd Precinct. He claims her allegations are all a . scam to get cash and now plans to sue the city for $35 million to . compensate for his apparently ruined reputation. But Cardenas' account are now being backed up by four other officers at the station-house, one of whom called John a 'manipulative, sick pervert' who created a 'hostile work environment for his staff.' Meow: Sgt. David John says Ann Cardenas sent him sizzling pictures, including this one showing her in a cleavage popping cat woman costume . 'I thought I was surrounded by friends and now I feel like Julius Caesar. They stabbed me in the back,' John, a 20-year NYPD veteran, told the New York Daily News. His lawyer, Eric Sanders, described Cardenas as 'Poison Ivy' for her ability to reel men in and then 'kill,' and said he was intent on getting justice for his hard-done-by client. 'It's obvious she wasn't a victim,' Sanders told MailOnline. 'Look at the pictures, it's common sense. 'She's spanking his butt and sending him sexy cat pictures.' The officer and other cops serving under John, 41, say the boss created a 'hostile work environment. One, Peter Szumillo, described him to the Daily News as a 'manipulative, sick pervert' who regularly punched him in the chest for no reason and groped his private parts. But John and Sanders believe the cops are simply out to make a buck from the lawsuit. 'They're putting it together to make money. They're schemers,' Sanders told MailOnline. Ouch: This picture John supplied appears to show Cardenas spanking his behind and laughing . Conflicting account: Cardenas, right, and other cops serving under John, left, say the boss created a 'hostile work environment' that was more like a frathouse . He added: 'These scheming opportunists make it less likely that real sexual harassment victims get justice.' John has been placed on modified duty as the Internal Affairs Bureau and the Brooklyn district attorney's office investigate the claims. Sanders said he's fighting to get back his guns after they were stripped, forcing him to lose out on a chance for a security job he had in the offing following his retirement from the force. Sanders admits that his client wasn't entirely innocent, however, though his mistake was failing to keep his staff at arms length rather than sexual harassment. 'He didn't follow his training, he got along too well with the troops. He may have been a poor supervisor but he wasn't a sexual harasser,' he said. He said the female officer engaged in the locker-room antics like one of the guys and was intimate with her boss on about 10 occasions in an arrest processing room in the station-house before turning on him. Counter claim: John, right, is planning to sue the city for $35 million after his guns were stripped, forcing him to lose out on the chance of another job. Cardenas is shown left . 'She's a man eater, she uses men,' Sanders said. 'I want her job and those of the other complainants and I want city to compensate him because his reputation is ruined, his livelihood is ruined. 'I'm going to destroy her because they destroyed that man his reputation.' But Cardenas' lawyer, Linda Cronin, has quashed John's claims, insisting her client was the victim. 'She was a victim of his aggression and intimidation and there are witnesses and evidence to support that,' Cronin told the Daily News. 'Any physical contact that there may have been (between Cardenas and John) was forcible.' Cardenas' claims she was repeatedly groped and grinded against by the 300 pound sergeant who nicknamed her his 'work p****' in the discrimination suit filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the state Human Rights Division. She says the 41-year-old showed her photos of his penis and crudely told her he wanted to have sex with her as well as rubbing himself against her while grunting. Alleged harassment: Ann Cardenas, 29, has accused Sgt. David John of sexually abusing and harassing her at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick, Brooklyn, pictured . The Brooklyn district attorney's office and the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau are also investigating the claims, which Cronin earlier described as the worst sexual harassment case she's seen. 'There was a frathouse culture in the precinct that was beyond the pale,' she told the New York Daily News. The six-year force veteran describes an occasion in the summer of 2013 when she was sitting on a couch in the precinct and Sgt. John 'grabbed me, threw me down and held me down while trying to kiss me.' The January EEOC complaint continues, 'He then climbed on top of me and would not let me up.' The harassment allegedly went on for more than a year. 'He also showed me pictures of his penis and asked, ""Is this big? It's bigger than your boyfriend's.""' In the complaint she alleged the harassment regularly took place in front of other officers. 'Sgt. John often pulls his pants down in front of me,' she claims. 'He often sleeps in the office with his belt undone, and then will pull his pants down, grab his groin and say, ""Ann, hold this for me.""'","NYPD Sgt.

"With its mustard yellow tassel detailing and textured orange top, the European President's unique piece of head-ware is more lamp shade than fashion statement.

"Education: Calls have been made for Primary School pupils to be taught about pornography . Children as young as 11 are becoming addicted to internet pornography giving them 'unrealistic expectations' of sex, according to new research. It is now 'common practice' for schoolchildren to access hard core pornography at an early age and become desensitised to sexual images. A study, published by Plymouth University, said that more children are finding themselves 'hooked' on internet porn before they become sexually active, leading to problems in later life. The news comes as a teaching union said yesterday that children as young as ten should learn about pornography as part of the national curriculum. The National Association of Headteachers said primary school teachers needed to respond to the fact that children were now getting a large amount of their information about sex from the internet. They said sex education guidelines are hopelessly out of date and cannot cope with the ‘overtly sexualised world’ in which children are now growing up. But many family campaigners will argue that teaching children about pornography could actually make the situation worse, because children could be introduced to the concept for the first time. Campaigners say the easy access of porn online is harming children, and the NSPCC says they have seen an upsurge in calls from teenagers upset by what they have seen. However, another teaching union – the National Union of Teachers – said it was too early to start teaching children about porn at primary school. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on web porn, with adults having to opt in if they want to access it. In an interview with BBC Radio 1’s Newsbeat programme, NAHT policy adviser Sion Humphreys said teachers should hold lessons on the ‘impact of pornography’. ‘Children are growing up in an overtly sexualised world,’ he said. ‘That includes easy access to porn and they need the skills to deal with it. ‘We . would support children being taught in an age-appropriate way about the . impact of pornography as part of a statutory Personal Social Health . Education programme.’ Time for change: The National Association of Headteachers argue that pupils need to be taught about porn from the age of 10 because information is so easily accessible online . Mr Humphreys said that lessons could start from primary school but that the material would depend on age. ‘Evidence suggests ten isn’t too . young to start lessons on pornography, but it wouldn’t be a full-on . lesson but the grounding would be laid down,’ he said. At the moment, PSHE, which includes sex and relationships education, is not compulsory in England, unlike other parts of the UK. Biological . facts are part of all lessons in secondary school science lessons. Beyond that parents have the right to withdraw their children from any . sex education. The National Union of Teachers however disagreed with their union colleagues. They told the BBC that referring to issues of porn in lessons is a step too far, and that schools should only talk about it if asked by students. But Leonie Hodge, from the charity Family Lives, said it was vital children learned about porn. She said that at a time when 90 per cent of children own a smartphone, it is no longer relevant to talk about ‘making a baby’. She said: ‘Teenagers are bombarded with pornography from a young age; you can’t escape it. It’s patronising to say they can’t cope with the lesson because they can.’ Siobhan Freegard, founder of website Netmums, said mothers frequently panic when they come across porn on a computer at home and would welcome support from schools. She said: ‘It can be a minefield. Many don’t know what to do or say. For example a single mother may struggle with teenage boys, a single father may not know how to approach the subject with his daughter. ‘In very traditional households, they might not even talk about sex at all. The ideal solution is for schools and parents to work together.’ The Department of Education would not comment on the NAHT’s suggestion, but told Newsbeat that it is up to individual schools on how they teach sex education.","Children are being given 'unrealistic expectations of sex' through porn .

"Ukip is trying to stop a comedy band from touring, despite Nigel Farage saying politicians should ‘let people tell their jokes’. Musical duo Jonny and The Baptists have taken their show The Stop Ukip Tour on the road, but venues have been bombarded with complaints from Ukip supporters. And the party’s deputy leader Paul Nuttal has condemned the ‘distasteful satire’, calling on the Arts Council to investigate funding given to theatres hosting the act. Comedy act Jonny And The Baptists are on the road with the Stop Ukip Tour, to the annoyance of Ukip supporters . The bizarre attempt to interfere with a comedy act appears to be at odds with Ukip’s strident attacks on political correctness and the fear of giving offence. Last week Mr Farage defended a stand-up comic who told a string of jokes targeting foreigners at the Ukip spring conference. But it has emerged the party has tried to prevent the Jonny And The Baptists shows going ahead. The group’s song about Ukip suggests the party believes all Eastern Europeans ‘live off benefits and won't let us watch Jim Davidson' and wants 'the Queen's jubilee [to] be every day', the website Chortle reported. However writing on the Ukip website, Mr Nuttall said: ‘Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and UKIP is very much the party of free speech but I think it is wrong that taxpayers money is being used to back this production,"" explained Mr Nuttall. Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall has condemned the act as 'distasteful satire' ‘It does, of course, show just how much left wing supporters are getting extremely worried about the growing success of UKIP. We wouldn't be under attack from these musical comedians unless we were proving a threat to the established order. ‘This blatantly party political rubbish is being staged to coincide with the run-up to the Euro elections in May and I am appalled that one of the venues in the much lauded Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. I would have hoped they had higher standards than giving this show house room. ‘I have written to the Arts Council about this matter and also the Royal Exchange expressing my views about this distasteful satire.’ However, one of the venues targeted by complaints says it has no record of the people who claim to be loyal customers offended by the booking. The Royal Exchange in Manchester said: ‘We've never had as many complaints about a show. ‘We had calls from people saying they were loyal customers and they come a lot but when we checked their names in our database they've never bought a ticket before. I think it was kind of to give us the scares.' Lead singer Jonny Donahoe insisted his group has not received Arts Council money. ‘They might be involved in a small way with some of those venues but that's a very different thing. We're a comedy group. I've never heard of anyone getting a comedy grant.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage has previously defended the right of comedians to tell whatever jokes they want . At the Ukip spring conference last week comedian Paul Eastwood sparked controversy with jokes at a gala dinner about Polish people, a Muslim butcher and Somali pirates. Defending the act, Mr Farage said: ‘I'm not going to comment on individual jokes, but I think we're in huge danger here. This was a guy telling jokes about national stereotypes, not racial stereotypes. ‘We are heading down a road here where we would kill all humour in this country if we tear things to pieces. ‘Enough is enough, let people tell their jokes. If what they say is inappropriate they won't earn a living because they won't get booked again.’","Musical duo Jonny and The Baptists on the road with the Stop Ukip Tour .

"Stand-in boss: Aman Dalvi was paid £2,500-a-day - before receiving another colossal payout when his post was axed just six weeks later . A stand-in council boss was paid £2,500-a-day - before receiving another colossal payout when his post was axed just six weeks later. Aman Dalvi was drafted in as temporary . chief executive of Tower Hamlets Borough Council in east London last year as councillors debated whether to scrap the role. He earned a staggering £115,000 for only 46 days in charge of the authority. Mr Dalvi then sued the council when he realised it had decided to axe the post in a bid to trim its £1.2billion annual budget. The authority - which must find £100million in savings over the next three years - paid him another huge sum to avoid an employment tribunal - taking his total payout to a staggering £256,000. Local government minister Brandon Lewis has branded the council's decision an 'outrageous waste of taxpayers' money'. 'The fact that the chief executive of Tower Hamlets can be paid more in two weeks than the average household in the borough earns in a year is astounding,' he said. 'Paying a council official the same rate as a Premiership footballer is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money.' The average household income in the borough is less than £30,000, according to a council report. Position: Mr Dalvi was drafted in as temporary chief executive of Tower Hamlets Borough Council (pictured) in east London last year as councillors debated whether to scrap the role . Mr Dalvi, . who was paid for both his role as interim chief executive and an 'out . of court legal settlement', is believed to have sued the council after . failing to land a permanent job as council boss. The former chief executive Kevan Collins left the position in July 2011. A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Borough Council said: 'The council has complied with its statutory requirements in the preparation and publication of the annual accounts.' Mr Dalvi, who now earns £119-a-year as the corporate director for development and renewal at the council, was unavailable for comment.","Aman Dalvi was drafted in as temporary chief executive of Tower Hamlets Borough Council in east London .

"A sex-obsessed doctor has had his license suspended after he was accused of a series of bizarre acts while on duty. Dr Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' included using medical images for sexual gratification and having sexual encounters at his workplace, it is claimed. The anesthesiologist, from Seattle, Washington, also allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient. The charges said some of the pictures were 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals'. Scroll down for video . Dr Arthur Zilberstein had a 'preoccupation with sexual matters', Washington state health authorities said . Washington state health authorities said 47-year-old Zilberstein repeatedly compromised patient safety between at least April 2013 and August 2013. Authorities accused Zilberstein, who has been in practice since 1995, of issuing at least 29 unauthorized prescriptions for controlled substances and other drugs. The charges, filed with the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission, also allege that Zilberstein prescribed unauthorized narcotics to a female patient he had sex with, NBC News reported. On one day alone, June 17, 2013, he is accused of sending 64 texts, many just minutes apart, during seven surgeries, many of which had sexual innuendos. One read: 'I'm hella busy with C sections.' Another read: 'Oh. And my partner walked in as I was pulling up my scrubs. I'm pretty sure he caught me.' Dr Arthur Zilberstein is accused of sending pictures 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals' Swedish Medical Centre in Seattle, where Arthur Zilberstein worked, has suspended him . The charges state: 'Respondent's lack of focus on patient care while providing anesthesia services for hospital-based surgical procedures routinely fell below the standard of care and put patients at unreasonable risk of harm.' Zilberstein also demonstrated 'moral turpitude' that reflected badly on the medical profession. Zilberstein cannot practice until the charges are resolved, health officials said. He has 20 days to respond to the charges and request a hearing, officials said. He was contracted through Physicians Anesthesia Services with Swedish Medical Center to provide care, NBC News reported. Hospital spokesman Clay Holtzman said: 'The safety of our patients is our number one priority. Once we learned that the state had suspended this physician's medical license, the physician's medical staff membership and privileges were immediately suspended. 'We just recently learned of these allegations and are conducting our own internal review of the physician, who is not directly employed by Swedish.'","Dr Arthur Zilberstein had a 'preoccupation with sexual matters'

"A British housewife and her husband have been accused of  spying for Iran in a leaked US  government report. Anne Singleton, 53, is alleged to have been blackmailed into training with the Iranian secret service  during a visit to Tehran in 2002. The Pentagon-commissioned report claims that Mrs Singleton and her Iranian husband, Massoud Khodabandeh, 56, agreed to work for the regime in return for saving the life of his jailed brother. The entrance to Camp Ashraf, the Iraq-based Iranian opposition group People's Mujahedeen (MEK) where Anne Singleton says she once trained to fire weapons . Iranian agents are also said to  have threatened to confiscate his mother’s extensive property in the Iranian capital. Mrs Singleton strenuously denies the allegations. The report, written by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress and privately circulated in Washington, says the couple agreed to spy on opponents of the Iranian regime, including the People’s Mujahideen of Iran (MEK), of which Mrs Singleton and her husband were once members. The report alleges that: ‘In 2002 Singleton met in Tehran with Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of the Islamic Republic of Iran [MOIS] agents who were interested in her background. She agreed to co-operate with them to save her brother-in-law’s life.’ It adds: ‘During her stay in Tehran, she received training from MOIS. After her return to England, she launched the iran-interlink.org website in the winter of 2002. ‘Afterwards, she made many trips to Iran and Singapore – the country where the agency contacts its foreign agents.’ Iran sponsors terrorism all over the world and last year was behind a bus bombing in Bulgaria. As tension between the West and Iran increases over Tehran’s nuclear programme, British security agencies are keeping a watch on MOIS activities. Last year Iran was forced to downgrade its diplomatic presence in  the UK after the British Embassy  in Tehran was attacked. Since then it has struggled to secure intelligence on dissident groups. Security sources said last night that the Iranian regime relies on agents in the West to spy on dissidents and conduct propaganda operations to discredit opponents. Last night the couple, who run a Middle East communications company from their Victorian semi-detached home in Leeds, threatened to take legal action over the claims. Lord Alex Carlile QC, an expert on Iran, has said the People¿s Mujahideen of Iran is a 'credible opposition' party and should be removed from a list of banned terrorist organisations . Mrs Singleton, a mother of one, said: ‘The report was withdrawn. It wasn’t published anyway. It was leaked deliberately by a journalist in America.’ She added: ‘The MEK just made all that up. Yes, I have been to Iran, but they have concocted a picture which is entirely false.’ David Osborne, chief of the Federal Research Division which compiled the report, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The report was revised on the Division’s own initiative and  resubmitted to the Pentagon. I do not know when it will be reposted to the US government site.’ By her own admission, Mrs Singleton once belonged to the MEK and was trained at its camp in Iraq to fire weapons. She later fell out with the group, describing it as a cult. The couple were also named in a 2007 report by the British Parliamentary Committee for Iran Freedom called Spying For The Mullahs: Iran’s Agents In The UK. The report said: ‘Khodabandeh and Singleton appear to lead a small number of individuals in an aggressive demonisation campaign against the MEK.’ Lord Carlile QC, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and a member of the Parliamentary Committee for Iran Freedom, has lobbied to have the People’s Mujahideen of Iran  removed from a list of banned terrorist organisations. ‘They are a credible opposition to the regime,’ he said. ‘To call them a cult is like saying that any political party is a cult.’","Anne Singleton and her husband Massoud Khodabandeh are accused by the US of spying for Iran .

"A genuine bottle of La Tache Romanee Conti 1995, similar to one of the forgeries . British wine connoisseurs have been buying fake bottles of vintage French wine costing up to £7,000 a bottle, it emerged today. The gigantic fraud not only sheds light on the vast trade in counterfeit luxury produce, but highlights how little some self-styled ‘experts’ really know about wine. It was exposed thanks to a Europe-wide investigation by specialist officers working for six different police forces. They found that a so far unnamed Italian father and son were producing counterfeit bottles of Romanee-Conti, a Burgundy Pinot Noire. The 1931 edition of The Great Wines Of France by Paul Ramain describes the upmarket beverage as 'one of the greatest wines of the world and the most perfect as well as the most expensive of Burgundy.' It goes on to describe a ‘forceful bouquet of violet mixed with a scent of cherry, a lively and profound ruby robe, a suaveness of exceptional finesse.’ But the counterfeiters still managed to make more than £1.8 million selling their fake produce across Europe, including the UK. Investigators said the design on bottles were ‘near perfect’ and that many customers were clearly fooled. But last year the Burgundy estate, which has been producing the wine for centuries, reported a number of fake bottles to police. Expensive wines are often seen as an easily attainable status symbol for the newly wealthy . The label is legally protected in France as an AOC, which means ‘controlled designation of origin’. Romanee-Conti is often named ‘one of the greatest wines in the world’. Its Burgundy vineyard is protected under French law to ensure no other wine can use the name, and Romanée-Conti has been given the highest level of quality classification – labelled a grand cru. Only about four acres of vineyard are used which yield just 3,500 bottles  a year, making the wine highly exclusive. Earlier this year, three bottles of the 1990 vintage were sold at auction for just over £42,000, making it officially the most expensive Burgundy in the world. In 2010, the vineyard was threatened with destruction by poisoners who demanded €1million (£850,000). The extortion  attempt failed. Enquiries across Europe found up to 400 bottles, although there are suspicions that many more could have been sold and drunk. Prosecutors supported by police from Dijon first opened an investigation for ‘organised fraud’ in March, and it now involves five other forces. The two Italians were arrested in their home country last week, and an application has been made to extradite them to France, where they are likely to face trial. Dijon prosecutor Marie-Christine Tarrare said: ‘Other suspects are being sought so that we can present this entire counterfeiting network in evidence.’ High end wines are sold to a variety of customers, but experts have noted that many buy them as prestige items, without really knowing much about them. There have been reported incidents of Russian oligarch parties at which vintage wine is served with cans of Coke, for example. Romanee-Conti, which was described by the the Archbishop of Paris in 1780 as  ‘velvet and satin in bottles', has become a status symbol for many who have newly acquired fortunes.","Italian father and son were producing counterfeit bottles .

"A new recording of Donald Sterling has been released by a friend of the disgraced Clippers owner and he is heard declaring that he is not a racist. 'You think I’m a racist? You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don’t think that! You know I’m not a racist!' Sterling is heard saying to his unidentified friend. 'I mean, how could you think I’m a racist knowing me all these years? On tape, again: A longtime friend of Donald Sterling released a second 'surreptitiously' recorded call where Sterling is heard sounding off about the scandal and how he will not sell his team . 'How can you be in this business and be a racist? Do you think I tell the coach to get white players? Or to get the best player he can get?' The tape was released to Radar Online and the friend signed an affidavit saying that Sterling is the other voice on the recording. 'I grew up in East L.A.... I was the president of the high school there. I mean, and I’m a Jew! And 50 per cent of the people there were black and 40 per cent were Hispanic,' Sterling says. 'So I mean, people must have a good feeling for me.' Under investigation: Donald Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly (pictured in 2011) have both previously been cited in old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants and now she is reportedly being investigated by the NBA . Scandal: Sterling's problems started when a secretly-recorded phone call with his girlfriend V. Stiviano (left) was released and he was heard complaining that she wanted to post photos of herself with Magic Johnson . Sterling talks about the scandal and specifically references the Instagram photo of his girlfriend V. Stiviano and Magic Johnson that reportedly prompted his backlash during a recorded call with her. 'It breaks my heart that Magic Johnson, a guy that I respect so much, wouldn’t stand up and say, ""Well let’s get the facts. Let’s get him and talk to him."" Nobody tried. Nobody!' If the recording is real, it would be the first time that Sterling has been heard from since he was banned from the NBA for life following the first recording of his conversation with V. Stiviano. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he hopes that the league's board of governors will vote to force Sterling to sell the LA basketball team that he has owned since 1981, but in this latest recording, Sterling made it clear that he does not intend to go without a fight. Ban: In April NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (pictured) announced a lifetime suspension and a $2.5million fine for Donald Sterling after audio recordings of him making racist comments came to light . 'You can’t force someone to sell property in America! I’m a lawyer, that’s my opinion,' Sterling said. In spite of his beliefs, the NBA is going ahead with their own process, as the advisory and finance committee held their second conference call in as many weeks in order to discuss their options and the timetable of a possible forced sale. Sterling has been banned from the NBA for life, is not allowed to have any role in the running of the Clippers nor attend any games or practices. The 'death sentence' came after tapes were released where Sterling was heard saying that he didn't want his mixed-race girlfriend to post photos showing that she was spending time with African Americans. The punishment, which also included a $2.5million fine, came after the NBA investigated and met with Sterling, but there are reports that his estranged wife Shelly Sterling is also being investigated because of some old discrimination lawsuits from former tenants who accused her of using racial slurs.","A 'longtime friend' recorded a call to Sterling after the NBA ban .

"Popstar Rihanna was asked to leave an Abu Dhabi mosque because she did not have permission for a photoshoot, it emerged today. Staff at Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque say they asked the singer to leave the compound after her actions were considered to be at odds with the 'sanctity' of the site. Photos posted on her Instagram account at the weekend show the 25-year-old posing on white marble wearing a head-to-toe hooded black jumpsuit. Order: Popstar Rihanna was asked to leave an Abu Dhabi mosque because she didn’t have permission for a photoshoot, according to reports . Spot the difference: Rihanna poses in her hijab as two local women walk past behind her . She is known for her raunchy outfits so the photoshoot was deemed conservative for the Bajan singer, although she made sure she had bright red lipstick and large gold accessories. But today it emerged that Rhianna and her team was not given permission to take photos at the mosque, the main place of worship for Friday gathering and Eid prayers. The . mosque, which is the largest in the UAE and can hold more than 40,000 people, released a statement, and although it does not name Rhianna, . it refers to a 'recent incident, involving a singer.' 'In the event of behaviour that violates . the moral codes of access to the mosque, or other visit regulations – . such as taking inappropriate pictures, posing in ways that are improper . in the context of sacred place, talking loudly, or eating – the . violators are directed in a polite manner that reflects the . civilisational and tolerant attributes of Islam,' the statement read. Still glamorous: The singer wore crimson lips and dark red fingernails, and added a statement gold necklace as she posed with a hoodie covering her head . Strike a pose: Rihanna made sure to turn her outing into a fashion shoot as she posed dramatically outside the Muslim place of worship . Fitting in: The singer paid heed to the dress requirements in the Middle Eastern city, where local women tend to cover up their bodies . 'Here, . the Centre refers to a recent incident, involving a singer who came for . a private visit to the mosque, at a gate that is not reserved for . visitors, without prior coordination with the Centre’s management and . without identifying herself,' it said reported The National. It . said the singer 'left without entering the mosque, after being asked to do so, due to the fact that she had taken some pictures that do not conform with the conditions and regulations put in place by the Centre’s management to regulate visits in a way that takes the status and sanctity of the mosque into consideration.' Many of her fans attacked the singer for the photos which have since appeared on websites across the world. 'Rihanna may look gorgeous and all but she’s covering her head out of fashion not out of respect for the mosque,' wrote one user. Sultry: Rihanna sat on the marbled floor outside the mosque at one point and pouted while looking into the distance . Is that entirely respectful? The singer takes a break on the floor . The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is the largest mosque in the UAE which can hold more than 40,000 people . Another tweeter, @Ahmedcarter, wrote: 'Rihanna pics at Sheikh Zayed mosque are disrespectful to the place of worship.' @BinttAlthee tweeted: 'Rihanna modelling in the Sheikh Zayed mosque is just plain wrong. Who let her in?' On Instagram user msloca89 wrote under a photo of the singer: 'This is very disrespectful even if she is covered she is not suppose to take photos in the mosque. I don't think you would like to see a naked person taking photos in a church as well.' While EmilyNovember wrote: 'Are these photos serious? I can't believe she is this wrapped up into her own 'looks' that she poses at a place like this. A place which represents the opposite of what she represents.' Cultural expert Ali Al Saloom, . the founder of AskAli.com, added: 'I feel disappointed that she shared . photos on Instagram that are inappropriate to the values of our religion . and our Arab tradition, which values modesty and respect to the most . important venue that has our father of the nation HH Sheikh Zayed’s . graveyard.

"Republican supporters led by secretive oil billionaires the Koch brothers have pledged to oust Barack Obama from power - by stumping up a $100million (£63million) war-chest. David and Charles Koch, worth a combined $50billion, have been joined by 300 of America's wealthiest businessmen in promising the cash to stop Obama from being re-elected. They met at the conservative brothers' annual three-day Californian retreat, where they gain pledges for non-profit groups that share their libertarian world view. Brotherly ambition: David (left) and Charles Koch (right) are rallying America's most powerful businesspeople to donate $100million to oust Barack Obama from the White House . But it is believed this is the first time the get-together has zoomed in one sole issue. Sources said an 'alpha-male' mentality of beating Obama at this year's election at all costs soon took over amongst the visitors. Charles, 76, will put up $40million from his personal fortune, while David, 71, has pledged $20million to the battle. As individuals can only donate $2,500 to a candidate, the $100million will almost certainly go to one of the independent Republican political action committees. Competition: Democrat Barack Obama (left) will most likely be challenged by Mitt Romney (right) in the 2012 after the Republican won the last two primaries . While they are supposed to be neutral, the committees usually ally themselves to a particular candidate and then use the money to support them. The brothers' Americans for Prosperity PAC has already spent $6.8million on adverts attacking the president. Barack Obama's campaign is returning $200,000 in contributions collected by the family members of a Mexican casino owner who fled the U.S. after facing drug and fraud charges. Obama's team said it would return donations arranged by Chicago brothers Carlos Cardona and Alberto Rojas Cardona - brothers of casino owner Juan Jose Rojas Cardona. He skipped bail in Iowa in 1994 and has since been linked to violence and corruption in Mexico. Campaign officials also said they would also return around $100,000 donated by other people connected to Cardona. Spokesman Ben LaBolt said: 'On the basis of the questions that have been raised, we will return the contributions from these individuals and from any other donors they brought to the campaign.' The pair have trodden a notoriously secretive path in amassing their wealth. But they started to gain more prominence when they helped launch the Tea Party movement. They are ranked at numbers 18 and 19 on the Forbes 100 Rich List, and have given more than $100million to right-wing causes. A total of $55million of that has gone in trying to discredit the science behind man-made climate change. The brothers are co-owners of energy giant Koch industries, the firm founded by their father Fred in 1940, and have since expanded the business to 2,600 times its inherited size. Initially involved in oil refining, the company is now one of the biggest firm in the country, producing well-known brands such as Stainmaster carpet, Lycra fiber, Quilted Northern tissue and Dixie paper. They have two other brothers, 78-year-old Fred and 71-year-old William, who were all involved in litigation against each other in the 1980s and 1990s. Obama raised $224.6million in 2011, more than the total gathered by all four of his Republican challengers. But sources said Las Vegas casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who has so far bankrolled Newt Gingrich for $10million, attended the event at the at the plush Renaissance Esmeralda resort, in California's India Wells, for the first time. And a group set up by George W Bush's former special adviser Karl Rove has also set a fundraising target of $200million for the election.","David and Charles Koch worth a combined $50billion .

"Stoke City forward Bojan Krkic has been handed a huge boost after it emerged he will be able to return to training in just over three months time. Initial scans indicated that he would be out of action for up to six months after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury in Stoke's 4-1 victory at Rochdale in the FA Cup. However, Sportsmail understands that subsequent tests have demonstrated that although the anterior cruciate ligament suffered damage, the meniscus and the two lateral ligaments have not been adversely affected. Bojan Krkic receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the Rochdale goal . Stoke forward Bojan is tended to by the club physio after injuring his knee against Rochdale . It is now understood that Krkic will be able to return to training in May and he is hoping to be in prime condition on the first day of pre-season. He will still miss the remainder of this campaign but fears that he may also be absent for the beginning of next season have been eased. He will now miss only three months of competitive action. The forward, who had been in outstanding form before suffering the injury, now requires a more minor operation than had been initially feared. Bojan, pictured celebrating after scoring the opener, is checked on by Marko Arnautovic after going down . Bojan celebrates the opening goal as Stoke took a firm grip on the FA Cup tie right from kick-off .

"It's been known for years that some Native Americans and Russians share ancestors, and new research claims to have confirmed this link by discovering they also share language traits. Scientists from Georgetown University used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to discover a direct link between the Na-Dene family of languages in North America, and the Yeniseian languages of . Central Siberia. Their findings also revealed the migration of people from central Asia to North America around 13,000 years ago may not have been a one-way trip - with some people returning home to Siberia, taking their language back with them. Scientists from Georgetown University used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to discover a link between the Na-Dene family of languages of North American tribes and the Yeniseian languages of Central Siberia. Stock illustration of an Apache Indian is pictured . In 2012, DNA research found genetic markers that linked people living in the Russian republic of Altai, southern Siberia, with indigenous populations in North America. Scientists believe that during an ice age between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago, inhabitants of Siberia crossed a stretch of land known as the Bering Land Bridge into North America. This stretch of land is now buried under the waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas. By studying mutations in the languages of these two regions, scientists found a lineage shift approximately 13,000 and 14,000 years ago - when the inhabitants are thought to have made this journey across the ice. However, because of the wide spread of languages, and the fact links still remain in Siberia, the researchers suggest some of these migrants returned home. This map shows the outlines of Siberia, left, and Alaska, right, with dashed lines. The broader area in darker green represents the Bering Land Bridge used by Siberians to travel into North America. The latest linguistic research, however, suggests some Siberians may have returned home, taking their language with them . An engraving showing Native Americans running, shooting arrows and throwing balls in Florida during the 1500s. Most Native Americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a 'land bridge' between Asia and America during the ice ages more than 15,000 years ago . To investigate this further, scientists used a technique originally created to investigate evolutionary relationships between biological species, called phylogenetic analysis. This involves creating a tree that represents relationships of common ancestry based on shared traits. The researchers used a linguistic version of this . phylogeny to discover around 40 languages that had diffused across . North America and Asia. They began by coding a linguistic data set . from each of the languages and establishing relationships between this data. They then . applied these links to the known migration patterns from Asia to North America. The people we know as Native Americans arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations. Most . Native Americans are descended from a small group of migrants that . crossed a 'land bridge' between Asia and America during the ice ages . 15,000 years ago. These migrants, known as the 'First Americans', populated most of North and South America. By . studying variations in Native American DNA sequences, a team of . scientists recently found that while most of the Native American . populations arose from the first migration, two subsequent migrations . also made important genetic contributions. The . second and third migrations have left an impact only in Arctic . populations that speak Eskimo-Aleut languages and in the Canadian . Chipewyan who speak a Na-Dene language. Eskimos show the most differences, with just 50 per cent of their DNA coming from the 'First Americans'. The findings highlight an early dispersal of Na-Dene along the North American coast with a Yeniseian back migration through Siberia. Study co-author Dr Mark Sicoli said: 'We found substantial support for the out-of-Beringia dispersal adding to a growing body of evidence for an ancestral population in Beringia before the land bridge was inundated by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age.' He added that although they cannot conclusively determine the migration pattern just from these results - and stated the study does not necessarily contradict the popular tale of hunters entering the New World through Beringia - it, at the very least, indicates migration may not have been a one-way trip. 'This work also helps demonstrate the usefulness of evolutionary modeling with linguistic trees for investigating these types of questions,' concluded Dr Sicoli. The research was published in the journal PLOS ONE.","Study used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to analyse languages .

"Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract to remain at White Hart Lane. The England Under 21 forward has firmly established himself in the Spurs line-up this season under Mauricio Pochettino. The deal sees the 21-year-old commit his future to the north London club until 2020 - on terms of £45,000 a week. Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract with the club . Kane has been tipped to be in Roy Hodgson's squad for England's upcoming March internationals . Age: 21 (D.O.B. 28.07.93) Born: Walthamstow, England . Clubs: Tottenham Hotspur (2009-), Leyton Orient (2011), Millwall (2012), Norwich City (loan, 2012-13, Leicester City (loan, 2013) Career goals: 41 . Goals this season: 20 (10 in Premier League) Kane has been in magnificent form this season, netting 20 goals in 33 appearances. In 19 Premier League appearances, Kane has scored 10 times - including twice during Spurs' 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Kane tweeted after signing the deal: 'Very happy to have signed my new contract at Spurs! Excited for the future ahead! Thank you for all your messages! #COYS.' He also told the Spurs website: 'It's been a great six months. I've been really pleased with how things have gone. This (contract) is another stepping stone and hopefully now I'll push on again from this and get even better. 'All you can do as a footballer is try to get better and better and that's what I aim to do, to get better, score more goals and play better for the team,' he added. 'I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season. Kane scores from the penalty spot during Spurs' 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday . 'I'm only 21 and I've a lot of football ahead of me. I'll keep my feet on the ground and keep working hard for the team and for the club. I've been at Spurs since I was 11 and always loved the club. I've been here 10 years now and hopefully there are many more good times to come.' Loan spells earlier in Kane's career at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City helped the forward hone his skills. However, this season Kane has become a mainstay of Pochettino's side - leapfrogging the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado in the pecking order. Kane holds his arms aloft after scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park earlier this month . In a statement released by Tottenham on their website, they said: 'The club is delighted to announce that Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract which runs until 2020. 'The young striker, still only 21, has been in outstanding form for us this season with 20 goals in all competitions, including a memorable double against Premier League leaders Chelsea at the Lane on New Year's Day. 'An academy graduate, Harry made his first-team debut against Hearts in the Europa League in August 2011 and made his big breakthrough last season when he scored on his first Premier League start for us against Sunderland in April - the first of three goals in consecutive league games. 'A Spurs fan born locally in Walthamstow, Harry has also impressed on international duty, having represented England at Under 17, 19 and 20 level, while his record for the Under 21 side currently stands at eight goals from 10 games.'

"Carl Froch will make an announcement on his future on Tuesday with the super-middleweight world champion likely to vacate his IBF title. Froch had hoped to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas next month but suffered an elbow injury in training. Should he vacate, James DeGale is expected to fight for the belt at the O2 Arena on April 25, with promoter Eddie Hearn keen to pit him against bitter rival George Groves. Carl Froch is set to vacate his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May .

Groves said via Sportlobster: 'Wow, Eddie Hearn can talk some waffle. James DeGale in a 50/50? 'I haven't lost a round in my last two fights. James stopped a fat out of shape dude who showed up with no trainer. When I box I sell out arenas or stadiums.

I'm happy to work hard for it, to gamble with it and to be patient with it. Make me a sensible offer.' Hearn responded on Twitter: 'James in a 50/50 split for a world title in London in spring or wait forever for 25 per cent of nothing in the US?'. Groves' trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick waded in to say: 'James could have 25 per cent of millions now or 50 per cent of not much vs Dirrell in a fight that doesn't sell.' Hearn's response seemed to confirm Froch would indeed be relinquishing his belt. He said: 'It sells and the split is not up to us Paddy it's a vacant title [so it's] 50/50.'

"Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has former driver Sebastian Vettel to thank for their 'camouflage car' in testing this week. The black-and-white livery design is visually refractive, ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car's aerodynamics. Horner has conceded the idea was spawned by Vettel's helmet design seen over the course of the Italian Grand Prix weekend last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Unleash the CamoBull. The RB11 takes to the track in Jerez . Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo drives the camouflage car during testing on Sunday at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain . Red Bull mechanics surround the livery designed car in the garage as Ricciardo waits to get out on the track on Sunday . The black-and-white livery design is visually refractive, ensuring rivals face a tough time trying to ascertain the car's aerodynamics. Although four-times champion Vettel has moved on to Ferrari, Horner said: 'Seb's helmet was quite fun, so we thought it would be interesting to extend that concept to the rest of the car. 'Dietrich (Mateschitz, owner) liked it when he saw it, and it epitomises Red Bull that we like to do things a bit differently. 'To see a Red Bull in a different livery is striking and it makes it difficult to get detailed photographs of the car, as it confuses the eyeline, at a time of year when we're all trying to be as secretive as we possibly can. 'But it's obviously had a great reaction. Team principal Christian Horner revealed the design of the test car was inspired by one of Sebastian Vettel's helmet designed last season . The design is meant to make it difficult for rivals to get detailed pictures of the car as they hope for secrecy during testing . Horner admitted the car is likely to return to its traditional colours for the first race of the but will feature a stronger livery design . 'It's been extremely well received.' Fans, in particular, are keen for Red Bull to run the livery over the course of the season. Horner has conceded that will not be the case, he added: 'The fans won't be disappointed because the livery will be even stronger.' There was little sign, however, of the car in action on the morning of the second day of the test at the Circuito de Jerez. That was due to the fact new recruit Daniil Kvyat, promoted from Toro Rosso to fill Vettel's shoes, damaged the one-and-only front-wing available to the team on an early installation lap. New Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat damaged the car's only front wing during the testing session on Sunday . The 20-year-old Russian driver has replaced Vettel for the 2015 season after being promoted from Toro Rosso . Despite lacking a spare, Kvyat still ran on track without a wing for a handful of laps before deciding to pit and wait for the new part to arrive from the factory in Milton Keynes. Horner said: 'Unfortunately Daniil very lightly touched the tyre wall with the front wing, causing damage. 'It's the only front-wing assembly we have in Jerez at the moment, which is relatively usual for this time of year when you are not abundant with spare parts. 'There are more components coming down later today, this evening and over the next two days. We'll certainly have a new front wing by tomorrow morning.'","Red Bull's test car at the Circuito de Jerez in Spain was emblazoned with a black and white livery pattern designed .

"Daniel Sturridge and his Liverpool team-mates were in jubilant mood as they took to a frosty Melwood training ground on Monday morning.

Liverpool duo Sturridge (left) and Ibe (right) took a second to pose for the cameras in between drills . It took the England star just 11 minutes to get himself back on the scoresheet for the first time since the opening game of the season after he replaced Lazar Markovic. Sturridge's timely return will be a huge boost for the Reds, who have struggled in front of goal since the striker suffered a thigh injury on international duty in September. Despite bringing in Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli over the summer, and recalling Fabio Borini from a season-long loan spell at Sunderland, the frontmen had managed just four Premier League goals this term.

"West Brom will step up their interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher following his failure to move to West Ham. Fletcher can commute from his Cheshire home, Joleon Lescott makes the same journey down the M6, and head coach Tony Pulis is keen to do business, preferably a deal until the end of the season with an option. Fletcher, 30, was poised to sign for the Upton Park club after travelling to London on Friday to undergo a medical and discuss terms. Darren Fletcher's move to West Ham fell through as the Londoners wanted to make it a loan . West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis (above) is keen to sign up Fletcher until the end of the season . However, after further talks, West Ham then tried to make the transfer a loan rather than a permanent deal and Fletcher and United pulled the plug. United had agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer. Manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement. 'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.' Louis van Gaal confirmed after the Leicester win that Fletcher's move had collapsed . Fletcher challenges for possession with Yeovil's Joseph Edwards during the FA Cup tie earlier this month . Fletcher was due to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal worth around £60,000 a week. Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season. Fletcher has made 342 appearances for Manchester United but the Scotland international has started just five times during Van Gaal's reign.","Darren Fletcher looked set to join West Ham from Manchester United .

"West Brom are preparing to offload their record signing Brown Ideye at a loss of £6.2million. A price of €5m (£3.8m) has been agreed with Al Gharafa of Qatar way down from a £10m purchase price last summer. The Nigeria striker has failed to impress at The Hawthorns, scoring just twice in all competitions - a tap-in from two yards against Hull and a deflection off the back of his head against Manchester City. West Brom striker Brown Ideye is set for a move away from The Hawthorns after a barren five months . The 26-year-old (right) has scored just two goals since his record £10million signing from Dynamo Kiev . Tony Pulis needs to raise cash to plough into fresh deadline-day signings and chairman Jeremy Peace has sanctioned the knockdown fee. Negotiations still need to be finalised over the method of payment, leaving the possibility the transfer could yet hit the buffers. However, much work has been done in the window to offload Ideye and all involved would like to see the move complete.

"Leicester City have signed Stoke City defender Robert Huth on a loan deal until the end of the season. Huth arrived at Leicester's training ground on Friday morning and trained with his new team-mates before finalising the deal. He becomes Nigel Pearson's third signing of the window, following goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and striker Andrej Kramaric. Robert Huth has joined strugglers Leicester City on loan until the end of the season from Stoke City . Huth was recently in trouble with the FA for sending explicit tweets, and was handed a two-game ban . Pearson is desperate for defensive reinforcements as he plots to keep his ailing team in the Premier League and sees Stoke's Huth as the ideal man to shore up his defence. Huth has been restricted to just four appearances this season under Mark Hughes - two in the Capital One Cup, once in the FA Cup and only one Premier League game. Stoke City and Leicester City had to renegotiate the terms of Huth's loan after he was given a two-match ban by the FA instead of a one-game suspension anticipated by the clubs for an explicit tweet he sent out. Huth had responded to a Twitter account - named 'C**k or no c**k' - which posts sexual images of individuals and asks users to guess their gender. The longer punishment meant Huth is available to Leicester for one fewer game, hence a reduction in the loan fee was discussed, but talks were successful. Huth (right) has played just four times in all competitions for Mark Hughes' Stoke side this season . Nigel Pearson is desperate to bring in reinforcements to strengthen his side in the fight against relegation .","Robert Huth has played just four times for Stoke so far this season .

"James Milner is set to stay at Manchester City until at least the end of the season. Liverpool and Arsenal were among the clubs interested in signing the midfielder as he enters the final months of his contract at the Premier League champions. But the England international is not interested in a short-term deal and Sportsmail understands contract talks will resume next week. James Milner is keen to remain at Manchester City and will resume contract talks next week . Milner, who turned 29 last month, is looking for assurances over playing time and length of contract rather than a giant payday. He is not without admirers at home or abroad but is keen to remain at City should those assurances be forthcoming. While this season Milner has made 11 first-team starts in the Premier League compared with 12 in the whole of last season, he is under no illusion that the impact of injuries and non-availability of the likes of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri have helped his cause. Milner has recently started in his preferred central midfield position and would welcome more opportunities at the same spot.

"Leicester City are interested in staging a late bid for Tottenham midfielder Aaron Lennon. The 27-year-old was set for a move to relegation rivals Hull City but the winger is believed to have expressed reluctance after they slumped to a 3-0 defeat by Newcastle at the weekend. There has also been a dispute between Spurs and Hull over who would pay the majority of his £55,000-per-week wages until the end of the season when Lennon would make a permanent switch to Humberside. Aaron Lennon (right, playing against Partizan Belgrade in November) has been told he can leave Spurs . Stoke are another team in the running to seal a move for Lennon after they were offered his services by Spurs, although there is also a snag over his wages. However, Leicester boss Nigel Pearson is hoping to win the race as he looks to add some experience to his side as they try to avoid the drop from the Premier League. The Foxes are currently rooted to the bottom of the table, two points behind fellow relegation battlers QPR and Hull and a further point adrift of Burnley. Pearson has a good crop of wide-men in his squad but believes Lennon's know-how can help them during the run-in and is willing to make a loan bid. The right winger has the sort of raw pace and directness to threaten most Premier League defences . Lennon, who has spent the last decade at Tottenham, last appeared for Mauricio Pochettino's men in their 1-0 Europa League loss to Besiktas back in December. The 21-cap England international has made just three Premier League starts this term with boss Pochettino's style not favouring a pacy wide man. Riyad Mahrez, who operates in the same position, will be back for Leicester’s key clash with Crystal Palace following Algeria’s exit from the Africa Cup of Nations. Leicester are keen to introduce Lennon's experience to the squad .","Leicester City are interested in making a loan move for Aaron Lennon .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League... 1. Per Mertesacker is a much better defender when he’s got Laurent Koscielny alongside him. The 5-0 win over Aston Villa was the sixth time in the 11 games where both of them played 90 minutes this season that Arsenal have kept a clean sheet. Meanwhile, in the 12 matches where one or the other was missing, the Gunners have shut out the opposition only twice.

Laurent Koscielny (left) of Arsenal and Christian Benteke of Aston Villa compete for the ball at the Emirates . Mertesacker (centre) and Koscielny (right) have kept six clean sheets in 11 games in defence together . 2. James Milner can’t do much more to convince Manchester City he deserves a better contract offer than the one currently on the table. Talks over a new deal have stalled with the 29-year-old England midfielder believing he needs to be treated in a similar bracket to some of City’s overseas stars. He underlined his point with a selfless display in the 1-1 draw at Chelsea. Nobody ran more than his 7.3 miles, and he also recorded the most sprints (63) of any player on the Stamford Bridge pitch as well as the highest average speed (4.6mph). Blood trickles down the mouth of midfielder James Milner during Manchester City's 1-1 draw at Chelsea . Milner (right) ran further than anyone else on the pitch and he also recorded the most sprints . 3. Napoli and Inter Milan both made moves to take Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva away from Anfield during this transfer window but there are good reasons why Brendan Rodgers refused to do a deal. The 28-year-old, who has divided opinion since he first arrived at Liverpool in 2007, has made a huge difference since returning to the regular starting side. The 2-0 win over West Ham United was the club’s eighth victory in 12 games that Lucas has started this season - in 11 games where he wasn’t in the opening line-up, Liverpool have won only three times. Lucas Leiva (left) has attracted transfer interest from both Napoli and Inter Milan after some solid matches . Lucas (left) celebrates with Raheem Sterling - during one of the eight wins he has been involved in . 4. Jonjo Shelvey rightly took the headlines for the stunning goal that brought Swansea City a much-needed three points at Southampton, but his midfield partner Tom Carroll did much of the donkey work to set up the 1-0 win. Carroll, who has struggled to get game time during a season-long loan from Tottenham Hotspur, ran 8.4 miles at St Mary’s as he battled to break up the Saints’ normally fluent midfield passing. That equalled Burnley’s George Boyd as the record for the greatest distance covered by one player during a Premier League match this season. Jonjo Shelvey claimed the headlines at Southampton after his stunning strike for Swansea City . But midfield partner Tom Carroll (left) did the donkey work and put in a tireless shift against Southampton . 5. David de Gea has played every minute of every game for Manchester United this season - but nobody else in the Old Trafford dressing room can be sure of starting every week. Manager Louis van Gaal made three changes from his last Premier League team in the side that beat Leicester City 3-1, including giving Adnan Januzaj his first start since mid-November. The Dutchman either believes in picking his team for the opposition, or still doesn’t know his best 11. He has only once kept an unchanged team all season.

Louis van Gaal (right) has shuffled his pack and only retained the same starting line-up once so far . Adnan Januzaj (centre) returned to the Man United starting line-up against Leicester City . 6. It’s a different story at Burnley where Sean Dyche believes in keeping a settled side - he has now named the same starting line-up for nine games in a row. The only other manager in the Premier League era to show such consistency of selection was Alex McLeish when he was in charge of Birmingham City. He kept the same team for 12 matches between November 2009 and February 2010. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has kept the same starting line-up for nine matches in a row . Birmingham City boss Alex McLeish kept the same side for 12 consecutive games in the 2009-10 season . 7. Nobody would suggest that Stephen Ireland might be pleased about the cruciate knee ligament injury that has ruled out mercurial Spaniard Bojan Krkic long term, but it has thrown him a lifeline to revive his career at Stoke City. The 28-year-old midfield man got only his fourth Premier League start of the campaign in the 3-1 win over Queens Park Rangers and made the most of the chance. He made both the first two goals of Jonathan Walters’ hat-trick, and set up three other chances. Bojan Krkic (right) grimaces after damaging his cruciate knee ligament for Stoke City last month . Stephen Ireland (left) came into the Stoke line-up for the home victory over Queens Park Rangers . 8. Maybe it is something to do with Bournemouth’s fluent passing style inviting tackles, but referees do seem fond of getting out their red cards to protect the Championship leaders. When Gabriele Angella got his marching orders from ref Lee Probert in the first minute of Watford’s 2-0 defeat, he became the seventh player to be sent off playing against Eddie Howe’s side in their last 13 games. Across the whole campaign Bournemouth have spent 11.6 per cent of playing time against 10 men, the highest percentage of any side in the Football League or Conference. Referee Lee Probert (centre) sends off Watford's Gabriele Angella just one minute into the match . Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has seen seven opposition players sent off in their last 13 games . 9. Fulham striker Matt Smith now has 11 goals from the last 10 games of his loan spell with League One leaders Bristol City. The 25-year-old, who struggled at Craven Cottage following a £500,000 summer move from Leeds United, has had his stay at Ashton Gate extended until March 1. City boss Steve Cotterill will get the chance to make the most of him during that time - this Saturday’s trip to title rivals Milton Keynes Dons will mark the start of a spell of seven games in 21 days. Fulham striker Matt Smith (centre) has now claimed 11 goals from his last 10 games on loan at Bristol City . 10. A group of cheeky Cheltenham Town fans paid £650 to put up a poster in the town hailing their League Two club as better than Manchester United. The logic was that they had beaten Cambridge United away this season, while Louis van Gaal’s men could only draw 0-0 when they went to the Abbey Stadium. Perhaps they chose the wrong week to do it, though. Or maybe they should spend a few more bob for a poster recognising that on that particular form line Dagenham and Redbridge, comfortable 3-1 winners against the Robins on Saturday, should now be considered Champions League contenders.

"Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane not only finished on the losing side in the Super Bowl, he also suffered a horrific wrist break from a brutal tackle. In the first quarter of the Super Bowl XLIX game with the New England Patriots Lane intercepted a loose endzone pass by MVP Tom Brady.

"Churchwarden Clive Weir (pictured) admitted neighbours had 'good grounds' for complaint over the noise at St James the Great Church in Thorley, Hertfordshire . A church handed a noise abatement notice after neighbours complained it was 'like living next door to a nighclub'- has now applied for a late licence. Locals living next to the 13th century St James the Great Church in Thorley, Hertfordshire, claimed it was making their lives 'hell' after they were plagued by loud music, rowdy  parties and drunken shouting from its wedding venue. Church leaders had promised to keep it down at their Grade II-listed St Barnabas Centre after the order by East Hertforshire District Council last November. But it emerged this week that St James, run by the Church of England and overseen by Diocese of St Albans, has applied for a licence to serve alcohol and host gigs up until midnight at another centre in its grounds. A neighbour, who would not be named, said: 'It's been hell living here for several years now and the worst of it is that the Church of England actively promotes the barns for parties and weddings. 'There have been more and more parties over the last few years and it's getting to the stage that we are using the Lord's name in vain when we hear the music or the wedding speeches. 'We don't want to upset the church, but we don't want drunken wedding guests wandering around shouting outside out houses.' Locals claimed that another late night venue at the church would make things 'ten times worse'. Churchwarden Clive Weir admitted neighbours had 'good grounds' for complaint and said church leaders are now investigating soundproofing at St Barnabas Centre. He said: 'There is no argument - we completely agree with them. 'The problem has been finding a satisfactory solution to abate the noise emitting from a grade II listed barn. Our acoustic consultants have advised us that we are now near a solution that will satisfy acoustic regulations.' A spokesman for East Hertfordshire District Council added it would give the church time to sort out its current 'noise issues' before stepping in. Neighbours to the church in Thorley, Hertfordshire complained to East Hertfordshire District Council that they are plagued by 'loud music', wedding parties, drunken shouting, amplified speeches, and live music . The source of the noise is the 16th century Tudor barn in the grounds of the church (pictured) which can be hired out through the Church of England for weddings, parties, school concerts, craft fairs and various other bashes, but it has now emerged the church has applied for a late license at another one of its venues . She said: 'We've given them until the start of the wedding season to try to resolve the noise issues.' But neighbours were furious the church had also applied to host parties at the nearby Emmaus Centre which is normally used for children's parties. Richard Timmis, whose home Thorley Hall is opposite the church, said said: 'The use as a church is not a problem - it's all these events they have - we hear the music the whole time. 'They have a terrace at the back which people sit out on and we get a lot of noise and disturbance from that.' He added the late licence application, if approved, would make the noise 'ten times worse'. 'We would have people not just on the terrace but milling around between the two buildings with no enclosure to mute it,' he added. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's been like living opposite a nightclub. 'It sometimes feels like we're actually in there, being able to hear the words of every song, and the doors and windows shaking from the heavy bass. 'It's been stressful for us all knowing we have weekend after weekend of disturbance to endure and sometimes just not wanting to be at home at a time when we should be able to relax.' Thorley Parish Council have also lodged their objections with concerns over noise and traffic. The local district council has given St James the Great until wedding season to sort out the noise issues, with church leaders promising to investigate soundproofing .","St James the Great Church has been handed a noise abatement notice .

"Fresh off a Super Bowl victory, the New England Patriots seemed to get a win on the Deflate-gate front Monday as it emerged that only one of the 11 under-filled balls was significantly below the minimum inflation. Also working in favor of team Brady was the added detail that the mysterious locker room staffer seen on video going with the balls from one room to another before taking them to the field was, in fact, an elderly Pats employee who appeared to stop into a restroom before delivering the balls. Of those balls, reports NFL.com, 10 were likely just slightly under-inflated while only one was a full two pounds per square inch below the 12.5PSI minimum. Accused of tampering: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is fresh off a big Super Bowl win. Will favorable new Deflate-gate details help bolster his already high spirits? The Patriots worker who became the focus of an NFL investigation after footage showed him carrying game balls into a room before he took them to the field was an elderly gentleman. The room he entered with the balls was a bathroom and he was there for 98 seconds. Both Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick have adamantly denied any involvement. Eleven of the 12 ‘Deflate-gate balls’ were under-inflated, though only one was two pounds below the required PSI of 12.5 while the others were below by only a small amount. The investigation is ongoing. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that 'we have made no judgments.' Source . So do these facts deflate the case against the Pats? Not totally, says NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who said Friday that 'we have made no judgments' regarding the the investigation. The growing storm over the team's use of illegal balls, which is being referred to as 'deflate-gate,' dominated the buildup to the Febuary 1 Super Bowl versus the Seahawks. Under NFL rules, game balls must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch and no alteration is allowed once they are approved. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped. Both Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have professed innocence regarding the deflated ball issue and said they knew nothing about it until Monday. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said investigators spent three days at the team's facility during which they were given access to every full- and part-time employee they requested to speak with and every communication device that they wanted to search. In fact, it was the Patriots themselves who turned over footage of the elderly equipment attendant and his 98-second restroom dalliance. As the Patriots move into the calmer off-season, the NFL says its investigation into Deflate-gate will continue. A whiff of scandal continued to hang over Sunday's game even as the Vince Lombardi Trophy was hoisted and confetti fell from the roof of the University of Phoenix Stadium still trembling from New England's heart stopping win. Inquest: The NFL is investigation into whether the Pats intentionally deflated balls has found that only one of the under-filled pigskins was significantly under the required 12.5PSI . 'We won that (AFC) game 45-7, we won today 28-24,' defended a defiant Patriots owner Robert Kraft through the celebratory din. 'Our people didn't touch the balls. I love our team, I'm proud of our guys. 'We're going to carry on and hopefully continue to do well. 'Every year if you're privileged to get to this game, hard things happen. I'm so proud of (Tom) Brady and (coach Bill) Belichick for handling things the way they did.' As the NFL's investigation into 'deflate-gate' continues, the spotlight of suspicion remains firmly fixed on the Patriots with some fans even questioning why New England was allowed to play in the Super Bowl at all. A battling Brady spent Sunday rewriting the Super Bowl quarterbacking record books, setting new marks for single-game completions (37), most career passing yards (1,605) and career touchdowns (13) to claim a third most valuable player award. 'It's just a lot of mental toughness, I think the whole team had it,' said Brady when asked how the team was able to deal with the controversy and focus on the game. 'The coach always says, ignore the noise and control what you can control.' But the Patriots and Belichick, the only coach to take a team to six Super Bowls, have also developed a reputation as a team not above a bit of skullduggery. In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 and the Patriots lost a first-round draft pick after an investigation found New England had videotaped an opponent's signals on the sidelines in what became known as 'Spygate'. New twist in Deflate-gate: The locker room attendant who is seen on surveillance footage at Gillette Stadium (pictured) carrying the balls into a room before going to the field was recently revealed to be an elderly man and the room he entered was a bathroom, where he stayed for 98 seconds .","Controversy over the deflated balls continues despite the New England Patriots' Super Bowl victory, but new evidence weighs in their favor .

"Paul Lambert would be well advised to dip into the transfer market for a striker, because if Aston Villa carry on at this rate they will earn the dubious title of becoming the worst attacking team in Premier League history. It’s no secret that Villa have struggled for goals this season, netting just 11 times in 23 games, but their inadequacies are laid bare when compared with previous problem strikeforces. The infamous Derby County side of 2007-08 – relegated after failing to compete all season, winning just once – managed more goals per game than Lambert’s side are currently trundling along at. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke looks frustrated during his side's 5-0 defeat by Arsenal . Paul Lambert does not believe his side have any reason to be lacking confidence in attack . Gabriel Agbonlahor has scored just three Premier League goals for Lambert this season . Andreas Weimann (No 10) had more woe in front of goal after he failed to beat David Ospina . Their drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes. It’s led to growing calls for Lambert to be shown the door by Randy Lerner, but the Scot appears to be safe for now. Incidentally, Derby scored 20 times that fateful season under Billy Davies and Paul Jewell. Villa need nine more to draw level with 15 games remaining. They wouldn’t even manage that if nothing changed. The teams currently have an identical record after 23 games which, given the Rams’ terrible run of form, makes very grim reading indeed. The two teams have the joint-worst record at this stage. Lambert has wanted to land a striker this month but it remains to be seen whether he can get a body in to truly compete with Christian Benteke. One of the major problems for Villa, of course, has been the failure to get the Belgian firing after he recovered from injury. They need to get someone in, otherwise the responsibility to score more goals befalls Andreas Weimann and Gabriel Agbonlahor; nobody wants that. The pair are Lambert's top scorers in the league. Three each after playing more than 40 games combined. It is a shambolic return and one which doesn't appear ready to change any time soon, with Chelsea to come next weekend.

"Unfaithful: Jessica Gore and her partner Darren . A cheating wife who cried rape in a bid to keep a six-year affair secret from her husband just a month after their wedding has avoided jail. Unfaithful Jessica Gore, 32, had only been married to partner Darren, 41, for four weeks when she arrived home later than expected last September. The newly-wed mother-of-two claimed she had been attacked by a stranger as she walked home from babysitting for a friend. Her worried husband immediately told her to contact police and report the crime. Her bogus claim came as police investigated a number of other reported rapes in her local area. But . detectives quickly exposed her lies and found she had sneaked off to . meet lover Matthew Richards - just a short walk from her marital home. Police then uncovered a series of texts on her phone and Gore admitted she had been cheating on her partner for six years. Gore admitted perverting the course of justice and was given a suspended prison sentence of eight months, suspended for a year. Judge Heather Norton told her: 'This wasn’t just a vague allegation. You gave an incredible amount of detail. 'This was all at a time when there was an ongoing investigation into rapes in the Ashford area.' On letting her walk free from Canterbury Crown Court Judge Norton added: 'This is an extremely exceptional case. 'I do so with some reluctance and it is really by the skin of your teeth.' Richard Scott, prosecuting, said she left her marital home in Ashford, Kent on the evening of September 24, telling her husband she was visiting a friend called Amanda. Unfaithful Jessica Gore, 32, had only been married to partner Darren, 41, for four weeks . She left the house at 8.15pm and texted her husband saying she had arrived at the property. But in fact she was in the arms of her lover who the court heard she had had an 'on-off relationship' for more than six years. Mr Scott said: 'Jessica Gore was lying to her husband at that stage. In fact she had arrived at the home of a Matthew Richards. 'Mr Gore, washed and shaved, put the children to bed and settled down to watch a film. By this time Mrs Gore was having sex with her lover.' At 10.10pm Gore left her lover and arrived home 10 minutes later in floods of tears claiming she had been raped. Bogus: Jessica Gore pictured with her husband Darren who told her to contact the police . On the advice of police her husband bagged her clothes before detectives arrived to question her. Mr Scott added: 'She gave the police an allegation of stranger rape after being confronted by a man who she had struck. 'She had then been shoved to the ground and her trousers and underwear were pulled down and she had then been raped.' But the court heard that her story began unravelling when her friend revealed that she had not been at her house. Officers then examined Gore’s mobile phone and discovered sexual texts between her and her lover. Gore told the court she was upset at herself and said 'things had spiralled out of control.' She also claimed she had gone to her lover’s house 'under threat' as he was going to tell her husband about the affair. 'This is an extremely exceptional case' Judge Norton . James Ross, defending, said: 'It was Mrs Gore’s belief that, unless she consented to this blackmail to have sex with him on that particular day, he would tell her husband. 'In effect, that her lover would pull the plug on her entire life.' Mr Ross added that Gore was suffering from mental health issues and blamed problems as a child for her difficulties with men. After her initial appearance in court she was sent to a hospital to be treated for mental health problems. Judge Norton said: 'Sadly, in this case, the allegation of rape proved to be untrue but was not admitted until after extensive inquiries had been carried out by detectives, at a time when there was understandable public concern about a number of earlier assaults being carried out in the Ashford area. 'I would echo the comments by Judge Norton that this strikes fear into the hearts of women and undermines actual victims.'

"A trial of 76-year-old white man accused of shooting to death his black 13-year-old neighbor in front of his mother is set to begin this week. Some have likened the shooting of Darius Simmons, 13, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as 'vigilantism and rogue police behavior' and similar in to the killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin. In both cases, an older man allegedly killed a black teen because the shooter believed they were suspicious. On trial: John Henry Spooner was charged with first-degree murder . Police say John Henry Spooner shot Simmons last May after accusing the boy of stealing $3,000 worth of guns from his home. The teen, who had lived with his mother next door to Spooner for only a month, was taking out the trash around 10 a.m. when Spooner accused the boy of the theft and demanded he return the shotguns. The teenager . was unarmed when he was shot in the street outside their homes. The boy told Spooner he had not stolen the guns and his mother, Patricia Larry, told the elderly man to go back inside. Spooner then pulled out a handgun and shot Simmons in the chest from only five feet away, killing the boy. There were at least two witnesses. Before shooting him dead he accused him of burglarising his home earlier in the week. 'I condemn in the strongest words possible the murder of Darius Simmons,' Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said after the shooting. 'To have a boy who's taking out the garbage at 10 in the morning murdered should shock the conscience of the state.' In the dock: Spooner, 76, right, confers with his defense attorney on Monday. He faces charges that he fatally shot a black teen last year whom he suspected of breaking into his Milwaukee home and stealing weapons . Spooner allegedly confessed to the shooting telling officers 'Yeah, I shot him.' The man had apparently vented his frustration to a local politician over the police response to the report of his theft. If convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, Spooner faces life in prison. His defense are planning to claim he is not guilty because he is mentally impaired. Neighbors: Spooner was arrested after waiting for police at the crime scene. He lives in the cream house, right, while Darius Simmons lived in the blue house, left .

Neighbor Robert Delatorre said Spooner lived alone with his two dogs and often walked around the block. The boy's mother, Patricia Larry, who . saw the shooting, said Spooner told her son he ‘wanted his stuff back . and that he wanted his shotguns back.' 'My son, Darius Simmons, was shot and killed in front of me,' Ms. Larry said. 'It's affected me, my friends, my work.'

"Britain's bosses are crippling their workers with the worst-ever pay rises, official figures revealed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said the average worker is getting a pay rise of just one per cent, the lowest pay rise since its records began in 2001. With the cost of living rising at 2.8 per cent, it means a worker’s pay is barely rising while their bills are rising at a rate which is nearly three times higher. Record lows: The average worker has seen their wage increase a mere one per cent while living costs have increased by 2.8 per cent . Since the financial crisis began in 2008, the ONS said there have been just three months when wages have risen faster than the consumer prices index measure of inflation. Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, warned: ‘Employees are seeing a substantial erosion of their spending power as salaries fail to keep pace with price growth.’ He said it was ‘baffling in an age of supposed pay restraint’ that public sector pay is rising by an average of 1.6 per cent, compared to one per cent for private sector workers. Unsustainable: Bills are bulging at a rate nearly three times higher than wages are rising . Household bills from the cost of keeping their home warm to the bill for filling up their car with petrol are going up, but workers have little or no extra cash to cover the cost. It comes after inflation has been above the Government’s target of two per cent for more three years amid warnings that the cost of living will continue to rise sharply. Other bills from food to council tax, university tuition fees to childcare costs are rising, but workers are not being given a decent pay rise each year to allow their wages to keep up. There is also pressure from the increase in VAT to 20 per cent, the loss or cut in child benefit for more than one million families and changes to tax credits. Overall, the ONS said recently the average annual increase for the whole of the last decade was just 1.3 per cent, the lowest figure since records began in 1948. A typical man in the private sector is earning less than he was being paid a decade ago after the figures have been adjusted for inflation. In 2002, a typical man with a full-time job in the private sector earned £12.67 per hour. A decade later, he is earning 30p less per hour.","The average worker in Britain is getting a pay rise of just one per cent .

While Great Britain is going through an embarrassingly fallow period in junior tennis Murray has at least been heartened by the performance in Australia of Katie Swan, a 15-year-old from Bristol who was overnight playing in the semi-finals of the junior event. ‘She’s a good athlete, got a very good mind. She’s got a very good foundation to her game already, strong serve, strong forehand. But I think it’s her calmness and her ability to stick to a task that impresses me. ‘I sat on the chair with her during the Maureen Connolly (under 18) Trophy last year when we played against the United States at New Haven. She beat the No 1 and 2 for the States and came from a set down in both of them. She was able to process the tactics and information and stick with them against girls who were a couple of years older than her and very much more experienced. That was when I realised, we’ve got a player on our hands here.’ Laura Robson, Judy Murray, Anne Keothavong, Elena Baltacha and Johanna Konta caught the eye at Fed Cup dinner in Argentina last April .","Great Britain team attended official tournament dinner in Hungary .

"Fans of the new John Lewis Christmas advert have already gone on a shopping spree with the £95 toy penguin getting  sold out online within hours of its release. The retailer only released its latest festive commercial this morning but stars Monty and Mabel have already proved to be a huge hit despite the high prices. John Lewis has released 39 different pieces of new penguin merchandise linked to its £7million Christmas campaign, but much of it is selling out fast. Other items, including the Monty and Mabel pyjamas, onesie, umbrella and cufflinks are already sold out according to the John Lewis website. Scroll down for video . Yours for £95: After the John Lewis Christmas advert was released today the retailer also offered the stars of the commercial for sale for £95 . Get them while you can: These Monty and Mabel cufflinks are apparently already sold out online . Gift list: This onesie is one of many John Lewis products linked to the ad available this Christmas . Costly: John Lewis has spent £1million creating the ad and £7million on the upcoming marketing campaign, but has also produced dozens of pieces of merchandise . This year's John Lewis Christmas ad tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, left, and his penguin friend Monty . This year's two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by seven-year-old Rhys Edwards, and his friend Monty. The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. Throughout the advert Monty is a CGI penguin, but at the end it is revealed to be a stuffed toy - and for a few hours you could buy him and his girlfriend online in various sizes for between £12 and £95. But they are still available in stores. A John Lewis spokesman told MailOnline: 'Yes we are expecting more stock and all items are still available in all of our shops'. Monty and Mabel toys jewellery, Christmas cards, jumpers, hot water bottle and even artwork are available in store and online. Other Items includes a children's book called Monty's Christmas, of which a proportion of the proceeds will go to Barnardo's, stuffed toys, an umbrella and pyjamas. But shoppers outside John Lewis's Oxford Street branch seemed unconvinced. Dedi Chinanurakchart, a 21-year-old student, said: 'If it was a real penguin I probably would have bought it because I've always wanted one. Why is it so pricy? Is it stuffed with gold?' Malik Kydd, 19, also complained about the price: 'If that's the thing that they are promoting in the advert it shouldn't cost so much - because John Lewis is (usually) an accessible store for everybody.' Similarly, Daneika March, 24, and Natalie Baker, 38, who work at House of Fraser, enjoyed the family-focused feel to the ad, but Ms Baker said she would not be swayed by the £95 Monty toy. 'I think it's £9.50 for a bear in John Lewis at the moment, so I wouldn't buy a £95 Monty.' His and hers: These jerseys for boys and girls are for sale for £12 to £14 each depending on the sizes . Work of art: This print of Monty and Mabel is designed is perfect for a lounge and bedroom, and is priced at £25 . However, Craig Whaites, 42, head of training at the Co-Operative, had just bought one for his 16-year-old daughter, Sarah, in the retailer's Oxford Street store. 'It makes you feel like it's Christmas,' he said. Thomas  Connelly tweeted: 'You can buy Monty the Penguin for £95 from @johnlewisretail! He's bloody staying single at that price'. Gill Edwards wrote: 'Just been checking out Monty the penguin toys, £95 for a 35 cm stuffed toy is outrageous. suddenly the advert has gone flat for me'. Price range: Also available are gift bags for £3.50, as well as a light for £25 and slippers for £15 .","John Lewis launched ad this morning and toys sold out online by afternoon .

"Lena Dunham has spoken out about the fuss surrounding the photoshopping of her much-anticipated Vogue cover and photo-shoot, saying she doesn't understand the controversy. The extent of the photoshopping was revealed by Jezebel, the women's blog owned by Gawker Media, which offered a $10,000 bounty for the unretouched pictures. The writer and star of HBO’s Girls told Slate that the controversy 'confuses me a little.' Cover girl: Dunham says she is pleased with the results of her photo-shoot with Vogue . 'I understand that for people there is a . contradiction between what I do and being on the cover of Vogue; but . frankly I really don’t know what the photoshopping situation is, I can’t . look at myself really objectively in that way,' Dunham, 27, told Slate. 'I know that I felt . really like Vogue supported me and wanted to put a depiction of me on . the cover. I never felt bullied into anything; I felt really happy . because they dressed me and styled me in a way that really reflects who I . am. And I felt that was very lucky and that all the editors understood . my persona, my creativity and who I am. 'I haven’t been keeping track of . all the reactions, but I know some people have been very angry about the . cover and that confuses me a little. I don’t understand why, Photoshop or no, having a woman who is different than the typical Vogue cover girl, could be a bad thing,' she said. Editor of Jezebel Jessica Coen said that it is the very fact that Vogue had chosen to manipulate someone like Dunham's image that the magazine should be taken to task. 'This is what Vogue does - and yes, we already know in general what all of these magazines do - but now, on its cover, Vogue has a woman who rightfully declares that her appearance, with all of its perceived imperfections, shouldn't be hidden and doesn't need any fixing,' she wrote. Bounty: Jezebel paid $10,000 for the unretouched versions of Lena Dunham's Vogue photos in a move some are labeling anti-feminist and mean . The pre-Photoshop images, acquired by Jezebel today, show how the Girls creator's jawline has been narrowed, her waistline slimmed and even smile lines removed. An image of the 27-year-old star seated on the edge of a bathtub in a Dolce & Gabbana dress demonstrates these changes to greatest effect. An annotated gif points out that Dunham's hips have been pulled in, her jawline slimmed, defined and raised. The bags under her eyes have been removed and the smile line on the right-hand-side of her face has been erased entirely. The whole image is noticeably brighter, and Dunham's skin has been smoothed. 'Fantasy': Despite Dunham being an positive body image role model, she says she doesn't have a problem with her retouched Vogue images . 'A fashion magazine is like a beautiful fantasy. Vogue isn’t the place that we go to look at realistic women, Vogue is the place that we go to look at beautiful clothes and fancy places and escapism and so I feel like if the story reflects me and I happen to be wearing a beautiful Prada dress and surrounded by beautiful men and dogs, what’s the problem? If they want to see what I really look like go watch the show that I make every single week,' Dunham told Slate France. Coen stands by Jezebel’s choice to publish the unretouched pictures of Dunham. 'Accusations that we’re shaming Lena are fueled by the assumption that there’s even something to shame her about,' she wrote in an email to Speakeasy. Response: Dunham has made her feelings on the matter very clear . Girl, uncovered: Dunham says if anyone wants to see what she looks like when not in a Vogue fashion spread they need only watch her show in which she regularly goes semi-naked, 'Girls' 'The underlying message of these critiques is that there’s something here to ""fix"" and Vogue should take care of the problem. There’s never any outcry when unretouched images of a supermodel surface online.' Others disagree, labelling Jezebel 'mean girls' who are using feminism as an excuse to shame Dunham. 'This is total mean-girl s*** masquerading as feminism,' tweeted screenwriter Diablo Cody. 'I'm disgusted.' TV critic for the New Yorker Emily Nussbaum wrote, 'If Dunham wanted to release her own retouched photos, that might be interesting. Asking for a bounty on them? GROSS.' Dunham weighed in with a tweet last night - a reply to Nussbaum. '10k?' she wrote. 'Give it to charity then just order HBO.'","Lena Dunham has responded to the controversy over her photoshopped Vogue fashion spread and cover .

"Babies fake cry to get extra attention - particularly if they have brothers and sisters, scientists claim (stock image) Babies are known to cry to alert their parents to their distress to help ensure their survival. Yet, confirming what many parents already suspect, scientists have found that infants also fake cry simply to get extra attention - particularly if they have brothers and sisters. Japanese researchers studied two babies crying over a period of six months and believe the infants are capable of the clever deception. Hiroko Nakayama, a researcher at the University of the Sacred Heart, Tokyo, said one of the babies faked crying, after filming the children for an hour twice a month, for half a year. The scientists coded the video footage in five second segments to document 68 episodes of crying for seven month old ‘Baby R’ and 34 episodes for ‘Baby M’ who was nine months old at the beginning of the study, The British Psychological Society reported. They looked for the presence of emotion in the minutes before and after the babies cried and found that all of Baby M’s crying episodes were preceded by evidence of upset, shown by the child grimacing, making noises or looking sad. However, the researchers also found that there was an instance when Baby R cried shortly after smiling and laughing. While they said that 98 per cent of Baby R’s crying episodes did follow a negative effect, the incident at 11 months was recognised by her mother as fake crying and analysis confirmed this. ‘Infant R appeared to cry deliberately to get her mother's attention,’ said Nakayama, who added that ‘she showed smile immediately after her mother came closer.’ The scientists looked for the presence of emotion in the minutes before and after the babies cried and found an instance when Baby R cried following a positive emotion when the child was smiling and laughing (illustrated) In the study, one baby only cried when she was distressed or unhappy. The other cried for the same reason 98 per cent of the time, but also fake cried to get attention. Researchers looked at the presence of emotion immediately before and after the infants cried to try and determine their motivation. They think fake crying contributes 'greatly' to a baby's social and emotional development. The scientists believe the child who used fake crying tactics in the study did so as she had to compete with siblings for her parents' attention. Dr Nakayama said fake crying successfully attracts the attention of a parent and contributes 'greatly' to an infant's social development as well as their emotional development. ‘Infants who are capable of fake crying might communicate successfully with their caregivers in this way on a daily basis. Fake crying could add much to their relationships,’ she added. The study also revealed that typically after a crying episode, the babies continued to be distressed or sad and they only slowly became happier with physical contact from a parent. While the researchers only observed two children, they think that Baby R might used fake crying as she had two siblings, whereas Baby M was an only child and did not have to compete for her parents’ attention. Dr Nakayama said that siblings can enrich social interactions at home and increase their variety. ‘Such environmental factors are known to stimulate the development of communication skills of infants,’ she added.","Tokyo researchers studied two babies to look at whether they were distressed or happy immediately before crying .

"With the BBC recruiting Phil Neville to replace Alan Hansen, football punditry is set for a major change this season - but perhaps not as much as NBC suggest in their newest Premier League advert. Fictional American coach Ted Lasso, who starred in last season's video as Tottenham's new manager, is back in the studio, and still completely out of his depth in the hilarious clip.

"Leighton Baines insists that Everton have turned a corner by no longer selling their best players as the club look to challenge for a top four finish.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Baines said: 'What the club has done lately is retain its best players. 'Everyone here who has been linked with someone has stayed and committed to the club. The younger lads; Ross, Stonesy, Seamus have all been linked with clubs and they've all got their best football ahead of them, but they're all happy to do it here. That's as big as anything for me. 'The manager was telling me that's what he wanted to do when I signed my contract. 'I signed following that summer of the whole United thing, but that was in their minds back then in terms of how to change the status and perception so we can keep hold of players when other clubs come calling.' Martinez has continued his revolution by bringing in high quality signings including Gareth Barry, a loan deal for Chelsea youngster Christian Atsu and breaking the club's transfer record for Romelu Lukaku. 'It was a big statement,' he says. Forward planning: Roberto Martinez has tied down young prospects like John Stones to long-term deals .

"Traffic Droid: Lewis Dediare patrols the streets of London on the look out for bad drivers . This self-styled cycling superhero has been naming and shaming errant drivers using seven video cameras mounted on his helmet and bike. Clad in black lycra, Traffic Droid, aka Lewis Dediare, describes his battle as a 'war of attrition' as he cycles around London, branding drivers 'idiots' if they get in his way. As well as a camera mounted on a three foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle, the 39-year-old carries a ruler to measure how his distance from cars, before bellowing into the car window to admonish the driver and showing them a 'red card'. He then uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter, and will often hand it over to traffic companies and police so the drivers can be further punished. Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers, which features some of the countries most persistent complainers, and the call centre staff who have to deal with them. So far, Mr Dediare says his naming and . shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every . year, as well as several prosecutions. The . telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 . when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane . while out cycling. He broke . two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the . driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more . needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to . cyclists. He now drives a modified bike, which features a camera on three-foot pole protruding from his handlebars, and as well as a further camera his helmet carries three bright lights. Mr Dedaire films his journeys to and from his office, cycling as much as two hours a day, before uploading his footage when he gets home in the evening. In tonight's Channel 4 programme he is shown alongside a car, armed with a ruler, to demonstrate to a driver how much space he should leave passing cyclists. He is also shown telling drivers they are 'idiots' and warning 'you can kill a cyclist the way you are driving'. Scroll down for video . Warning: Mr Dediare rides a modified bike featuring a camera on a pole protruding from his handlebars, and carries a red card which he shows to motorists . 'If you do something wrong I have the invincibility of the law which I feel protects me and that's why I confront people with the law,' he told programme makers. But Traffic Droid admits that not all drivers are welcoming of his advice, and he says he has often been threatened by motorists. 'It's a war, a war of attrition,' he said. 'One has to be prepared to combat that.' Alongside Traffic Droid, tonight's episode of The Complainers also features those working inside the Tfl complaints centre, and those they deal with - including an obsessive tweeter and a bus driver  sent on a course known as 'the naughty boys club'. Future episodes will focus on the call centre workers, social media teams and frontline staff who tackle irate customers at businesses and local councils. Viewers will meet one of Britain's most persistent long-term complainers, who confronts Kirklees council with a camera strapped to his body as part of an ongoing dispute dating back to 1988, a man who complains several times a day about rubbish in Croydon and a complainer in Cardiff who patrols his neighbourhood daily on the hunt for vandalism and disrepair.

"Two new lizard species have been discovered after living for millions of years in a remote rainforest area of far north Queensland. A James Cook University researcher, Dr Conrad Hoskin, came across the Cape Melville Rainbow Skink and Cape Melville Bar-lipped Skink on an expedition to the rainforest plateau on top of the Cape Melville Range, 170 km north of Cooktown in December last year. Dr Hoskin said the two species were hidden in the isolated range, a virtual mountaintop fortress cut off from the surrounding area by piles of huge granite boulders. Cape Melville Bar-lipped Skink was discovered for the first time in December last year . Cape Melville Rainbow Skink is the lizard specie found by Dr Conrad Hoskin on his last expedition . Dr Hoskin flew into all three expeditions by helicopter to the rainforest plateau on top of Cape Melville Range . Cape Melville is a 10 hour drive from Cairns . The lizards have been officially named and described in the latest edition of the international journal Zootaxa, taking the tally of new animals discovered during Dr Hoskin's three trips to Cape Melville  during to a remarkable five. Last year's expeditions to the plateau also found three other unique species: a boulder frog in February and a leaf-tailed gecko and a golden skink in March. This incredible find prompted international headlines describing Australia as host to a 'lost world' of animals isolated by a freak of geography. Dr Hoskin said that description was perfectly justifiable. 'The Melville Range has been sitting there completely isolated from other rainforest areas for millions of years. It's truly remarkable,' he said. 'It probably has more unique animal species per unit area than anywhere else in Australia.' Dr Hoskin told Daily Mail Australia that the main reason the species had not been discovered until now was because the range was difficult to get to. Dr Hoskin said although it was rare to find five species in less than a year - he expected more discoveries . The new boulder frog was discovered on Dr Conrad's first visit in February last year . Dr Hoskin reached all three expeditions in Cape Melville by helicopter last year. 'It takes about 10 hours by car from Cairns to get there but when you get there it's very hard to climb - I tried a couple of years ago,' he said. 'The area has also been overlooked because the area looks like it's very small.' Although Dr Hoskin said it was rare to discover one specie let along five in less than a year - there may well be other discoveries to come. 'We are looking in detail at another lizard that could also be new. And the invertebrate and plant collections made during the surveys are still being assessed by experts,' he said. 'This is on top of three vertebrate species that were discovered there in past decades. So that's eight animal species that are found only at Cape Melville, making their entire world distribution about the size of inner Sydney.' The scientific names of the two new lizards - Carlia wundalthini and Glaphyromorphus othelarrni - were chosen by the traditional owners of the Cape Melville region in collaboration with Dr Hoskin. The Cape Melville surveys were funded by the National Environmental Research Program, National Geographic and the Australian Biological Resources Study. Dr Conard found the leaf-tailed gecko on his second expedition . The golden skink was the other discovery on his trip in March last year .","Two new lizard species have been discovered in far north Queensland .

"Oxford University last night launched an investigation into claims that Tory students sang a ‘despicable’ song  celebrating Nazi massacres  during meetings. Members of the university’s Conservative Association were alleged to have given renditions of the song that revels in the killing of Jews during ‘port and policy’ nights. One video, filmed in the common room at Corpus Christi college, is said to show a student drunkenly chanting: ‘Dashing through the Reich’, before being silenced by another member. Oxford University Conservative Association president James Lawson with a friend. They were not involved in the alleged racist singing . The song’s full version, to the tune of Jingle Bells, continues: ‘Dashing through the Reich / in a black Mercedes Benz / killing lots of kike / ra ta ta ta ta.’ The word ‘kike’ is a derogatory term for Jewish people. One member of the Conservative Association, who declined to be named, told the Oxford Student newspaper: ‘Lots of people were singing it that night, and indeed on many other nights, and the general attitude is that that was OK. ‘The thing is, lots of members do find that song, and songs like that one, absolutely despicable, though little is done to stop it. I am very worried with the direction the society is going in at present.’ Pictures taken from ‘port and policy’ nights during the past year also showed members of the society rolling . around drunk on the floor. One was photographed pouring port into a friend’s mouth through a pith helmet. Excess: A member drinks port poured through a pith helmet. Neither was involved in the Nazi singing . Another . photo shows two members dressed as Margaret Thatcher next to a coal . miner outfit bearing an offensive placard which reads: ‘I love . shafting.’ Last night, Joe . Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative . Association, told the Daily Mail he was resigning from it in protest . about the ‘debauched’ behaviour of many of his fellow members. The . third year PPE student said: ‘It is disgusting and goes against . everything the Conservative Party stands for. I am completely . disillusioned. 'I came from a single-parent family and went to a state . school and had to work for everything I have achieved. ‘But . unfortunately the majority of members are rich former public schoolboys . with a great sense of entitlement who are far more interested in . drinking port than discussing policy.’ A former treasurer of the association recently wrote to members to complain about the ‘excessive and crass’ singing at meetings. He wrote: ‘The dissonance is enough to inflict pain as short, spotty, still-pubescent boys struggle to fix their unsteady voices on any pitch at all. ‘This unbridled clamour is disturbing finalists who live near the Union, many of whom are sounder Conservatives than most, but who don’t feel the need to dress up in ridiculous clothes or pretend that we still have an empire.’ David Cameron and former Tory leaders Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith have all given talks to the association in recent years. Its former presidents include Cabinet members William Hague and Jeremy Hunt. The OUCA is affiliated with Conservative Future, the party’s youth wing, and regularly supports candidates in local elections. During last year’s General Election, five former presidents stood for parliamentary seats. The Nazi song allegation is just the latest controversy to hit the association in recent years. Two years ago it was temporarily banned from using Oxford University in its title after members were urged to compete to see who could tell the most offensive racist joke. Yesterday an Oxford University spokesman said: ‘The university proctors, who are responsible for discipline, have been made aware of the [Oxford Student] article and will be considering whether there are grounds for further investigation. ‘The university strongly condemns any form of racism or discrimination.’ James Lawson, the current president of the Conservative Association who took over after the alleged racist singing took place, said he had started an investigation into the allegations. He said: ‘If it turns out this person is a member we will take immediate action to expel them from the association. Racism has no place in the association or our society.’ Additional reporting by James Rothwell .",One video said to show student singing 'Dashing through the Reich' to tune of Jingle Bells .

"West Ham could be kicked out of the FA Cup if found guilty by FIFA of illegally playing Senegal striker Diafra Sakho in their fourth-round win at Bristol City last month. FIFA have opened disciplinary proceedings against the London club after Senegal complained that Sakho should not have played.

"Nigel Farage will take Ukip into an alliance with a host of extreme right wing parties, one of the EU's most controversial politicians has claimed. Anti-EU Dutch politician Geert Wilders said Mr Farage will ditch a promise never to work with France's National Front - led by Marine Le Pen. Mr Wilders and Miss Le Pen have joined forces to create a 'European Freedom Alliance'. Like Ukip, both are leading in the polls ahead of the crunch May 22 European Parliament elections. Europe's top far right politician Geert Wilders has formed a Franco-Dutch alliance with Marine Le Pen's Front National . Mr Farage has refused to join the alliance - and pledged never to work with the French nationalists because of their  'anti-Semitism and general prejudice'. But Mr Farage has refused to rule out working with Mr Wilders - despite the Dutch politican’s controversial views on Islam and immigrants, . Mr Wilders, who leads the Dutch Freedom Party, sparked controversy this year by joining in chants demanding 'fewer Moroccans' at a campaign rally. But the Dutch politician dismissed criticism of his behaviour - and insisted he could persuage Mr Farage to work with Miss Le Pen’s Front National. Marine Le Pen has overseen a boom in popularity for France's controversial National Front Party after taking over from her father Jean-Marie Le Pen . He told The Telegraph: 'I am optimistic that Mr Farage will have more room to work together than he does today after the elections. 'He is not excluding my party and there is still an opportunity but he is tougher on the Front National for now. 'I understand he is a politician but I hope after elections both Miss Le Pen, Mr Farage and myself will be able to work together. 'I respect Mr Farage a lot. I think he is a very charismatic and excellent politician I understand he has a lot of support. 'But I also respect Marine Le Pen a lot. She is a very charismatic leader as well doing well in the polls with almost the same message when it comes to Europe.' Mr Wilders said Mr Farage would join the far-right alliance after the elections - where Eurosceptic parties are expected to get a third of the vote across the Continent - because it would hand the anti-EU parties much more power. He said: 'I hope we can overstep our differences to represent the all the millions of people who elected our parties to be as strong as possible a countervailing power against all the Europhiles in Brussels. 'It is not helpful to have two leaders of two important parties [Mr Farage and Miss Le Pen] fighting publicly. I hope I can play a role in bringing them both together. I would like to work together very closely with Ukip and Front National.' Polls put the French Front National and Dutch Freedom Party in a strong position to form a far-Right bloc in the European Parliament. They are expected to end up with at least 38 MEPs from at least seven countries. The Austrian Freedom Party, Belgian Vlaams Belang, Italian Lega Nord, Slovak National Party and Sweden Democrats have all vowed to join the alliance. If the group does as well as the polls suggest, it would be entitled to over £2million a year in EU funds. But they would be in an even better position if Ukip's expected 25 MEPs were to sign up as well. Marine Le Pen (right) took over from her controversial father Jean-Marie (left) as France's top far right politician in 2011 . Mr Wilders said: 'The elections are historic because many Eurosceptic parties, in the UK, Netherlands and France, will have a very good result. 'If they are not the outright winners they will be second in many cases. That is historic. 'People are fed up. We want to decide who we invite into our country, how we spend our money for Dutch taxpayers, not to give it to Greece or Cyprus. 'We have to be masters again of our borders and budgets.” Nigel Farage shares a hatred for the EU with other far-right European politicians - but insists he will not join a formal alliance because of the Front National's alleged anti antisemitism . But Ukip has insisted that there will no alliance with Mr Wilders and Miss Le Pen. Ukip's Roger Helmer said on Twitter today: 'Memo to Gert Wilders: UKIP MEPs will absolutely not sit with Marine Le Pen's party. Ever.' A party spokesman added: 'Ukip has made it clear that the party will have nothing to do with Front National or any of its fellow travellers in their new group. 'There have been no contacts between Nigel Farage and Geert Wilders.'","Ukip has ruled out working with France's controversial Front National .

"As Nicola Cortese slalomed his way . across the ski runs in the exclusive mountain resort of Lech over New Year, Southampton's executive chairman knew it would be all downhill. In . his path was Katharina Liebherr, the heiress to the £3billion . fortune left to her on trust by her father Markus after his sudden death in August 2010. The . story has picked up speed since his return, gathering momentum as . Liebherr's daughter continued with her bid for power behind the scenes . at St Mary's. Meet the boss: Katharina Liebherr leaving St Mary's Stadium after visiting the ground on Thursday . In the driving seat: The interference from Liebherr led to Nicola Cortese's resignation from the club . In charge: Katharina Lieberr, the new non-executive chairman of Southampton . End of an era: The club have accepted the resignation of Nicola Cortese . Popular: Katharina Liebherr's father Markus had preferred to leave the running of the club to Cortese . July 2009 Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr buys Southampton for a reported £14million. August 2009 Liebherr appoints Italian Nicola Cortese, the man who brokered the deal, as new executive chairman. March 2010 Manager Alan Pardew guides Southampton to the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy — their first silverware since the FA Cup in 1976. May 2010 Club . finish seventh in League One despite a  10-point deduction for going . into administration, narrowly missing out on the play-offs. August 2010 Liebherr dies of a heart attack. Daughter Katharina takes over ownership of  the club. August 2010 Cortese controversially sacks Pardew two weeks into the season. September 2010 Nigel Adkins is handed a three-year deal to replace Pardew as manager. May 2011Southampton gain automatic promotion to the Championship. May 2012 Club reach the Premier League after successive promotions. January 2013 Cortese upsets fans by axeing Adkins and bringing in little known Mauricio Pochettino from Argentina. May 2013 Southampton finish 14th in the league, with fans pleased by Pochettino’s progress. August 2013 Club are tipped for a strong season after spending £30m in the summer. January 2014 Cortese resigns and Katharina Liebherr takes over as chairman, putting Pochettino’s position at the club in the balance. On Wednesday night, just after 7pm she won, but the fear is that Southampton will be the biggest losers. Cortese had tolerated Katharina until she refused to allow him to continue in his executive role without interference. The Italian, a banker by profession, established The Southampton Way when Markus Liebherr took the club out of administration in 2009. He lived and breathed Southampton. Each day, when he walked up the main staircase at St Mary's and headed towards his office suite, he passed a mural on the wall which reminded his staff of their ambition. Katharina, who has no experience of running a football club and until recently had little interest in the sport, will run the show from now on. Katharina has been in London this week, spending much of her . time in the offices of her lawyers Allen & Overy. She will be non-executive chairman of the . club and intends to appoint a chief executive to handle Southampton's . affairs. The transition will not be easy. Southampton are a . thriving Premier League club, the good news story as a succession of . homegrown players make their way into the first team. One of Southampton’s academy recruits is Cortese’s son, . while his wife is also heavily involved in some of the club’s community . projects. This week's . events have been bubbling since last summer, when Katharina arrived . unexpectedly at the club's pre-season training camp in the stunning . Alpine setting of Velden, Austria. It was on the banks of Lake . Worthersee, on the decking of the Seespitz Restaurant on the evening of . Wednesday July 24, that she made her first serious demands to be . involved in the day-to-day running of the club. Until that moment . Cortese had held her at arm's length as he went about the business of . establishing Southampton as a force again in the Barclays Premier . League. It was Cortese who decided to fire Alan Pardew in August 2010 and replace him with Nigel Adkins. Southampton . won two successive promotions before Mauricio Pochettino, who was . discovered by Cortese during a scouting mission to Espanyol for a player . two years ago, was brought in on January 18 last year. Between . them they convinced raw academy graduates such as Luke Shaw, Calum . Chambers and James Ward-Prowse to remain at Southampton, even when they . had better offers elsewhere. Home is where the heart is: Cortese's 'Southampton way' was epitomised by club captain Adam Lallana . Uncertain future: Manager Mauricio Pochettino is ready to leave Southampton . There is a commitment to developing . homegrown talent, something Cortese believes is his responsibility to . English football and the national team. All that is now in jeopardy. At . the club's Marchwood training centre, the elaborate plans for a world . class facility for the game's top players is coming together at . breathtaking speed. Soon there will be a hotel for the players to . stay in when they return from long away trips to avoid disturbing their . families at 3am when they return home. Before the . team bus arrives at the appointed hotel for away games, Southampton . staff have already been into the rooms to vacuum them to reduce the risk . of infection. Each player has his own mattress, which is . taken to the team hotel the night before the team arrives. It is this . stunning attention to detail which separates Cortese and the team he has . assembled at St Mary's. They are an ambitious bunch. In and out? Pochettino walks into the reception at St Mary's on Wednesday evening and (below) drives away . This is Cortese's vision, something he aspired to when he arrived at Southampton following the Liebherr takeover in 2009. The . Italian believed he owed it to Liebherr to restructure the club and . fulfill his ambition to bring Champions League football to the south . coast for the first time. The executive chairman knows that it . is a highly ambitious target and yet the players who signed last summer - . Victor Wanyama and Dejan Lovren - were convinced they could do it. On Wednesday morning many of the players were openly threatening to walk away from . the club when they realised Cortese was about to quit. Many of them have close relationships with the Italian and they exchange regular text messages with the team. On Wednesday night, Cortese got the message loud and clear. James Coney, Money Mail editor and lifelong Southampton fan gives his . view on his club after chairman Nicola Cortese resigned on Wednesday. Many Saints fans will be thinking one thing: here we go again. For . years, fans endured boardroom rows as the chairmanship of the club . swapped hands. The football was bad – and the management of the club . even worse. After years of teetering on the brink finally Southampton sunk in to  League One and administration. Marcus . Liebherr was the saviour of the Saints. He not only rescued the club . financially, but built a plan, and put leadership in place to deliver . the club back to the top flight. It may have taken a while for fans to . warm to Nicola Cortese (and many, including me, were outraged when he . ousted former manager Nigel Adkins, pictured right). But every decision he has made has . later proved to be right – he was a capable and much envied chairman. Fans have even started dreaming of trophies and European football. And it’s not just on-field success that Saints fans have had to come to terms with – but a reputation of being a well-run club. When . Liebherr passed away suddenly in 2010 – just a few years in to his . takeover – all Saints fans feared that the funding and plans he put in . place would die with him. After all, how much could the family of this Swiss billionaire really care about some small team on the south coast of England? Typically, . just as things were starting to look rosy for the Saints, a new . boardroom row looks set to tear apart everything that has been built. With . Cortese gone, Mauricio Pochettino will surely follow. And after that, . who next? Lallana, Shaw, Lovren, Osvaldo, Schneiderlin? All are envied . by others in the top flight. A club that seemed upwardly mobile, has sunk its fans in to the depths of despair again.","Nicola Cortese quit as Southampton executive chairman on Wednesday .

"A late bid by Queens Park Rangers to sign West Ham winger Matt Jarvis fell through due to Premier League rules on Monday night. Rangers held talks over a loan deal for the 28-year-old, who has struggled for first-team football this season due to injuries and a loss of form. QPR wanted to sign winger Matt Jarvis from West Ham on deadline day . The transfer was complicated by QPR having taken forward Mauro Zarate  on loan from West Ham last month. Premier League clubs are only allowed to have one player on loan from another Premier League club so QPR wanted to send Zarate back to Upton Park. It was reported that the Premier League initially backed the proposal but the deal fell through when it became clear that a a temporary transfer must be from one transfer window to the next. QPR were unable to sign Jarvis because they already Mauro Zarate on loan from West Ham . QPR were keen for Zarate to return to West Ham and considered taking Carlton Cole on loan instead . There were also reports that QPR asked for special dispensation to sign Jarvis and that was refused by the Premier League. It is understood that QPR had made it clear earlier this week they wanted to send Zarate back to West Ham and negotiate another loan deal, with Jarvis and Carlton Cole the options. The Premier League strugglers are now stuck with Zarate, who has made just one substitute appearance since joining the club on a temporary deal at the start of January.","QPR wanted to sign winger Matt Jarvis on loan from West Ham .

"FIFA's rule makers could decide this month to let teams use a fourth substitute in extra time. The idea could take effect in July if the proposal is passed at a meeting of the International Football Association Board, known as IFAB, in Northern Ireland on February 28. Designed to help teams cope with tired and injured players in the extra 30 minutes of play, the plan has been supported by World Cup-winning Germany coach Joachim Loew. FIFA's rule makers could decide this month to let teams use a fourth substitute in extra time . It's the most high-profile decision set to be taken by IFAB, which will also begin discussions about the potential use of video replays to aid refereeing discussions. FIFA President Sepp Blatter surprised IFAB members in Brazil when he launched that idea last June at the governing body's congress in Sao Paulo. Other items of discussion included on the agenda released Monday includes whether to relax a 'triple punishment' rule where a defender can make a challenge that results in a penalty kick, a red card and suspension. FIFA president Sepp Blatter proposed the change to lawmakers in Sao Paulo back in June . A proposal by the US Soccer Federation could change the way stoppage time is calculated, by giving the fourth officials their own match clock to advise referees and give a more accurate estimate. Other ongoing talks and trials include 'sin bins' in youth football to sideline players for several minutes as a replacement for some red-card offenses. IFAB includes delegates from the four British football associations and FIFA. Since last year, it takes advice from panels of technical and football experts selected from across the world.

"Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon has joined Everton on loan for the remainder of the season. Everton will pay £1million up front but the clubs have not agreed a fee to make the deal permanent. The Merseyside club confirmed the signing on their Twitter feed around 10.30pm on Monday, half an hour before the 11pm deadline. Speaking to evertonfc.com, Lennon said: 'I’m really looking forward to seizing this opportunity at a club with such a history and with such great potential, too. 'The manager wants to play exciting, attacking football and I’m determined to make a big contribution over the remaining games.' Aaron Lennon (right, playing against Partizan Belgrade in November) has joined Everton on loan . Lennon will join up with Roberto Martinez's side until the end of the current season . Everton manager Roberto Martinez is delighted to have clinched the signing of Lennon, saying: 'We all know what Aaron will bring to our squad with his experience and know-how, his involvement with England in two World Cups and the landmarks he has set in the Premier League. 'At 27, Aaron will be a really important asset to our squad and he will represent a real boost in terms of attacking options from now to the end of the season. His pace and trickery will fit in well at Goodison.' Lennon is eligible to make his debut against Liverpool on Saturday. Jermaine Jenas, who played with Lennon at Spurs, revealed on BBC Radio 5 Live that he had received a text from him saying he had agreed personal terms with Everton. Lennon had appeared to be heading to join another former Spurs team-mate - Jake Livermore - at Hull City, but the Tigers' woeful form led to a cooling in the winger's interest. Stoke City were also keen to sign Lennon, who has been capped 21 times by England, but Martinez appears to have won the race for his signature. The signing will be Everton's first of the transfer window. The Merseyside club have, however, sold Samuel Eto'o and Hallam Hope, and loaned out youngsters Chris Long and Mason Springthorpe.

"Philippe Coutinho has agreed a new long-term Liverpool deal, with Brendan Rodgers predicting he will become world-class. The Brazil midfielder arrived at Anfield from Inter Milan in the January transfer window two years ago and has now signed a contract which takes him through to 2020. The move will be welcomed by supporters, who are also hoping to see Raheem Sterling sign a new deal soon. Philippe Coutinho has agreed a long-term Liverpool deal, keeping him at the club until 2020 . The Brazilian playmaker set up both goals as Liverpool beat West Ham 2-0 at Anfield on Saturday . Sportsmail revealed that Brazil midfielder Coutinho was close to signing a new deal earlier in the year, click here to see how we broke the story. He set up both goals in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday and it has prompted manager Rodgers to liken his qualities to those of Real Madrid’s Luka Modric. Liverpool's boss recognises that Coutinho needs to improve his goalscoring form — he has scored just twice this season — but believes the 22-year-old has the potential to blossom into one of the top performers in the Barclays Premier League. ‘You see his quality in his two assists at the weekend,’ said Rodgers. ‘They were sublime. The first pass was incredible invention. ‘If you look at Modric, he doesn’t have a big goalscoring record but he is a world-class player. ‘If he can improve his goalscoring, Coutinho will be getting into the bracket of being world-class.’ Liverpool are still hopeful of agreeing a deal with Burnley to sign striker Danny Ings to avoid the need for a tribunal when his contract ends in the summer.

"Robin van Persie says that the presence of Wayne Rooney makes him a better player – and believes he has the same effect on his Manchester United team-mate. The pair are currently sidelined because of injury and United have struggled amid their absence. Last season they scored 38 top-flight goals between them as the Red Devils sauntered to the Premier League title. VIDEO  Scroll down to watch RVP: Moyes needs time to turn things around . Better together: Robin van Persie has said his partnership with Wayne Rooney has improved both players . Compliment: Van Persie said the pair are so good together because they are both 'nine and a halves' And Van Persie feels there is more to come from the double act. 'We realise that we are stronger when we are playing together, as a partnership,' the Dutchman told UEFA Champions magazine. 'You . are always stronger, in any sport, in life, when you are doing stuff . together. With a player of Wayne’s calibre, we can go from strength to . strength, and we can become even better. 'One . game he will score a couple, the next game I will score a couple. It is . important that this partnership is becoming even stronger.' Struggles: Both players have suffered with injury this season and United have endured a poor start . Van Persie believes that he and Rooney boast a 'rare' quality. 'In a way we are both ""nine-and-a-halves"", because we can play high up front and we can drop,' he went on. 'That is an extra quality we have, which is quite rare. If you look around you have loads of main strikers, target men, foxes-in-the-boxes, and you have No 10s who are dropping in more. 'With us it’s not obvious because we can both do that job. Wayne is doing a bit more, because he is playing behind me, but we can both do it.' The ultimate goal: The pair's strikes brought a league title to Old Trafford last season . Meanwhile, Van Persie has revealed that some words of wisdom from AC Milan legend and former Holland manager Marco van Basten helped to sharpen his focus in front of goal. 'The way he (Van Basten) looked at football was ice cold,' reflected Van Persie. 'I remember a game against Manchester City and I hit the bar, the post twice and one chance went just by it, and we lost that game. 'I went to play for Holland and he asked me: “How was your game?” I said: “Yes, actually quite good.” Then he said: “How was your game?” I said: “Yes actually not bad. I was a bit unlucky, but I think I played well. I hit the post and the bar...” 'He said: “No, no, Robin, it’s not good enough. You need to make sure that you score those goals, that they don’t hit the post or the bar, and you should not be happy if it hits the bar or the post, because the bar or the post is not a goal. So, no it was not good. I watched the game and you’ve got to change your mentality of looking at those situations.” 'He opened my mind, because he was right.' Ice cold: Marco van Basten changed Van Persie's mentality by saying that the striker should not be pleased with hitting the woodwork . Advice: Van Basten, now Herenveen boss, managed Van Persie at international level . Van Persie and United return to Champions League action next month when they face Olympiacos in the last 16. The Rotterdam-born star was just 11 when he watched Ajax lift the trophy in 1995 courtesy of Patrick Kluivert's toe poke against AC Milan. Van Persie says that is one of the goals he wishes he had scored. 'It wasn’t beautiful but it changed his life,' he said, 'He was 17 or 18 at the time, it was an unbelievable stage to score such an ugly, important goal which won them the Champions League. One wish: Van Persie says Patrick Kluivert's winning goal in the 1995 Champions League final against AC Milan was the one he wishes he'd scored . 'Arjen Robben’s goal last year, it was very special, to do it in the 89th minute, it’s a dream come true, and I was really happy for him when I saw that. 'He deserved that, he’s worked so hard over the years, he’s had some ups and downs, he is a great player. To enjoy a moment like that, to score the winner in a Champions League final in the 89th minute, that’s dream stuff. 'And, of course, Zidane’s volley against Leverkusen in 2002. That was a beautiful one as well.' The Big interview: The Dutchman on the cover of UEFA Champions magazine .

"Sky Sports have rolled out their big-name pundits on transfer deadline day, and it is a move that Gary Lineker found rather puzzling. Among Sky's studio experts on Monday was former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who recently moved into a career in the media having just retired from the game.

"Spared jail: Ben Edgell, 31, kissed two teenage girls while working as a teacher at a boarding school . A public school sports teacher who kissed two teenage students after 'grooming' them with text messages and trips to the New Forest has been spared jail. Ben Edgell, 31, was a sports coach and house tutor at the £31,000-a-year Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, when he pursued the girls, then aged 16 and 17. The liaisons began after he swapped mobile numbers with them and encouraged them to meet in the school's cricket pavilion and on the golf course, a court heard. Edgell was sentenced to three months' jail, suspended for a year, after he pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual activity with a child by a person of trust between 2009 and 2013. He was also ordered to pay £500 costs and to remain on the sex offenders' register for seven years. Bournemouth Crown Court heard he struck up an illicit relationship with the first girl, then 16, when he was in his mid-20s. He met her twice outside school, taking her for drives in his car to the New Forest and kissing her. He also met her a number of times at the school's secluded cricket pavilion at night, where again he kissed her. Edgell moved on to his second victim two years later, the court heard. He became 'flirtatious' with her before sending her texts, telling her he loved her and another in which he made lewd suggestions about her 'ending up naked'. He went on to meet up with her on the school's golf course where he kissed her. The court heard both girls consented to the behaviour, but Edgell was caught after the second girl spoke about the matter to the school's head of sport. Edgell, who coached cricket and hockey at Canford, had been a well-regarded teacher and had a flat on school grounds in his role as a boarding house tutor, the court heard. Prestigious: Edgell had a flat on the grounds of the £31,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset where he worked . He was suspended from his job and resigned soon afterwards, initially denying any wrongdoing when interviewed by police. The court heard it is now unlikely he will ever teach again. David Bartlett, prosecuting, said Edgell contacted his first victim through Facebook. 'They swapped mobile numbers and a week later he suggested they meet up,' he said. 'He met her at a train station and drove her to the New Forest. They went for a walk, chatted and kissed. 'She said he initiated the kiss but she wasn't forced into it. She found it quite exciting because he was a teacher. 'They carried on texting and a few weeks later he took her for a drive again and they kissed again. Formerly a respected member of staff, Edgell is unlikely to work as a teacher again, the court heard . 'He continued to text her saying he wanted to do more stuff but it never went beyond kissing. 'They did meet on occasions inside the cricket pavilion. He had keys and she thought his presence there wouldn't be surprising. 'He kept saying don't tell anyone, which annoyed her, and then she stopped communicating with him.' Mr Bartlett said he began texting the second victim two years later. He said: 'He sent her texts saying ""I want you, I'm falling in love with you"", but she was hesitant about meeting him. 'She met him by the school golf course where he held onto her jumper and kissed her with tongues. Then she didn't hear from until the next term.' Referring to pain she was suffering, he wrote: 'I wish I could do something about it but I would get in trouble and you would end up naked.' Audrey Archer, defending, said his client had brought shame on his family over the matter. She said: 'He deeply regrets having kissed both these schoolgirls. He accepts full responsibility for his actions. He accepts he should have known better. 'He was going through a difficult time personally at the time of these incidents - he was struggling in gaining access and custody to his son and not having much of a life outside the school. 'His parents are deeply disappointed by the fact their son is before the court for these offences. They are a decent, good family and this has brought shame on them, which is something Mr Edgell feels greatly sorry for.' Judge Peter Johnson told him: 'When you were in your mid to late 20s you were a well-regarded sports teacher. 'You engaged in inappropriate French kissing with them on a number of occasions after you groomed them with texts. Liaisons: Edgell met the two girls on the grounds of Canford School in Dorset (pictured) where he worked . 'Parents of school children and the public trust teachers to behave properly and not take sexual advantage of children. 'You broke that trust. You told one girl not to tell anyone and sent wholly inappropriate messages to another. 'You have lost your job, your good character and been subjected to public shame. It is unlikely you will ever be allowed to teach again.' 'Groomed'? A judge said Stuart Kerner was seduced by a pupil, then 16, and spared him jail . There were dozens of complaints last month after a judge claimed a 16-year-old girl had 'groomed' religious education teacher Stuart Kerner - despite him taking her virginity in a store cupboard. A 'loophole' meant that because his sex offence was not within the Attorney General's unduly lenient sentence review scheme, the punishment cannot be changed. The former vice-principal of London's Bexleyheath Academy, 44, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence - but it was the judge's comments that prompted the biggest outcry. Mrs Justice Joanna Greenberg told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her. It was she who groomed you and you gave into temptation when you were vulnerable.' The judge was set to be investigated over the comments she made in court. The religious education teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust. Inner London Crown Court also heard he took her home for sex  while his wife was out. Kerner, who denied any guilt and said the girl invented the affair, has launched an appeal in a bid to overturn the conviction and clear his name.","Ben Edgell, 31, lived in a flat on the grounds of Canford School in Dorset .

"Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has signed for West Bromwich Albion on a three-and-a-half-year contract. The 30-year-old completed his move late on Monday night after an extension was granted for the deal to be completed beyond the 11pm deadline. Fletcher's initial deal is for two and a half years with the option of a further 12 months. Fletcher was poised to sign for West Ham on Saturday but the deal fell through after Sam Allardyce's side attempted to make the deal a loan instead of permanent deal. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United . Fletcher  joined West Brom on a three-and-a-half-year deal from Manchester United . Fletcher told West Brom's official website: 'It feels great. This is a fantastic new challenge for me in my career. 'I've spent my career at Manchester United and it's all I've ever known. 'But I felt it was the right time to move and I'm not sentimental about doing that - I have great memories obviously, but I'm now a West Bromwich Albion player and I cannot wait to get going. 'Everyone involved in making the deal happen has been fantastic. And a big reason I'm here is because of the head coach. 'He has impressed me from the first minute. When someone shows how much they want you it's a great feeling.' Manchester United took to Twitter to thank the Scottish midfielder for his service to the club . United had already agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer and manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement. 'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.' Fletcher was due to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal at West Ham worth around £60,000 a week. Fletcher (left) celebrates Premier League success with Manchester United alongside Wayne Rooney in 2009 . Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season.

Annette Gabbedey, 48, creates delicate rings, earrings and bracelets, inset with with diamonds, opals and other precious stones in her workshop in Frome, Somerset. But the expert goldsmith uses no special tools to help her work and says she cannot imagine how people with fingers manage to do it. Scroll down for video .

Mrs Gabbedey, who trained at London's Hatton Garden, specialises in opals and other precious stones . Shop: The goldsmith runs her own studio and boutique in Frome's picturesque Catherine Hill . Mrs Gabbedey said: 'I'm quite normal . and not disabled at all.  But I do appreciated that people are . fascinated by me being able to create something. 'Making jewellery is very tactile, and something you do with your hands, and people ask how I manage to create jewellery, let alone the day to day things. 'My answer to that is: ""How do you manage with fingers?"", because they must get in the way.' Mrs Gabbedey, who says she was always encouraged by her family to 'get out there and sort it out', studied jewellery-making at school and college before training amongst the jewellery experts of London's Hatton Garden. She moved to Somerset 24 years ago, and now has a reputation as one of Britain's finest craftsmen and opal specialists.

'It really is just fingers that I am missing.  I've got the joints and the movements which means I have got the dexterity to be able to hold small items.'

"Geography clearly isn’t his strong point but Jermain Defoe proved he still knows the route to goal. Having announced himself delighted to be in the USA when unveiled by Toronto FC last January, the 32-year-old was at it again — this time admitting he was stumped when asked to name the capital city of the country where he spent the best part of 12 months before his lucrative return to the Premier League. His failure to identify Ottawa in a match programme general knowledge quiz was one of the rare occasions the Sunderland forward put a foot wrong.

Defoe is congratulated by Gus Poyet after being substituted in the 75th minute of the Premier League clash . Burnley are closing in on Birmingham City’s five-year-old Premier League record of 12 successive unchanged line-ups after Sean Dyche sent out the same starting XI for the ninth consecutive game. On the pitch, where it matters most, he underlined just how well he can navigate his way into the danger areas of the opponents’ penalty box. Sunderland were already a goal to the good through Connor Wickham’s early header when Defoe engineered space to convert Patrick van Aanholt’s cross as Gus Poyet’s side earned only a second home league win of the season. Having been a regular scorer on debut for his previous clubs, Defoe had to wait until his third game with his latest club to open his account. ‘As a forward you’re just waiting to get that first goal,’ he said. ‘We created plenty of chances and I felt a lot sharper because of the games I’ve now played.’ Defoe, pictured with his Sunderland team-mates, has revealed he is starting to regain his sharpness .","Jermain Defoe scored his first Sunderland goal since January switch .

"Horrified: Christopher Fiddes, 78, outside his home in Watford, Northamptonshire . Christopher Fiddes hoped his lovingly restored Georgian home would be a nest egg for his daughter. But the 78-year-old artist was shocked to discover that permission for a wind farm just 500 yards from his doorstep has knocked £100,000 off its value. An energy company was granted approval for five turbines up to 400ft tall on appeal – after the local council  rejected the plan. Mr Fiddes moved into the converted farmhouse near the village of Watford, Northamptonshire, with his late wife Jane 20 years ago, and now lives there with his daughter Cordelia, 16. After fully renovating the property, he asked estate agents for a valuation. He was horrified when they told him that since the wind farm was approved eight months ago, his home has plummeted in value from £400,000 to £300,000. Mr Fiddes said: ‘At my age I shall die when my daughter is still relatively young, perhaps before she has met somebody and fallen in love, or goes to university. ‘All I have to leave to her is this house so it seems particularly harsh. I’m worried for her future.’ The value of thousands of properties near wind farms is feared to be at risk as the number of onshore turbines nears 4,000 and is set to more than double in the coming years. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who is sceptical about wind farms, has commissioned an official report into the impact of green energy on rural areas – reportedly against the wishes of LibDem energy secretary Ed Davey. The application for the wind farm near Mr Fiddes was made by green energy firm Volkswind in 2009 and rejected by Daventry District Council. But the firm appealed to the local Planning Inspectorate and was given the go-ahead last December. Mr Fiddes has corresponded with the Planning Inspectorate and the Department of Energy and Climate Change about his house price but said the replies he received were ‘a sop’. Home: Christopher Fiddes, 78, with his daughter Cordelia Fiddes, 16, outside their home where permission has been granted for a wind farm . He said: ‘The inspector decided it could go ahead in the national interest, irrespective of it being very much against the wishes of the local residents. ‘DECC seem to be in denial about the impact on homes and about the noise impact. ‘To meet our 2020 targets an area of rural Britain the size of Wales would have to be covered in wind farms. Is that how we want our landscape to look? ‘Britain earns a hell of a lot of its income from tourism so blighting the landscapes of Shakespeare and Constable in this way is really not viable for an island this size. It will ruin our precious land forever.’ Last year the government’s Valuation Office Agency admitted wind farms can wipe tens of thousands of pounds off the value of homes, saying it had been forced to re-band homes into lower council tax categories as a result. Mr Fiddes’ local MP, Tory Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘Wind farms definitely affect house prices and I would expect there to be billions of pounds of planning blight because of turbines close to properties.’",Christopher Fiddes says the wind farms will 'ruin our precious land'
"Mitt Romney will decide whether to compete for the Republican presidential nomination within the next weeks. Talk show host Larry King says Romney made the disclosure during a chance encounter the two had at the airport over the weekend. With Romney seriously considering another go at the presidency, GOP presidential hopefuls are ratcheting up their attacks on the 2012 nominee's last campaign, aiming to blast enough holes in the former Massachusetts governor's possible bid to sink it before it sets ashore. But Romney's close friends and backers say his faith may be driving him to run again anyway. Hi, it's me again: 2012 Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney is thinking about running again in 2016 to the chagrin of his party's other potential candidates . Talk show host Larry King, center, says he ran into Mitt and wife Ann at the airport at Mitt told him he'll be making a final decision on 2016 within the next two weeks . At a forum on Sunday night in California hosted by a conservative non-profit, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul invoked Romney's wife, who insisted last year that her husband wouldn't run for president again, and said: 'I’m kind of with Ann Romney on this one: ""No, no, no, no, never.” ' Speaking at the same forum Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blamed Romney's infamous '47 percent' comment and the rationale behind it for the GOP's loss in 2012. 'I think Mitt is a good and decent and honorable man, and I think he ran a very hard campaign,' Cruz began. 'But the central narrative of the last election, what the voters heard, was ""we don't have to worry about the 47 percent."" 'And I think that Republicans are and should be the party of the 47 percent,' he argued. Romney - along with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush - has become a pinata for Republicans considering presidential campaigns in recent days as they angle to present themselves as the GOP's best foot forward heading in the 2016 general election. After Bush and Romney met for a private, face-to-face chat on Thursday in Utah, Paul trolled the two so-called establishment candidates on Twitter with memes of friendship bracelets and charms. 'Dear Mitt, 3rd time's a charm,' a photo featuring a silver bracelet with a note attached read, along with Bush's signature. Earlier this month, after news of Romney's interest in the 2016 contest broke, Paul said the GOP needed 'a new approach, a fresh approach.' Sunday at the Freedom Partners gathering in Palm Springs Paul said of Romney, 'I think he's a good man, he's a generous man, and he would have been a great president. He would have been much better than this president. 'But to win the presidency,' he said, 'you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies, and I just don't think it's possible [for Romney to do that.] . 'If he thinks well, I'm just going to change a few themes, and next time, I'll reach out to more people than that... I think it's a little more visceral than that, how you connect with people,' he continued. Paul said he's 'just not sure' Romney would be able to make that kind of connection 'with enough people to win a general election.' Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul trolled Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday after it was announced that the two so-called establishment candidate would meet privately. Asked Sunday if Romney should run again, Paul said: 'No, no, no, no, never' Dark horse GOP candidates Donald Trump and Sarah Palin also derided a Romney revival tour over the weekend. Trump told reporters in Iowa on Saturday for conservative Congressman Steve King's Freedom Summit, 'Mitt had his chance. ... And he choked.' 'You don't want to give a person like that a second chance. ... they'll absolutely lose to the Democrats,' Trump added, referring to both Romney and Bush, a first-time presidential candidate himself but the third person in his immediate family to pursue the Oval Office. 'I just don't think they can win,' he said. Trump argued that America's had 'enough of the Bushes.' 'We're bushed out.' Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was none-to-thrilled about the prospect of either Romney or Bush carrying the GOP's torch in 2016 when asked about them on Friday by ABC News. 'I can’t wait for new energy,' the 2008 vice presidential nominee-turned reality TV star said, joking. Palin said she'd be 'interested' in running for president next year but stressed that she doesn't necessarily need to be a candidate. Most importantly, she said, is that the Republican primary 'be a competition and not a coronation.' 'I think he's a good man, he's a generous man, and he would have been a great president,' Paul said Sunday night during a forum at a Freedom Partners meeting in Palm Springs, California, that was aired in part by ABC News. 'But to win the presidency,' he said, 'you have to reach out and appeal to new constituencies, and I just don't think it's possible [for Romney to do that.]' If Romney does run, his Morman faith will be contributing factor, allies say. His contemplation of a third presidential campaign comes from an 'almost devout belief that he needs to do something for this country,' Kirk Jowers, a fellow Mormon and the former chair or Romney's political action committee told the New York Times. 'In the Mormon faith, public service is one of the most honorable things you do — to participate in local and national politics is a very honorable thing to do,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Romney advocate who the Times says has spoken recently with the Republican politician. 'The idea of try and try again is something that’s ingrained in the religion,' as well, he noted. Jowers said another attempt at higher office would also give Romney a platform to testify about his faith - something he didn't do in previous campaigns. 'In 2008, Romney risked being a caricature of the Mormon candidate,' he said. 'Now everyone seems to know everything about him, and that will be very liberating for him to talk about his faith.' Should Romney make it his mission to win the GOP nomination again in 2016, early polling shows he'd be well positioned. Nearly a third of Republican voters and right leaning independents in first in the nation state New Hampshire say they'd vote for Romney again if the primary were held now. Romney also tops Iowa voters' lists. He lead his closest potential rival, Bush, by seven points in a recent Gravis Marketing poll. A Bloomberg survey released in December showed that Romney couldn't beat Hillary Clinton in a general election match-up if she were to also run and win her party's nomination, but he, Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would have the best odds. The three Republicans would lose to Clinton by six points, the poll found. Paul would take an eight-point lashing, and Cruz would face a double-digit whooping of 13 percentage points.","Rand Paul invoked Mitt Romney's wife and said: 'I’m kind of with Ann Romney on this one: ""No, no, no, no, never” '
Ted Cruz blamed Romney's infamous '47 percent' comment and the rationale behind it for the GOP's loss in 2012 .
'Mitt had his chance. ... And he choked,' dark horse candidate Donald Trump said. 'You don't want to give a person like that a second chance'
Romney allies say his strong faith is driving him to consider a third try at the presidency ."
"The father of a Dutch schoolgirl killed on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has penned an open letter blaming Vladimir Putin for his daughter's death. Elsemiek de Borst, 17, was killed alongside her mother, step-brother and step-father when the Boeing 777 passenger plane they were travelling on was shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine by a surface-to-air missile last Thursday. Now her father Hans, who lives in the town of Monster, has posted a grief-stricken open letter online outlining all the things his daughter had planned to do after leaving high school and accusing the Russian president and pro-Kremlin rebels in eastern Ukraine of ruining his life. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Grieving father Hans de Borst (left) has penned an angry letter to Vladimir Putin after his daughter Elsemiek (right) died in the Malaysia Airlines crash over the Ukraine . Tragic: 17-year-old Elsemiek de Borst was killed alongside her mother, step-brother and step-father when the Boeing 777 passenger plane they were travelling on to Malaysia was shot out of the sky over eastern Ukraine . Elsemiek and her mother were among 193 Dutch nationals to die when flight MH17 was blown out the sky by a surface-to-air missile while flying over eastern Ukraine last Thursday. In an open letter written in Dutch, Mr de Borst said: 'Mr Putin, Many thanks to the Separatist leaders of Ukrainian government for the murder of my dear and only child, Elsemiek.' 'She is suddenly no more! From the air she was shot in a foreign country where a war is going on,' he added. 'I hope you're proud of including her and her young life was shot up too, and you can look in the mirror,' Mr de Borst went on to say. Innocent victims: Elsemiek, pictured here with her father Hans de Borst, was among 193 Dutch nationals to die when flight MH17 was blown out of the sky. She died alongside her mother, step-father and step-brother . Anger: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte (left) he had made it 'crystal clear' to Vladimir Putin that he must use his influence in eastern Ukraine to ensure unhindered access to the crash scene for international investigators . Grief: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Dutch ambassador to Ukraine Kees Klompenhouwer lay flowers in commemoration of the MH17 victims . High school pupil Elsemiek was travelling for a holiday to Malaysia with her mother, step-father and step-brother when the plane was shot out of the sky, killing 295 passengers and crew. Outlining his daughter's plans for the future, Mr de Borst said: 'Elsemiek would next year take her final exam, along with her best friends Julia and Marina, and she did well in school. She then wanted to go to TU Delft to study engineering, and she was looking forward to it.' Mr de Boorst's open letter comes as anger grows in the Netherlands over the treatment of victims' bodies at the crash site. The Dutch have widely condemned the way the bodies of loved ones have been left piled up in body bags at the side of the road for several days as they rapidly decay in the summer heat. Piled up: Rescue workers are pictured above at the MH17 crash site in Grabovo, eastern Ukraine, moving bodies onto trucks . The Dutch have widely condemned the way the bodies of loved ones have been left piled up in body bags at the side of the road for several days as they rapidly decay in the summer heat . 'No words can describe it, said Silene Fredriksz-Hoogzand, whose son Bryce and his girlfriend Daisy Oehlers died on their way to a holiday in Bali. 'Bodies are just lying there for three days in the hot sun. There are people who have this on their conscience. There are families who can never hold the body of a child or a mother.' 'When I am in my bed at night, I see my . son lying on the ground... I see Daisy. I see Bryce. I see them in my . head. I see it. They have to come home, not only those two. Everybody . has to come home.' Ms Fredriksz-Hoogzand was among scores of victims' relatives expected at a behind-closed-doors meeting this morning near the central city of Utrecht, where they were to be consoled by King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Grisly: The bodies of almost 200 victims of the MH17 plane disaster are seen for a fourth day in a refrigerated train which has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken the corpses . Stench: A rebel can be seen holding his nose as the door to a carriage containing the heaped bodies is opened . An armed separatist soldier covers his nose and mouth, shielding himself from the corpses' smell while OSCE inspectors investigate . Mr Rutte told the families that getting the bodies home as soon as possible was his government's top priority, adding that he had made it 'crystal clear' that Putin must use Russia's influence in eastern Ukraine to ensure unhindered access to the crash scene for international investigators . He said a Dutch military transport plane was ready to repatriate the remains, which are now being stored in a refrigerated train in a rebel-held town. 'If the train finally gets going and the bodies get to Ukraine-controlled territory then we would prefer - and a Hercules is ready at Kharkiv airport - to get the bodies back to the Netherlands as soon as possible,' Mr Rutte said. Right-wing lawmaker Louis Bontes has urged the government to send special Dutch forces to secure the crash site. ""This messing around with our people can go on no longer... Our people must be brought home now,' he said.","Hans de Borst attacked Vladimir Putin in emotional letter published online .

"Change of approach: Caitlin Durkovich, assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at Homeland Security says the agency is also looking at environmental threats, not just terror . They're tasked with protecting the United States from terrorists and keeping America's biggest cities safe, but Homeland Security's brief appears to be widening to include more global issues like climate change. The department that was created by President Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks says that the role of the organization is 'to assist in the wake of disasters, whether they be man-made or natural'. However, claims of 'mission-creep' are now being hurled at the department which is attempting to redefine its role as one of emergency management than of protection and security against enemies of the state. Throughout it's 13 year existence, there has been persistent criticisms the department is wasteful, ineffective and has been far from transparent in how the agency is run, and how money is spent on a day-to-day basis. In fact, claims of bureaucracy seems well-founded as the departments expanded role verges onto that of its partner agency, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It is exceptionally murky how the tasks of 'emergency management' are to be divided between the two government departments. In the aftermath of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which devastated large swathes of the Northeastern U.S  Durkovich said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on 'how to think about baking in resilience from the get-go' The Department of Homeland Security now has  a team of specialists, including city planners, in conjunction with the National Academy of Science to develop better tools for planning . 'Increasingly, we've moved not only from a security focus to a resiliency focus,' said Caitlin Durkovich, speaking at a panel at the Rising Seas Summit, a three-day conference organized by the U.S.-based Association of Climate Change Officers to discuss tools and ideas on building resiliency, particularly against rising sea levels. In the aftermath of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which devastated large swathes of the Northeastern U.S and caused over $60 billion in damages, Durkovich said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on 'how to think about baking in resilience from the get-go.' Now a team of specialists, including city planners, along with a partnership from the National Academy of Science to develop better tools for planning, are part of her team. In New York, 'Hurricane Sandy really highlighted our vulnerability' to climate change, said panelist Daniel Zarrilli, director of the city Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency. Extra help: The Department of Homeland Security already has launched regional efforts to assess resilience of infrastructure and judge where gaps in adaptation and preparedness may be . New targets? A protester dressed as a polar bear dances in the streets during the 'Flood Wall Street' last weekend . The city is still recovering from the effects of the storm, which flooded most of its extensive shoreline, left tens of thousands without electricity for days, did billions of dollars of damage to infrastructure and killed 44 people, he said. Scientists predict that climate change will cause more intense storms, frequent heavy precipitation, heat waves, drought, wildfires, extreme flooding, and higher sea levels. The Department of Homeland Security say this may alter the types and magnitudes of hazards that communities and emergency management professionals face, impacting mitigation, preparedness, and response and recovery operations. The department is now working regionally to assess the resilience of infrastructure and judge where gaps in adaptation and preparedness may be, said Durkovich. The agency has not specified if its enhanced role will affect the effectiveness of what it is best known for - to identify and curb terrorist threats to the homeland.","Department of Homeland Security was formed after 9/11 terrorist attacks .

"Sunderland striker Connor Wickham insists another fight for Barclays Premier League survival has never crossed his mind. The 21-year-old scored his fourth goal of the season in Saturday's 2-0 victory over Burnley which hauled the Black Cats into 14th place and four points clear of the drop zone. It was their first win in the league in six attempts since December 21 and just their second of the season at the Stadium of Light. Connor Wickham heads Sunderland's opener past Burnley goalkeeper Thomas Heaton . Sunderlands fans look on in expectation as Wickham leaps highest to head home a vital goal . However, Wickham, whose five goals in three games at the end of last season provided the platform for the club's unlikely great escape, has never even considered the prospect of having to produce a similar fightback this time around. He said: ""You can never guarantee you are safe - you just have to look at last season. We were seven points adrift and then we managed to avoid it. I don't think anybody can guarantee safety until it's mathematical, so we are not even thinking about that. ""Obviously the aim is to stay in the Premier League and do the best we can, but I don't think - well, for me personally, relegation has never crossed my mind, so it shouldn't for the team either."" Sunderland January acquisition Jermain Defoe embraces manager Gus Poyet in the 2-0 home win . Head coach Gus Poyet, despite his delight at a performance and result which answered his pre-match challenge to make the game a turning point in a difficult season, was swift to warn his team they had done little more than start a process which needs to continue over the weeks and months ahead. However, the manner in which victory was achieved will have come as a welcome relief as his efforts to find a system in which new signing Jermain Defoe could prosper finally paid dividends. Having abandoned the three-man defence he had employed in the previous two fixtures, he opted for a system which allowed Wickham to support Defoe and full-backs Anthony Reveillere and Patrick van Aanholt to get forward, and that proved to be Burnley's undoing. Strike partners Wickham and Defoe appeal to the referee during the Premier League clash with Burnley . Wickham headed home Reveillere's 20th-minute cross to open the scoring and when Defoe slid home Van Aanholt's pull-back 14 minutes later for his first Sunderland goal, the points were secure. The former Ipswich frontman said: ""We played well as a team and we looked comfortable. I have not had much of a chance to play in a game situation with Jermain. On Saturday, we got the opportunity and we both managed to score, which is good."" It was not a good day, however, for the Clarets, who left Wearside sitting just one place and a single point above the relegation zone. They were poor in the first half, although Ashley Barnes might have headed them into an early lead, and while they rallied after the break, they never really looked like rescuing the situation. Burnley manager Sean Dyche gives his squad some pointers during the game at the Stadium of Light . Manager Sean Dyche said: ""That is life in the Premier League. We have been learning, we are improving, I am sure of that, over the season. We are still on good shape. ""I always remind you people thought we would need snookers at Christmas and we didn't, and we are still active. ""It's a learning curve for these players on a weekly basis and it's another big reminder that you have to be on top of your game for every minute, certainly when you are us. We can't come away from our performance levels and we had too many down. ""At any level of football, it's improbable that every player on your team plays at the top level of their performance every week. But we can't carry threes and fours if they are not on their levels. ""Others can. If you are Chelsea, maybe Arsenal, Manchester United et cetera, if they have three or four players who are well below par, they can still carry that. We need everyone at it all of the time.""

"The man who callously lured firefighters to their deaths in a blaze of gunfire left a typed up note saying that he wanted to burn down the neighbourhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.' William Spengler, 62, armed himself with three weapons, including a Bushmaster assault rifle - the same type of weapon used by Sandy Hook Elementary shooter Adam Lanza - and set his house afire to lure first responders into a death trap. Two firefighters were shot dead and two others are hospitalized. Spengler killed himself as seven houses burned around him Monday. On Tuesday, it was revealed that a body - believed to be his sister Cheryl Spengler - was found in the charred rubble of his home. Scroll down for videos .

A family friend of William Spengler says he 'couldn't stand' his sister and said the two had a difficult relationship. Police have not confirmed for certain that the charred remains are Cheryl's, but it is believed she died in the house. Police . are investigating whether a fight with her sparked the shocking . violence - which took place just ten days after the elementary school . shootings in Newtown, Connecticut. William Spengler has a history of brutality against his family. In July 1980, he beat his 92-year-old grandmother Rose Spengler to death with a hammer. He served 17 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter. He was released in 1998. Authorities believe he used an assault rifle to kill Webster police Lieutenant Mike Chiapperini, 42, and Tomasz Kaczowka, 19, a rookie 911 dispatcher who was best friends with Lt Chiapperini's son. Spengler, who shot himself dead after a brief firefight with police, is a convicted felon and cannot legally own a gun in New York. Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefighters . Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother . However, somehow, he was able to obtain an assault rifle - the same type of weapon that was used to murder 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. Police say Spengler also had a handgun. Roger Vercruysse, who claims Spengler was a good friend when they lived next door in Webster, a Rochester suburb, said Spengler 'couldn't stand' his sister, Cheryl Spengler. Police were unable to locate her since the home she shared with William Spengler was burned down. Mr Vercruysse said Spengler 'loved his mama to death.' Arline Spengler died in October, and Mr Vercruysse wonders what effect that had on her 62-year-old son. He says he thinks William Spengler 'went crazy' after she died. Police say they don't have a motive for the killings on the shore of Lake Ontario. However, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports that detectives believe a fight between William Spengler and his sister Cheryl, whom he lived with, could have sparked the horrific violence. The victims, Lt Chiapperini and Kaczowka, were public servants who bravely volunteered to be firefighters in their off-hours. Lt Chiapperini was a community leader who was heavily involved as a volunteer firefighter and had held nearly every post at the fire house. He even trained Mr Kaczowka, who spent three years of high school training in the department's Explorer program. In addition, two full time fire men, Joseph Hofsetter and Theodore Scardino were shot and wounded by the gunman and are currently in nearby Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, along with John Ritter, an off duty police officer who was hit by shrapnel from the volley of bullets. Mr Hofsetter, who is also a full-time firefighter with the . Rochester Fire Department, was hit once in the pelvis and the bullet . lodged in his spine, authorities said. Mr Scardino was hit in the chest and . knee. All three men are in a guarded condition according to West Webster fire Chief Gerald Pickering, who confirmed that there was only one gunman and that it appears the fire was started as a trap. 'It does appear it was a trap set for first responders,' said a visibly emotional Pickering at a press conference this morning.

Tomasz Kaczowka was a Monroe County 911 dispatcher according to officials . Joseph Hofsetter and a friend: The West Webster firefighter is currently in hospital in Rochester having been shot by the unidentified gunman . Police say Spengler set fire to a car and house to lure firefighters to his house on the shore of Lake Ontario about 5.30am. When firefighters arrived, he ambushed them and opened fire. The West Webster . Fire District learned of the fire early Monday after a report of a car . and house on fire on Lake Road, on a narrow peninsula where Irondequoit .

Joseph Hofsetter was injured in the shooting and was rescued by a police SWAT team in the town of West Webster . Mike Chiapperini and his son Nick - who also works at West Webster Fire Department . Monday's shooting and fires were in a neighborhood of seasonal and year-round homes set close together across the road from the lakeshore. The area is popular with recreational boaters but is normally quiet this time of year. 'We have very few calls for service in that location,' Pickering said. 'Webster is a tremendous community. We are a safe community, and to have a tragedy befall us like this is just horrendous.' O'Flynn lamented the violence, which comes on the heels of other shootings including the massacre of 20 students and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. 'It's sad to see that that this is becoming more commonplace in communities across the nation,' O'Flynn said.Webster, a middle-class suburb, now is the scene of violence linked to house fires for two Decembers in a row.

"Fox News unveiled its revamped newsroom Monday to the delight of critics who see comedy gold in the studio's rows of reporters dwarfed by gigantic monitors. Newly minted breaking news head anchor Shepard Smith leads a video tour of his new Fox News Deck, where 'viewers can watch us sort it all out as it happens' on 55-inch touch screens. While the monitors are impressively large, internet reaction to the big reveal suggests not everyone is convinced it will translate to better breaking news. Scroll down for video...

'That's where our journalists will be,' Smith says in the video as he walks around the new studio, 'using brand new tools to track developing stories and bring them to your screen as quickly as possible. We call these BATs. Big area touchscreens.' According to Mashable, those nearly five-foot screens are Microsoft's Perspective Pixel touchscreens, which retail for $8,000. Fox also confirmed to Mashable that the screens run windows 8, for those unable to see the screens for themselves. In addition to the giant touch screens, the Fox News Deck features a wall that displays Twitter and a 38-foot-long wraparound screen that Smith can control with a wand. Fox says the outside remodel was done to appeal to cutting edge, 'nonlinear' news consumers, but many who watched the video find the changes a little over the top. The unveiling was immediately turned into a joke across social media. What a view: Smith, who is now the face of breaking news, shows off one of the 55-inch touchscreens, which Fox says will help revolutionize their news reporting process .

Information specialists is what Smith says the reporters manning the huge screens are called. Meanwhile, some think they should be called something else. 'Fox News hires tiny little humans to work on gigantic iPads,' tweeted @BoingBoing. The revamp comes just in time for Fox News' 17th anniversary. The changes were made while Smith was away for surgery, starting in mid-September, and the Fox News Deck has now gone live. Smith will now make appearances on the network from his futuristic platform whenever breaking news happens, he says, or 'whenever news warrants.'","Shepard Smith unveiled his new studio Monday, which features rows of reporters and their massive tablet computers ."
"Frontline: Edward Kennedy, pictured here on Anzio beach in Italy on March 1 1944, was the first journalist to report on the German surrender in World War II . In the final moments of World War II in Europe, Associated Press correspondent Edward Kennedy gave his news agency perhaps the biggest scoop in its history. He reported - a full day ahead of the competition - that the Germans had surrendered unconditionally at a former schoolhouse in Reims, France. For this, he was publicly rebuked by the AP, and then fired. Kennedy had defied military censors to get the story out. Winston Churchill and American president Harry Truman had agreed to suppress news of the capitulation for 36 hours in order to allow Stalin to stage a second surrender ceremony in Berlin. Kennedy was accused of breaking a pledge that he and 16 other journalists had made to keep the surrender a secret for a time, as a condition of being allowed to witness it firsthand. 67 years later, the AP's top executive is apologizing for the way the company treated Kennedy. 'It was a terrible day for the AP. It was handled in the worst possible way,' said president and CEO Tom Curley. Kennedy, he said, 'did everything just right.' Curley rejected the notion that the . AP had a duty to obey the order to hold the story once it was clear the . embargo was for political reasons, rather than to protect the troops. 'Once the war is over, you can't hold back information like that. The world needed to know,' he said in an interview. Julia Kennedy Cochran, daughter of . former AP Paris bureau chief Ed Kennedy, points to her father in a . picture taken during the German surrender in 1945, at her home in Bend, . Ore. Curley, who is . retiring this year, has also co-written an introduction to Kennedy's . newly published memoir, Ed Kennedy's War: V-E Day, Censorship & The . Associated Press. Scoop: The New York Times on May 8, 1945, showing news of the end of the war in Europe . Kennedy, who died in a traffic . accident in 1963, had long sought such public vindication from his old . employer. His daughter, Julia Kennedy Cochran, of Bend, Ore., said she . was ""overjoyed"" by the apology. 'I think it would have meant a lot to . him,' she said. The German surrender happened at 2.41 . am on May 7, 1945. Kennedy was one of 17 reporters taken to witness . the ceremony. He and the others were hastily assembled by military . commanders, then pledged to secrecy by a U.S. general while the group . flew over France. As a . condition of being allowed to see the surrender in person, the . correspondents were barred from reporting what they had witnessed until . authorised by Allied headquarters. Initially, . the journalists were told the news would be held up for only a few . hours. But after the surrender was complete, the embargo was extended . for 36 hours - until 3 pm the following day. Kennedy was astounded. 'The absurdity of attempting to bottle up news of such magnitude was too apparent,' he would later write. Kennedy, centre left, with the AP Paris staff in the early hours of May 18, 1945 before returning to America . Nevertheless, he initially stayed . quiet. Then, at 2.03 pm,, the surrender was announced by German . officials, via a radio broadcast from Flensburg, a city already in . Allied hands. That meant, Kennedy knew, that the transmission had been . authorised by the same military censors gagging the press. Furious, . Kennedy went to see the chief American censor and told him there was no . way he could continue to hold the story. Word was out. The military had . broken its side of the pact by allowing the Germans to announce the . surrender. And there were no military secrets at stake. The censor waved him off. Kennedy thought about it for 15 minutes, and then acted. He . used a military phone, not subject to monitoring by censors, to . dispatch his account to the AP's London bureau. Notably, he didn't brief . his own editors about the embargo or his decision to dodge the censors. The AP put the story on the wire within minutes. To . some of Kennedy's competitors, the scoop was a betrayal on the scale of . Pearl Harbor. Compounding their anger, military censors continued to . refuse to allow any other news organization to send their own stories, . meaning the AP would continue to have an exclusive for a day. Julia Kennedy Cochran, points to her father in a picture taken during the German surrender on May 7, 1945 . 'I am browned off, fed up, burnt up . and put out,' wrote Drew Middleton, a New York Times correspondent. He . called the suppression of the story 'the most colossal ""snafu"" in the . history of the war.' His newspaper followed with an editorial chastising . the AP for initially boasting of a historic 'news beat.' 'If . it was a ""beat"",' the paper wrote, 'it was one only because Mr. Kennedy's sixteen colleagues chose to stand by their commitments.' Retribution . was swift. The military briefly suspended the AP's ability to dispatch . any news from the European theatre. When that ban was lifted, more than . 50 of Kennedy's fellow war correspondents signed a protest letter asking . that it be reinstated. The military expelled Kennedy from France. Condemnation also came from the AP's president at the time, Robert McLean. 'The . Associated Press profoundly regrets the distribution on Monday of the . report of the total surrender in Europe which investigation now clearly . discloses was distributed in advance of authorization by Supreme Allied . Headquarters,' he said in a public statement on May 10. Kennedy's report in the New York Times, left, and the cover of Ed Kennedy's War, the book remembering him . The AP's general manager, Kent Cooper, said Kennedy should have conferred with his editors about the decision to publish. Later, he addressed a letter to the reporter saying that he had violated a 'cardinal principle' of journalism by breaking a pledge to keep the surrender confidential. 'No employee of the Associated Press has the right to disregard what is defined by the source as a pledge of confidence, when he knows that those who meant to impose it still hold it to be in force,' he said. Other journalists defended Kennedy. In an essay in The New Yorker, published May 19, 1945, under the subhead 'The AP Surrender,' A.J. Liebling absolved Kennedy of breaking the 'pledge' he had supposedly made aboard the aircraft flying to Reims. 'Whether a promise extorted as this one was, in an airplane several thousand feet up, has any moral force is a question for the theologians,' Liebling wrote. 'I suppose that Kennedy should have refused to promise anything and thus made sure of missing an event that no newspaperman in the world would want to miss.' Apology: Tom Curley, President and CEO of AP, says Kennedy 'did everything right' Wes Gallagher, the AP reporter who succeeded Kennedy in Europe and became the general manager after Cooper, strongly supported his colleague and believed he had done the right thing. According to the memoir, Gallagher told Truman's successor, President Dwight D. Eisenhower: 'If I'd been Kennedy, I'd have done the same thing - except that I'd have telephoned you first.' After being fired by the AP, Kennedy took a job as managing editor of the Santa Barbara News-Press in California, and then went on to become publisher of the Monterey Peninsula Herald. He died at age 58 after being struck by a car. Kennedy wrote the war memoir before his death. His family held on to the manuscript for decades before his daughter, Cochran, began looking for a publisher. She said that even though she was only 16 when her father died, she got the impression he still took great joy in his career, despite the episode. 'Some people said after the war, ""Oh, Ed Kennedy is a broken man. He's out there editing some little newspaper in California."" I think people had this idea that he was feeling sorry for himself. But he wasn't. He wasn't the kind of person who sat around and felt sorry,' she said. Curley said Kennedy's daughter approached him around the same time he had become interested in the matter while helping with work on the book Breaking News: How The Associated Press Has Covered War, Peace, and Everything Else. The publication of Kennedy's memoir prompted the AP's apology, Curley said. He called Kennedy's dismissal 'a great, great tragedy' and hailed him and the desk editors who put the surrender story on the wire for upholding the highest principles of journalism. 'They did the right thing,' Curley said. 'They stood up to power.'","Journalist Edward Kennedy witnessed surrender in France in May 1945 .

"Southampton striker Graziano Pelle has defended ‘dirty’ Diego Costa and claims the Chelsea frontman has to adopt a physical approach to protect himself from Premier League defenders. Pelle studied Costa’s methods, which have landed the Spanish international in trouble with the FA, while learning his trade in Holland. Italian Pelle will employ some of those techniques when Ronald Koeman’s Champions League hopefuls tackle Swansea on Sunday. Southampton's Graziano Pelle grapples with Crystal Palace duo Marouane Chamakh and James McArthur . Martin Skrtel (right) tells Diego Costa exactly what he thinks of the Spaniard's style of play . Costa is forced to watch the draw with Manchester City from the stands following his three match ban . Pelle, 29, said: “When I was playing in Feyenoord Joris Mathijsen was our defender. He had played for Malaga and he said ‘Graziano, Diego Costa is a good player but he is a ‘asesino’ - an assassin. He is really and you are not’. “He told me that three years ago. Now when I see Costa play I can see. “You have to be aware, kick before you receive. Every game I go off the field with my ankle bruised. England is like this. If you don’t give, you will receive 100 per cent. Pelle (right) has a war of words with Palace defender Damien Delaney at St Mary's Stadium . “He plays in a dirty way, but this is the way he plays. I don’t like it if you give an elbow - from the defender or from the striker. “Defenders always do it and you don’t see the defender criticised. It’s because they are a defender and the striker shouldn’t do it? “It’s like me, every game I get pushed. I don’t have to say to the referee ‘Oh, I got pushed’. It is better next time I will be stronger. Costa (left) shows West Ham United keeper Adrian he is not afraid to be the tough man on the pitch . “I know that I have to protect myself and be strong, but I don’t like it when anyone does something to injure a player. “I have watched Costa a lot. He is a good player. “I know his story in football. He was away on loan, then he got injured, then he start to play and scored so many goals. But when I see how he plays, he is a very good striker. “ . Pelle is dreaming of emulating bad boy Costa by leading an unfashionable club into the Champions League. Costa was part of the Atletico Madrid side who won La Liga last season and lost narrowly to Real Madrid in the European final. Pelle is dreaming of emulating role model Costa by getting Southampton into the Champions League . Pelle, whose goals have helped fire Southampton to an unlikely top fourth berth, said: “We believe in our quality and we want to continue what we are doing. “There are many teams like Tottenham, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham all competing for the Champions League. I really wish that at the end of this season it will be good for us. “If you see what Atletico Madrid did last year, they have really good players but you can see that money is not everything. “It’s about the way you play, we enjoy the way we play football. We believe in our squad, but I cannot say now that we will be third. It is small details that can make the difference.” Pelle reels away in celebration as he grabs Southampton's second of the game against Sunderland .","Graziano Pelle studied Diego Costa's methods when playing in Holland .

"A new book on the hidden life of Fidel Castro claims the Cuban leader lived in luxury on his own private island, which included a turtle farm. It was thought that Castro, who is now rarely seen in public, lived a simple, austere life similar to his fellow Cubans in the communist country. However, in the new book La Vie Cachée de Fidel Castro (Fidel Castro's Hidden Life), a former bodyguard says Castro never renounced 'capitalist comforts'. A new book claims Fidel Castro, pictured here in 1997, lived the life of luxury on his own private island . The book by a former bodyguard adds that Fidel Castro never renounced 'capitalist comforts' Juan Reinaldo Sánchez, who worked for the leader for 17 years and now lives in America, says that the vast majority of his . countrymen weren't aware of their leader's lavish lifestyle, which is in . stark comparison to normal Cubans. He claims that Castro had a private island, Cayo Piedra, south of the Bay of Pigs, describing it as a 'Garden of Eden', complete with a turtles and dolphin farm. He adds that he reached the island by sailing there on his luxury private yacht, which featured rare Angolan wood and motors given by the Soviet president Leonid Brezhnev. Other properties he owned included an estate in the Cuban capital Havana, with a rooftop bowling alley and medical centre as well as a bungalow with a private marina. Mr Sanchez also claims that Castro always had at least 10 bodyguards, including two 'blood donors' wherever he went. Castro now rarely makes appearances in public. He is pictured on his last public appearance at the opening of an art gallery in Havana in January . The book claims that Castro always had at least 10 bodyguards, including two 'blood donors' wherever he went . It was thought that Castro, right, pictured with Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, lived a simple life in Havana . In the book Mr Sanchez says: 'Contrary to what he has always said, Fidel has never renounced capitalist comforts or chosen to live in austerity. Au contraire, his mode de vie is that of a capitalist without any kind of limits.' He also added that while Castro was enjoying these luxuries, the Cuban economy was starting to collapse after the their main trading partner the Soviet Union began to disintegrate. Mr Sanchez also recalled how Castro's favourite film was Soviet version of Tolstoy's War and Peace  and that his bodyguard wrote everything he did down in a notebook 'for history'. News correspondent Barbara Walters being driven around Cuba on a sightseeing tour by Castro in 1977. Other journalists to have met him say he seemed to live a simple, austere life . He also says that most were also . unaware of Castro's complicated love life and that he had nine children, . as the Cuban media was forbidden from mentioning them. The former bodyguard decided to help with the book, written by French journalist Axel Gyldén, after he claims fell out of favour with Castro and was imprisoned and after asking to retire. He says he was thrown into jail 'like a dog' in a cockroach infested cell and tortured. On his release, he then went to live in America, like many Cubans in the country. Raul Castro, who is now leader of Cuba after his brother Fidel stepped down due to ill health . The author Mr Gyldén told the Guardian: 'This is the first time someone from Castro's intimate circle, someone who was part of the system and a first-hand witness to these events, has spoken. 'It changes the image we have of Fidel Castro and not just how his lifestyle contradicts his words, but of Castro's psychology and motivations.' In 2006, Forbes magazine listed the Cuban leader as one of the world' richest leaders but Castro denied the report. Other journalists who have interviewed him say although he has the best food and healthcare, he does not lead a lavish lifestyle. Castro ceded power to his brother Raul in 2008 after falling ill in 2006 and has kept a low profile in recent years. It even fuelled rumours that he may have died, however he has made short occasional appearances although he is starting to look very frail. In January, he appeared in public for the first time in nine months, when he attended the opening of an art studio in Havana. But despite the change in leadership, Raul has is said to have made little change to Cuba. Castro, pictured here in 2004, ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006 . Fidel Castro was born in Cuba in August 26 in a sugar plantation in the south-east of the island. He went to the University of Havana to study law and intended to run in the 1952 election, which was then cancelled. In 1953, he and brother Raul led an unsuccessful uprising against General Fulgencio Batista and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He fled to Mexico on his release under an amnesty where he joined together with Argentinian Marxist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. In 1956, the pair and their insurgents began a guerilla war against the government, which was overthrown in 1958. The next year Castro was sworn in as prime minister of Cuba and adopted a communist regime. In the 1960s Castro allowed Soviets to build sites for nuclear missiles, when they came close to war with the United States, sparking the Cuban missile crisis. In the following decades, Cuba struggled economically due to the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of their main trading partners. Castro eventually stood down as leader of Cuba in 2008 following a bout of ill health, handing over power to his brother Raul.","Claims made in new book by former bodyguard Juan Reinaldo Sanchez .

"For every couple buying their first home together is momentous life event. And with a price tag of £3.6million Euan and Suzanne Blair's new marital home in central London is more than a new couple could ever dream of. But the new Mrs Blair is not the Mrs Blair listed on the property deeds. Land Registry documents have revealed the six-bedroom Georgian town house in Marylebone is joint owned by Euan and his mother Cherie Blair. The new Mr and Mrs Blair (left) have moved into their new £3.6million Georgian townhouse (right). But the new bride is not the Mrs Blair listed on the house deeds after Euan purchased the home with his mother Cherie Blair . Cherie was also the joint owner of her eldest son's former home, which was sold for £860,000 profit. It implies the barrister retains a control over her son's finances, as she does for her other children Kathryn and Nicky, with whom she also jointly owns properties. David Kirwan, of Kirwans Solicitors, told The Telegraph Suzanne Blair - the daughter of Jonathan Ashman, a motor racing entrepreneur, and the stepdaughter of TV weather presenter Sian Lloyd - would find it harder to claim a share of the value of the house, were her marriage to end in divorce. He said:  'She would face an uphill . task if the marriage ended, particularly if they hadn't been married for . long,' he said. 'As a wife . she would have some claim on the property, but it would be a much more . litigious matter than if she was registered as joint owner, when there . would be a presumption of a 50/50 split. Cherie and Tony Blair, pictured at Euan and Suzanne's wedding in September . 'It looks very much like a case of Tony and Cherie Blair managing their empire of assets.' The couple dated for eight years before marrying in The South Pavilion, the £5.75 million Grade I-listed mansion in Buckinghamshire, owned by Tony and Cherie Blair. Just days before they tied the knot, the 30-year-old, who is thought to be preparing a bid to become an MP, and his mother completed on the sale of the new property in Marylebone. The impressive house boasts a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bathrooms and two reception rooms and is close to Regents Park. The couple moved after selling their previous home, also in Marylebone. The four-storey property bought for £1.29million in 2010 was put on the market for £2.35million. Three years later the house has been sold for £2.15million, netting the Blairs £860,000 in profit. Euan and his mother paid £3,625,000 for the six-bedroom new house, a short walk from their previous home. Cherie has interests in eight properties, with a total value of around £24million. Euan recently moved from his job at investment bank Morgan Stanley, taking up a new post at Sarina Russo Job Access, a Coventry-based recruitment agency. It was seen as an indication that Tony Blair's eldest son was preparing to run for MP. However Labour has already selected its candidate for the Coventry North East seat, rumoured to be the 30-year-old's preferred target, leaving him with a six-year wait for the 2020 General Election, his first chance of becoming an MP for the constituency.","New bride Suzanne Blair is not listed on the deeds of the couple's home .

"Decades after the last concentration camps of the Second World War closed their doors, many guards who were in charge of overseeing them are now being tried for suspected war crimes. To secure convictions, prosecutors are using a mixture of testimonies and archived paperwork alongside modern techniques, including 3D modelling. One model of the iconic Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland could even reveal exactly how much the guards were aware of during their time at the death camps, although images of this are yet to be released to the public. A German prosecutor built a 3D virtual model of Auschwitz-Birkenau, stock image pictured, that model provides a 360-degree view of the concentration camp. It can be programmed to show what individual guards would have seen from watchtowers. This could be used to prove they were aware of deaths in the camp, for example . Officers from Queensland are using a . handheld 3D scanner to perfectly record computer models of indoor and . outdoor scenes of crime. Called . Zebedee, because of the way it moves like its namesake in The Magic . Roundabout, the scanner has previously been used to produce models of . famous landmarks and shipwrecks, yet this is the first time the . technology has been used to fight crime. Using Zebedee, also known as ZEB1, . police can now easily access these hard to reach places and map confined . spaces where it may be difficult to set up bulky camera equipment and . tripods. It also means less disturbance of the crime scene and scans can be uploaded in almost real-time. The surge in cases follows a landmark ruling in 2011 that set a precedent for guards to be tried for murders that happened during their watch, even if they weren’t individually involved in the deaths. John Demjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor camp in Poland, was convicted for being an accessory to the murder of 28,060 people who died during 1943. Up until then, cases required evidence linking suspects explicitly to specific killings. Many guards have previously claimed the camps were so large they couldn’t possibly have known what was going on in individual rooms and sections. While building a case into suspect Hans Lipschis, now 94, Stuttgart prosecutor Ralf Dietrich, used 3D modelling software to reconstruct Auschwitz and its outbuildings. The digital model can be used with online tours, pictured, of the the camp, as well as other information, including the years guards served, and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps . His model provides a 360-degree view of the camp and it can be set to show what was visible from individual watchtowers. Lipschis was a cook at Auschwitz and the model also reveals what was visible from the kitchen. ‘Many former guards say that they didn’t know anything because they couldn’t see from where they were serving,’ Dietrich told Melissa Eddy at the New York Times. ‘This allows us to go in and look at whether that is true. What could one see from a watchtower? Could you see the chimneys of the crematoria? Could you see smoke?’ The model can also be used with online virtual tours of the the camp, as well as other information, including the years guards served, and any changes that were made to the layout of the camps. In February, the case was dismissed due to the age of the defendant but Dietrich claims its model could be used in future cases.","A German prosecutor built a 3D virtual model of Auschwitz-Birkenau .

"Facebook has launched a pilot scheme selling strangers access to users' inboxes. The social networking website has introduced a fee, believed to be $1, to guarantee that messages are routed to a recipient's 'inbox' and not their 'other' folder, where they are likely to be ignored. Facebook has billed it as giving users the chance to hear from people they do not know but who have an 'important' message for them. It argues the fee will actually cut down on the amount of unwanted messages. Networking: Facebook will guarantee a message is routed to a user's inbox . But the trial, which began yesterday, . has sparked fears that businesses will be happy to pay such a low . charge and bombard people's inboxes with advertising. Facebook previously only allowed messages into an inbox if the recipient was 'friends' with the sender. It also uses algorithm . calculations to let 'relevant' messages through, such as those sent from a 'friend of a friend'. All other messages are routed to the other folder, similar to a junk or spam email filter. Social: Facebook allows friends to message each other instantly . Facebook said the US pilot involves only a 'small number' of individuals and is limited to one message a week for each inbox. A statement on its website said the 'experiment' is also limited to 'personal messages between individuals'. Experiment: The pilot is running in the US and open to a 'small number' of people . Facebook is testing a new look layout for its users' profile pages. Tabs replace the 'friends' and 'photos' thumbnails to make a cleaner looking menu towards the top of the page. The user's name is lifted into the cover photo, while the timeline has also been given an overhaul. The chronological updates appear in a single line on the left of the page, with photos and friends information running down the right. This replaces posts appearing on the left and right of the page, which often makes it difficult to follow the chronology. A Facebook spokesman told ABC News: . 'This is a new design Facebook is testing with a small percentage of . people to make navigating timeline even easier.' Users also do not have to navigate away from a profile page to view a person's friends or photos. They instead scroll down to below the 'about' information. It continued: 'Several commentators and . researchers have noted that imposing a financial cost on the sender may . be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and facilitate . delivery of messages that are relevant and useful.' 'If you want to send a message to . someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with, or if you . want to message someone about a job opportunity, you can use this . feature to reach their Inbox. 'For the receiver, this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them.' Writing on allthingsd.com, technology . journalist, Peter Kafka, highlighted that users cannot opt out of . receiving the paid for messages. He also said Facebook will look to 'tinker' with the $1 fee over time, but added: 'The one-message-a-week cap, combined with the $1 fee, will prevent your inbox . from filling up with spam.' Facebook has also tweaked its message settings, with users able to select a 'basic' or 'strict' filter. The latter means a person will receive 'mostly' messages from friends in their inbox. Anyone who previously selected the 'friends' setting will automatically have their messages set to 'strict'.

At 34 weeks, Montaño ran the 800-meter race at the U.S. Track and Field Championships at the end of June in Sacramento, California. The 28-year-old former University of California track star finished last in her heat, but that didn't matter for the then-expectant mom. 'That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,' Montaño said at the time. Healthy: She continued to run and train with the encouragement of her doctors and says she felt 'really good' 'What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby. ...

"It has long been said that dog owners look like their pets and it’s a subject that has left scientists bemused for years. But now researchers say that the resemblance is no coincidence and found strangers can identify owners and their dogs with an 80 per cent accuracy – and the clue is in the eyes. Japanese psychologist Sadahiko Nakajima, of Kwansei Gakuin University in Japan, has been determined to resolve the idea after becoming doubtful over people’s belief that there is any likeness. Scroll down for video . David Beckham (right) and the family's pet bulldog Coco (left) - but do their eyes look similar? Scientists believe the resemblance between dogs and their owners lies in a similarity in the eye shape . Do you think Simon Cowell (left) resemblances one half of his pet dog duo Diddly and Sqiddly? New research says that there is evidence strangers can identify dogs and their owners in 80 per cent of instances . He took pictures of dogs and their owners at a ‘dog lovers field festival’ before asking 502 students to look at two sets of test sheets of the 20 dog-owner pairs with their faces side by side – one sheet was a real pair while other was fake. They were also put into four different ‘masking’ situations where they were shown either the entire face or versions that had certain features covered, for example the eyes or the mouth. Participants were simply asked ‘choose the dog-owner pairs that physically resemble each other’. In the trial showing the full face, 80 per cent picked the correct pairing. The group that was only shown the dogs and owners with a panel covering the mouth scored 73 per cent. But most surprisingly 40 students of the group of 50 (74 per cent) that were shown only the eyes still correctly guessed the dog-owner pair. Nakajima, who has done previous research into the same subject, was so surprised by their ability to do this by only seeing the eye regions that he ran the same experiment on a fresh group of students - and they scored even higher with 42 of the 55 (76 per cent) choosing the right image set. However, the group that was shown the faces with the eye region covered only scored a chance level of around 50 per cent – strongly suggesting that the resemblance is in the eyes.

Some may so after the report was published by Japanese psychologist Sadahiko Nakajima where he showed participants strangers and their dogs and most got it right . Does the Duchess of Cambridge (left) look anything like her pet black Cocker Spaniel Lupo? Participants in the most recent study ruled out that things like hairstyles were not a feature that mattered in resemblance . The report published in journal Anthrozoös also ruled out the possibility of features such as hairstyles or similarity in obesity make any difference. However in previous research by Stanley Coren, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of British Columbia, he found that when women were shown portraits of dogs and asked how friendly and loyal they looked, they would favour the ones that shared similar hairstyles. His findings showed that people with long hair covering their ears would give higher scores to springer spaniels and those with short hair and visible ears were more generous in their rating of the ‘cock-eared’ Siberian Husky. But Professor Coren has said these most recent findings could support his own research into the resemblance debate. He told The Times: ‘There's a phenomenon in psychology called the ‘mere exposure' effect. ‘If you see something a lot, you tend to develop affection for it. One of the things we see all the time is our own face.’ ‘There is a remarkable amount of variety in eye shape. You have the big round eyes of the spaniel, almond-eyed retrievers and gorgeous human shaped eyes on whippets.’ Elton John (left) is often spotted out and about on the red carpet with his pet Cocker Spaniel Arthur (right) who was 'best man' at his wedding to David Furnish in May .

"The Cold War had young children preparing for nuclear war with duck-and-cover practice drills in classrooms across the country and politicians fearing a call from the dreading a call from the red phone prompting the use of launch codes. Now a graphic artist in Los Angeles imagined what it would look like if nuclear explosions were a part of today’s everyday landscape. Clay Lipsky created a series of composite images that juxtaposed pictures of explosions next to inquisitive tourists who, in keeping with today’s culture of participation and constant sharing, would want to see the incidents for themselves. A different seascape: Los Angeles-based artist Clay Lipsky created graphic designs that put pictures of tourists next to nuclear explosions as a statement on our voyeuristic society . Signs of the times: The artist theorized what it would look like if there were nuclear explosions happened frequently today . Not a sunset: He said that he predicts that people would stand a safe distance away but still watch . ‘This series recontextualizes a legacy of atomic tests in order to keep the reality of our post-atomic era fresh and omnipresent,’ Mr Lipsky wrote in an explanation about the series. ‘Imagine if the advent of the atomic era occurred during today’s information age. Tourists would gather to view bomb tests, at the ‘safe’ distances used in the 1950’s, and share the resulting cell phone photos online,' he explained on his website. ‘Broadcast media would regurgitate such visual fodder ad nauseum, bringing new levels of desensitization.’ Mr Lipsky, who combines is his skills as a photographer and graphic designer in the series, used pictures that he had collected while travelling over the past eight years for the tourist portions of the atomic bomb blast series. Surf's up: A mushroom cloud would create some serious waves . Not the typical scene: Couples and friends would react as if it was nothing to have a nuclear blast occur . Scary sights: The nuclear blast would be a different kind of not-so-natural wonder . He then coupled those off with iconic photos of real nuclear bomb blasts, putting two pieces of real imagery next to one another to create an entirely new product. Mr Lipsky warned that it was the voyeuristic nature of this generation which prompted his series, and he fears that if we were to face a world with more frequent nuclear explosions, his created images may happen in real life. ‘I can only hope that mankind will never again suffer the wrath of such a destructive force, but it is clear that the world would not hesitate to watch,’ he said.",Artist Clay Lipsky created composite images of tourists by nuclear blasts .
"They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market to become one of the season’s most recognisable brands with sales of Canada Goose outerwear expected to top $30million this year alone. In a high profile year in the States, Kate Upton has appeared on the front of Sports Illustrated in one of their fur trimmed, down jackets and nothing much else. It isn't the only firm to market such coats, yet Canada Goose has rapidly established itself as the label of choice for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid weather blown in on the polar vortex. But today MailOnline can reveal that allegations of chilling cruelty and unspeakable animal suffering have been repeatedly levelled at this family business turned multimillion dollar concern. Scroll down for video . The real cost of a $600 coat: Campaigners claim the coyotes that are trapped and skinned for their fur to trim the hoods of Canada Goose coats can be in pain for days. It is unclear whether these images are from Canada Goose trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds . Exhausted, alone and all out of fight, this Coyote awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg . According to animal rights activists, behind every fur trimmed hood and down stuffed coat is a brutal reality of Coyotes trapped and left to suffer in the wilderness. Many of today's ethically aware consumers would never dream of buying a full length fur. But in an  odd quirk of the current trend for this style of garment those same shoppers pull on a coyote trimmed coat without a moment's concern for the origins of that little flurry of fur. Lindsay Rajt, Director of Campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said:  ‘Canada Goose uses exclusively Coyote fur on the trim of their coats and those animals are trapped in a way that is just inherently cruel.’ As a company founded and grown in Canada, Canada Goose makes much of their support of North Canadian communities in which, their publicity states, Coyote trapping has been ‘a way of life for hundreds of years.’ According to a spokesperson for the firm: 'The trapping of fur-bearing animals is strictly regulated by the provincial and territorial wildlife departments in Canada. 'We purchase coyote furs from certified Canadian trappers, never from fur farms or endangered animals. Kate Upton going 'Polar Bare' on the cover of Sports Illustrated's 2013 Swimsuit edition, wearing a smile, a white Canada Goose parka and not much else . But PETA has dismissed the standards as ‘window dressing.’ Mr Rajt said: ‘The company’s reference to . AIHTS standards is meaningless and a way of placating and . silencing people with valid concerns. ‘Leg hold traps are still legal in . Canada. Mother animals will chew off their limbs in order to get back to . their young. The trapped animal might be there for days before the . trapper comes and finds them, they are frightened and starving and in . pain during that time. And then they’re bludgeoned or strangled to death . or shot.’ A trapped Coyote howls in pain, its right forepaw held tight in the jaws of a leg hold trap - legal under the AIHTS but cruel according to PETA . Trapped Coyotes can struggle to get free for days until the hunter returns to check his traps. Mother animals separated from their young attempt to chew off their own limbs in a bid for freedom . Ms Rajt revealed that PETA is this week appealing to Canada Goose to abandon their use of fur in favour of synthetic alternatives and to dump their use of real down stuffing. She said: 'PETA is reaching out to Canada Goose to urge the company to switch to innovative, synthetic fur like their top competitor Helly Hansen, which has been fur-free for many years. 'Additionally, we are asking that Canada Goose dump down and opt for revolutionary synthetic technology like the one recently developed by The North Face - Thermoball, which mimics down but offers superior versality.' Ms Rajt claimed: ‘We have been trying to meet with this company, we’ve been trying to engage with them since 2006. ‘The . CEO originally agreed to meet with us in 2008 to discuss trapping . policies and methods but just never confirmed that meeting and then . failed to make himself available to any of our follow ups. 'It is a challenging company for us to work with.' Meg Ryan pictured last month in New York's West Village.

Actress Clare Danes wearing her Canada Goose parka with its distinctive Coyote trim while braving the New York chill . But according to a spokesperson for the company: 'We've corresponded with PETA on numerous occasions and it quickly became evident that they were not interested in a constructive conversation.' Canada Goose was founded in 1957 and has enjoyed remarkable success and rapid growth across the past decade when it started marketing it’s ‘truly Canadian’ ethos to Europe. Today the company employs more than 1000 people and sells its products in more than 50 countries across the world. It continues to manufacture its coats in Toronto and Winnipeg but recently opened its first US Headquarters in Denver, Colorado. Last year it became the official sponsor of the Sundance Film Festival and US Equity firm, Bain, recently bought a majority stake in the hitherto entirely Canadian enterprise. Real fur real suffering: Canada Goose President Dani Reese flanked by his company's distinctive outerwear. He says the company uses Coyote fur 'because it works' The extreme weather outerwear is manufactured in Toronto and Winnipeg though US Equity firm, Bain, now owns a majority stakehold . Founded in 1957 the family company Canada Goose now employs more than 1000 people and sells its garments in more than 50 countries . Canada Goose President Danni Reiss is very clear in his assessment of the importance of the US market to his brand. He said, ‘The States is a market with one of the greatest potentials in the world. The US is growing faster than the overall company.’ Speaking in a corporate video Mr Reiss explained: ‘We use Coyote fur for a number of reasons. Number one, Coyote fur works – it’s functional, it provides warmth around the face in a way no synthetic fabric can. It does that in the coldest places on earth and it is important to realise that sometimes urban centres and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth.’ Coyote fur doesn’t freeze, doesn’t hold moisture, retains heat and is biodegradable. Ms Rajt dismissed the necessity of real fur saying: ‘They actually do have some faux fur trim products and there’s a market for that. There’s no reason why they couldn’t switch completely.’ A spokesperson for Canada Goose said: 'We understand PETA's concerns and we respect the right of people to choose not to wear fur, however, we know PETA does not respect our ethical, responsible use of fur so further conversation won't be productive.' But Ms Rajt insisted: ‘I just don’t believe that . half the people wearing these coats understand what’s really involved in . the making of them. And I just don’t believe that they would make that . same choice if it was an informed one.'","US sales of Canada Goose expected to top $30million this year .

"The Newcastle Thousand Families Study claims common childhood illnesses such as tonsillitis and ear infections can cause hearing loss later in life . Common childhood illnesses such as tonsillitis and ear infections can cause hearing loss later in life, according to results from a famous study. The Newcastle Thousand Families Study monitored 1,142 Newcastle-born babies from 1947 to the present day, measuring their health, growth and development. A quarter of the participants, who are now in their 60s, have had their hearing tested and the results show those who had infections as children were more likely to have hearing loss. Dr Mark Pearce, who led the study at the Institute of Health and Society at Newcastle University, said: 'Our findings show that those who suffered from infections as a child were more likely to have a hearing loss in their 60s. 'Reducing childhood infection rates may help prevent hearing loss later in life. 'This study shows the importance of the Newcastle birth cohorts, with the study initially focusing on childhood infections. 'The study is nearly 70 years old and continues to make a major contribution to understanding health conditions, which is only possible through the continued contribution of cohort members.' Tonsillitis, ear infections and multiple episodes of bronchitis occurring in the first year of life were linked to the condition. Dr Ralph Holme, Head of Biomedical Research at Action on Hearing Loss, said: 'Hearing loss affects as many as one in six people across the UK and is often seen as just another sign of getting old. 'However, the study shows that this is not necessarily the case; illnesses in childhood could have long-lasting consequences for hearing in later life. The renowned study began in 1947, meaning many of the participants are now in their 60s (picture posed by model) 'Hearing loss can have a big impact on a person's life, isolating them from family and friends, and has been linked to other health conditions like depression and dementia. 'These findings remind us that it's never too early to think about protecting your hearing.' Planning for the study began in the 1930s when Newcastle had a high infant mortality rate compared with the rest of the UK. The start of the study was delayed by the Second World War, but got under way in May 1947 when recruitment began for a one-year study of health in infancy.","Famous Newcastle-based study monitored babies from 1947 to present day .

"How do deals still go through after the window closes on transfer deadline day? Why are there always some deals  confirmed after the clock has ticked past 11pm? It is called the 'deal sheet', and it allows clubs up to an extra two hours after the deadline to get their business done. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United after the deadline . 'Sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the Premier League by 11pm,' says premierleague.com. 'The deal sheets allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation. 'The sheet cannot be used before 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. 'Once the sheet arrives, clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, it still has to comply with the FIFA TMS deadline of midnight.' So it means that for domestic deals, as long as the sheet is submitted in full after 9pm, clubs have until 1am to finalise their deals and send the paperwork through to the Premier League. This is why transfers such as Darren Fletcher's switch from Manchester United to West Bromwich Albion can go through up to two hours after the 11pm deadline. Hull City have completed the signing of Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye . For Hull City's  signing of Dame N'Doye from Lokomotiv Moscow, however, the Tigers had just an hour after the deadline. This is because the Premier League allows two hours after the deadline - that is their decision - but international transfers must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight - therefore only giving clubs one hour after the deadline. What is FIFA's TMS? FIFA’s TMS is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance.

"His face a mask of raw shock, a young boy soldier is led away after his friend was killed fighting in Syria. Wearing jeans, trainers and an Adidas t-shirt, he looks like a primary schoolboy but for a green ammunition vest much too big for his small frame and the AK-47 he clutches in his right hand. He is one of a rising number of child soldiers – many barely older than ten – recruited by the increasingly desperate rebel Free Syrian Army to fight President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. In a heart-wrenching video, he catches sight of the body of his friend Ahmad, who had mustered a group to defend the Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers. Worrying: A young Syrian boy holding a Kalashnikov is comforted by a rebel during fighting with government forces on the outskirts of Homs . Tears: The young Syrian boy holds a hand to his face as he cries after witnessing the horror of a comrade being shot dead in battle. He also shouted the dead man's name . Overcome with grief: The boy steadies himself after the grizzly event, which occurred in a battle between his rebel fighters and government forces on the outskirts of Homs . Rebel fighters carry the dead fighter away after he was shot, one of a possible 15,000 victims of bloody conflict . Moments later, Ahmad was dead, his . body carried from the frontline by his brother and comrades – who would . die five minutes later. The boy cries ‘Ahmad’ in his unbroken . voice in the video – the first time the reality of children fighting on . Syria’s frontline has been so vividly captured. An older rebel puts a hand on his shoulder as the boy peers around a corner to see Ahmad’s body being carried away. On the verge of tears, he buries his face in his free hand before being led away – still carrying his gun. Assad claimed today that he has the support of his people - saying he would otherwise have been toppled from power by now. In an interview with the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet newspaper Assad contrasted himself with the late Shah of Iran, who was toppled by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Violence: Smoke can be seen rising from a neighbourhood in Homs . Wrecked: Damage can be seen in the district of Juret al-Shayah in Homs . Devastation: A burning shop can be seen on a road covered in debris in the al-Khalidya district in Homs . 'He led the most important country in . the region, he had a powerful army and was supported by the whole . world. So was he able to stand up against the people? No,' Assad said. 'If I had been in the same situation, . that is if I didn't have the people behind me, I could not have . resisted. I would have been overthrown. How come I'm still standing?' Syria's current bloodshed starting in March 2011 following an initially . peaceful revolt against the 42 years of Assad family rule. Despite this, Assad is confident  that most of Syria's 23 . million people are on his side in the struggle. 'Everybody was calculating that I would fall in a small amount of time. They all miscalculated.' Protests: A group are seen in Sarmada in a demonstration against Assad's rule earlier this week . Anger: Protesters raise their arms as they demonstrate against the Syrian President in central Damascus . He added: 'The overwhelming . majority of the people think like me on this subject.' The underfire Syrian leader also told . the newspaper, which published an interview with him today, that Syria . was under attack from Islamist militants sent by malevolent Arab . countries, and was threatened by Western enmity and Turkish hostility. Assad responded violently to popular . demonstrations at the outset of the uprising and has since used tanks, . artillery, helicopter gunships, troops and militiamen to try to crush . armed rebels and deter Syrians from challenging his power. But he claimed Syria was under attack from Islamist militants. 'The big game targeting Syria is much bigger than we expected,' Assad said. 'The aim is to break up Syria or trigger a civil war. The fight against terrorism will continue decisively in the face of this. And we will defeat terror.' Assad's remarks published today betrayed no hint that he was prepared to consider the kind of political transition proposed by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan with broad Western and Arab backing. Bizarre: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claimed in a speech he has the support of his people otherwise he would have been toppled from power long ago. He also compared himself the late Shah of Iran, pictured right, who was toppled by the Islamic Revolution in 1979 . 'No power, however powerful it is, can defeat a genuine revolution of the people,' he said. 'But we are now waging war with terrorist groups, not the people. And we will wage war because we have to protect ourselves and our people.' An international conference in Geneva last weekend endorsed proposals for a political transition in Syria, but Russia denies the plan implies Assad's departure, as the West insists. Syrian dissidents and Western leaders say more than 15,000 people have been killed in the conflict, with many more wounded or tortured, while Syrian officials say their forces have lost several thousand dead to 'terrorist' insurgents. Assad ridiculed the notion that Syrians wanted him to go. 'Look at the situation: America is my enemy, the whole of the West is my enemy, regional countries are my enemy,' the 46-year-old leader said. 'I am still standing thanks to my people ... Why should I kill the people who stand by me?' The Turkish daily Cumhuriye has published excerpts from its interview with the Syrian leader . over the past three days. In an article earlier this week, Assad said he regretted the shooting down of a Turkish jet by his forces last month. The paper quoted Mr Assad as saying: 'I say 100%, I wish we did not shoot it down.' Pieces collected from the wreckage of the Turkish F4 war plane which was shot down by Syria over the Mediterranean Sea . Tensions on Syria's northern border with Turkey have also soared since Syria shot down a Turkish reconnaissance F4 plane over the Mediterranean on June 22 in disputed circumstances. Turkey said it had retrieved the two pilots' bodies from the jet's wreckage on the seabed and had flown them back to their base in Malatya for burial on Friday. Turkey will join Western and Arab states in Paris on Friday for a third meeting of the anti-Assad 'Friends of Syria' forum. Russia has criticised the grouping as one-sided. China confirmed on Thursday it would not attend the Paris talks, which also involve members of Syria's fractious opposition. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she regretted the absence of Russia and China. 'If we have two important powers within the United Nations not attending such a conference, that is not a positive sign,' she told a news conference. The Paris gathering could help by tightening sanctions on Syria and further isolating it to ramp up pressure on Assad, a senior Western diplomat in Washington said earlier this week. The diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said any clear Russian move away from Assad would weaken his position. 'Whether or not the Russians have told Assad that he is not their best friend, Assad certainly believes the Russians are his best friend and that sustains (him) to a degree.' Lavrov said the leader of the opposition Syrian National Council would be in Moscow for talks next week, but signalled no change in Russia's stance. Assad has made clear he has no intention of stepping down and can count on staunch support from Iran. 'The Americans think only of their own interests, but it is the right of the nations in the region, including the great nation of Syria, to freely determine their own destiny, and other nations should not impose their own demands,' Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday.","Image shows boy of about ten crying out during fierce battle near Homs .

"A flesh-eating form of pneumonia that is easily passed between healthy people on public transport is spreading across the UK, experts have warned. The deadly strain of MRSA called USA300 passes easily through skin-to-skin contact. It can also survive on surfaces and so has the potential to be picked up on crowded buses and tubes. It was first seen in the U.S but cases are now being reported in the community and not just hospitals in Britain. USA300: The deadly MRSA strain can cause large boils on the skin . Dr Ruth Massey, from the Department of . Biology and Biochemistry at the University of Bath, said extra vigilance . was required around this and similar MRSA bugs known as PVL-positive community acquired strains. USA300 is resistant to treatment by several front-line antibiotics and can cause large boils on the skin. In severe cases, USA300 can lead to fatal blood poisoning or a form of pneumonia that can eat away at lung tissue. Dr Massey said there were 1,000 cases of PVL-positive community acquired MRSA in England in the last year, of which 200 were USA300 strains. 'These community-acquired strains seem to be good at affecting healthy people - they seem to be much better than the hospital ones at causing disease. 'They don't rely on healthcare workers moving them around, which the hospital ones seem to.' Dr Massey said USA300 is 'a really big issue in the U.S. and it's starting to emerge here. 'But hopefully because we are aware of it and are working to understand it, it won't become as big of a problem (in the UK).' In a new research paper published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, Dr Massey and colleagues analyse the way community-acquired MRSAs are able to adapt and fine tune themselves to spread outside of hospitals. MRSA bacteria in hospitals has not been able to migrate into the community in the same way. Dr Massey said: 'Our research found that the composition of the cell wall of the bacteria is critical to the community-acquired bacteria being more toxic. Different danger: MRSA bacteria in hospitals have a different kind of . cell wall to community-acquired MRSA strands which have evolved further . 'The ability of the MRSA bacteria to secrete toxins is one of the main ways it causes disease. 'Using a sensing system, it carefully controls when it switches on its ability to do this, so as not to cause disease until it is firmly established within the human. 'Many antibiotics target the cell walls of harmful bacteria, and to resist this, the bacteria have to make changes to their cell wall.' Community-acquired MRSA strains have cell walls that are different to those seen in hospitals, allowing them to sense their environment and switch toxin expression on at the right time. Justine Rudkin, a PhD student working on the project, said: 'The community-acquired bacteria has evolved further, and is able to maintain a higher level of toxicity while also resisting treatment from antibiotics, making it a much larger problem.' She added: 'While we are constantly learning more about MRSA, there is a serious threat posed by this newer strain of bacteria capable of causing disease and even death in perfectly healthy people. 'We need to respond seriously to this threat as it reaches Britain from the United States.' An HPA spokesman played down the danger of USA 300, saying: 'In England we have seen sporadic cases of this type of MRSA most often causing boils and abscesses, but it has not emerged as a major public health issue' Chris Thomas, professor of molecular genetics at the University of Birmingham, said: 'The key message is that strains of MRSA that are spreading in the community are better able to infect the young and healthy, precisely because they are not actually trying so hard to be resistant as the bugs that have been encountered in hospitals for many years.' He said there was now a 'need to worry about community super bugs that are fine tuned to spreading outside of hospitals and we all need to be extra vigilant about hygiene and unnecessary use of antibiotics.' A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: 'The paper highlights some important observations which helps us understand at the molecular level why hospital strains of MRSA are less virulent than the so-called community MRSA strains. 'We have known about community MRSA for over a decade and, whilst they are responsible for a high burden of disease in North America, this is not the case in the rest of the world. 'In England we have seen sporadic cases of this type of MRSA most often causing boils and abscesses, but it has not emerged as a major public health issue in this country. 'The HPA are carrying out active surveillance of this type of bacteria and advise healthcare professionals on correct infection control procedures to reduce the likelihood of spread.'","Strain of MRSA from the U.S. causes large boils and is resistant to several front-line antibiotics .

"Gary Lineker thought it might be time to make it a Bank Holiday and for a while it seemed like the usual movers and shakers had decided to take deadline day off. There were revelations from Juan Mata that Anderson had returned to Brazil and an outburst from Davide Santon’s girlfriend, who claimed they had been forced out of Newcastle as the Italian full back rejoined Inter Milan, but it was a slow start to business. Robert Huth arrived at Leicester with a blank stare and a black bin-liner and the cogs were greased and started to whirl. Chelsea's signing of World Cup star Juan Cuadrado was the biggest deal of transfer deadline day . Robert Huth looked less impressed to be joining strugglers Leicester City on loan from Stoke . Chelsea added Colombia World Cup star Juan Cuadrado to their squad for £27million, the biggest deal of the month, just ahead of Wilfried Bony’s transfer from Swansea to Manchester City. West Bromwich really got the momentum rolling in the Premier League market as manager Tony Pulis and chairman Jeremy Peace created space in the squad by finding homes for unwanted players. Among them, Graham Dorrans, who began the day as a Burnley target, seemed to be heading to Norwich. Albion were keen to take left back Martin Olsson in return but the clubs could not get that deal over the line. Having missed Dorrans, Burnley bid £3m for Nottingham Forest’s Henri Lansbury but could not convince boss Dougie Freedman to agree on his first day in the job at the City Ground, even though Forest were desperate for the money. Albion’s Brown Ideye was pursued by Al Gharafa of Qatar, for £3.8m, a significant loss on their £10m club-record signing, but that deal also fell through. Pulis had hoped for a day akin to last January when he bagged four deadline signings at Crystal Palace. This time he needed an extention to push through their deal for Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, but a move for West Ham’s Carlton Cole also collapsed late on. Darren Fletcher's move from Manchester United was one of the few deals West Brom managed to complete . Aaron Lennon (right), playing against Partizan Belgrade in November, has joined Everton on loan . Georgios Samaras, who joined Albion for free on a two-year deal in August, was last night heading to Saudi Arabia after failing to start a game. West Brom epitomised what has become a self-sustaining cycle of spending, where time and energy are burned desperately trying to sell the expensive errors of judgment from previous windows. All under the pressure of a ticking clock and financial fair play. ‘It is the poker room of last resort,’ according to former Hull chairman Paul Duffen on BBC Radio 5 Live.Yet again, someone at Southampton was devoting time to finding a home for Dani Osvaldo, who had fallen out with Roberto Mancini during a loan at Inter Milan. When a proposed move back to Juventus collapsed, he emerged as a viable alternative for any team seeking a high-maintenance striker but unable to afford Emmanuel Adebayor. Tottenham tore up Benoit Assou-Ekotto’s £40,000-a-week contract, tried unsuccessfully to loan Younes Kaboul to Roma and found Aaron Lennon was reluctant to be rushed out. Stoke, Hull, Leicester and QPR all failed before Everton tempted him to Merseyside. Goodison boss Roberto Martinez said: ‘Aaron represents a real boost in terms of attacking options. His pace and trickery will fit in well.’ QPR decided they would like Matt Jarvis, rather than Mauro Zarate, from West Ham but the deal collapsed. Tom Ince travelled from Hull to Derby and sealed a move to his fifth club in little more than a year. A promising career has lost its way in this blur of money. Other clubs worked hard to hold on to their players, like Swansea with Bafetimbi Gomis, who, after a month of discontent, confirmed he would stay. For now. ‘Even if I was sad before, because I didn’t play a lot, now everything is different,’ Gomis said on Twitter. ‘I believe in this team and this project.’ Burnley’s Danny Ings also went on Twitter to reveal he was watching American Sniper. He was a movie-goer not a mover, at least not yet. After an impressive debut season in the Premier League, Ings will clinch a good move when his contract expires in the summer. Liverpool and Real Sociedad are interested. Manchester United swallowed a loss of millions on Wilfried Zaha, signed two years ago from Palace for £15m and loaned back to help them win promotion. At the time, Arsenal and Spurs wanted the winger, who has returned to Selhurst Park for just £6m. English clubs were committed to a total of £80m of spending at start of play, £15m down on the same point last year, when another £35m was spent on deadline day. Wilfried Zaha ended his Manchester United nightmare by returning to Crystal Palace for a knockdown fee . Tottenham have invested for the future with a deal for MK Dons  wonderkid Dele Alli . Monday's figures were boosted by the Cuadrado deal. Chelsea took care to stay within FFP limits with the £24m sale of Andre Schurrle to Wolfsburg and a loan fee for Mohamed Salah, who joined Fiorentina. Salah arrived at Chelsea from Basle 12 months ago in what looks increasingly a signing designed to stop him joining title rivals Liverpool. Jose Mourinho never warmed to his style. Tottenham invested £5m in Dele Alli from MK Dons, heading off Newcastle and Aston Villa. Bournemouth tried to dazzle Birmingham with a £5m bid for Demarai Gray, but without success. Down the divisions, Sheffield Wednesday were active, Cardiff paid Chesterfield a seven-figure fee for Eoin Doyle, League One’s top scorer, and Yakubu is back. The Nigerian represented five English clubs in nine years before leaving Blackburn, three years ago. Now he is back, via China and Qatar, signing for Reading and still only 32. ‘The Yak is ready to go,’ he beamed from Berkshire.","Chelsea funded Juan Cuadrado signing by selling Andre Schurrle .

"The Leeds United pantomime now has one of the directors trying to justify on social media the ongoing scandal of former chief executive David Haigh spending nine months in a Dubai jail without charge or trial. Haigh, who is sharing a small cell with two others, remains the longest-serving inmate at Bur Dubai police station despite his powerful legal team filing High Court actions for deceit, loss of earnings and false imprisonment against former Leeds owners GFH Capital. GFH claim Haigh took £3.9million against false invoices when employed by them at Leeds. Haigh says he was owed that money in salary, commissions and expenses. Former chief executive of Leeds United David Haigh has spent nine months in a jail in Dubai . But this farce, in which the Football League run by former Leeds chief Shaun Harvey should surely intervene, now has Jinesh Patel, GFH Capital’s senior executive officer and a Leeds board member, reacting on Twitter to fans questioning Haigh’s extraordinary plight. Patel said: ‘The lies being peddled by Haigh are just that — lies. His incarceration is wholly the responsibility of the Dubai police and public prosecutor who are considering criminal claims against him for defrauding GFH.’ Patel, whose tweets are being examined by Haigh’s lawyers, also told fans he was responsible for uncovering Haigh’s alleged fraud. Jerome Champagne, a fanciful FIFA presidential candidate from the start, finished his statement announcing his failure to gain the necessary five nominations by saying he would declare in due course his preferred candidate — as if anyone cares a fig what he thinks now. Jerome Champagne has announced that he has withdrawn his candidacy for FIFA president . The failure by former FIFA deputy general secretary Champagne  to get endorsements, despite a year on the campaign trail as a stooge candidate for Sepp Blatter, is understood to have a lot to do with opposition from FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke. FA chairman Greg Dyke, who is addressing staff on Tuesday about his streamlining plans, is keen to break down diversity barriers at Wembley. His latest move is to promote Kelly Simmons, who has done a lot to develop the women’s game, and human resources chief Mel Milner to the FA’s all-important senior management team. FA chairman Greg Dyke is keen to break down diversity barriers within his administration . Such moves, plus the arrival of interim chief operating officer Nick Humby, will only add to speculation that England Rugby 2015 chief executive and Football League director Debbie Jevans remains top of Dyke’s list to be the next FA chief executive and he will wait until she is available after the Rugby World Cup. Also added to the FA’s senior management are head of communications Scott Field and public affairs chief Rob Sullivan.

Heaselgrave was shown the door by the FL for a failed commercial strategy but has signed seven new tennis sponsors in his first year in Australia. Sky fixing fixture farce . One benefit of Sky Sports broadcasting both The Open and England Test matches from 2016 is that the flagship Lord’s Test and the golf major will no longer clash — as they do this summer for the third year in a row and for a third successive Ashes series. This ridiculous scheduling is blamed on Sky and the ECB by the R&A, whose Open dates are the same every year. However, after Sky secure both events this week when their Open deal is concluded, there is no chance of them being staged at the same time again. Eleven months on from chairman Anthony Fry suffering the stroke that has prevented him returning to the role, the Premier League are still some way off finding his successor. Harrogate lawyer Peter McCormick continues as temporary chief despite the PL being his prime clients. Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck is taking responsibility for finding the next chairman. Chief executive Richard Scudamore being promoted to executive chairman still looks the most likely option.

"When John Terry circa 1998 was trying to find his way at Stamford Bridge, he turned to a man by the name of Marcel Desailly. And that never changed, right up until the France defender left in 2004. '[Desailly] would stand there, in the team line-up, and say to me: ""John, listen to this Champions League music, this is what you want to hear season after season,"" and he was excited,' Terry remembered last April. 'Even now I've got goose bumps on my legs – I will never forget those nights standing alongside Desailly in this competition.' Now Terry has gone from student to master with a new pupil in the class of 2015: Kurt Zouma. John Terry and Kurt Zouma acknowledge each other as the two build on their defensive partnership . Terry (right) celebrates with Marcel Desailly back when he was learning from his defensive partner . Terry learned his trade from Chelsea legend Desailly after the pair became regular defensive partners . Zouma (right) looks to be Chelsea's latest prospect and Terry is taking the 20-year-old under his wing . Zouma and Terry hug at full-time after another defensive pairing for Chelsea under Jose Mourinho . Zouma's heat map against City on Saturday evening . On Saturday at Stamford Bridge, Terry's defensive partner was a man 14 years younger than him. Zouma was favoured ahead of Gary Cahill - the England international demoted to the substitutes' bench and fighting for his future - as Chelsea went toe-to-toe with  Manchester City. It was a hell of a call by Jose Mourinho to back a man that had just four Barclays Premier League appearances previously. Yet the £12million buy from Saint-Etienne hardly looked out of his depth. 'The new Paolo Maldini,' was among the tags bestowed upon the 20-year-old. And, as if being likened to a legendary AC Milan defender is not enough, he has been backed to emulate Terry. Terry began his  professional association with Chelsea in 1998 - the same year Desailly arrived. That's when the schooling began ahead of a partnership that would come to fruition in 2000. Desailly was club captain - a torch that would later be passed to Terry in 2004 once his fellow centre-back departed. That promotion, however, would only be allowed with his  tutor's blessing. Zouma executes a perfectly-timed tackle on Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero in the 1-1 draw . Zouma tackles Aguero as he looked to shoot past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at Stamford Bridge . Zouma closely marks James Milner as he puts in a star performance for Chelsea against champions City . Gary Lineker hailed Zouma as 'one hell of a prospect' after his performance against champions City . Once Terry hit 500 appearances last October, he set about thanking Desailly 'who first and foremost gave me the opportunity to be captain of the club, and help me through and learn from the very best'. He added: 'I remember when I first got [the armband] Marcel was captain, and he called a meeting with the management, (Gianfranco) Zola, Dennis Wise, Graeme Le Saux.' More than a decade on, it's Terry's turn to look for a successor. Prime candidate, Zouma. A cool, composed, brave customer that didn't shy away from marking Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, and had David Silva and Sergio Aguero to contend with on Saturday. He knew when to go to ground, when to stay on his feet, and how to not let adrenaline or the situation get the better of him. Quick, sharp, athletic; worthy of Chelsea. James Milner learned about Zouma's frightening pace, Aguero discovered his perfect timing in tackles, and all this was streamed live to television screens in 650million homes across 175 countries. Desailly and Terry celebrate an FA Cup win over West Ham back in the day as the pair thrived in defence . Zouma and captain Terry were defensive partners as Chelsea booked their place in the Capital One Cup final . Desailly once recalled how Terry persistently pestered him, and that is what the man with the middle name 'Happy' must do. If only to impress his captain and teacher, like it did Desailly. 'I regard Terry as an apprentice, but a precocious and cheeky one who barraged me with questions about tactics and positioning, and who once came to me with a detailed suggestion about how the physios, doctors and fitness coaches should fit into the team,' Desailly once said. 'He was sharing his opinion, and to hear this from an 18-or-20-year-old guy was something a bit special for me.' Mourinho is already prepared to trust Zouma. We know that, and so does he. He played like a man determined to keep Cahill out in the cold against Liverpool and City, and rightly so. He's making a name for himself, and has already interrupted Chelsea's formerly firm back two. Next up, is the tutelage of Terry. And that, it seems, has already begun.

In New York, Mayor de Blasio has come in for sharp criticism for his handling of the snow storm after residents in the Upper East Side complained that their neighborhood was being ignored by snow plows. At one point on Tuesday afternoon the city's PlowNYC website appeared to show no snow plows between East 59th and 79th Streets and between Second and Fifth Avenues. Residents complained to the New York Post that the wealthy area had been deliberately ignored. 'He is trying to get us back. He is very divisive and political,' said one angry resident. But Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty has claimed the map was inaccurate because one spreader had a broken GPS and so wasn't reporting its progress. 'The GPS was not working,' he said. 'Also, traffic created a lot of problems for us in that area.' At the same press conference de Blasio stood by his performance. 'All city agencies are acting [like] usual very, very effectively and in a coordinated fashion.' All public schools will be open Wednesday. Nonetheless, overnight temperatures in the single digits were expected in Philadelphia and New York, with wind chills dipping into the negative teens. The frigid air extended to Kentucky, which was forecast to see similar temperatures and subzero wind chills. On Tuesday morning, temperatures . had plunged to minus 40F over the Upper Midwest and were below zero as . far south as portions of the Ohio Valley and as far east as northern . New England.

Before the show, Frey broke a beer bottle against the dressing room wall. Afterwards, Felder smashed his guitar before storming off into the night. The concert - a benefit gig, no less - was played out amid muttered onstage threats (all captured on the DVD). At one point, Frey is caught whispering he is going to kill Felder after ‘three more songs, ass****!’. The Eagles didn’t play together for another 14 years, Don Henley famously commenting that they would only reunite ‘when hell freezes over’. No prizes for guessing what they called their 1994 comeback tour. In London to promote the film, made with Oscar-winning producer Alex Gibney, the current Eagles line-up — Henley, Frey, guitarist Joe Walsh and bassist Timothy B. Schmit — present a united face. ‘We were never really at each other’s throats,’ insists Frey, 64, rather unconvincingly. ‘We specialised in a quiet turbulence. That Long Beach concert was unfortunate. We fought because we were passionate about the band.’ ‘Men grow up slowly, especially in the music business,’ adds Henley, 65. ‘We started this band in our 20s, but we were kids, really. We’ve learned how to tolerate one another now. Our differences are not as dramatic.’ The film’s best footage is its early archive material, telling the tale of how Detroit-born Frey (pronounced ‘Fry’) and the Texan Henley met in LA. They toured as Linda Ronstadt’s backing band before launching the Eagles with guitarist Bernie Leadon and bassist Randy Meisner. ‘We lived for the moment,’ Henley tells me. ‘Our label, Asylum, booked us into a club in Aspen, Colorado, because we needed to play to people. It was a wooden shed, but we had some wild times there. It was a hippy town, and everybody was on drugs. ‘We were never really at each other’s throats,’ insists Frey, 64. ‘We specialised in a quiet turbulence.' The Eagles sit on chairs as the perform on the television show 'Don . Kirschner's Rock Concert,' 1979 . ‘We tempered our bad habits, though. We never let bingeing get in the way of work. I’d drink and take drugs all weekend, but I’d go to the gym on Monday morning to clean it all out. We had a survival instinct — every current and former member of the Eagles is still alive.’ Mixing country rock, catchy pop and finely wrought harmonies, the Eagles secured an unexpected hit with their self-titled debut album, but fared poorly, initially at least, with its follow-up, Desperado, dismissed as ‘a cowboy record’ on account of its Western-style sleeve. ‘We didn’t want to be pigeonholed, so there was a lot of variation on the early albums,’ says Henley. ‘We played bluegrass, country, rock, blues and soul. It was an organic way of developing as we searched for a direction.’ If Joe Walsh’s 1976 arrival gave the Eagles a keener rock ’n’ roll edge, the wild-card guitarist’s unpredictable streak brought new problems. With friend Keith Moon, Walsh became known as the king of the hotel room-trash. Soon, the band were barred from all the best establishments. Now 65, a clean and sober Walsh admits his antics were fuelled by his insecurity around Frey and Henley — superior talents in his eyes — although things took a darker turn after the band’s 1980 split. ‘When we stopped, I was sad and didn’t know what to do,’ he says. ‘So I kept going. I became an alcoholic and dependent on drugs. I hit rock-bottom.’ It took the band’s 1994 reunion to convince Walsh that there was an alternative to oblivion. Schmit, also 65, explains: ‘He looked so bad. I think the offer to rejoin the band saved him.’ Since then, the Eagles have soared, and inspired by the documentary (to be shown on BBC2 in June), they are gearing up for a two-year world tour. ‘As a band, we had so many issues I’m surprised we ever wrote any songs,’ says Henley. ‘But, somehow, we got it done.’ History Of The Eagles is  out on DVD and Blu-ray.

"Celtic have ramped up the post Old Firm feelgood factor by finally landing Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven from Dundee United. The captures of the Tannadice pair for a combined £2million fee signalled a shift in the Parkhead club’s transfer strategy back towards home-spun talents. A left-field move for Kilmarnock striker Robbie Muirhead failed to materialise and on deadline day United moved in and were putting the finishing touches to his transfer to Tayside. But Derry City winger Michael Duffy completed his move to Celtic Park as expected. Stuart Armstrong has signed for Celtic as the Scottish Premiership champions completed their transfers . Gary Mackay-Steven also arrived from Dundee United on transfer deadline day . Armstrong poses with Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell inside the stadium . Michael Duffy was a left-field arrival at Celtic Park from Derry City . However, it is the completion of moves for two of the Scottish game’s brightest lights that will leave fans of the champions convinced that Ronny Deila’s reign will now go from strength to strength. Mackay-Steven had already agreed to join Celtic under freedom of contract this summer, but last week the champions had a bid of £150,000 to take him immediately rejected. Matters gathered apace on Monday evening, however, with an improved £250,000 offer finally matching United’s valuation. Celtic had started the day by improving upon an earlier bid of £1.5m for Armstrong, only to have that kicked into touch. Their willingness to up the fee to around £1.75m finally saw United cave in and the player travelled with his team-mate to Glasgow for medicals before the deals were sealed. While United have now sold £8m of talent since the summer — with Sporting Lisbon’s Ryan Gauld and Hull’s Andrew Robertson netting them £3m apiece — they will now face Celtic in the League Cup Final on March 15 without their two prized assets. Neither player can turn out for Celtic, however, because they are cup tied. Armstrong celebrates scoring the opening goal for Dundee United against Celtic last year . Mackay-Steven (left) and Armstrong (right) are two of Scotland's hottest young talents . Former Ross County and Liverpool youth player Mackay-Steven, 24, won his first full Scotland cap against the USA in 2011. Armstrong, 22, started out at Inverness before joining United in 2010 and Gordon Strachan rewarded his progress with a place in the Scotland squad which travelled to Croatia two years ago. The capture of Duffy proved a rather more straightforward deal with the Northern Ireland Under-21 winger moving to Glasgow for a nominal fee after a successful trial. Kris Commons remains a Celtic player — for the time being — after an expected bid from Bolton failed to materialise on Monday night. Neil Lennon had hoped to use the proceeds from the £1m sale of Lee Chung-yong to Crystal Palace to fund the move but with that transfer going to the wire  there was insufficient time for him to test the resolve of his former club. Kris Commons could still leave the club in the summer with Bolton manager Neil Lennon keen . Lennon remains keen to be reunited with Commons in the Championship and will get his wish by agreeing a pre-contract agreement next week unless the player is granted the straight two-year deal he desires with Celtic before then. The prospect of Celtic moving for Barry Bannan floundered when he moved from Palace to Bolton on loan while speculation linking Deila with a spectacular swoop for Darren Fletcher ended when he joined West Brom. While Armstrong and Mackay-Steven signed for Celtic, former Dundee United defender Paul Dixon, 28, rejoined the Tannadice club from Huddersfield. But United failed in a bid to lure their former midfielder Scott Allan back from Hibs.","Celtic had been pursuing Dundee United duo throughout January .

"Perhaps I'd overdone it by following Super Bowl Sunday? Or perhaps Transfer Deadline Monday turned out to be like any other Monday... but arguably, deadlier. To the point where perhaps the most interesting move on Sky Sports' coverage of the day was Jim White's former sidekick, Natalie Sawyer, making a move to the afternoon shift. With the station's rising star Kate Abdo moving in the opposite direction. Making the yellow dress her own. Of course, I mainly blame the world of football for not splashing some rash cash to keep us all entertained as the clock ticked. But I also have to take some of the blame myself. Because I got what I wished for. VIDEO Scroll down for Robbie Savage dons a yellow suit for BT Sport deadline day advert . Thierry Henry joined Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith for a more considered approach by Sky . Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker was baffled by Sky's use of Henry on transfer deadline day . When reviewing Sky Sports' coverage of the last window, I said enough was enough with the various circus acts that were happening outside grounds across the country. With Sky Sports' reporters acting as the unwitting, or sometimes excruciatingly witting ring masters. Well I got what I asked for. And man alive is what it has been replaced with dull. I'm sure their reporter Alan Irwin is delighted, though. He spent his evening in Everton's car park. And the only thing he got in his ear was a word from Jim and Kate back at Sky Sports HQ. Sky Sports News presenter Kate Abdo with Jim White in a picture shared on Instagram . Natalie Sawyer shared an image of her with Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville on Instagram . Kirsty Gallacher shared this image of her with fellow presenter Abdo on Instagram . But he had among the best of it. At least he might be asked to get out of the way so someone could move their motor. Some reporters were left alone in dark, silent stadiums. Their faces lit up like characters in The Blair Witch Project. One reporter, Tim Thornton, was in the solemn surroundings of Hull City's KC Stadium. At least I assume it was Hull. You could see the 'H' and 'LL's' behind his head. But was the letter he was blocking an 'E'? There were some worthy attempts to jazz things up. Niall Quinn's flourish pronouncing 'Cuadrado' certainly chirped Paul Merson up. And Jim couldn't believe his luck when he saw himself in a viral, his head transplanted to MC Hammer's body for a rousing 'Deadline Day' rendition of 'You Can't Touch This'. Perhaps a new career as McHammer, Jim? Rising star Abdo (right) joined White in the yellow dress for the prime time shift on deadline day . Natalie Sawyer kept wearing her yellow dress after being moved to the afternoon slot . But if none of this was enough to stop your deadline day flat-lining, there was, for the first time, an alternative. This year, BT Sport decided to go head to head with Sky Sports with their own transfer window show. Inside their arena-sized studio, around several desks and with Des Kelly at the helm, an army of presenters, pundits, comics and impressionists - plus agent Jon Smith and Simon Jordan from the business end - were all drafted in to pick their way through the last few hours of deadline day. Although when they asked the question 'Ditch the window?', just half an hour into their coverage, I think the tone was immediately set as to how they were going handle their coverage. Which was, essentially, to not really get caught up in the hysteria of it all. Of which there wasn't any, anyway. So probably a good call? There was no sign of Alan Irwin battling abusive fans outside of Premier League grounds in this window . BT's approach was much more considered, deciding instead to focus on the ramifications of it all, rather than grind away at the rumour mill too heavily. It was chat heavy stuff. Indeed, at times, too much so. But there was some light to the shade. That was particularly evident at the start of their coverage when the aforementioned Simon Jordan must have thought he was staring into a mirror. And saw Robbie Savage staring back. Perched at either end of Des' desk, this got very tetchy, very quickly between the blonde, bearded book ends. First Jordan scoffed 'it always amuses me when people have observations about who should be in a team' when Robbie shared his thoughts about Chelsea's best eleven. And he was even stroppier when Savage explained the tricks he'd pulled to manoeuvre a deadline day deal to get out of Birmingham City. 'You'd have stayed and done as you were told', said Simon, before also accusing him as being the kind of player who, 'to some extent, holds clubs to ransom'. Robbie flashed the shiney gnashers. But I wouldn't say was exactly  smiling. Robbie Savage donned his own yellow outfit to advertise BT Sport's deadline day coverage . Sky presenter Paul Merson was prevented from getting an early cab home . Meanwhile back at Sky Sports HQ, Jim was, in time honoured tradition, also working his molars overtime. But his claim at around 10.45 that it was 'all go' whistled just a little hollow through them. 'All over' might have been closer to the truth. Indeed, as eleven o'clock came around and the camera focussed on the clock in the tower at Westminster, I'm sure even a rather bored Big Ben could only muster about eight bongs? And if this wasn't indication enough, even before the great bell had stopped its tolling, one of Jim's pundits was trying to make his escape from transfer deadline day. 'Not so fast, Mr Merson' ordered Mr White as he told us Paul had tried to make a break for the taxi he had ordered. Frankly Mers, I know how you feel.","Gary Lineker was surprised by Sky Sports' use of Thierry Henry .

"By all rights the golfing world should be agog following Rory McIlroy’s wondrous display in Dubai, Tiger Woods’s jaw-dropping troubles in Phoenix and the astonishing feat of a 17-year-old girl from New Zealand becoming the youngest world No 1 in the entire game’s history. Instead, the two main topics of conversation are the act of sheer lunacy in taking live coverage of The Open off terrestrial television and McIlroy’s court case involving his former management company which is due to begin in Dublin on Tuesday. If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, why not do it like golf — and use a howitzer? Rory McIlroy is heading for a potentially lengthy court case with his former management company . The Northern Irishman reportedly made an £8million offer to settle the case out of court . McIlroy has reached that blessed state precious few golfers ever manage, where they begin knowing that if they summon up 85 per cent of their capabilities in any given week there really is nothing anyone else can do. And yet, in a state of affairs that almost beggars belief, the eagles that will be on the 25-year-old’s mind for the next fortnight or more will be of the legal kind. I have it on decent authority that McIlroy offered €10million (almost £8m) to settle out of court with Horizon Sports and its owner, Conor Ridge, and end what the world No 1 described himself as a ‘tedious and nasty business’. But Ridge, with his reputation at stake, appears determined to have his day, or rather his several weeks, in court. It promises to be toe-curlingly tawdry at times and wholly damaging to a sport that relies so much on the goodwill of big business to keep the show on the road. What will the CEOs be thinking as the two sides tear lumps out of one another and the financial affairs of the sport’s most marketable commodity are laid bare? What’s it all about? McIlroy is both suing Horizon and being counter-sued in turn for unpaid fees. McIlroy has vowed not to let the legal proceeding distract him from his performance on tour . McIlroy is given a kiss from his mother Rose after winning the Dubai Desert Classic . In a nutshell, Horizon believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of McIlroy’s endorsement money until 2017. Given that Nike alone will pay McIlroy $100m over the duration, it’s not hard to see why Ridge is fighting tooth and nail. McIlroy’s lawyers will argue the contract signed was ‘unconscionable, and an improvident bargain’, and that McIlroy was coerced into signing it without proper legal representation. You can just imagine what the senior counsel are going to be like seeking to prove their respective arguments, can’t you? In Dubai on Sunday, McIlroy didn’t sound like a man who expected the matter to be settled on the steps of Dublin’s Four Courts on Tuesday morning. He talked about being in the witness stand for as much as two weeks, before being blissfully released to concentrate on his preparations for the Masters in April. McIlroy's team argue that the deal he signed with Horizon was ‘unconscionable and an improvident bargain’ The 25-year-old will be released from court to prepare for The Masters, the only major he is yet to win . Thankfully, it’s unlikely to affect him at all in that regard. As he showed in the Middle East last week, he’s become brilliant at putting the blinkers on. And so by some time next month we should be back where we want to be, watching the man who has taken European golf to a whole new level demonstrating why he’s going to rewrite every meaningful UK record. But first to the Four Courts, where alongside a couple of murder trials, we find a sport seemingly consumed with a death wish. ‘The accusations made against me are serious and were intended to damage my reputation and character. They will not be taken lightly. My team and representatives are looking into all aspects of this matter, and we look forward to setting the record straight.’ Patrick Reed (right) played alongside Tiger Woods at last week's Waste Management Phoenix Open . American Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed responds to a lurid series of allegations in a new book, in which the four-time PGA Tour winner is said to have cheated in tournaments and stolen money from team-mates during his college days at Augusta State University. He was said to have been so unpopular that his team-mates were hoping he’d lose his match when they reached the National Championship final. We might not have heard the last of this one, I fancy. TEEN ACE KO SMASHES TIGER'S RECORD . The minimum age to play on the women’s PGA Tour in America is supposed to be 18 but what choice did they have but to waive this regulation in the face of the startling performances of Lydia Ko? New Zealand's Lydia Ko has become the youngest ever player to reach No 1 in the world rankings . Ko reached world No 1 at 17 - four years before Tiger Woods managed when he topped the rankings in 1997 . By the time the exemption was granted last June, the extraordinary Kiwi was already a two-time champion, including a victory in the Canadian Open at the age of 15. Seven months on from becoming a member, and still only 17, she reached the summit of the women’s world rankings last Saturday, beating Tiger Woods, the previous record- holder of either sex, by four years. What an achievement that is, given the welcome revival in women’s golf in America, led by the likes of Michelle Wie, Stacy Lewis and Lexi Thompson.","Rory McIlroy is due in court for a legal battle with Horizon Sports .

"She was one of the great stars of Hollywood’s golden age and shared a kiss with Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights. But mystery has always surrounded Merle Oberon’s early life, not least because of the version of events given by the actress herself. She claimed she was born in Tasmania and then moved to India to live with her aristocratic godparents after her distinguished father died in a hunting accident. Her Who’s Who entry in the 1970s listed her birthplace as Tasmania and her father as a British Army officer. Dark secret: Merle Oberon was a Hollywood great and appeared with Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights (1939), left. But the woman she thought was her sister actually gave birth to her aged 12 . A dark moor haunted by secrets: The actress with Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights . It's complicated: Merle's mother, Constance Selby, was the 12-year-old daughter of Merle's father's girlfriend . Now, however, records have been published that confirm for the first time that she was actually born in India – and that the woman she knew as her sister was really her mother. A project between the British Library and ancestry website findmypast.co.uk has published records from the time of the Raj online, including Oberon’s birth certificate. It shows she was born Estelle Merle Thompson in 1911 in Bombay and her father, Arthur Thompson, was a railway engineer from Darlington rather than an Army officer. It names her mother as Constance Selby, who was only 12 at the time of the birth. Controversially, Constance was the daughter of Thompson’s girlfriend Charlotte Selby. Charlotte, a Eurasian from Ceylon with partial Maori heritage, had had Constance by an Irish tea planter when she herself was only 14 and living in Ceylon. Glitz: Merle died in 1979 and took the secret to her grave, saying her father had been a distinguished Army man . Starlet: Merle in That Uncertain Feeling (1941) with Ernst Lubitsch. She continued acting in Hollywood throughout the Second World War, sometimes in propaganda films . Charlotte was around 26 when Merle was born and raised her as her own. The girl grew up thinking Constance was her sister rather than her mother. In 1914 Thompson joined the British Army and later died of pneumonia on the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme. Literary inspiration: As Cathy in Wuthering Heights with Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff . Constance went on to marry a man called Alexander Soares and had four other children, Edna, Douglas, Harry and Stanislaus. All grew up believing Oberon was their aunt rather than their half-sister. Her brother Harry discovered the truth and tried to organise a meeting with her, but she refused to see him. Throughout her successful career Oberon, who died in 1979, lied about her mixed-race heritage, a controversial subject at the time. She became famous for her roles in Hollywood and British films of the 1930s and 1940s such as The Cowboy And The Lady and The Private Life Of Henry VIII. She was nominated for the best actress Oscar for The Dark Angel in 1935. Her career peaked as Cathy in Wuthering Heights in 1939. She married four times, had a relationship with actor David Niven and had two children. But she could never bring herself to admit to her heritage and told everyone that she was born in Tasmania – which back then must have seemed so removed from Europe and the US that her secret would not be discovered. She claimed that all early records of her birth were destroyed in a fire. In 1978 she even accepted an invitation to the Tasmanian capital Hobart to see her ‘birthplace’. However, the story began to come out as friends remembered her growing up in Bombay, now Mumbai. Her birth certificate is among 2.5million records covering 200 years of British rule in India which are being made available online for the first time. They can be viewed by purchasing a findmypast.co.uk subscription or pay-as-you-go credits. Sixties fashion: The actress was glamorous in her later years, when she travelled the world.

"Everywhere you go you run the risk of leaving traces of your DNA behind – from fingerprints, to skin, hair and cigarette butts. A Brooklyn-based firm is so concerned this DNA could be collected and stored by authorities it has created a range of sprays designed to help people delete it from all surfaces. A limited number of Invisible sprays are due to go on sale in June for $99 (£58) to protect people’s privacy, but, in theory, it could also be used by criminals to commit crimes without getting caught. Scroll down for video . The Invisible range of sprays has been created by Brooklyn artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg and her new company BioGenFutures. The Erase spray, pictured left, is said to remove 99.95% of DNA from surfaces, while Replace, pictured right, removes the final 0.5% by mixing it with other genetic material . The Invisible range consists of two different sprays that can be used as a pair, or separately. The first is called Erase and it’s an ‘antiDNA cleaning product’ similar to a disinfectant spray. While . Replace is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material . to a DNA sample to cloak the details of the original. This means customers can either wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate DNA sample to protect their privacy. The Invisible range of sprays was created by genetic privacy company BioGenFutures, set up by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg. Last year, Dewey-Hagborg set up the Stranger Visions exhibition in which she created realistic 3D portrait sculptures of strangers using DNA she collected from public places. According to the BioGenFutures sites, Invisible is a set of sprays that can be used to remove or obfuscate a person’s residual DNA left on door handles, keyboards, train seats, or in restaurants and pubs. The first spray is called Erase and it’s an ‘antiDNA cleaning product’ similar to a disinfectant spray. 'Replace', on the other hand, is an obfuscation spray that adds a mixture of genetic material to a DNA sample to cloak the details of the original.

BioGenFutures' website claims the product goes on sale in June for $99 (£58) and customers can use it to wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate genetic sample to protect their privacy . This means customers can either wipe everything clean, or leave an alternate DNA sample to protect their privacy. The site does, however, feature endorsements from genetic experts including Jeremy Gruber, President of the Council for Responsible Genetics who said: ‘No-one should be able to take another person’s DNA without consent and mine it for information. ‘The promises of the genetic revolution . will not be fully realised if concerns over unauthorised testing of DNA . and its misuse are not addressed. Invisible represents a critical step . towards achieving that goal.’ This graphic reveals that the average person sheds 50 strands of hair each day and each strand contains five nanograms of DNA. Only 0.5 nanograms of DNA is required for standard forensic analysis . Last year, Dewey-Hagborg set up the Stranger Visions exhibition, pictured, in which she created realistic 3D portrait sculptures of strangers using DNA she collected from public places . BioGenFutures continued: ‘Genetic information is inadvertently discarded by billions each day through shed hairs and lashes, dropped cigarette butts and gum, or saliva left on glasses and silverware. In addition to being accidentally discarded, DNA is routinely extracted and often stored from infants at birth, and as criminal DNA databases are expanding exponentially. ‘Law enforcement now routinely profiles individuals convicted of even petty crimes, tending toward permanent storage of both profiles and biological samples from individuals arrested for but never convicted of a crime.’ Commenting on the spray,  Dr John Bond from Leicester University . told MailOnline: 'It is easy to remove DNA with a good clean, with . biological washing powder for example.

"Clubbers have been warned to avoid a batch of ecstasy tablets called 'pink love' after two young people were left in hospital after taking the drug. The news comes following a warning earlier this month about the dangers of taking tablets known as 'green apples' following the death of a 19-year-old man. North Wales Police and the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board have since warned two young people from the Anglesey area had to be taken to hospital when they fell ill after taking the 'pink love' tablets. Danger: Police have warned clubbers to avoid ecstasy tablets called 'pink love' and 'green apples' after a teenager died and two more young people were hospitalised after taking them. Pictured is a different type of ecstasy tablet . Officers had previously warned of the potentially deadly batch of 'green apples' ecstasy tablets after Thomas Jones, 19, of Llangefni, died after apparently taking the drug. Police said his death could be linked to another incident which left a Bangor man 'extremely ill'. Acting Chief Inspector Simon Barrasford said: 'Both the pink heart shaped Pink Love and Green Apple tablets are being used by party goers and I want to make it very clear that the consequences of taking these tablets can be fatal. 'If you have been given or have bought these drugs please do not take them, I ask that you hand them into the Police so that they can be destroyed properly and safely. 'I am also asking parents with teenage children to be extra vigilant and to sit down with their sons and daughters and talk through the dangers of taking these drugs. 'You can also call in confidence with any information regarding drug dealing and I assure you this information provided will be dealt with confidentially.' Warning: Police have said partygoers have been using both 'pink love' and 'green apple' tablets, but warned of their dangers . Dr Linda Dykes, a consultant in emergency medicine at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, said: 'Over recent weeks we have seen a number of people brought into hospital as emergency cases after taking recreational drugs, some of whom have suffered very severe reactions requiring admission to intensive care and one patient has sadly died. 'There are significant risks with any drug misuse, especially when it involves drugs bought off the streets or from unregulated sources. 'Users will never actually know what they are taking, its strength or whether or not it is contaminated: every time you take a street drug, you are trusting your health, or indeed your life, to chance.' Anyone with information about those who use or supply Pink Love or Green Apple tablets, or any other controlled drug, have been asked to contact North Wales Police. Ecstasy is a class A drug, which is an artificial stimulant, popular among clubbers. The chemical name is methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but the drug is also often known as pills or E. It usually comes in the form of a tablet, although it can also come as a powdered form of MDMA. Those who take the drug can have a rush of energy which makes them alert, excited and happy. The high lasts for a few hours, before it is replaced with a comedown which can leave people feeling depressed, tired and paranoid. Short-term risks of taking the drug can include feeling anxious or getting panic attacks, and developing confused episodes, paranoia or even psychosis. There is no way of knowing what is in a tablet until it has been taken. There may be negative side effects from other ingredients added to the tablet. There have been more than 200 ecstasy-related deaths in the UK since 2006. Users who take the drug before dancing for long periods can dehydrate, but drinking too much can also be dangerous.

"It was always an unlikely union – the former socialite daughter of a disgraced Tory minister and a Sikh warrior from the foothills of the Himalayas. Now the marriage between Alexandra Aitken and her Indian husband Inderjot Singh is said to be in trouble. Family friends of the Aitkens say the couple have been spending long periods apart and that their relationship is effectively over. And when questioned on her three-year marriage recently, Alexandra would only say: ‘God is my true love.’ Separated? Alexandra Aitken and Inderjot Singh pictured at Kesgarh Sahib Temple in 2011 . Inderjot, who is a devout Sikh, is said to be living apart from Ally, who is reportedly still in India . Former life: Alexandra Aitken pictured in 2003 at the second wedding of her father, Jonathan Aitken . Alexandra is one of three daughters of . former treasury minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed for 18 months . in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice. She . was best known in her twenties for falling out of Mayfair nightclubs in . revealing dresses and posing naked in GQ magazine. So it was a surprise . in October 2010 when she married Mr Singh who is a member of the . Nihangs, a distinguished Sikh warrior order. Alexandra, . now 33, had moved to Amritsar in Northern India that year after . apparently having a dream about a Sikh who would change her life. She . noticed law graduate Inderjot while practising yoga at the Golden . Temple and spent a week beside him without exchanging a single word. She later said she knew she was ‘blindly in love’ and returned to the city a few weeks later to be introduced to him. Alexandra . rapidly adopted Sikh traditions, refusing to cut her hair or even wax . her eyebrows, using only a wooden comb and carrying a ceremonial knife. The couple were married on October 28 at a temple in Rayya, a village just outside Amritsar. Guests . included her twin sister Victoria but she was sworn to secrecy and her . parents were not told about the ceremony until later. When . news of her marriage broke, Alexandra admitted her father and mother . were initially ‘shocked’ and ‘upset’. She revealed in an interview: . ‘When I said, “Daddy, I might be wearing a turban next time you see me”, . it was a bit of a shock. ‘But my father loves my husband – it’s impossible not to. He’s happy for us.’ Supportive: Disgraced former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken (left) is supportive of his daughter's unconventional career choice, Miss Aitken says . Alexandra, . who now uses the name Uttrang Kaur Khalsa, remains a devout follower of . Sikhism but spent much of this year Italy, away from her husband. She . is now thought to be back in India. A . friend of Alexandra’s twin sister said: ‘Victoria told me that the . marriage had come to an end, and that they’re living separate lives. ‘But she didn’t know much more as she said it’s very hard to get hold of her sister these days.’ Asked . by the Mail about her marriage at a Sikh conference in London where she . was speaking during the summer, Alexandra became defensive and finally . replied: ‘God is my true love.’  She told a newspaper at the weekend: . ‘Many believe, don’t talk unless it improves on silence.’ A . brother of Mr Singh, Jyoti Singh, said he did not believe the couple . had separated but had very little contact with them and was uncertain of . their current whereabouts. Traditional: After her marriage, Ally had stopped dyeing her hair blonde and adopted a simpler lifestyle . Alexandra . was photographed last year walking barefoot in India dressed in long . traditional robes and clutching a spear in one hand and a bag of bananas . in the other. Speaking . about that moment she first saw Mr Singh in 2011, she recalled: ‘I was . sitting on the roof of the Golden Temple at about 3am, and the most . beautiful man I’d ever seen in my whole life walked in. ‘He seemed 100 per cent man, gentle and intuitive and poetic and sensitive, but also extraordinarily strong and manly. ‘And you don’t see many of these around. So I was like: “Oh wow!”’","Alexandra Aitken and Inderjot Singh shocked their families when they wed in secret in October 2010 .

"A testicular cancer survivor is taking on a range of gruelling challenges in a bid to raise money for the hospital that saved his life. Charlie Penrose, 29, is going to walk from London to Cornwall, kayak across the Channel and cycle from London to Paris to raise money for King’s College Hospital. He is also going to take part in an ironman triathlon and try to climb the highest peaks in England, Wales and Scotland. Charlie Penrose, 29, was diagnosed with testicular cancer after finding a lump in December 2013. He is now raising money for King's College Hospital as he believes the staff there saved his life . He told MailOnline: ‘I can’t repay the staff for what they did – I couldn’t have asked for anything better. ‘I just want to do what I can to say thank you.’ Mr Penrose, from Brixton, south London, was diagnosed with testicular cancer after finding a lump in December 2013. When he went to see his GP he was immediately referred for a CT scan at King’s College Hospital. Within a week of seeing his doctor, he had surgery to remove the affected testicle. Mr Penrose, who works in marketing, told MailOnline: ‘They were amazing. My experience couldn’t have been more positive. Mr Penrose had to have a testicle removed and had a course of chemotherapy in a bid to stop the cancer returning. He is now cancer-free but will continue to have regular check-ups . Mr Penrose (left) is now trying to raise £10,000 for King's College Hospital where he was treated . Mr Penrose is going to attempt to cycle from London to Paris, walk from London to Cornwall, kayak the Channel and climb the highest peaks in England, Scotland and Wales . ‘I didn’t really have time to take it in – I just rolled with it. It was only after Christmas when I went home that I started to absorb what had happened.’ Mr Penrose also had a course of chemotherapy in January to prevent the cancer returning. This wiped out his immune system meaning he was instructed to stay at home for 10 days. Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and affects 2,000 each year in the UK. The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease. It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men. It is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured. For more information visit www.orchid-cancer.org.uk . He will now have to have monthly check-ups for a year and then regular check-ups for a further nine years. He said: ‘I’m feeling quite positive about it. There’s not a lot I can do other than check regularly.’ He added: ‘Testicular cancer has become less alien because of Movember – it’s been normalised. ‘You assume it won’t happen to you – even now I still have a bit of a reality check.’ Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15 to 44 and affects around 2,000 each year in the UK. The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in part of one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease and those with HIV or AIDS. It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men. It is, however, one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis and 96 per cent survive for more than ten years. Once someone has been free of the disease for five years they are considered to be effectively cured. Since his recovery, Mr Penrose has decided to try and raise £10,000 for King’s College Hospital. Mr Penrose will also take part in an Ironman Triathlon in Mexico at the end of the year . Mr Penrose (left) said: 'I can't repay them for what they did - I couldn't have asked for anything better. I just want to do what I can to say thank you' Mr Penrose will have to have monthly check-ups for a year and will then have less regular check-ups for the next nine years . He said: ‘I am pretty fit and healthy but this has really kicked me into doing some more active things.’Mr Penrose has already taken part in a 10km race in Richmond Park. Next, in April, he will take on the Three Peaks Challenge which will see him attempt to climb Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon all in 24 hours. In June he is set to attempt to cycle from London to Paris in just 24 hours and in July he will walk the 350 miles from London to Cornwall in five days. Then, in August, he will spend six to eight hours kayaking across the English Channel and at the end of the year he will take part in an Ironman Triathlon in Mexico.

"Would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham has called breastfeeding 'vile and borderline incest' in an online dig at new mother, singer Kimberley Walsh. Cunningham, who sparked outrage after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, gave birth to her third child, daughter Grave Neiv, last month, but she went onto Twitter this morning to say she was not breastfeeding her. In an apparently unprompted jibe, the 24-year-old from Leeds told her 58,700 followers: 'Wish people would stop asking if I'm breastfeeding like Kimberley Walsh. 'No I'm not! I think the idea is vile and borderline incest!' Scroll down for video . Would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, seen leaving hospital with her new baby daughter Grace earlier this month, left, said today that she wasn't breastfeeding her because it was 'vile and borderline incest' Miss Cunningham went onto Twitter this morning to make a dig at former Girls Aloud star, Kimberley Walsh . Despite Twitter users replying to her calling her 'ignorant' and 'vacuous', Cunningham hit back at those saying breastfeeding was 'natural'. She wrote: 'People saying it's natural.... Maybe it was before powdered milk - in the same way it was 'natural' to walk around naked before clothes' And she concluded: 'But you would soon kick off if I started walking around naked. It's time to change.' New mothers replied to Miss Cunningham expressing their outrage, with one, Mathilde, saying: 'I'm all for choice about feeding but saying bf is 'incest' is seriously wrong and misleading, get a grip.' She added: 'The worrying thing is that younger women will read her stupid tweet and agree. 'This is beyond stupid.' Another, Elaine Reith, tweeted Miss Cunningham to ask: 'Are you uneducated also? 'A woman's breasts are for feeding her child.  Nothing disgusting about it!' Lactation consultant Emma Pickett, who is also chairman of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, told MailOnline it was 'sad' that Miss Cunningham had apparently 'lost sight of what her breasts are really for'. Her tweets prompted a huge response amongst her 58,700 followers, some of whom called her 'ignorant' Many Twitter users questioned Miss Cunningham's logic, while a breastfeeding expert said it was 'sad' She said: 'Having breasts is not just about having nice big ones to attract men, they are about us being mammals and are also for feeding our babies. 'I am sure Miss Cunningham's baby doesn't see it the same way - in the mind of a baby, breastfeeding is the most obvious and natural thing in the world. Kimberley Walsh, who had a baby boy last month, has told she found breastfeeding difficult at first . 'Our statistics show that the majority of new mothers want to breastfeed, whatever they think before giving birth' Ms Pickett added: 'Apart from the health benefits to babies, there are health benefits for breastfeeding mothers, too, including a reduced risk in breast and ovarian cancer and osteoporosis. 'Maybe Miss Cunningham has lost touch with what her breasts are for but lots of young women are working really hard right now to get breastfeeding up and running.' A spokeman for the NCT parenting charity said: 'We support parents however they choose to feed their baby. 'If parents want to breastfeed, it can offer significant health benefits for mother and child. 'Parents who need support feeding their baby can get a range of information on our website, and we also offer individual support services including Baby Cafés and breastfeeding counsellors.' Miss Cunningham, who already has two boys aged six and three, gave birth to her first daughter last month, three weeks after Miss Walsh, 32, gave birth to her first child, a son named Bobby. Last week Miss Walsh, a former member of Girls Aloud, spoke about how difficult she had found it to feed Bobby, her son by her long-time boyfriend Justin Scott, saying it was 'distressing'. She said she had thought it 'would be the easiest thing in the world', but had problems at the start before finally 'cracking it'. 'It can be quite distressing when it's not working, but we've definitely cracked it now and it continually gets easier,' she wrote in OK! magazine. Today the singer would not be drawn into a row with her critic, saying nothing on Twitter beyond posting a link to a dress she is giving away to raise money for a breast cancer charity. Tweeter Mathilde told Miss Cunningham what she said was 'seriously wrong' and added: 'get a grip' Elaine Reith, who said she was a breastfeeding mother herself, said Miss Cunningham 'needs to be educated'","Wannabe glamour model had a daughter, her third child, a fortnight ago .

"Bolton manager Neil Lennon has revealed that new Manchester United signing Andy Kellett refused to believe him when he told him he was going on loan to Old Trafford. United produced perhaps the shock of a generally unremarkable transfer deadline day on Monday when they plucked Kellett from Bolton's reserves at 10.55pm on a deal until the end of the season. It is understood that United will use the 21-year-old – who only has four first-team appearances for Bolton – in their Under 21 squad after allowing Belgian Marnick Vermijl to move to Sheffield Wednesday earlier in the day. Manchester United stunned their supporters by signing Bolton Wanderers defender Andy Kellett on loan . The 21-year-old has only made a handful of appearances for the Bolton first team . Kellett spent time on loan at Plymouth Argyle earlier this season . But Lennon revealed the morning after that he will always remember the reaction of the youngster when he was called in to be told the news on Monday night. 'He thought he was going to Plymouth but we told him he was going to United,' said Lennon. 'He didn't believe us. He was like: ""No way"". 'He rang his dad and I think his dad had to have a sit down. 'His mate came in with him at the same time and he was actually wearing a Man United track suit. 'But it's an opportunity of a life time for him. It is understood that Kellett will spend the duration of his loan playing for United's Under 21 side . Bolton manager Neil Lennon described the move as an opportunity of a lifetime for Kellett . 'I have known [United reserve coach] Warren Joyce has liked Andy for a while. 'We have been looking for pace in the team so [chairman] Phil Gartside got on the phone to United and asked if we could take Saidy Janko and they said we could if they could take Andy. 'It's a good move for us and a fantastic opportunity for Andy.' Kellett's last game for Bolton was in the 4-2 defeat at Rotherham that followed the club's goalless draw at Liverpool in the FA Cup. The defender was taken off after 50 minutes with the score at 3-0. 'We used Andy the other week at Rotherham, and it was a difficult game to come into after Liverpool and didn't play as well as we had hoped,' added Lennon. As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way . 'But he has been in the first-team squad since he came back from Plymouth [where he had been on loan] and they were very keen to take him back again. 'But then this came up.' Bolton face Liverpool in the FA Cup replay at their own Macron Stadium on Tuesday night after a transfer deadline day that saw them complete a number of deals. 'It was a good day for us,' added Lennon. 'It was good to get home at midnight and have a lie down.' Who? Exactly. When Jim White reported the signing on Sky Sports News' Deadline Day coverage, Twitter went into meltdown. Surely this was some mistake? This was not a Mats Hummels or a Marco Reus. Across the country, bemused United fans rewound their TVs and wnt straight to Google. Sure enough, abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from United's official account to their 4.35m followers. The club had brought in Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season with Under 21 right back Saidy Janko going the other way. But why? It's a good question. Some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan. But there is method in the madness. United are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men's football. They want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the Under 21 league. Officials will hope Janko's footballing education will be furthered in the Championship. Departures like this, however, leave their own Under 21 side short of numbers. Manager Warren Joyce is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues. He is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not. This would appear to be the case with Kellett. So what's his pedigree? He's Bolton-born , 21 and a left back. A product of the club's academy he has made four first-team appearances and earned a loan move to Plymouth Argyle in October. While at the League Two Devon side he scored a wonder goal at Northampton Town and was described as a solid performer by fans. How did the move come about? United had to fight off interest from Plymouth (not a sentence you often write) to bring him to Old Trafford. The Bolton News spoke to first-team coach Garry Parker who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster. 'Sit down,' he said, before adding that they had some 'good news and bad news'. Kellett opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to Home Park. Presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was. 'You're going to Manchester United,' was the response. What can we expect? In an interview with fans site Vital Bolton, Kellett says he models himself on Jordi Alba and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing. Former Wanderers boss Dougie Freedman was impressed and made him the first Bolton-born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the Scot described as off-the-field attitude issues. Joyce has seen him in action and is impressed, and with Louis van Gaal's history of giving youth a chance, who knows what will happen next?","Manchester United signed Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season .

"Even now, 10 years after going into remission from chronic myeloid leukaemia, Geoff Thomas has an issue with his eyes that can make Alpine descents on his bicycle rather perilous. But a decade on from completing the entire Tour de France route to raise money for other blood cancer sufferers, Thomas is returning to the scene of what, for all the success he enjoyed as an England footballer, was his greatest triumph. To ride day after day through the mountains so soon after recovering from a life-threatening disease was heroic. To navigate those descents at speeds up to 50mph, when all he could make out through eyes no longer capable of generating tears was the light reflecting off a car in front, bordered on the insane. ‘I was a bit deranged then,’ he admits now.

Thomas has a target of raising at least £2m over the next two years for the Cure Leukaemia charity that was co-founded by the doctor who saved his life, Professor Charlie Craddock. He will attempt to do so by staging two events next summer. In June, a London to Paris bike ride that will be open to 300 cyclists who want to enjoy the thrill of riding like a professional with rolling road blocks and mechanical support. Not to mention the chance to ride in peloton-style groups of up to 75 riders to suit every ability.

"Former Denver Broncos tight end Nate Jackson lasted six years in the NFL, and his revelations about the easy sex, constant drug use and horrific injuries of his football career make for incredible reading. In his memoir, Slow Getting Up: A Story of NFL Survival from the Bottom of the Pile, Jackson, now 34, tells of the women that approach players in clubs and pain-killing injections before every game. But most alarming is Jackon's catalog of gruesome injuries. 'I dislocated my shoulder multiple times, separated both shoulders, broke my tibia, broke a rib, broke my fingers, tore my medial collateral ligament in my right knee, tore my groin off the bone, tore my hamstring off the bone twice,' he writes. Despite his injury problems, Jackson signed a $2 million contract (plus added escalators) with the Broncos in 2008, before moving to the Cleveland Browns for the 2009 NFL season. Reserve: Tight end Nate Jackson was at the Denver Broncos between 2003 and 2008 . Pain: Nate Jackson #89 of the Denver Broncos (right) hits the ground with Will Allen #25 of the New York Giants in 2005. Jackson's memoir tells of how his NFL career ravaged his body with scores of injuries . Wracked by physical problems, he was . released by Cleveland before the games began. Jackson then signed with . the Las Vegas Locomotives of the UFL but never played for the team . before retiring. In an adaption of his book by Deadspin, . Jackson also describes bone chips, concussions, strains, tears, spine . trauma, nerve damage, tendinitis and possible brain damage. But . he explains that to try and make it as an NFL player he constantly had . to conceal the pain. 'No matter how bad anything hurt, I could get . through practice without showing it,' he remembers. Casual sex provided Jackson with . some relief, and he describes the groupies that chase NFL players in clubs . as 'a mob of bloodthirsty jersey chasers' or 'approachable vampires.' He tells of a typical night out where 'women have emerged from the fog, . pulled toward us by our oversized pituitaries and our cave man libidos, . vibrating the floorboards like a Dr. Dre bass line...' 'Now everything is open wide: arms, . doors, and legs. We are young, physically powerful men with money,' he . writes in an extract in the New York Times. Shot through: Former Denver Broncos tight end Nate Jackson suffered serious injuries all over his body, but played through the pain . Jackson imagines a conversation with one of the women in the club, where she says: 'But you’re on the practice squad!' He replies: 'But you're a s**t!' But after Jackson agreed to his first . pain-relieving injection he writes: 'Thus began my long relationship . with the needle-as-savior approach to injury treatment... 'The needle was the last resort when pain was too much or progress too slow.' He . admits to taking a shot of Todoral before every game, as his body is . riven with pain throughout the week. 'Every game a needle,' Jackson . ruefully writes. Jackson was a wide-receiver at Menlo . College in California before being signed as an undrafted free agent by . the San Francisco 49ers and spending the 2002 season in the practice . squad. He signed for the Broncos in 2003 and converted to a tight end in 2005, making a first career start in 2007. Happier times: Jackson celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Mile High in September 2007 . New direction: Jackson (center) started his writing career in 2010. He posted this picture to his Twitter feed in September with the caption: 'Editors or oysters: who's slimier?' Jackson goes through blood platelet therapy after a horrifying injury swells his groin into a 'watermelon.'

"Carlton Cole was left furious on Monday night as his move to West Bromwich Albion broke down at the 11th hour. West Ham had given Cole permission to move to The Hawthorns and, after holding encouraging talks with manager Tony Pulis, the 31-year-old was looking forward to a new chapter in his career. Pulis had earmarked Cole as a player of Premier League pedigree who could help younger team-mates to develop and replace Brown Ideye who is poised to join Al Gharafa. Carlton Cole, pictured celebrating against Crystal Palace in August, saw a move to West Brom break down . Cole was left furious after his move to the Midlands was blocked by the Hammers late on deadline day . However, West Ham called off the deal with an hour to go to deadline after Tottenham blocked a move for Emmanuel Adebayor and the Premier League blocked QPR's attempts to send Mauro Zarate back from his loan. Cole was said to be upset and angry at the decision but had little choice with contracts yet to be exchanged. Cole has found himself struggling to feature in Sam Allardyce's first-team plans this season, and has made only 14 appearances in all competitions, scoring just three goals, and was looking forward to getting more game time under Pulis. West Ham called off the deal for Cole after failing to secure Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor (above) QPR wanted to send Mauro Zarate back to Upton Park but the Premier League would not allow it .","West Ham striker Carlton Cole was on the brink of a move to West Brom .

"The White House has disowned a State Department draft proposal that would have seen Ebola-infected foreign nationals brought to the United States for treatment. 'No,' National Security Council Assistant Press Secretary Ned Price said flatly on Wednesday evening when MailOnline asked if the plan was under consideration. 'There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill with Ebola to the United States,' said Price. 'We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment.' 'Allegations to the contrary are completely false.' The four-page draft proposal, which surfaced Wednesday morning, 'was drafted by a mid-level official,' Price added, 'but not cleared by senior leaders. It never came to senior officials for approval.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT MEMO . Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte claimed on Monday night that the Obama administration was plotting to bring foreign nationals with Ebola into the U.S. for treatment – and he appeared at first to be correct . DISMISSED: White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday that it 'certainly hasn't happened so far; I don't know of any plans to do that' The plainly worded position paper described its goal as reaching 'an agreed State Department position on the extent to which non-U.S. citizens will be admitted to the United States for treatment of Ebola Virus Disease.' 'The United States needs to show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the Ebola crisis,' the memo read. It spelled out the expected cost at $500,000 per patient, including $300,000 for medical treatment and $200,000 for transportation. The  memo also said the U.S. is considering a change in policy because some countries 'are implicitly or explicitly waiting for medevac assurances' as a condition of sending their own doctors and nurses into the Ebola hot zone – particularly countries that lack their own capacity to treat Ebola patients. Despite the existence of a written plan, the State Department had already denie that it had any intention of bringing Ebola-infected noncitizens to the U.S. for treatment. One official told The Washington Times that 'there is no policy of the U.S. government to allow entry of non-U.S. citizen Ebola-infected to the United States. There is no consideration in the State Department of changing that policy.' Robert Sorenson, deputy director of the State Department's Office of International Health and Biodefense, wrote the memo, which advocates strongly for a policy that would allow the life-flights. State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that the draft is 'weeks old' and out of date because 'our European partners, since several weeks ago when that was written, have addressed this by providing a guarantee to international health workers that they would either be flown to Europe or receive high-quality treatment on the spot.' 'So it’s not applicable at this point.' Virginia Republican congressman Bob Goodlatte claimed on Monday that the government was working on such a scheme, saying that was 'increasing evidence that they're making those plans.' but the Obama administration offered a qualified denial on Tuesday. 'That certainly hasn't happened so far,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday. 'I don't know of any plans to do that.' ALUMNI CLUB: (left to to right) Dr. Kent Brantly, Ashoka Mukpo and Nancy Writebol were three of the first Americans to come home with Ebola and go straight to hospital isolation – all three survived – but the next crop could be foreign nationals . Goodlatte's aides at the House Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, wouldn't discuss details. A committee aide told MailOnline only that a government official 'contacted our office about this proposed plan and Chairman Goodlatte has written to Secretaries Kerry and Johnson seeking information about it.' The congressman's October 21 letter demanded written records related to 'a plan to allow non-U.S. citizens infected with Ebola to enter the U.S. to receive medical treatment.' Goodlatte told Fox News host Megyn Kelly that while non-citizen Ebola sufferers could be brought to the U.S. on the same kind of aircraft that have already transported nine Americans to Emory University Hospital and other treatment facilities, the risk of exposing Americansis too great. 'The disease needs to be contained where it is now, and people treated there,' he said. The congressman is a strong advocate for a travel ban that would restrict the ability of people to reach the U.S. from western Africa without a pre-travel quarantine, calling it 'simply a matter of common sense.' And 'if you are concerned about this problem spreading,' he said, 'and this is a deadly disease that we're even concerned about the great health care workers when they come back, not spreading it – we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients.' Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group, first raised the specter of Ebola life-flights that could bring the disease into the interior of the United States without involving a U.S. citizen. The organization's first online mention of the idea predated Goodlatte's letter by four days. Not only in America: Spanish health authorities rushed a Malian national into isolation on Tuesday after arriving in Murcia city . One day after Goodlatte weighed in with State and DHS, Judicial Watch proposed a scenario where importing non-American Ebola cases for treatment could be legal – by offering Ebola-infected foreign nationals 'a special parole.' 'Under federal regulations a parolee is an alien that is inadmissible to the inspecting officer but is allowed into the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons,' the group explained in a statement. 'Obama applied this exemption to allow the recent influx of illegal immigrant minors that entered the country through the Mexican border by labeling it a “humanitarian crisis"".' 'Besides “urgent humanitarian reasons,” parole can be authorized at DHS headquarters for “medical emergency,” according to the agency’s regulations. This could apply to foreign nationals infected with Ebola.'

"Mario Balotelli had a quiet transfer deadline day – so he took advantage by going for dinner with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico and their daughter Pia. Balotelli has struggled since his return to England with Liverpool. The Italian has two goals, one each in the Champions League and Capital One Cup, but is yet to find the net in the Premier League. Earlier in the transfer window Balotelli had been linked with a return to Italy – but that never materialised and the striker spent the final hours of the transfer window in San Carlo restaurant in Manchester. Mario Balotelli had dinner at San Carlo in Manchester  with his ex Raffaella Fico and their daughter Pia . In December, Balotelli’s former manager at Manchester City Roberto Mancini said he was keen to take the striker to Inter Milan – but it never happened. Last week, Balotelli’s agent Mino Raiola said the striker was ‘very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool but has no immediate plans to leave the club. 'The plan is to continue at Anfield,' Raiola told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'I saw him Monday and told him: ""You have a four-year contract and I won't bring you away. Or you leave Liverpool at 60-70 million, and I won my bet, or you'll die there."" Balotelli dated briefly a few years ago and had a daughter Pia together . 'It's the first time I've made a speech like that to a player. I've seen him quiet, changed, different than at Milan. 'He's very disappointed with himself, too. He's going through a bad time like he never had. In Liverpool he hasn't his spaces: if you don't make things as they want, you stay out. Then he was broken for eight weeks, he lost the rhythm.' Balotelli and Raffaella enjoyed an evening together on Monday night . Singer Raffaella and Balotelli dated briefly at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 and she gave birth to Pia in the summer of 2012.

"Cristiano Ronaldo would cost £1billion to lure away from Real Madrid, according to his super agent Jorge Mendes, who believes he will see out his career with the Galacticos. The Real Madrid star is not only better than Lionel Messi, he is the best sportsman in history claimed Mendes, who has brokered some of the biggest transfers in European football. ‘He’s the most expensive player in the world because he’s the best footballer, the best sportsman ever in the world,’ Mendes told the BBC’s Dan Roan. ‘It’s impossible to say his worth. Cristano Ronaldo? One billion. His buyout clause one billion, so it is one billion. Cristiano Ronaldo will never leave Real Madrid for another club, insists the forward's  agent Jorge Mendes . Mendes rates Ronaldo as worth £1billion and believes he will never return to Manchester United . ‘If for any reason they decided to sell him tomorrow for £300m, someone would pay. He loves the Manchester United supporters because he was there six years he but he will finish his career at Real Madrid, for sure.’ Portuguese Mendes has risen from a DJ bar owner in Porto, where he became friends with many footballers, to one of the most powerful men in the game who has reportedly taken charge of transfers worth more than £1bn in total. He negotiated Angel di Maria’s £59.7m move to Manchester United and Diego Costa’s £32m purchase by Chelsea last summer. He also represents Jose Mourinho, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and David de Gea. Mendes pictured with his most famous client Ronaldo earlier in the Real Madrid forward's career . Ronaldo's super agent Mendes has other players such as Radamel Falcao (right) on his books . But Ronaldo, who moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid for £80m in 2009 is his most important client. That was a record-breaking transfer fee at the time but Mendes claimed it would not be long before a club paid £200m for a player. ‘Clubs like Manchester United or Real Madrid, if a player is worth £200m, of course they can do it,’ said Mendes, who also said players are worth even more than clubs are currently paying. ‘The most important part of the game is the players,’ he said. They deserve the maximum amount possible. Of course there is a limit but you can pay until this limit. I think the limit may be in three years or maybe after that.’ Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid for £80million in 2009 .

"George Osborne yesterday declared that ‘Britain is coming back’ after official figures showed the economy growing at its fastest pace for nearly seven years. Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – rose by 0.8 per cent between January and March and was 3.1 per cent higher than in the same period of last year. It was the first time since before the recession that the economy has expanded for five quarters in a row. The UK economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the first three months of 2014, official figures show . Chancellor George Osborne said the latest growth figures were proof Britain is coming back . Experts said the economy was at last back ‘within shouting distance’ of its peak before the financial crash in 2007. The figures left Labour’s Ed Balls floundering, resorting to jokes about Natalie Rowe, a former dominatrix photographed with Mr Osborne two decades ago, in the Commons. The shadow chancellor conceded that growth was ‘finally’ returning but insisted: ‘Millions of hard-working people are still feeling no recovery at all.’ Mr Osborne revelled in pointing out that while Labour had forecast one million jobs would be lost if he trimmed public spending, in fact one and a half million more have been created. The Office for National Statistics report yesterday showed the annual growth rate was the fastest since the end of 2007, and the economy is now on the cusp of surpassing its pre-crisis peak. Independent analysts welcomed the news, with one saying the UK is in a ‘sweet spot’ and another saying ‘the economy is on fire’. The Chancellor said the figures ‘show . that Britain is coming back’ and said he was particularly encouraged . that manufacturing rebounded more strongly than any other sector. He . said: ‘For the first time in a decade all three main sectors of the . economy – manufacturing, services and construction – have grown by at . least three per cent over the last year. ‘The impact of the Great Recession is still being felt, but the foundations for a broad-based recovery are now in place.’ Despite the growth in recent months, the economy remains 0.6 per cent below its peak in ealry 2008 . Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said: ‘There is every sign that the recovery is starting to broaden out and I would describe our attitude as prudently optimistic.’ The International Monetary Fund has predicted Britain will be the fastest growing major economy in the developed world this year with growth of 2.9 per cent. The Bank of England is expecting 3.4 per cent. GDP crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 under the last Labour government and is still 0.6 per cent smaller than it was before the crisis. But analysts believe it will make up the rest of the lost ground in the coming weeks. Excluding oil and gas production – which has been in sharp decline for a number of years – output is already 0.3 per cent higher than before the crisis. The ONS said the services sector grew 0.9 per cent between January and March, with output 3 per cent higher than a year ago. Manufacturing output rose by 1.3 per cent – its best performance since the end of 2009 – and 3.4 per cent year-on-year. Construction rose 0.3 per cent in the first quarter and was 5.1 per cent higher than a year ago. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ‘The UK economy is in the sweet spot of the economic cycle, with growth powering ahead of our major competitors and inflation falling away. ‘This is the Goldilocks moment for the UK economy, with growth neither too hot nor too cold.’","Economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2014, ONS says .

"Ravi Bopara is not the sort to fret over his future but if he took time this week while England unwind in Western Australia to glance at what is happening elsewhere then he would have been given much World Cup food for thought. Bopara still looks certain to be part of England’s opening World Cup line up against Australia on February 14 but, at 29, is approaching the last chance to finally realise the rich potential that has all too often remained unfulfilled. There is competition both near and far now for an all-rounder whose poor Tri-series is one of the major concerns for an England side who, despite three defeats by Australia, have made quiet progress so far in their Cup build-up. Ravi Bopara's England form is a major concern ahead of the upcoming World Cup . The England star, in action against Australia on Sunday, still have so much to prove . Bopara leaves the field of play on Sunday as Australia celebrate taking his wicket . Gary Ballance is nearing full fitness after a broken finger and looks set to be given a chance by England to push for Bopara’s place in one of their warm-up matches here in Sydney against Pakistan and West Indies next week. More seriously for Bopara’s long-term prospects, the spectacular hitting of Ben Stokes for the Lions in South Africa has confirmed the return to form of a special talent who will be an important part of England’s future. It is frustrating that Bopara, approaching his third World Cup, still has so much to prove as he remains a gifted batsman and a bowler who should provide a valuable option for England, particularly on the slower pitches of New Zealand. Yet Bopara, who was also under-used in Sri Lanka with the ball before Christmas, was given just three overs by Eoin Morgan during the Tri-series, conceding 24 runs, while Moeen Ali has established himself as fifth bowler. Bopara, pictured in the nets last week, is approaching his third World Cup for England . Bopara managed only seven off 16 balls in Hobart, but his ability should note be doubted . And if Bopara’s bowling becomes less useful then there will be more scrutiny on batting which saw him struggle for seven off 16 balls in Hobart when England needed acceleration against Australia and play an awful shot against India at the Waca when a cool head was needed. It was only in Sri Lanka that Bopara was promoted to five and looked to have been given more opportunity to build longer one-day innings rather than just provide cameos at seven or seek to become England’s finisher. He is back at six now but will find Ballance breathing down his neck if he takes the chance that looks sure to come his way at the SCG next week. Bopara’s ability should not be doubted. When he was scoring three centuries in consecutive Test innings against West Indies six years ago he looked certain to become a permanent fixture. There have also been spectacular one-day innings for Essex but only one 50-over century for England, and that came against Ireland. Gary Ballance is closing in on a return from a broken finger and could push Bopara for a place in the line-up . Ben Stokes celebrates scoring a century for the England Lions in their ODI match against South Africa . There will be those, like Paul Collingwood, who bemoan the fact Stokes is not with the World Cup squad and able to replace Bopara now but the selectors had little option other than to leave him out when they picked the squad. The Durham all-rounder’s international form collapsed with both bat and ball after he returned from Australia this time last year and it was when he continued to struggle in Sri Lanka that England, with heavy hearts, omitted him. What one would say is that Stokes was not helped by being treated as a bowling all-rounder and he showed, not least with his 15 sixes in Pretoria, that he should very much be treated predominantly as a batsman when he returns. That day will come if England have an injury here or more likely when they start again in one-day cricket after the World Cup when it is to be hoped that Jason Roy and Sam Billings will also feature in 50 and 20 over cricket. For now England have the squad most would have picked in December and it is hard to argue against it being the right one for the here and now. But the big question is whether Bopara can justify his inclusion in it.","Ravi Bopara is certain to be part of England's opening World Cup line-up .

"Rory McIlroy’s court case against his former management company Horizon Sports lasted a total of 44 seconds on Tuesday morning before proceedings were adjourned to see if the two warring sides can thrash out a settlement. Mr Justice Brian Cregan entered the courtroom a shade after 11am and stayed just long enough for McIlroy’s senior counsel Paul Gallagher to request a three-hour recess. ‘As you know the case is listed to last eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides,’ said Gallagher, Ireland’s former Attorney General. ‘Along with Mr Paul Sreenan (senior counsel for Horizon and its owner, Conor Ridge) we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm.’ This was court-speak for the fact a breakthrough is believed to be close in the bitter 18-month dispute and a settlement possible that would spare the world’s No 1 golfer a prolonged spell on the witness stand. Rory McIlroy arrives at the Irish High Court in Dublin ahead of the case involving his former agents . McIlroy has sued Horizon Sports over a bitter row over the fees he was charged while he was with them . World No 1 McIlroy returned to Ireland after winning the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday . I have it on decent authority that McIlroy offered €10million (almost £8m) to settle out of court with Horizon Sports and its owner, Conor Ridge, and end what the world No 1 described himself as a ‘tedious and nasty business’. But Ridge, with his reputation at stake, appears determined to have his day, or rather his several weeks, in court. In a nutshell, Horizon believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of McIlroy’s endorsement money until 2017. Given that Nike alone will pay McIlroy $100m over the duration, it’s not hard to see why Ridge is fighting tooth and nail. McIlroy (left) seen here with Horizon Sports Managing Director Conor Ridge is suing the firm for £4.2million . McIlroy was in impressive form in Dubai but now has another challenge to face at the High Court in Dublin . McIlroy had arrived some 45 minutes before the scheduled 11am start. Dressed in a dark blue suit and wearing glasses, he looked relaxed as he chatted with his legal team in the gathering area outside the courts known as the Round Hall. Moving on to a more private area, he acknowledged the golfing scribes present among the 34 accredited members of the press. ‘Hello boys,’ he said, with a grin on his face. The proceedings were held in the intimate setting of Court One, where there was little more than 50ft separating barristers sat at the back of the room from the presiding judge. From the public gallery, a few whispers could be heard as McIlroy entered the courtroom at 10.45am. At first, it was a struggle to find seats for his team, such were the amount of boxes containing court documents that were situated on one of the designated rows of seats. The sports management firm are also counter-suing McIlroy for £1.65m for severing his contract early . Some five minutes later Ridge entered, looking far more tense. The difference between his body language and McIlroy’s relaxed demeanour was stark. Two minutes before the start silence descended, and there was a genuine sense of drama in the courtroom as Mr Justice Cregan took his seat, only for it to be punctured almost immediately by Gallagher’s request. McIlroy is suing Horizon sports for being locked into what his legal team claims is an ‘unconscionable’ contract until 2017. Horizon are defending the lawsuit aggressively and counter-suing for unpaid fees, dating back to 2013.

"Middle class jobs are under grave threat from advances in technology, a former senior adviser to David Cameron is warning. White collar posts in areas such as law, medicine and accounting are increasingly being replaced by computers, according to Rohan Silva, an ex-Number Ten strategist. He warned politicians were ‘all over the place’ in their responses to the squeeze on the middle classes and were failing to address the ‘actual causes’. Rohan Silva, an ex-No 10 strategist, pictured, said jobs in areas such as law, medicine and accounting are increasingly being replaced by computers . Jobs are being created at the bottom end of the income scale – in areas such as retail and social care – and at the top, but too few in the middle, Mr Silva, who is now chairman of the Year of Code, a national campaign to promote computer science and technology skills, told the Daily Mail. He pointed to the example of the Nissan factory in Sunderland, which produces more than 500,000 cars a year and is one of the most productive in Europe. Its use of modern robotics means it employs only about 6,000 workers, far fewer than would have been needed just a few decades ago. In China, the electronics firm Foxconn recently announced plans to buy an ‘army’ of more than a million robots to replace most of its human workers. ‘Take legal services - text-analysing and data-mining software is doing the work of paralegals, or the accounting profession, in which algorithms are taking over from human auditors,’ he added. In the future, driverless vehicles are already being tested – which will eliminate many more jobs, while computers were also being used to diagnose medical conditions and carry out stock-market trading. Mr Silva said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle-class people for jobs in IT and technology - a key growth area . Driverless vehicles are already being tested for the future, which will eliminate many more jobs, while computers were also being used to diagnose medical conditions and carry out stock-market trading. Mr Silva said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle-class people for jobs in IT and technology – a key growth area. ‘This is either the biggest threat to jobs in the UK or it’s the biggest opportunity,’ he claimed. He said the trend had ‘profound implications’ for society. ‘If you look at the UK and look at the US, there is a stagnation in middle class incomes. ‘There are more jobs at the top and more jobs at the bottom, but fewer in the middle. Labour blames the Government, the Government blames it on other people. Really what’s affecting it is technology replacing white collar jobs in the way that it replaced blue collar jobs back in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Mr Rohan pointed to the example of the Nissan factory in Sunderland, which produces more than 500,000 cars a year but employs just 6,000 staff . ‘If a tough place to be in the 80s was working in a manufacturing job, today if you’re working in a lower level job in a law firm or an accountants increasingly you’re seeing those kinds of jobs replaced by software.’ He said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle class people for jobs in IT and technology – a key growth area. ‘Look at where most jobs have been created over the last five years: lots in residential care, in face-to-face retail – which are not jobs that can be replaced by technology. But the next biggest category is IT and technology. ‘That’s a real source of optimism here. The average IT job pays £20 an hour, well above the average wage. There’s a chronic shortage of trained computer scientists and software workers in the UK,’ he said. ‘That’s why the Government is having to create a tech talent visa, to bring these sorts of people in from abroad. At the last Davos summit, Eric Schmidt said it's 'a race between computers and people' ‘The internet economy is already over ten per cent of UK GDP and it’s growing by 20 per cent per year. The question for us is how can we make sure British people benefit from this trend and don’t lose out from technology replacing old jobs. ‘That’s entirely about skills. It’s about getting computer coding into the curriculum, which we are the first G20 country to do.’ Mr Silva said there was ‘so much more that needs to be done’, calling for more tech and IT apprenticeships and adult training. ‘You can absolutely learn very quickly the skills you need to get a job in the technology industry at any age,’ he said. ‘This is either the biggest threat to jobs in the UK or it’s the biggest opportunity.’ Roger Bootle, managing director of Capital Economics, said: ‘In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advances in technology mainly involved more powerful and productive machines that nevertheless needed to be operated by humans. Later came machines which effectively replaced human labour. ‘Simultaneously, though, new jobs appeared using human brain power. When computers came along, they started to substitute for various humdrum mental labours while leaving more complex tasks still in the field of the human. We are now on the brink of a change that will see machines take over these, too – hence a second ""machine age"".’ Eric Schmidt, head of Google, said at the last Davos summit of world leaders and economists: ‘It's a race between computers and people — and people need to win.’","Rohan Silva says more should be done to prepare middle class for IT jobs .

"Sky Sports are to broadcast The Open Championship for five years from 2017 at a cost of over £15million-a-year. The official announcement from the R&A that Sky had won the exclusive rights to the Open after what will be 60 years of BBC broadcasts came on Tuesday afternoon. Sportsmail had revealed on Saturday that Sky had reached an agreement with the R&A at a cost of over £10million – and that BBC would only retain the consolation prize of highlights.

CLICK HERE to read the story . But it’s understood the price that Sky have paid is nearer £15m than £10m giving the R&A almost a 100 per cent increase from the £7m paid by the BBC in their current contract which will end after this year's tournament at St Andrews in July. As Sportsmail also reported, the Corporation have been resigned to losing their flagship golf contract to Sky for some time and had prioritised keeping Match of the Day highlights, which they have done. The 2015 Open Championship, the last to be broadcast  by the BBC, will be at St Andrews . BBC's golf team (from left to right) Ken Brown, Hazel Irvine, Peter Alliss and Andrew Cotter . But the R&A’s decision to take the money from subscription TV – chief executive Peter Dawson’s last big move before he steps down later this year – will not do anything to help golf’s falling participation figures and has been widely criticised by numerous big names in the sport, including Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood and Peter Alliss. Speaking in an open letter on the Open's official website, Dawson said: 'We believe this new arrangement, which will see The Open broadcast live on Sky with prime-time highlights on the BBC, will allow golf’s oldest championship to maintain its position as one of the world’s premier sporting events. 'I want to express my gratitude to the BBC, our trusted broadcast partner for 60 years. Our relationship developed through The Open’s renaissance in the early 1960s, golf’s boom years in the 1970s and 80s and more recently the height of its global appeal during the 90s and 2000s.

"Merseyside Police have withdrawn a legal challenge to the kick-off time of Saturday's Everton versus Liverpool derby at Goodison Park. The force were concerned that the 5.30pm start would increase the risk of alcohol-fuelled crowd trouble and leave the taxpayer with a big bill to foot. In a rare action, they launched an appeal against the decision made by Liverpool council and the Safety Advisory Group to allow the televised clash to take place so late. Goodison Park, Everton's home ground, will host the Merseyside derby against Liverpool on Saturday . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) and Everton boss Roberto Martinez square up this weekend . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is set to feature in his final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Saturday . But at South Sefton Magistartes Court on Tuesday morning they withdrew that appeal following assurances from Everton that they would improve segregation at the eagerly-anticipated clash. The hearing could have had huge implications for broadcasters, given that a decision to put the match back to 3pm would have seen them unable to screen it live. A Merseyside Police spokesman said that all parties would meet within 28 days to ensure similar issues did not arise in future. The midfielder is pictured celebrating his goal in the Anfield game between the teams back in September . Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke, said: 'Our opposition around the late kick-off time has been constant throughout and our paramount concern has always been the safety of those attending the game. 'Ideally we would have preferred that this situation could have been resolved much earlier and we have pressed throughout to get the time changed. The force accepts that any change to the kick-off time at this stage would have considerable inconvenience for those fans who were going to the game. 'But unfortunately we were given no option but to appeal to the courts and today we have been able to come to agreement about the way forward. Merseyside Police believe the derby clash at Goodison Park should kick-off earlier than 5.30pm on Saturday . Everton's home ground Goodison Park is the venue for the Merseyside derby on Saturday . 'The decision to go with a 5.30pm kick-off for this game creates unnecessary risk. We have tried to do everything possible to get this situation resolved as quickly as possible. 'Our request to move the kick-off time is in no way a reflection of the behaviour of fans from either club, as the majority of people who attend the games are genuine fans who go to enjoy the football and have a good time. 'Unfortunately, there is a significant minority who take the opportunity to drink and cause problems, and the additional hours before the game give these people the opportunity to spoil what should be a good afternoon out at the football. The Liverpool fans shows their support for the side during September's Merseyside derby against Everton . 'The 5.30pm kick off time presents different challenges for the force and the club and increases the impact of the event, not only to the city centre but across Merseyside. The plan for a late kick off requires 254 police officers covering the area around the stadium, inside the stadium and also the city centre. 'The operation would be extended to 17 hours, which would result in valuable resources being displaced from their ordinary duties from across Merseyside. Additional resources would also be deployed to police licensed premises across the county. 'The cost of that operation to date would be £78,500 and at least £50,000 of that would not be recoverable from club. There is no doubt that the late kick off, to facilitate the match being played on live TV, would significantly stretch our resources.'","Everton will host Liverpool at 5.30pm on Saturday as originally planned .

"Danny Cipriani's England recall will be confirmed on Wednesday when Sale's fly-half is included – along with Nick Easter – among the replacements named by Stuart Lancaster for the clash with Wales. The 27-year-old playmaker forced his way back into the national squad last month on the back of a series of outstanding performances for his club this season. Now, with Owen Farrell missing from the entire RBS 6 Nations after suffering a knee injury, Cipriani has earned the right to a bench place, as understudy to the starting No 10, George Ford.

Cipriani practices his kicking after joining up with the England squad at their Pennyhill Park training base . This selection represents a triumph for dogged perseverance and the consistency of his form for Sale, despite the disappointment of being omitted from the England squad for the autumn series at Twickenham last November. It also provides encouragement that a place in the World Cup squad is there for the taking, which should in turn further reduce the fading chance of Cipriani taking up the option of a move to France, which would leave him in Test exile. Last June, he won two caps in New Zealand, following a period of five-and-a-half years spent off England's radar – during which time he had a spell with Melbourne Rebels in Australia. Cipriani's last appearance in the Six Nations came way back in March 2008, when he shone against Ireland on his full debut at Twickenham – scoring 18 points in a compelling personal display.

"Andre Schurrle stepped out in the snow on Tuesday morning as he trained  for the first time following his big-money move from Chelsea to Wolfsburg.

There were fears that Schurrle's move would not go through before the German transfer window shut at 5pm UK time but Wolsburg got the deal over the line. A tweet from the Bundesliga club confirmed the move, saying: 'Finally - pen has been put to paper! @Andre-Schuerrle makes the move from Chelsea to the Wolves. Contract until 2019.' Schurrle quickly changed his Twitter biography to 'VFL Wolfsburg' and the move paved the way for Chelsea to wrap up the £27m signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina before the window closed. Cuadrado, one of the standout players at last summer's World Cup, was at Stamford Bridge on Saturday for the 1-1 draw with Manchester City, while the move saw Mohamed Salah move the other way on loan.

The two clubs had been stuck in talks over a solidarity payment owed to club's in Schurrle's development, with neither wanting to pay five per cent of the transfer fee. It is still unclear how the disagreement has been resolved. Schurrle needed to beat a noon deadline to be registered on the German FA's transfer list before potentially completing a switch. That was done under an hour beforehand as the move went down to the wire. Earlier in the day, Wolfsburg general manager Klaus Allofs had cast doubt on the deal saying: 'Chelsea agreed to putting him on the transfer list just before midday and you can read into that what you want.'

"A woman has told how breast surgery gave her the boost she needed to launch a business. Lucie Morgan, 28, says implants to increase her bust from a B cup to an E cup finally gave her the confidence to start her own company. She says that before her operation she was too self conscious speak at seminars or perform well in business meetings. Scroll down for video . Confidence boost: Lucie Morgan, 28, says implants to increase her bust from a B cup to an E cup finally gave her the confidence to start her own company despite people assuming she wanted to become a glamour model . She said: ‘I admit it sounds bizarre that a boob job can have a positive impact on business but it’s true. ‘Before my operation my confidence held me back. I couldn't visualise myself talking confidently in seminars or at events and parties but now all that has changed. ‘When I tell people I had a boob job to boost my career they wrongly assume I wanted to be a glamour model but nothing could be further from the truth. ‘I think my story shows it’s not only glamour girls who have surgery to boost their careers, business women do too. ‘It’s all about having the confidence and the surgery has given me that.’ Miss Morgan from Long Sutton in Lincolnshire says she had always struggled with her self esteem after battling weight issues in her teens. She recalls being a chubby school girl who weighed 18st by the age 18. Miss Morgan said: ‘I told myself I was happy being fat and compensated by being bubbly but I don’t think anyone can say that are truly happy and confident when they are overweight.’ As she was: Lucie says she had always struggled with her self esteem after battling weight issues in her teens and weighed 18st by the age 18 . Confidence boost: She had the £4,000 operation in February 2013 and says her confidence increased dramatically . But matters came to a head when she was out celebrating her 18th birthday and became the target of abuse because of her weight. She said: 'A group of girls falsely accused me of being disrespectful to one of them and before I knew it they had rounded on me, calling me a fat cow and ridiculing me because of my size. ‘It turned into the worst birthday ever.’ So the determined teenager vowed to lose the weight and cut out all junk food and take-away meals from her diet. She also reduced her carbohydrate intake and instead ate a healthy diet of lean met and vegetables or salad. Ms Morgan also started exercising. In the following 12 months she lost nine stone, dropping from 18st to nine stone. At 5ft 5in tall she went from a size 20 to a size 8. She was thrilled with her success on the scales but the dramatic change to her bust left her feeling low. Ms Morgan explains: ‘When I was 18st, my generous bust was probably the only thing I liked about myself.’ She was a 38D before starting her diet but by the time she turned 19 one year later she was a deflated small B cup. She said: 'Of course I was thrilled with my weight loss but still felt very self -conscious because of my bust.’ She resorted to padded bras and chicken fillet type bust enhancers. Miss Morgan said: ‘I just felt I couldn’t relax and embrace my weight loss. It was frustrating to have worked so hard and still not feel confident and relaxed about my body. ‘In fact I think I was more self aware because I had lost nine stone.’ Before and after: She was a 38D before starting her diet but by the time she turned 19 one year later she was a deflated small B cup, left, and now she's a 34DD, right, and finally feels happy . She recalls a holiday with friends in 2001, which revealed how low her confidence had dropped. She explains: ‘I was able to wear a bikini like my friends but now instead of covering my fat I was covering my flat chest. ‘Because I had lost the weight so quickly they were like two empty sacks. ‘I wondered if all the hard work had been worth it because I still wasn’t confident enough to follow my dreams including starting my own business.’ When a friend had cosmetic surgery with Transform Miss Morgan visited their webpage and researched breast enlargement. Speaking out: Miss Morgan says she had long considered starting a small business but lacked the confidence to stand up and speak publicly in meetings and at events - something she knew she would have to do. Now that she's had her breast augmentation, she has set up a business . Decision: Speaking about wanting to undergo the procedure, she explained: 'I was able to wear a bikini like my friends but now instead of covering my fat I was covering my flat chest', and that's why she decided to have the operation . When an ex-partner offered to help her finance a bust enlargement she leapt at the chance and arranged a consultation. Miss Morgan said: ‘I told the consultant that I just wanted to look normal and finally feel confident like other woman my age and he understood.’ She had the £4,000 operation in February 2013 and is now a 34DD, saying her confidence increased dramatically as a result. She recalls: ‘The nurses were really supportive and when I came round in the hospital, it was like I was finally the person I should have been all along. I felt good and I looked good and that had such a positive impact on every aspect of my life.'

"David Gold hurled a grenade in the direction of Daniel Levy, suggesting that the Tottenham Hotspur chairman has a grudge against West Ham which caused talks over an Emmanuel Adebayor transfer to break down. ‘No matter how hard you try, there are people out there that you just can't do business with,’ he wrote on Twitter, a barb seemingly directed at Levy. The hostility between the two teams is no secret with Levy falling out with the East London club on several occasions, most notably when they were both bidding to move into the Olympic Stadium. Emmanuel Adebayor deadline day move to West Ham collapsed after talks stalled . West Ham had been keen to take Adebayor to Upton Park . West Ham co-Chairman Gold took to Twitter to document his club’s bid to sign Spurs striker Adebayor in the closing hours of the January transfer window. ‘Don’t go to bed,’ he urged, suggesting a deal was imminent. However he later took to the social network to apologise for giving supporters false hope. ‘Sorry for keeping you up late,’ he wrote, ‘but at the last moment the main deal collapsed and the rest folded like a pack of cards. ‘I'd like to thank David Sullivan and Sam (Allardyce, manager) for their efforts to secure new players during this window. However no matter how hard you tried there are people out there that you just can't do business with.’ Spurs are now left with a player in the dressing room they desperately wanted to get rid of until the summer, at least. Adebayor, 30, is paid £100,000 a week. He refused to move away from London and Levy was willing to subsidise his wages if he moved to QPR, who offered to pay £60,000-a-week towards his pay packet and Crystal Palace, who offered to contribute £70,000-a-week. David Gold was left frustrated by his attempts to sign Adebayor form Spurs . Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was unwilling to subsidies Adebayor's wages if he moved to West Ham . Adebayor preferred a move to West Ham but Levy would not budge, refusing to contribute any of his wages if he moved to Upton Park. In some ways, this could be seen as a compliment to West Ham, a club Levy clearly deems a threat to Spurs’ top four aspirations. There are just six points separating them in the Premier League table and Essex born Levy, 52, didn’t want to be left rueing the sale of Adebayor. But Gold seemed to take it somewhat personally. Jeramin Defoe played for West Ham before leaving in 2004 to join Tottenham . Spurs have bought some of West Ham’s best players in recent years, including Jermain Defoe and Michael Carrick. But there is no love lost between Levy and West Ham’s vice-chairman Karren Brady, either. The pair made their war of words public in 2011 when they were both bidding to take over the Olympic Stadium, which was later sold to West Ham. In a statement, Levy branded Brady a ‘scaremonger’ and accused her of being ‘irresponsible’ after she said his club’s plans to tear down the stadium in Stratford amounted to ‘corporate crime’. Michael Carrick was another player who started at West Ham and was later signed by Spurs . Brady had accused Levy of making rash plans to redevelop the site. ‘It’s a corporate crime to spend £500million on a stadium and, just four weeks after the Games have finished, bring the bulldozers in. The Olympic Stadium was built on a promise, made in the Queen’s name, to have a legacy for athletics,’ she said. Levy quickly hit back at the Apprentice star and prominent businesswoman. ‘Accusations that we would ‘demolish’ £500million of stadium are hugely inaccurate and highly irresponsible and I want to be very clear on this issue. West Ham and Spurs had been at war over the Olympic Stadium in the past . ‘It is also important to remember that two thirds of the Olympic Stadium, under the original legacy plan, was to be dismantled - it was not designed to be a permanent structure. Recent scaremongering conveniently forgets this fact.’ Whatever the reason for the breakdown in the Adebayor transfer, this latest bit of mudslinging will do nothing to improve the relationship between the two clubs.","West Ham tried to sign Emmanuel Adebayor from Spurs on deadline day .

"Sportsmail reviews the best buys, the big surprises, the players who got away and the lucky ones who survived the January clear-out during a busy transfer window. Deal of the month . For all the big money transfers, the one that gave many a young player hope was that of Sadiq El Fitouri. A 20-year-old right-back who had failed to get a break at Manchester City, fell out of love with the game then tried his luck playing for Salford. Pushed to go for a trial at Manchester United, within two weeks he had signed a contract. As he said, dreams can come true. Chelsea's signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina should prove astute business for Jose Mourinho . Window's star buy . Wilfried Bony could make all the difference to Manchester City's attack. His power and physical presence aligned with compatriot Yaya Toure will give City a fighting chance of muscling their way back to the top of the Premier League. However, Chelsea's signing of Juan Cuadrado should prove astute business. Yes, he's not cheap but he can make Chelsea stronger, has versatility and flair to make an immediate impact and will prove a telling addition to an already impressive squad.

Everton signing Aaron Lennon on loan could prove a masterstroke if they can revive his form of old. Tottenham wouldn't have let him go if they felt he could still make a significant contribution and his workrate and final ball have been questioned too often recently. Goodison Park likes a winger and a Merseyside derby for a debut could be the perfect platform or where the truth hurts. Other good business has to be West Brom's signing of Darren Fletcher on a free and Leicester bringing in the experience and slightly-creaking back of Mark Schwarzer to steady their nervous defence. West Brom securing Darren Fletcher on a free was a shrewd piece of business from the club . Surprise of the window . Steven Gerrard signing for LA Galaxy answered what many thought would never happen. Could he really leave Liverpool? Yep. Wolfsburg paying so much for Andre Schurrle was excellent business for Chelsea and Sunderland tempting Jermain Defoe to the North East was a real coup, albeit expensive. However, Andy Kellett's last-minute move from Bolton to Manchester United brought out the romantic side in all of us, even if he does only play for their U21s. Steven Gerrard (right) tries to close down Dejan Lovren during Liverpool training at Melwood  on Tuesday . One that got away . There was so many on the final day. One agent had 14 potential deals on Friday and ended up with none come 11pm Monday. One Premier League target was sold at 1pm, his agent asked for more money at 8pm and the player turned up for his medical at 10.35pm. Yes, it fell through. However, the one you have to feel for is Carlton Cole. So close to signing at West Brom after playing a bit part at West Ham, through no fault of his own he was recalled as West Ham failed to find a striker and QPR botched their bid to send back Mauro Zarate. Carlton Cole (right) replaces Andy Carroll during West Ham's 2-0 defeat against Liverpool on Saturday . Are you still here? Emmanuel Adebayor continues to linger with little intent at White Hart Lane despite their best attempts to shift him but special prize for resilience has to go to Mario Balotelli.

"Aaron Lennon has revealed his excitement at becoming an Everton player after joining the club on loan on transfer deadline day from Tottenham.

'Can't wait for the next few months now!!!' The Merseyside club confirmed the signing on their Twitter feed around 10.30pm on Monday, half an hour before the 11pm deadline.

'The manager wants to play exciting, attacking football and I'm determined to make a big contribution over the remaining games.'

Mauricio Pochettino hasn't used Lennon regularly - the English winger hasn't played since December . Lennon had appeared to be heading to Hull City, but the Tigers' woeful form led to a cooling in the winger's interest. Stoke City were also keen to sign Lennon, who has been capped 21 times by England, but Martinez appears to have won the race for his signature. The signing will be Everton's first of the transfer window.

"James DeGale will fight for the IBF super middleweight title on April 25 at London's O2 Arena following confirmation that Carl Froch is relinquishing that belt. The announcement came from promoter Eddie Hearn by way of a 29th birthday present for DeGale. But the mood of celebration was soured by DeGale's adviser, Ambrose Mendy, repeating the slur that 'Froch is a coward for not defending the title against James in the ring'. James DeGale (left) will fight for the IBF super middleweight title on April 25 at London's O2 Arena . DeGale (right) will fight for the IBF super middleweight title following Carl Froch's relinquishing of that belt . DeGale lost a contentious decision to George Groves (right) in 2011 in their grudge match . Hearn and DeGale's trainer, Jim McDonnell, refused to association themselves with that remark. Froch, meanwhile, is negotiating for two major defences of his WBA world title against Bernard Hopkins at the City Ground and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in Las Vegas. Hearn confirmed also that George Groves is declining the possible opportunity of being the opponent for DeGale in the fight for the vacant IBF title. Groves, who narrowly defeated DeGale in their first grudge match, was second in line behind No 2 contender, Andre Dirrell. Negotiations with Dirrell to meet DeGale have already commenced, although the American is wary of returning to England after believing he was robbed of a decision against Froch in Nottingham. Hearn says: 'We will get a decision on Dirrell quickly by pressing for purse bids if he wants this agreement. Froch has vacated his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May . Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in March but had to withdraw with an injury . 'If Dirrell refuses the fight then we will move down the list of contenders, starting with No 3, Gilberto Ramirez. But whatever happens, James will fight for the title on April 25 and I believe will become world champion that night.' DeGale is bidding to become the first British boxer to go on from winning Olympic gold and then winning a world title. He says: 'I don't care who is in the opposite corner. 'I wouldn't even care if it was Andre Ward, who everyone seems to think is the best super middleweight in the world. I'm just excited. I can't wait. 'It would be nice if it's Dirrell because I believe that us two and Ward are the three top super middleweights. Of course I would like it to be in London but if his team come up with more money then it wouldn't bother me to fight him in America.' It has taken more than six years for DeGale to be given this chance since winning gold in Beijing, and Hearn says: 'He's waited very patiently. 'He's boxed beautifully in his latest fights and he deserves his shot.'","James DeGale will fight on April 25 at London's O2 Arena .

"From the top of the world to the exit door in seven short months, it has been an unstoppable slide for Andre Schurrle as he was caught up in Chelsea’s new reality. As Schurrle he adjusts to new targets as a Wolfsburg player he may stop to wonder what has happened since his two goals in the World Cup semi-final and Germany’s glorious month in Brazil. He returned in confident mood and scored in Chelsea’s opening game at Burnley what remains one of the best goals of this season, but things can change quickly in football and he has made way for Juan Cuadrado. World Cup winner Andre Schurrle struggled to impress Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge . Schurrle trains in the snow following his big money move to Wolfsburg . Schurrle was not Jose Mourinho’s selection, which is never a good starting point for a relationship between player and manager, although it does not mean it is doomed to fail. He was identified by Michael Emenalo’s scouting network before Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea had tried to sign him when Roberto di Matteo was in charge, soon after winning the Champions League, and stayed on his trail, but Mourinho gave the transfer his blessing and the German striker, fast, versatile, direct and industrious seemed a good fit for his tactical style. When he first arrived in London, Thomas Tuchel, Schurrle’s coach and mentor through the youth ranks to the first team at Mainz, was certain he would excel in the high-pressure environment of the Barclays Premier League. Chelsea unveil new winger Juan Cuadrado as a replacement for Schurrle who moved to Wolfsburg . “He is an excellent team player who will dedicate his speed and skills to defending and able to decide matches with his offensive abilities,” said Tuchel. “You can be fast but he also has quick anticipation. He is half a second quicker in deciding and sees the situation before defending.” There were memorable contributions: a hat-trick at Fulham, the first in a second-leg comeback against Paris St Germain and that delightful goal at Turf Moor on the opening day. It was the clinical finish the approach play deserved. He also scored on his final appearance, as a sub in the 5-0 win at Swansea. By then his fate had been sealed. Perhaps his biggest obstacle was the fact he performed best from the left wing, a role with belongs to Eden Hazard. Schurrle was always going to struggle to oust the impressive Belgian winger Eden Hazard at Chelsea . He was a useful substitute to have but that did not appeal. Having started the season in the team, opportunities were drying up. At Arsenal, Per Mertesacker spoke of motivational problems he felt after the World Cup triumph. At Chelsea, they pointed to a virus which knocked Schurrle’s fitness in October. Unlike Arsenal’s three world champions, he had reported back for pre-season after a truncated break and was flying at the start of the season. Schurrle rejects the idea that this illness was anything other than a brief interruption. There have been no questions about his motivation. Mourinho simply seemed to have lost faith, hauling him off at half-time following a poor 45 minutes in Maribor in at the start of November. Chelsea new boy Cuadrado shields the ball from AC Milan's Kevin Constant while playing for Fiorentina . The manager blamed the virus for a poor display, but the German has only started one Premier League game since, at Southampton during the fixture congestion around Christmas. He has started only five times in the Premier League this season and Schurrle is not the type to sit happily on the bench. He was not homesick – he loved London – and there was no big bust-up. But, at 24, he wanted to play every week. He met with his father Joachim and agent Ingo Haspel in November and decided to stick it out until the end of the season and then look for a transfer if nothing had changed. A month later, the trio met again. The situation seemed to have worsened and they agreed to accept a January move if the right one became available. Mourinho has made a habit of selling players (like Lukau) for big money in order to shape his Chelsea squad . They were aware of interest from Germany and ambitious Wolfsburg is a challenge which appeals to Schurrle. He will not play tonight at Eintracht Frankfurt but he will be in contention at home against Hoffenheim on Saturday. Was the situation contrived by Mourinho? Was he deliberately unsettled? It is conceivable. But this is the way football operates. Mourinho wanted Cuadrado and would have been aware of a buy-out clause in his Fiorentina contract which Chelsea could meet if they balanced the FFP figures by selling a player. Schurrle, a world champion in his mid-twenties on the fringe of the team, fitted the bill. Juan Mata was another big money player that was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge for a sizable fee . Chelsea wanted £30m, Wolfsburg paid £24m with add-ons and Schurrle joined Juan Mata, Kevin de Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and David Luiz and players to leave Stamford Bridge in their prime to generate big money to reshape the team. Privately, Mourinho had reservations about all of them, either in terms of their character or their tactical suitability within the style he wants to play, which supports the idea for the time being that the manager’s opinion is prevailing in regard to who comes and goes at first-team level. This was not always the case in the years between his first spell and the club and his return in 2013. As a footnote to the deadline-day departures from Chelsea, it is worth mention that the three players – Schurrle, Ashley Cole and Ryan Bertrand - who infuriated Mourinho by joining Arsenal players for their Christmas night out, 14 months ago, are no longer at the club.

"A former defence minister has threatened to derail David Cameron’s promise to guarantee a rising foreign aid budget. Sir Gerald Howarth said if the Prime Minister backs a law forcing the Government to spend high amounts on foreign aid, then backbench Tories will demand a similar pledge on defence spending. The aid law, which has passed its second reading in the Commons and is now due to go to committee stage, would compel future governments to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. This would mean further rises in the foreign aid budget, which has already reached £12billion a year. An Afghan shoe cobbler works inside his box at a market in Kabul.  Despite massive injections of foreign aid since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, Afghanistan remains desperately poor . Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said Tory opponents will attempt to amend the Bill so it also commits Britain to spending two per cent of national income on defence. As a Nato member, Britain is currently required to spend that exact percentage of our income on defence. But so far the Government has not committed to do so beyond 2016. Sir Gerald said: ‘This Bill is the sort of thing that drives traditional Conservative supporters to Ukip. ‘People wonder, what is the Prime Minister doing? They do not get why he is promising to spend billions more on aid while he is making soldiers redundant.’ The warning came after a report by the TaxPayers’ Alliance found that British aid ‘does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries’. The report examined the progress of 28 countries which have received British taxpayers’ money, measuring the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations. These included the Heritage Foundation, which published a measure of trade and property freedom, and Freedom In The World, which measures political and civil liberties. Out of the countries which received British aid, 12 showed no changes in their measured levels of economic and political freedoms over a decade. Six countries had a falling score while just three – Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid. Four countries – Ghana, Paraguay, Peru and Zambia – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from Britain went down. Russia, which ceased to get UK aid in 2011, had a falling score, and Ukraine’s share of British aid money went down while its measured levels of freedom stayed much the same. The report said: ‘International organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty, but the Department for International Development, recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes.’ Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said Tory opponents will attempt to amend the Bill so it also commits Britain to spending two per cent of national income on defence . Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Too often, British taxpayers’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms. ‘The arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means money is spent for the sake of it, rather than for any obvious need.’ But a spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Britain promotes freedom by backing fair elections, a free press and individual rights, and we should be proud of that.’","Aid law would compel  governments to spend 0.7% of national income on aid .

"When Einstein the elderly goldfish developed swim bladder disease, the future looked bleak. The ailment, which is common in aquarium fish and controls their buoyancy, caused him to turn upside down and sink to the bottom of the tank. But now things are looking up, after his owner Leighton Naylor, 32, from Blackpool, made him his very own life jacket. Scroll down for video . Not finished yet: Einstein in his new life jacket made from recycled tubing which keeps him floating the right way up . Tanked up: The new swimming aid has allowed Einstein to resume a normal life at his home in Blackpool, Lancashire . The 'floating frame', made from recycled tubing which fits perfectly over his body, has enabled him to swim normally again. Warehouse worker Mr Naylor, 32, said: 'Einstein's been suffering with ill health on and off for about two years. 'He's always been a fighter so when he sunk to the bottom one day and couldn't get back up again it was a very sorry sight. 'It broke my heart to see him so helpless. He looked so depressed. 'I started looking at floating aids and saw one where an owner kept his koi carp afloat by attaching it to a wine bottle cork but that looked quite painful. 'I wanted to build something that would allow Einstein to move his fins a little bit and be comfortable at the same time.' Mr Naylor spent three hours designing the life jacket from fish tank aeration tubes, and adjusted the fit so it comfortably cradled Einstein. He added: 'He wriggled a bit a first and he wasn't too keen on the idea. 'He kept catching on to plants and getting stuck but since I've rearranged the tank to make it disability friendly he's been absolutely fine.' Things are going swimmingly: Einstein now has to be fed using a straw because his life jacket stops him getting to the surface . Disability: Swim bladder disease is a common ailment among aquarium fish and affects their buoyancy . The float means that Einstein cannot reach the surface to feed so Leighton drops him food through a tube which he lowers into the water. If the fish is particularly unwell he can pick him up with his little life jacket to make sure he gets the food. Leighton said he is now looking forward to teaching new tricks to Einstein, who shares his tank with fellow goldfish Pat, Frank and Blondie, . He said: 'They're one big happy family now, but he'll have to wear it for the rest of his life. 'People have said I'm crazy but every animal is a valued family member and I do my best to help every one of them. 'I've tried to train all of my fish but Einstein's really shone above the rest - he's my star pupil. 'He can already swim through my fingers and through hoops using a feeding wand. I was just getting him into fish football before he got sick. 'People can be dismissive of goldfish as pets but they are intelligent animals as Einstein proves.'","Goldfish Einstein suffers from swim bladder disease which affects buoyancy .

"When you are the first beaver to be spotted in the wild in England for 800 years, it must get a little lonely. So thankfully, the male pictured at the aptly named River Otter last month has now found some companions to swim with. Amazing images of the family of wild beavers have been captured by the same retired environmental scientist who pictured the solitary male. Scroll down for video . Just months after a solitary beaver was spotted near the River Otter in Devon, new pictures have emerged showing the creature is not alone. A total of three beavers, two are pictured, have been caught grooming themselves, gnawing the base of trees and playing together in the same location . The three European beavers are thought to be adults and were filmed paddling together and gnawing at trees on the riverbank. Their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries. Eager beavers: Could the Environment Agency be replaced by furrier workers? Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river in east Devon after he first noticed trees had been nibbled there last October. He said he believed the male had been lost from a breeding farm but nobody claimed him. There are several such programmes in the UK, including the nearby Ottery St Mary, but none of the animals are unaccounted for. ‘When we saw three, that’s a totally different situation altogether,’ said  Mr Buckley. ‘Three indicates a family and looking at the footage, all three are  quite sizeable and active, which indicates to me that they are not young. I would expect them to be at least two years old. ‘That indicates they may have been around for at least two years or more. ‘During that time, they may have been fitting in very nicely in terms of the environment.’ Mr Buckley said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he came across the images of the first beaver at the river last month. ‘For me, there was a combination of amazement and a little bit of disbelief,’ he said. ‘I had looked through hundreds of video clips and there was nothing at all in them. ‘Then there was one beaver, I was a little bit taken aback.’ The trio has also been seen interacting with local wild otters and felling trees in the area. The beaver is shown in the bottom left of this image, while the top of the otter is the shown swimming past him . The animals were pictured in a sequence of shots taken beside the River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, Devon, pictured . Beavers were hunted to extinction in England and Wales during the 12th Century and disappeared from the rest of the UK 400 years later. Landowner David Lawrence admitted he has no idea where the creatures, a single beaver is pictured, have come from . Beavers were once common throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in England and Wales 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur, meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure. They remained in Scotland but disappeared from the UK completely 400 years ago. Natural powers: Facts about beavers . The family’s arrival in Devon this month remains a mystery but David Lawrence, who owns the land, said he is delighted with his new neighbours. ‘We are quite happy for them to be here,’ he said. ‘At some point we will possibly have to go in and clear up some of the wood because it could possibly cause a flood problem. ‘But it’s all very interesting – my wife has just started a holiday business with a safari tent and this will give people something extra to look at.’ The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is investigating the sighting. A spokesman said: ‘It is unlawful to release beavers in England – we are looking into this case and will consider what action to take.’ Steve Hussey, of the Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘This is not necessarily the right way to go about having beavers reintroduced to the English countryside. It would be better if it was done in a planned way. ‘But now they are here we need to take a really close look on the impact they have. ‘I think we should leave them alone but observe their impact on the local landscape.’ There are two species of beaver, the European and North American. The European is considered ‘vulnerable’. It is extinct in most of Western Europe, with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from Eastern Europe to the Chinese and Mongolian borders. There were several attempts to breed American and European beavers to boost numbers of the European species, until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible. Sightings of a single beaver, pictured, were reported in July 2013, and again in January this year, in the same location where the family has been seen. These images, as well as the new shots of the beaver family, were all captured by retired scientist Tom Buckley . During recent years beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for. Here, a beaver gnaws on wood in captivity . Tom Buckley used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island near the river, after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees. This image is one of the results . The retired scientist first noticed a tree that had been damaged from nibbling, which made him want to get photographic evidence of the beaver's existence.This photo documents the damage done by the wild beaver .","A trio of beavers has been spotted on River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, Devon .

"Every Christmas, one Manchester United player could be counted upon to give out presents to 30 or more staff at the club's training ground as a personal thank you for their work and friendship during the year. Darren Fletcher's deadline day free transfer to West Bromwich Albion won't have made the global headlines of Cristiano Ronaldo's world-record move to Real Madrid, for example, but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31-year-old Scot who has left Old Trafford after 12 memorable years. Fletcher would banter with the canteen ladies, enquire about the families of the ground staff and away from the club would be seen shopping on the high street in Hale with his two young boys just like any other family man. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Darren Fletcher: Louis van Gaal didn't want me to leave United . Ander Herrera is among a host of Manchester United players to honour Darren Fletcher as he departs . Now at QPR, Rio Ferdinand praised hugely popular Fletcher's qualities on and off the pitch . West Brom confirmed the signing of Fletcher on a three and a half year deal late in the transfer window . If anybody can be said not to have let fame and wealth go to his head, it is Fletcher. And that, in addition to his 340 first-team appearances, is what he will be best remembered within the inner sanctum at United. United's official Twitter account wished him well . The way he came back from a career-threatening illness, ulcerative colitis, also endeared him to the greater United family who were so desperately worried about the thinning figure in front of them, there was almost relief when the condition was announced rather than it being a terminal illness. In many ways, Fletcher was a historical figure, the last of the “Fergie fledglings” who was personally wooed by Sir Alex to ensure he ended up at United from Scotland rather than a clutch of other clubs who wanted him. Ferguson played snooker with Fletcher at his house as he sought to sign him. He saw him as a long-term successor to David Beckham who was at the time on his way to Real Madrid. Fletcher could pass, get around the pitch, and had the mental strength not to be overawed by playing for England's biggest club. After Fletcher, the game changed – young stars could come in from around the world and in any case Ferguson got older and would start to spend more time delegating than personally overseeing the signings of the next big thing. We're now seeing Fletcher in the context of his brave battle with his condition – it was so serious at one point he needed an operation to stop the risk of his bowel exploding, and he didn't play for a year after Boxing Day 2012 – but it is worth remembering he was a fantastic player at his peak, with his best season probably coming in 2008/09. Fletcher enjoyed a memorable 12 years at Manchester United in which he appeared 342 times . Sir Alex Ferguson personally secured the signature of the young Scot amid interest from other clubs . With Owen Hargreaves injured, Fletcher was one of the star performers during a season which saw United win their third Premier League title in a row and reach the Champions League final. Ferguson at the time said Fletcher had become 'a key performer for us in major games.' The only cloud was he missed the final itself for a red card sustained against Arsenal in the semi. Typically, he dealt with the setback in such an unfussy manner it is barely remembered compared to Roy Keane and Paul Scholes being suspended for the 1999 final. Nonetheless, United badly missed his drive in midfield as Xavi and Andres Iniesta dominated and Barcelona easily won 2-0 in Rome. Not surprisingly, Fletcher hasn't been quite the same player since returning from his illness even though he has made 13 appearances this season. Manager Louis van Gaal wanted Fletcher to remain – his influence in a dressing-room of so many new signings was huge – but the club felt they couldn't stand in the player's way if he wanted first-team football, an attitude the Scot is grateful for. Fletcher's work with charity, including the Manchester United Foundation, has also bee recognised . Spain keeper David de Gea isn't alone among new additions at Old Trafford to hold Fletcher in high regard . 'Manchester United are a fantastic club and I've got so many great memories there but I feel it's time for a new challenge for me,' he has said following his move to join Tony Pulis at The Hawthorns. 'I haven't had as many games as I would like this season and, after everything I've been through, I'm a professional football player. I want to play football and hopefully I can do that at West Brom. They've given me the opportunity to do that. 'I'm leaving Manchester United but I've got so many happy memories and got to know so many great people there I'm leaving with a smile on my face. 'I spoke to the manager [Louis van Gaal] about not playing as much as I wanted and the club didn't really want me to go but they respected my wishes. Fletcher is mobbed by team-mates including Wayne Rooney after scoring  during a pre-season friendly against Valencia, however, he went on to appear just 13 times this season with only five starts . Fletcher's move has't garnered the attention that met Cristiano Ronaldo's world-record departure, but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31-year-old Scotland international . 'The manager and (executive vice chairman) Ed Woodward have been fantastic. I cannot speak highly enough of them. I have great respect for them and how they have dealt with this. They helped me as much as possible and made the move possible. I have to thank them for being professional and catering for my wishes.' Fletcher won five Premier League titles with United and has a Champions League winners' medal as an unused substitute from the 2008. But his real legacy at the club is the hearts and minds he won over. His international team-mate Barry Bannan once described Fletcher as the “Daddy” of the Scotland team. 'You look up to him because of what he's done,' said Bannan. It could equally apply at Manchester United.

"The Royal Navy has revealed details of a new air defence system capable of destroying enemy missiles travelling at supersonic speeds. Sea Ceptor missiles fired from Navy warships will reach speeds of up to Mach 3 and can protect an area of around 500 sq miles over land or sea. The £483 million contract to develop the cutting-edge missile defence system has been awarded to MBDA (UK). Speedy: A computer generated image of the Royal Navy's new Sea Ceptor missiles which can reach speeds of up to Mach 3 and can protect an area of around 500 sq miles over land or sea . The Ministry of Defence said the five-year project would sustain around 500 jobs in MBDA and its supply chain in facilities across the UK including at Stevenage in Hertfordshire, Filton in South Gloucestershire and Lostock in Bolton. Sea Ceptor will initially be used on the Navy's Type 23 frigates, but in the future it could be adapted for use by the Army and RAF.

"Tell all: Sharon Savoy has written a book about her life as a professional ballroom dancer . On the popular BBC series Strictly Come Dancing, the professional dancers and their celebrity partners are often seen to become the best of friends, supporting one another throughout the competition. The reality of competing on the ballroom dance circuit is somewhat different, according to three times world champion, Sharon Savoy, who is lifting the lift on the sequin-filled world in a new book. She told MailOnline: 'It's a competition, not a performance. So the normal tension and rivalries are heightened. It is rare to . develop a true friendship with your competitors, like you would see in a . dance company. 'Backstage is an interesting dichotomy. Beneath the . seemingly calm and composed exterior is a cauldron bubbling with nerves, . anxious tension and pent up energy. Most of the dancers pace until . their event is called and remind me of the energy of thoroughbred horses . at the starting gate.' Chicago-born Sharon, who trained at the School of American Ballet, said despite the fierce rivalry, attempts to sabotage the performance of a fellow competitor are thankfully rare. 'I have never heard of anything so . terrible and tragic as the acid incident at the Bolshoi,' she said, referring to the time in 2013 when tensions at Russia's rival ballet companies turned violent and dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko threw acid on the face of artistic director, Sergei Filin. Sharon said a dancers' worst enemy can often be the judge, rather than their competitor, as 'politics' means the best performer doesn't necessarily win. 'Many . talented ballroom dancers leave the competition circuit when they tire . of the politics. My book speaks about the politics in ballroom dance, . which has been a taboo subject. Anytime you . have a decision based on human opinion there will be controversy,' she said. 'The . winner of a ballroom competition is not defined by who crosses the . finish line first. What opens the door for ""politics"" to exist in . ballroom dance competitions is the fact that our current system allows . the coaches to also judge. It would be akin to allowing a barrister to . also preside as judge of a legal case.' Champ: Sharon, performing one of her routines, has won national and international titles . Politics aside, Sharon said she loves every aspect of the dance world - but success has not been easy. She's worked hard to become a U.S. and World champion, making sacrifices along the way. 'To become a top ranked professional . ballroom dancer, you must live, breath, eat dance 24/7,' she explained. 'Nothing else . can matter more, not relationships, family or comforts. Your passion . must be all consuming and borderline obsessive to make it through the . eye of the needle. 'George Balanchine, one of my early mentors, and . director of the New York City ballet said it best, ""I don't want dancers . who want to dance, I want dancers that need to dance.""' But Sharon said the sacrifices are worth it to reap the rewards of being a professional ballroom dancer. 'The lifestyle of a top ranked ballroom . dancer is a page out of the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"",' she said. 'If you ""make it"" and become the champion, you travel all over the world to . compete, perform and teach. It's a very glamorous way to see the world . and get paid to do what you love most - dance! Glamorous: The dancer, pictured in her youth, said she never gets tired of the sequins or elaborate make-up . 'I have had the pleasure to . perform in China, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Australia, North and South . America, Europe, The Royal Albert Hall and in Hollywood movies.' Of course, the make-up and outfits all add to the glamour and Sharon said as a professional dancer, you can never have too much sparkle, tassles or fake tan. 'There's a saying that ""you can never be too rich or too thin"" - in the ballroom dance world, you can never be too tan!' she joked. She added: 'Hair color is usually extreme - platinum blonde, flaming red or jet black. Make-up is exaggerated; eyelashes, eyebrows and lips are all accentuated. In a sea of competitors it's important to stand out and be the most exotic or colourful fish.' As for the costumes, they are always 'exquisite'. Political: Sharon said being the best dancer doesn't always guarantee victory . 'The amount of time and attention to detail that goes into designing these lavish creations is similar to the fashion world's obsession with every facet of a piece of clothing,' she said. As well as looking lavish, the costumes must allow the performers to have freedom to move. Sharon says she never gets fed up of the sparkly costumes or make-up that are necessary for a ballroom or Latin dance routine. 'It's part of the fun and fantasy - to become larger than life, to be sexier or more provocative or more elegant than you can be in normal daily life,' she said. Ballroom!

"Nationwide support for Nigel Farage’s Ukip has soared to an all-time high 25 per cent – enough for the party to take Parliament by storm with well over 100 MPs and a possible Labour Election victory. That is the shock result of a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday, carried out after Ukip rocked the Tories and Labour in two by-elections last week. If the poll result was repeated in next year’s General Election, it would see the Tories lose 100 seats, the certain resignation of David Cameron – and the possibility of Ed Miliband in No10. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage could see himself in government after the next election according to a Mail on Sunday poll . The Tories, under David Cameron could lose up to 100 seats as voters turn towards Ukip in mass numbers . The collapse could see Ed Miliband handed the keys to Number 10 unless Cameron does a deal with Farage . To stop him, the Conservatives would have to join forces with Ukip and other parties from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The sensational Survation poll shows the Tories and Labour level pegging on 31 per cent, six ahead of Ukip, with the Lib Dems on a paltry eight. Pollsters were quick to point out last night that the surge in support for Ukip, buoyed by its success in last week’s Clacton by-election, could fall away in the run-up to the General Election, as has happened in the past with other so-called minor parties, such as the SDP. But it is the strongest evidence yet that Ukip is on the brink of a major breakthrough which could change the political landscape forever. It means Farage could be closer than ever to his dream of holding a ministerial post. Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP . David Cameron and Nigel Farage are the most popular duo to run the country according to the poll . According to the poll, one in four voters now support his self-styled ‘People’s Army’. According to John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, the poll would give Labour 253 MPs, Conservatives 187, Ukip 128, Lib Dems 11, and others, including Scots Nats and Ulster MPs, 71. Prof Curtice said: ‘If Ukip are to turn votes into Commons seats in Britain’s first-past-the-post system, they need to build up bastions of local strength. Today’s poll suggests they may have begun to do that. ‘The 25 per cent level represents a 22-point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010. If that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency, they could still fail to pick up a single seat. ‘But today’s poll suggests Ukip’s support has increased much more in the South of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points. ‘If that level was recorded throughout the South, Ukip could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points. In that event, Cameron would be left with just 187 seats, almost as weak a position as the Conservatives were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997. Almost 60 per cent of people agree with Farage that HIV positive immigrants should not be allowed into the UK . David Cameron is the most trusted leader in all things apart from fixing a shelf, where Nigel Farage excels . ‘Mr Farage would achieve his ambition of holding the balance of power at Westminster. Any poll estimate of what is going on in an individual region is inevitably not as robust as that for the country as a whole. However, if Ukip are advancing more strongly in some parts of the South, its chances of establishing itself as a significant force at Westminster may well be higher than has so far been appreciated.’ The survey dramatically bears out Cameron’s warnings that a vote for Farage will give the No 10 keys to Miliband. But it also demonstrates his problems in neutralising the Ukip threat. Tory voters are opposed to any kind of Election pact with Farage, whereby Ukip candidates would stand aside for Conservatives – and vice versa – in key seats. Paradoxically, while the survey shows the rise in Ukip could make Miliband Prime Minister, other aspects suggest Miliband is in danger of becoming a joke figure. When respondents are asked if they can imagine him as Prime Minister, he comes behind Theresa May – and Farage. He is seen as Labour’s second worst leader in a third of a century, behind Neil Kinnock and only slightly ahead of Michael Foot. By contrast, Cameron is seen as the second best Tory leader since Thatcher. The survey underlines the growing status of Farage and his party. His controversial call for immigrants who are HIV positive to be banned from entering Britain is supported by an overwhelming 58 per cent to 22. And voters appear to be warming to the idea of him having a government role after the next Election. When respondents were asked which combination of the four main party leaders they would like to run Britain, a Cameron-Farage ‘coalition’ comes top, followed by Cameron-Clegg, Miliband-Clegg and Miliband-Farage. Farage is also the leader people would ask to fix a shelf, but least trusted to babysit, feed a pet or bake a cake. And, although a minority, one in three, believe Farage is fit to be a Cabinet Minister, his fans are in no doubt as to which job he should get. Immigration Minister is the clear favourite, followed by Deputy Prime Minister and Europe Minister. Survation interviewed 1,003 people online on Friday. Voters consider Ed Miliband the fifth-best Labour leader ever, while Cameron is only second to Mrs Thatcher .","David Cameron remains the most trusted political leader in the poll .

"The plaintive song of a lone chestnut­-bellied wren sounds remarkably like the first three bars of Volare. It sighs with unrequited love, like the heady ballads played by taxi drivers in tatty cars with swinging rosaries; a soundtrack to debauchery and heartache. To talk of a safer Colombia for tourists is a tiresome cliché. Backpackers have plodded through its lush jungles, hit its sweet Caribbean beaches and partied in Bogota for over a decade. What is apparent now is that Colombians, too, have fallen for their country. Head­ over heels. Like teenagers in the first throes of passion, discovering every beautiful quirk and stomach flip - after years of being locked into an era where the very idea of tourism in their country was anathema. Colombia has more bird species than any other country, including the striking Emerald Toucanet . In the capital’s beautiful botanical garden, Esteban Jaramillo Pedroza, Commercial Director of Aviatur Ecotourism  tells me: ‘Ten years ago my mother wouldn’t let me travel overland. ‘She told me I must fly. It was too dangerous. We knew nothing of our country’s beauty - so we have been discovering it ever since.'

Coffee country: The fertile, mountainous land between Pereira, Armenia and Manizales . The world's finest: Mancini Torres tells the story of coffee from seed to cup at his San Alberto coffee plant . The enormous mountains here touch the sky, and are dressed in a million  trees.The ferns and vines are so old I imagine a brachiosaurus munching high up in the canopy. My journey begins at Otún Quimbaya in Risaralda, a sanctuary in the cloud forest, brimming with over 300 species of bird and home to spectacled bears and paramo tapirs. A morning walk is lit up by iridescent tanagers, and I witness a male and female torrent duck having a domestic (the stony glares and feathery turned backs say it all). Overnight, staying in the rustic lodgings laid on by Yarumo Blanco, the local community, I encounter more wildlife than I require, including a spider-on-cockroach attack.

In the pristine forest that is her garden, she grows plantain, cacao, yukka, potatoes, coffee and a rainbow of delicious fruits. The farm, surrounded by mist, is paradisaical.

But he also said Calico's mission could prove to be even more important than curing cancer. 'One of the things I thought was amazing is that if you solve cancer, you'd add about three years to people's average life expectancy,' Page told Time. 'We think of solving cancer as this huge thing that'll totally change the world. But when you really take a step back and look at it, yeah, there are many, many tragic cases of cancer, and it's very, very sad, but in the aggregate, it's not as big an advance as you might think.'","New health venture Calico will be run by Apple chairman Arthur Levinson .
