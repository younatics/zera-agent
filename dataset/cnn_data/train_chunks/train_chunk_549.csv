With viewing figures of almost . 10 million every week, the popularity of ITV's . charming period drama Downton Abbey is in no doubt. But . it appears a weekly television fix is not enough for some Downton fans who are so fixated with the upstairs/downstairs lives of . the 1920s characters that they want to dress like them too. Not only have fashion brands reported increased interest in retro flapper style dresses and demure ruffled blouses - but apparently we are in such awe of ladies of the . manor Sybil, Mary and Edith Crawley that we are keen to copy their nightwear too. Since Downton Abbey hit screens again, vintage nightwear sales have surged . As the most recent series of Downton Abbey returns to our screens, 1920s luxury lingerie brand Lucile has reported seeing an unprecedented increase in sales - thanks, they say, to the fact that the brand's name was mentioned during the show. Lucile lingerie, a brand which was very popular in the 1920s and has since been revived, has seen website traffic increase by 62 per cent and overall sales increase by 48 per cent since the hit show returned. The brand was only recently revived by the great great granddaughter of the brand's original creator, Lady Duff Gordon, and is in its first season of selling. Lady Duff Gordon was a legend in the lingerie world and created revolutionary designs for couture brands opening boutique stores in New York, Paris, Chicago, and the most famous flagship ‘Maison Lucile’ in Hanover Square, London. She made her mark in the fashion world by designing lingerie deemed scandalous at the time, free as it was from corsetry and wired underskirts. The lingerie brand, which was famous in the 1920's, has been redesigned with a modern twist . Lucile lingerie quickly became popular with film stars, royalty and nobility - the Queen of Spain, Lily Elsie, and the Duchess of Warwick - all flocked to her famous boutiques. An ‘It Girl’ of the Belle Époque era, Lady Duff Gordon's designs challenged and changed both the fashion industry and women’s perception of how they should look and feel. The female form was the inspiration behind each garment, with beautiful fabrics draped to create feminine silhouettes. Lady Gordon’s great-great granddaughter, . Camilla Blois, has now reinvented the brand - and has seen sales soar. The £715 Indiscretions Gown has already sold out, while the £499 Duchess . of Warwick short kimono has an extensive waiting list. The female form was the inspiration behind each garment which evoked an air of elegance and grandeur . Lucile's British heritage is the very core of the brand and perfectly reflects the glamour of Downton, as seen here in vintage images from the brand's archives .

Bert Eastham was devastated when doctors found cancerous cells in his nose three years ago and he was faced with a choice between radiotherapy or face disfiguring surgery to remove a cancerous tumour. The doctors recommended surgery as his best chance and so Mr Eastham, from Chorley, Lancashire, underwent an operation to remove his nose and top lip and six weeks ago he was fitted with a prosthetic nose made out of silicone and held onto his face using magnets. Determined not to let his deformity bring him down Bert, who now has the all clear, has been using his wicked sense of humour to keep his spirits up, even using his magnetic nose as a fridge magnet to make sure he doesn't misplace it. Bert Eastham has been fitted with a magnetic nose following nasal surgery . Appearing on This Morning today with his wife Olwyn Bert says that it is a sense of humour that has helped him and his family get through the past few years. He said: ''You don't know what you are capable of until you have to go through it. 'It was devastating to hear the diagnosis, like the bottom had dropped out of the world. 'When people hear cancer they think ""I'm dead""' 'After the shock I said I am going to banish negative thinking from this house, we have to be positive. 'I have always had a sense of humour, and you have to laugh in a situation like this. 'Now I have the perfect face for radio.' Bert shows This morning's Holly and Phil how easy it is to remove his new nose . The nose is made of silicone and mini metal poles and Bert uses Vaseline to smooth it on to his face . 'It is really sturdy!' Holly Willoughby holds the prosthetic nose . Bert's wife Olwyn, 62, said: 'His sense of humour carried us through, listening to him being so positive and funny at times made me think: we can win this. 'We had no intention of crumbling.' The nose is made of silicone and attached with two magnets, and Bert demonstrated how easy it was to take on and off by handing it to a surprised Holly live on air, asking: 'Do you want to feel? Can you wipe it for me while you have got it?' Holly said: 'It is really sturdy!' Mr Eastham admitted that he was almost . unable to look at himself in the mirror before getting his new nose and . thanked the prosthetic surgeons who created it before joking to Holly: . 'My story is not to be sniffed at.' Novel storage: The prosthetic nose has magnets that attach to magnetic studs implanted in Mr Eastham's face - this also means it easily sticks to the fridge in his kitchen . Speaking about the magnetic nose earlier last week he said: 'My new nose has given me a new lease of life but I was so worried we would lose it.' After repeatedly buying fridge magnets as souvenirs from his holidays, Mr Eastham came up with a brainwave and now sticks his prosthetic nose alongside the others on the side of the fridge freezer before he goes to bed. 'I used to wear my nose to bed when I first got it, but one night it fell off and landed in one of my slippers, when I got up in the middle of the night, I stood on my own nose. I got the shock of my life. Keeping it safe: Bert Eastham wearing his prosthetic nose which was fitted last month . 'It was only when I noticed the fridge magnets in our kitchen that I thought I would test out whether my new nose would stick to the side too. 'Now if I’m cooking dinner, sometimes I’ll just stick my nose on the fridge next to the magnets because I don’t know when my nose is running and I wouldn’t want anything going into the food. 'Or if I’m at a party with my . friends, I’ll maybe stick it on the fridge just to lighten things up. I . can’t wait for the next time we go on holiday and go through security . because I’ll have to take my nose off - I bet they won’t have seen that . before.' Mr Eastham was diagnosed with nasal cancer in 2009, after noticing growths on his face. He . said: 'For a year I had two scabs at the entry of each nostril, which I . assumed were cold sores. I just used to pick them off - I didn’t think . it was anything serious.' The . sores were swabbed and Bert was prescribed antibiotics but in February . 2009, he was transferred to Preston Royal Hospital for a biopsy where he . was diagnosed with cancer. Mr Eastham, who . lives with wife Olwyn, an accounts manager said: 'I felt like I . was in a dream, you always know someone with cancer but you never think . you’ll be the one to get it. 'It was such a blow - I had been made redundant the month before, so it was already a difficult time.' Mr Eastham, . who has seven grandchildren, was told the operation would be the most . effective treatment so he agreed to go for it - even though his face . would never be the same. Replacement: Mr Eastham waited more than three years for his new nose, and it was fitted last month . Result: 'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', said Mr Eastham . He . said: 'I was told it would leave me very disfigured but would be the . best option to fight the disease. It was life or death - so I didn’t . care about losing my nose. 'I . wanted to carry on living and see my grandchildren grow up, that’s what . was important to me. I must have sat in the car outside the house for . 40 minutes thinking of ways to break the news to my wife. 'She . burst into tears - she wasn’t expecting it. She phoned our family who . came round, it was very emotional. They were all so positive and told me . they were behind me.' Mr Eastham on his 60th birthday before surgery . Mr Eastham underwent the operation to remove his nose and most of his upper lip on April 16, 2009, before receiving four weeks of radiotherapy in June. He said: 'It was all very quick - I was home the next day. I was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses who would come to change the dressing - I can’t praise them enough. 'The dressing was removed every day until it healed - but I just couldn’t force myself to look at it.' Although Mr Eastham had the confidence to go out with friends and to the shops within two weeks of his operation, it took him six months to look at himself in a mirror. He said: 'I refused to look. I thought I looked so ugly the first time I did, my stomach dropped. The vain man in me would have likened me to Paul McCartney - my hero - but I just looked so different.' 'I went back for the prognosis, it was the first time I’d seen the surgeon smile. He said it was good news and that I had the all clear. It was such a big relief, I just felt brilliant', he added. Up until four weeks ago Mr Eastham wore a triangular-shaped plaster on his face in a bid to improve his appearance - but he added: 'Teenagers would actually shout abuse across the street, they would be laughing and pointing at me. 'Adults would avoid me - when they saw me they’d hurry their kids across the road. Some people thought I’d been in a terrible fight and had brought it on myself. I felt ignored and was sick of people patronising me. 'But it didn’t stop me going out, my amazing wife helped me and told me I was better than them - I wouldn’t let them stop me getting on with his life.' Family support: Bert and Olwyn Eastham on their wedding day, 1971. He said his 'amazing wife' helped him dealing with his treatment . Surgeons operated to improve the appearance of Bert’s top lip last September and he was finally fitted with a silicon nose produced by Oral Maxillofacial Surgery UK last month. Technicians at the firm spent months designing and producing the prosthetic nose, which was a rare task for them, as they were used to creating eyes, nipples and ears. 'They looked at photos to create an exact replica of my nose and matched my skin colour perfectly. It is so life-like, the detail is incredible - there are even varicose veins.' Mr Eastham had waited more than three years for his new nose, which is held on with magnets. 'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', he said. Within the last months, his self-confidence has shot up and he is delighted. 'When I walked out of the hospital with my new nose, not one person looked at me. I felt normal again. Although I’ll never look the same, I am so pleased I can get on with my life', he said.","Bert Eastham, 64, had the prosthetic nose fitted last month after nasal cancer treatment .

But sisters Donna Jones and Victoria Wardley have had to cope all their lives without recognising anyone – even themselves. Despite having normal eyesight the women suffer from an extreme form of 'face blindness.' Scroll down for video . Sisters Victoria Wardley (left) and Donna Jones (right) suffer from from prosopagnosia, a rare condition which makes them unable to recognise the faces of anyone around them . It means they do not recognise their . own faces in the mirror, do not know each other when they meet, cannot . recall their partners' features and when they were children they . routinely had to recognise their parents by their clothing. Their condition, prosopagnosia, has been known for decades, although little is understood about how it is caused. It appears the sisters from York never . developed the visual mechanisms in the brain required for face . processing and simply cannot do something we all take for granted. Mrs Wardley, 32, cannot describe what . her husband Matthew's face looks like. She said: 'I can make out an eye . or a nose, but when I try and look at a whole face it just doesn't work.

'I even find it hard to pick out my daughter from a crowd. 'I feel guilty – I should know what my own child looks like – but I just find it impossible.'

A  mother has given birth to a healthy daughter - after claiming medics told her she had lost her baby. Holly Lewis said she was twice told her unborn child would not survive during pregnancy scares at Birmingham Women’s Hospital. But now the 21-year-old from Birmingham is the proud mother of daughter Lacey. Holly Lewis claims she was twice told her baby would not survive. The 21-year-old from Birmingham went on to give birth to a healthy daughter called Lacey (right: with elder daughter Lilly) The little girl was born on September 29 and weighed 6lbs 3oz. 'She is my little miracle,' said Ms Lewis. 'I’m just glad she is here. I was distraught when I was told I had lost her. 'But I had a feeling they were wrong. I’ve already got another little girl and my earlier pregnancy meant I had an instinct I was still carrying Lacey.' The hospital said it was satisfied it had offered 'appropriate care' to Holly, whose other daughter is 19-month-old Lilly. On being told she had miscarried, Ms Lewis said: 'I had a feeling they were wrong. My older daughter Lilly is 19 months and my earlier pregnancy meant I had an instinct I was still carrying Lacey' Ms Lewis was first referred to the hospital in February after suffering a bleed early in her pregnancy. She claimed she was told the foetus had not survived after a scan. But a blood test the next day revealed she was still pregnant. But when she again suffered bleeding, Ms Lewis said she was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. She said: 'They refused me a scan saying there was . no point as it was an ectopic pregnancy.' Ms Lewis later discharged herself because she thought medics were wrong. 'I knew they were wrong because I knew the feeling of being pregnant, having had another baby.' Lacey was born on September 29 and weighed 6lbs 3oz . Birmingham Women's Hospital said it was satisfied it had offered 'appropriate care' to Ms Lewis and Lacey . She said she was told she was still pregnant when she rang the hospital the next day for the results of another blood test. 'I’ve never had an apology from the hospital and I’m disgusted at their actions,' she said. 'All I want is an apology to say they were wrong.They refused to offer me a second scan even though I kept asking.' Hospital chief executive Professor Ros Keeton said: 'When women come to the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit, we always explain what potentially may be causing any problems and the tests they will need to help us to make a diagnosis. 'We are always very honest with women about the range of scenarios. It is not always possible to detect a pregnancy on scanning in the very early stages and so we can not rely on this as a definitive diagnosis. 'Women are offered a range of investigations following which, the right plan of care can be offered.“We are satisfied the care provided to Ms Lewis was appropriate and followed national best practice for early pregnancy assessment. 'We are obviously delighted Ms Lewis has gone on to have her baby with us.'","Holly Lewis, 21, claims she was twice told her unborn child would not survive during pregnancy scares at Birmingham Women’s Hospital .

"He learned his craft during World War II, treating badly-burned soldiers . By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 04:12 EST, 27 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 27 November 2012 . Pioneer: Dr Joseph Murray, the surgeon who carried out the first successful kidney transplant, has died at 93 . Dr Joseph Murray, the surgeon who carried out the first successful kidney transplant and later won a Nobel Prize for his work, has died at the age of 93. Dr Murray died in Boston on Monday after suffering a stroke last Thursday. Murray and his team completed the first human organ transplant in 1954, taking a kidney from one identical twin and giving it to his twin brother, opening a new field in medicine. More than 600,000 people worldwide have received transplants since Murray's innovation. Dr Elizabeth Nabel, of Brigham and Women's Hospital where Dr Murray completed his training and returned to serve as chief of plastic surgery, said: 'The world is a better place because of all Dr Murray has given. 'His legacy will forever endure in our hearts and in every patient who has received the gift of life through transplantation.' Later in his career, Murray continued to search for ways of suppressing a patient's immune response to prevent it from rejecting foreign tissue, eventually becoming a co-winner of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1990. Son Rick Murray said his father was a 'great man'. He said: 'Difficulties are opportunities. This is a quote that sits atop my father's desk at home. 'It reflects the unwavering optimism of a great man who was generous, curious, and always humble.' Murray began his career in medicine after graduating from Harvard Medical School in the 1940s, and developed an interest in transplanting tissue while working with service personnel injured in World War Two. He completed his surgical training at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and later returned to join the staff and serve as chief of plastic surgery. He learned his craft during World War II, treating badly burned soldiers. By performing skin grafts on troops, he realised the biggest obstacle in the procedure was the immune system's rejection of foreign tissue . Revolutionary: Identical twins Edith Helms, left, and Wanda Foster, right, of Oklahoma, pose with Murray in 1996 at a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the 1956 operation during which Edith received a kidney from her sister, Wanda . Making history: Richard Herrick, front left, and his twin brother Ron, front right, pose with doctors, from top left, Joseph Murray, John Merrill and J. Hartwell Harrison, in 1954. Murray was lead surgeon in the first successful organ transplant in which Ron donated a kidney to Richard . With broad interests beyond medicine, Murray said told the Nobel Prize organisation that he and his extended family had been 'blessed in our lives beyond my wildest dreams.' 'My only wish would be to have 10 more lives to live on this planet. 'If that were possible, I'd spend one lifetime each in embryology, genetics, physics, astronomy and geology,' he said. 'The other lifetimes would be as a pianist, backwoodsman, tennis player, or writer for the National Geographic.' Success: Richard (centre) says farewell to a nurse at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital after he received a kidney from his brother (right) At just 23, Richard Herrick was dying. It was 1954 and the young man had been discharged from the Coast Guards months earlier and returned home to Massachusetts for an emotional reunion with his family, including twin brother Ronald. But Richard had been diagnosed with kidney disease - at the time a terminal disease - and the 'reunion' was little more than a family vigil by his bedside. At Public Health Service Hospital in Brighton, Massachusetts, the family waited for the inevitable. Not far away however, at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Harvard Medical School (HMS), a group of 'renegade' doctors and scientists were devising ways of transplanting healthy kidneys into those whose organs had failed. And they were looking for volunteers. The small group was viewed with skepticism by the medical establishment, with one physician dubbing them 'a bunch of fools' for their efforts, according to Harvard Science. But this group of 'fools'  led by a young surgeon and professor named Joseph Murray, felt strongly that they — and their dying patients — had nothing to lose and much to gain. Just before Christmas that same year, at 11.15am on December 23, they performed the world's first successful organ transplant, between Richard and Ronald. Richard Herrick lived eight more years. Murray once told interviewers: 'I had no idea of the worldwide influence of it. It expanded to other organs, multiple organs.'. 'If you’re going to worry about what people say, you’re never going to make any progress.'","More than 600,000 people worldwide have received transplants since Joseph Murray's pioneering innovation .

Dozens of British women each year are heading to America to defy the UK ban on choosing the sex of their baby. Gender selection is illegal in Britain, but couples wanting to balance their family are flying to New York and even as far Los Angeles, where doctors are prepared to help them have a boy or a girl. The medics at fertility clinics check the women’s fertilised eggs and then implant an embryo into them after checking that the child will have the required gender. Unusual decision: Gender selection is banned in Britain but allowed in the U.S . One doctor offering the service, British-trained Dr Jeffrey Steinberg, says he currently sees around 40 British couples a year. He has assisted 400 British women since he began offering the service a few years ago. Dr Steinberg, whose main clinic is in New York, said yesterday: 'New York is only a seven or eight-hour flight from most of Europe, so it works very well for those from Britain, France, Germany, Spain and the Middle East.' Dr Steinberg offers a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). A welcome message on his website says: 'If you want to be certain your next child will be the gender you are hoping for, no other method comes close to the reliability of PGD. 'While traditional sperm-screening techniques have a success rate of 60 to 70 per cent, only PGD offers virtually 100 per cent accuracy.' Dr Jeffrey Steinberg offers gender selection to British couples . The website adds: 'Unlike many programmes offering sex selection only to very limited couples with known genetic disorders in the family, we make sex selection available to all patients. 'Parents have come to us from nearly every nation on the planet - we have assisted patients from 147 different nations - seeking to balance their families or assure themselves that a pregnancy will result in only the gender outcome they desire.' Gender selection is banned in Britain under the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. It says a licence to assist in reproduction 'cannot authorise any practice designed to secure that any resulting child will be of one sex rather than the other'. It also forbids 'the testing of embryos for the purpose of establishing their sex'. British law only allows gender testing where there is a family history of serious physical or mental medical conditions which are gender related.","Gender selection is banned in the UK under the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act .

Or, to be more accurate, some of the long, luscious locks which we are accustomed to seeing swept back from her pretty face have been snipped into a sweeping fringe. Kate may have left only a handful of hair on the salon floor, but her new style has caused a sensation, dividing opinion and no doubt sparking a wave of copy-cat cuts. Now, to most men, her haircut will probably seem insignificant, nothing more than a nod to fashion, or a whim on Kate’s part. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were cheered by members of the public during an appearance on the balcony of the Guildhall in Cambridge . New 'do: Kate saw the funny side though as her blow dry blew across her face on the balcony . But we ladies know that a woman’s . hair is a barometer for her emotions, and that a cut often signals a . radical shift in an individual’s life. Many older women decide to chop . their hair when going through the menopause, for example, while younger . women change their look when something drastic has happened to them. And I should know. For when I was 22, . I had my heart broken. Really, truly, badly broken by someone I had . really, truly loved and trusted, and who behaved abominably. In those days, I had long, red hair . that had never been cut. It was so long that I could sit on it — some . thought it my crowning glory, though my ex had always told me, in his . affectionate way, that red-heads tended to go bald, and that he detested . the flame-haired beauties celebrated by the artist Titian and the . Pre-Raphaelites. At the time, I was too crushed to challenge him, but . when the affair was over I decided I was going to change it. Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart also struggled with the strong wind. She said the royal visit was 'absolutely huge' for the city . Despite being complemented on her new hairstyle, Kate appeared to be having second thoughts . What did I do? I went to Vidal Sassoon in London’s South Molton Street and asked them to cut it all off. I wanted to make the most radical alteration to my appearance I could think of. ‘Do you want me to stop here? Or . here?’ the hairdresser kept asking, anxiously, as he passed my . collarbones, my shoulders, my chin. ‘No,’ I snapped. ‘Keep going. I want it all off.’ When it was over, and I was the proud . owner of a shiny new bob, he gave me back the longest swag of my hair, . reverently woven into a plait and wrapped in tissue paper. ‘You could still wear it as a hair-piece,’ he said, sadly. Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart said the royal visit will be remembered for generations . Catherine greets people during her visit to the Guildhall . Like Kate, I also asked for a fringe, because a fringe feels like a screen you can hide behind. While I loved my new look, the cut . was a very public statement that something in my life had changed — and . not everyone liked the new message I was sending out. People who had . previously criticised me for being a shrinking violet decided I was now . ‘intimidating’ and ‘terrifying’. While everyone has been talking about Kate’s new hairstyle, some onlookers noted that her husband William’s hair seems to be disappearing at a remarkable rate. Once the proud possessor of a golden mop-top and a fringe eerily reminiscent of his late mother, now, at the age of 30, he increasingly resembles his balding relatives — particularly his Uncle Edward. Perhaps he will soon join his father, Prince Charles, in opting for a ‘comb-over’ to cover his bald spot. Friends were shocked, and my mother, . never one to mince her words, told me sadly that I ‘had cut off my one . real beauty’. I didn’t care. I felt like a newborn bird, lighter and . ready to fly away into a different life. I wonder what new stage in her life Kate was contemplating, when she sat in the hairdresser’s chair? After all, she turned 30 in January, and this year has made several . steps away from the natural, girlish look which so captivated Prince . William when they were both students at St Andrews. Her style, while always on the safe . side, has become more assured. She has rung the changes with elegant . chignons and a polished half-up half-down hairstyle during her recent . tour of South-East Asia — so perhaps the revamped locks are just the . burnishing of her new royal style. Or could there be something else going on? Predictably — given that she and . William have now been married for a year-and-a-half, and he has spoken . in the past about his desire for children — Kate’s new cut has sparked . speculation that she may be pregnant. (And if she is keeping a Very . Important Secret, then that demure long fringe is perfect for hiding . behind). Kate met 5-month-old James William Davies who was named after her husband William as she walked through the Market Square . Thousands of well wishers had braved the rain to greet William and Kate as they went on a walk about on their way to the senate house . William and Kate both wrapped up against the Cambridge chill in smart wool coats . William fuelled this speculation . yesterday on the couple’s first visit to their namesake city, Cambridge, . when he delightedly accepted a Babygro from a well-wisher. The tiny suit was emblazoned with a . helicopter and the words ‘Daddy’s little co-pilot’ in honour of the . Prince’s job as an RAF pilot. New mother Samantha Hill, 27, from . Sudbury, Suffolk, who made the present, had brought her baby daughter, . Beth, to see the royals. She said: ‘I made it for when his little one comes along. He’s a helicopter pilot, so his baby will think his daddy is cool. ‘When I gave it to him he said: “I’ll keep that.” ’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a tour of Jimmy's resettlement centre in Cambridge . Jimmy's was opened in 1995 in the basement of a Baptist church and is named after Jim Dilley, who spent the last few years of his life sleeping under a motorway bridge on the M11 . While such behaviour confirms William is broody, it does not, of course, prove Kate is pregnant. But, even if she isn’t expecting, . I’ll wager that she feels she is entering a new stage in her life, as a . royal and a wife, rather than a Sloaney twentysomething-about-town. And . those tumbling tresses are a key part of her identity — just as my own . red locks are a part of mine. By coincidence, my decision to go . short was made easier because of the fashion for bobbed hair set by . Princess Diana, Kate’s mother-in-law.

When she is tricked into going . through with the cut, she is appalled to realise that her new look makes . her hair lie ‘in lank lifeless blocks on both sides of her suddenly . pale face. It was ugly as sin.’ Of course, this is always the big . risk with any new hairstyle. Not everyone admires Kate’s new ’do —  even . the Duchess doesn’t seem entirely convinced by it. Yesterday she told a fan who complimented her on the style: ‘I’m not sure about it. It’s a bit windy today.’ Homeless catering manager Carmelo Giammona had his picture taken on a smartphone with the Duke and Duchess after he made Kate blush by kissing her hand and calling her beautiful .

UPDATED: . 07:17 EST, 7 December 2012 . 25 per cent of mothers in England had a Caesarean - a slight increase from the previous year . Older mothers are behind the number of Caesarean sections rising yet again. The latest maternity figures show that 25 per cent of mothers in England had a caesarean - a slight increase from the previous year, according to data from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Older mothers were more inclined to have an elective C section - with 18 per cent over the age of 35 opting not to give birth naturally. One in 10 mothers aged 25 to 34 had the elective surgery with just five per cent of those under 25 giving birth by caesarean, according to the hospital data from 2011 and 2012. The Royal College of Midwives has raised concerns about the figures. Louise Silverton, the RCM's director for midwifery, said: 'That means that one in four women giving birth is having a caesarean, which is a major surgical procedure. 'There has also been a rise in the number of elective caesareans while the number of emergency caesareans has remained stable. Questions must be asked as to what the driver is behind this increase in elective surgery. 'An increase in caesarean rates and instrumental deliveries often reflects a decrease in involvement with midwives, and this concerns me.' The data also shows that more older women and fewer teenagers are having babies. The rate of teenage mothers giving birth in English hospitals has fallen by a fifth in five years. In 2011/12, 33,600 mothers aged 13 to 19 gave birth in NHS hospitals - a 22 per cent fall on the number recorded in 2006/07. Older mothers were more inclined to have an elective C section - with 18 per cent over the age of 35 opting not to give birth naturally . In the same time frame, the number of mothers aged 40 to 49 increased by 16 per cent, from 22,200 to 25,600. Ms Silverton added: 'This data also shows that the age profile of pregnant women is getting older. ""The baby boom, combined with the increasing age of mothers, means greater demands on maternity services, as pregnancies for older women can give rise to increased complications and a need for medical interventions, which demands more of midwives and others in the maternity team. 'As we are in the midst of a baby boom, these factors together with the increasing social complexity of care needs for all mothers have a dramatic effect on the workload heaped on already overstretched midwives.' London has the most older mothers - but the youngest number of teenage pregnancies . HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan added: 'While the number of hospital deliveries in England has broadly risen - albeit relatively slowly - in recent years, almost 10,000 fewer hospital deliveries last year were to teen mums compared to five years previously. 'This drop in hospital teen deliveries has occurred in all regions of the country, although the North East still has the highest rate of deliveries among 13 to 19-year-olds according to its population size. In contrast, London has the lowest rate for teenage mothers, but the highest rate for older mothers.","18 per cent over mothers over 35 opted not to give birth naturally .

A mother-of-two who suffered 200 crippling headaches a day has been ‘cured’ thanks to a remote control that zaps her brain. Carolyn Matheson’s chronic condition is known as ‘suicide headaches’ among doctors because of the maddening effect it has on patients. Waves of pain can strike Carolyn, 58, in either minute-long bursts of up to 200 a day or in agonising two-hour-long attacks. During the episodes she is sometimes unable to move or even talk. Misery: Carolyn lived with chronic headaches for eight years until she had the implant . Carolyn has lived with the chronic cluster headaches for eight years since they started on a holiday in Greece with her husband Ian, 59, and daughters Jade, 21, and Emma, 19. But now Carolyn, from Greenwich, London, has been handed a lifeline from her misery in the form a remote control that stops her headaches. Specialist surgeons have inserted the matchbox sized implant into chest so it sends an electric impulse to her brain blocking any pain. The stimulator is permanently on but the strength of the implant’s impulses can be changed through a mobile phone-sized remote control, which she carries with her wherever she goes. She now only has one or two headaches a day and has described the results as ‘a true miracle.’ Carolyn, an executive coach specialising in chronic health conditions, had her life turned upside down by the illness and every-day activities became out of the question. She said: 'There was one time before when I was shopping in central London with my daughter and had to just lie down on the floor in Primark on Oxford Street as the pain was too much. 'I couldn’t do anything until the pain had gone.' Her specialist, consultant neurologist Dr Manjit Matharu said many female patients had said they’d rather endure child birth every day than suffer these headaches. Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNA) are a rare form that more commonly occur in men aged over 50. The disorder is marked by bursts of moderate to severe burning, piercing, or throbbing pain, usually on one side of the head and around the eye or temple. The pain usually peaks within seconds of onset and may follow a pattern of increasing and decreasing intensity. Attacks typically occur in daytime hours and last from 5 seconds to 4 minutes per episode. Individuals generally have five to six attacks per hour. Other symptoms include watery eyes, reddish or bloodshot eyes and nasal congestion. The episodes are generally non-responsive to usual treatment for other headaches. Studies have shown that injections of glycerol to block nerve signaling along the trigeminal nerve may provide temporary relief. There is no proven cure for these headaches. The disorder is not fatal but can cause considerable discomfort. For more visit www.ninds.nih.gov . He said: 'They are commonly referred . to as ‘suicide’ headaches, as for some patients the pain becomes too . much and they make attempts to end their own lives. 'Carolyn . tried fifteen different treatments before the implant, unfortunately . they didn’t work but the implant has significantly improved her quality . of life.' It took three years to diagnose Carolyn with chronic cluster headaches meaning she suffered up to 16 hours of pain a day. There is just a one in a 15 million chance of suffering both of Carolyn’s conditions together, and only 200 people in the UK have had the £20,000 implant as only the worst cases qualify. Carolyn’s surgery was only approved once she had tried every other treatment available on the NHS first. The ground-breaking procedure involves wires being fed under the skin from the implant to two electrodes in her brain. In the past the battery in her chest would have been replaced every couple of years, however now the implant is rechargeable, meaning Carolyn has to spend four to six hours a week quite literally ‘re-charging her batteries’. This is done through the skin with a charger that connects to the mains being placed above the implant. She said: 'I use it as time to relax, as I can’t really do anything during that time as I’m plugged in, so it’s the perfect opportunity to avoid cooking tea.' She said: 'I can feel the scar tissue and in some places the wires, but it’s very discreet, I call it my little friend as I can feel it buzzing constantly. 'It’s very soothing to know it’s there and doing its job.' The four-hour operation was carried out in September at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. Carolyn said before that surgery her headaches were a nightmare. She said: 'It’s a very sharp pain, like someone has stabbed a boiling hot rod into your eye and through your head, and then slowly twisting it.' Carolyn used to inhale 100% oxygen for 10 minutes as a treatment for cluster headaches . When at its worst, she was unable to drive, was only able to work one day a week. Simple every-day tasks such as using the cooker were dangerous in case an attack was brought on unexpectedly. The condition was also tough for her daughters to understand initially, but Carolyn found support from headache group Ouch UK, and was then able to fully explain the severity of her condition. She said: 'They were teenagers when it first started, so it was hard for them as they thought ‘oh mum just has another headache’, but now they understand and have been great.' She has tried numerous drugs in a bid to control the pain, and even though the implant has worked wonders, she still has to keep using injections, oxygen and drugs to keep the condition at bay. Carolyn said: 'I still have good days and bad days. 'I can’t change what’s happened, but I’m using my experience to try to help others- as an executive coach I talk to employers about how to deal with chronic illness in the work place.' The wait for the implant has had a dramatic impact on her life, especially her career. She said: 'When I became ill I had my own business and was thinking of expanding. 'Then the headaches struck, and it all came to a grinding halt. 'I didn’t tell people because I didn’t want them to question whether I was up to the job, I would work longer hours just to compensate for the fact that I felt I wasn’t able to do my work due to feeling so unwell.'

Cancer specialists have hailed a 'landmark moment' for treatment after doctors bathed two patients' livers with chemotherapy drugs. It is the first time that patients in the UK have received the targeted chemotherapy treatment on just one organ. Doctors at Southampton General Hospital who pioneered the treatment say the technique could reduce side-effects by limiting the exposure of healthy tissue to the drugs. Chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells but attack healthy cells as well, causing unpleasant side-effects (file picture) This means higher doses could be given without causing damage to the patient. Dr Brian Stedman, a consultant interventional radiologist, has performed the 60-minute treatment on two patients. The liver was separated using two balloons to divert the blood supply past the organ. Following the treatment, known as chemosaturation therapy or percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), the blood from the liver was drained from the patient and processed through a filtration machine to reduce toxicity before it was returned to the patient via the jugular vein. Results of a recent study in the US showed patients who received PHP survived five times longer before the disease - metastatic melanoma - progressed than those who had standard chemotherapy. The targeted chemo-bath treatment has been performed in the UK for the first time at Southampton General Hospital . Dr Stedman said: 'To cut off an organ from the body for 60 minutes, soak it in a high dose of drug and then filter the blood almost completely clean before returning is truly groundbreaking. 'Previously, the outlook for patients specifically suffering from cancer which has spread to the liver has been poor because the effect of standard chemotherapies is limited by the unwanted damage the drug causes to the rest of the body.' Dr Stedman, who is the lead for pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer in Southampton, added that the treatment could go on to be used for a number of other cancers, including colon, breast and melanoma. In addition to studies in the US, the technique has been used in Germany, Italy, Ireland and France.","First time patients in UK have received chemotherapy treatment on just one organ .

As the first anniversary of the superstar's death approaches next month, Cissy Houston is still traumatised by her drowning in a Beverley Hilton hotel bath at the age of 48 . But in her memoirs, Remembering Whitney, her mother admits: 'She started partying and she didn't really know how to stop. I used to wonder what she was doing at night, where she was.' Last picture: Whitney Houston seen here two days before she died at the Beverley Hilton hotel . Couple: Whitney Houston with her husband Bobby Brown. They lived in a mansion in Atlanta . According to the extract obtained by People Magazine, Cissy continues to ask herself: 'Could I have saved her?' In a serialisation in the Sun, she . first realised her daughter had problems when she arrived unannounced at . the mansion in Atlanta, Georgia, Whitney shared with her husband, . singer Bobby Brown, and their daughter Bobbi Kristina. Cissy, . 79, had been called by her son Gary in early 2005 warning her: 'Ma, I . think Nippy [the family's pet name] is really in trouble.' He travelled . everywhere with the singer. Inside, . the multi-million house was filthy, but Cissy's biggest shock came when . she saw 'big glaring eyes and strange faces' spray painted on the walls . and door. Mother and daughter: Whitney and her daughter Bobbi Kristina . Then in another room, she discovered .

Cissy recalled: 'Evil eyes staring out like a threat. Who would do such a thing it seemed crazy. It was beyond disturbing to seeing my daughter's face cut out like that. It was frightening.' In her memoirs, Remembering Whitney by Cissy Houston, due to be published by Harper and Collins (£18.99) on January 31st, she tells how her daughter yelled at her and refused to come downstairs. Cissy said her daughter looked as if she was on drugs and did not recognise the woman who was a worldwide star with many Grammy music awards and acclaim as an actress. She left the house but vowed to save Whitney, returning with a court order and two women police deputies. The petition had been signed by eight people and a doctor who had seen the singer in the past 48 hours. When they arrived, Whitney and Bobby Brown were at the doorway.

Here's a golden chance, quite literally, for Nitish Kumar to give a boost to tourism in Bihar. The royal family of Thailand has offered to donate 100 kg gold to build a dome atop the Buddha temple it has constructed in Bodh Gaya. But the chief minister is running scared of accepting this glittering gift, valued at `35 crore by the current market rate of gold. If tourism ministry sources are to be believed, Nitish is afraid that the temple with a golden dome will create a law and order problem in the holy town and that it would be difficult to guard the structure. Thailand's Queen Sirikit (left) has offered to donate the gold. But Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has concerns . That's why, they claim, the Bihar government has been sitting on the proposal communicated to it by the Thai royal trust, managed by the Queen's office, almost five months ago. ""The state government has expressed its inability to provide adequate security to a temple having 100-kg gold plating on its top,'' a senior official said. But the patience of the Thai royal trust and tourism authorities seems to be running out. Apparently unhappy with their experience of dealing with the state administration, they took their plea to expedite the matter to Union tourism minister K. Chiranjeevi. A team of Thai tourism officials and an Indian delegation met Chiranjeevi at the Bangkok airport on Wednesday during his brief stopover there on his way back to New Delhi from Laos after attending the ASEAN tourism ministers' conclave. He promised the Thai authorities all help. When contacted, Chiranjeevi told Mail Today: ""I have sought more details from the Indian mission in Bangkok. I have been requested to take up the matter with the state government to clear the proposal soon. I am going to talk to Nitishji and persuade him to expedite the matter."" The minister asserted that the royal gift would benefit Bihar and eventually India. It will not only enrich the temple town, but is also likely to make Bodh Gaya more popular among the tourists flocking to the Buddhist circuit, he added. The . Bodh Gaya temple is important for Bihar's tourism . ""One . cannot underestimate the instant global publicity it will give to Bodh . Gaya and to other Buddhist circuit spots in the state. It will also give . impetus to infrastructure development, including hotels and . connectivity modes, to attract more tourists from ASEAN countries,"" he . said. Nitish could not . be unaware of all this. It's safe to presume that he pretty well . realises that the move will be a free publicity for state tourism, which . is in dire need of a lift. Despite that, his government has been . reluctant to acquiesce to the offer because of safety concerns. Mail Today tried to contact the Bihar CM on Friday afternoon, but he was not available. This correspondent left his contact details for a response from his office, but there was none till late evening. However, the central government officials cited the issue to put the Nitish government in dock over his claims of improved governance and law and order. ""If you can't provide security in a globally-acclaimed Buddhist circuit hotspot like Bodh Gaya, which is also the main revenue earner for Bihar's tourism department, then what is the assurance for other areas in the state?"" an official asked. Interestingly, the tourism ministry babus also took a dig at their Bihar counterparts for the red-tape and blame game that typifies bureaucracy. ""There has been no response so far from the state to the Queen's trust. The government has blamed the authorities entrusted with granting permission, which include the temple trust in Bodh Gaya, which is managed by nominees of the state administration and Buddhist monks. The local babus, on their part, do not miss an opportunity to blame the Archaeological Survey of India and allege that it's the ASI that is putting roadblocks,"" a senior government official in New Delhi said. In Bangkok and Laos, Chiranjeevi also received other complaints from Buddhists, the most common being about the lack of basic facilities, such as toilets, on the Buddhist trail taken by tourists in India, particularly in Bihar, which mostly entails road journey in the state. Senior ministry officials said Chiranjeevi was almost speechless when his Laos counterparts raised the issue of hygiene around the Buddhist holy sites in India. ""We carry the Indian soil to our monasteries and keep it in our homes where we perform daily worship... and feel really sad to see people relieving themselves next to our temples,'' the Laos tourism minister is learnt to have told Chiranjeevi.","Queen Sirikit’s trust plans gold donation for temple .

Grandmother Patricia Barden (pictured here in an old image), 77, who died after falling into a cesspit in her garden . A grandmother drowned after falling into a 14ft-deep cesspit in her garden. Patricia Barden, 77, was walking outside her house when a rusty manhole cover gave way beneath her. She plunged into the cesspit, which was two-thirds full, and would have been unable to climb up its smooth sides. Police who were called to the home found her shoes nearby and told an inquest she may have hurled them out in a desperate attempt to attract help. It is not clear how long she survived but nearly four days elapsed between the last time someone spoke to her and when her body was found at the detached £450,000 property in Milden, near Ipswich. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Dan Sharpstone, assistant deputy coroner for Suffolk, said: ‘The metal cover and brickwork was in a poor state... it was described as a death trap. ‘Mrs Barden fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out. Tragically, she drowned.’ Widow Mrs Barden had lived alone since her husband, Charles, died in 1994. Her daily routine involved getting up at 7.30am and having a walk and a cup of tea in her beloved garden. Suffolk Police were called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year after a concerned family member said they were unable to get in contact with her. They were let in by her step-granddaughter, Charlotte Rush, who drove up from Kent with a set of keys. The doors were locked and there was no sign of trouble but an officer made the grim discovery in the garden. Detective Inspector David Giles told the inquest in Bury St Edmunds: ‘An officer noticed an open manhole and, with the use of a torchlight, saw what was believed to be a body in the bottom of the pit, in the water. Suffolk Police were first called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble . ‘We concluded that somehow she had . fallen in. The access to the cesspit was heavily corroded. I think at . some point she stood on the cover and it has given way as there is no . strength there. If you had gone in there, you wouldn’t have been able to . get out without any assistance. We will never know exactly the day that . she fell or how long she was in there.’ Mrs Barden’s body was removed by firefighters on July 3 and she was pronounced dead by a paramedic. 'She . lived her life to the full and we are all extremely sad that she is no . longer with us,' - Step-granddaughter Charlotte Rush . A post mortem examination  confirmed . the cause of death was drowning. Receipts showed she went to a . supermarket in Sudbury on June 27 last year and Miss Rush’s cousin spoke . to her the following day. An inspection by a drain inspector revealed . the fragile state of the manhole cover and that the surrounding . brickwork and concrete was so corroded it could barely support its . weight. Reading a statement submitted by Miss . Rush, Dr Sharpeston said: ‘Her step-grandmother was an active person who . drove to local towns and had a nice life.’ Residents near Mrs Barden’s home paid . tribute to her as a ‘pillar of the community’ who was ‘articulate’ and . ‘well-presented’. She held numerous fundraising events including coffee . mornings and bazaars for her local church, St Peter’s. Speaking after the inquest, Miss Rush, . 30, said: ‘My beloved nan, Patricia, was the best nan in the world.

Two fraudsters who ripped off an estimated 16,000 music lovers by selling gig tickets which never existed have been jailed for a total of eight years. Gary Agar, 44, and his brother-in-law Andrew Lagan, 49, duped fans of acts including Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney into buying fake tickets tickets online. The £2.65million scam targeted big events all over the country and Europe such as T in the Park festival in Balado, Kinnross-shire, Scotland, the V Festivals, in Staffordshire and Essex, and the Benicassim festival in Spain. Jailed: Andrew Lagan, left, and Gary Agar, right, were found guilty of defrauding an estimated 16,000 music fans out of money for gig tickets which never existed . Sentencing the two men at Harrow Crown Court today Judge Martyn Barklem said: 'It was a nasty and greedy fraud aimed at duping large numbers of people, mostly young people who bought tickets in good faith.' But he added that he accepted neither Agar nor Lagan were the 'mastermind' behind the conspiracy and that the evidence suggested a criminal based in Hungary had approached them and set up fraudulent websites. The judge added: 'You were instrumental in transferring away the large sums of money that were received.' 'I am satisfied that neither of you received the lion's share of the proceeds of this fraud.' The fake tickets were for the biggest events up and down the country and across Europe for acts such as Kings of Leon (pictured) Music fans paid money for tickets to see artists such as Jay-Z, left, and Sir Paul McCartney, right, that never existed . The conmen sold the tickets through their company Good Time Entertainments between November 2009 and October 2010. Prosecutor Toby Fitzgerald said: 'Having had the money transferred into a bank account controlled by the defendants the money was removed from the bank account. 'It was removed to make very sure that when the inevitable time of reckoning came, when it became clear that the tickets were not provided and people were after their money back, the money had disappeared,' he added. Some of the transfers were made to Link FX money exchange in Victoria, central London, where more than £1.5m in cash was withdrawn. The rest was split up between an account in Hungary and an account held in Thailand - where Agar would regularly visit. When customers did not receive their tickets, they contacted their credit or debit card issuers, who in turn contacted First Data International (FDI), who handled the purchases. More than £1.5m is believed to have been withdrawn from Link Fx in Victoria during the scam . First Data International had provided Good Time Entertainments with a 'merchant terminal' through which they would take payment for the bogus tickets. Lagan and Agar had agreed a deal with the Hungarian company, allowing them to use their merchant terminal in return for a commission. Many music fans were never reimbursed and only £1.9m was returned via charge backs for the offences. Lagan, of North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Agar, of South Ruislip, west London, were both convicted of . two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of converting or . transferring criminal property after a two week trial at Harrow Crown . Court.

Hedgehog numbers have declined by more than a third in the past decade, research reveals. The fall is being blamed on their access to food being reduced by a loss of hedgerows, larger field sizes and greater use of garden fencing. Between 2003 and 2012, surveys by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species found that sightings of hedgehogs in towns and cities across Britain had fallen by 37 per cent. Worrying: Sightings of hedgehogs in Britain have declined by 37 per cent between 2003 and 2012 . The amount of prey available for the mammals to feed on has fallen due . to the use of pesticides, while in urban areas, tidy, sterile gardens . has also contributed to their demise. Experts ALSO believe the decline in numbers is . linked to the loss of permanent grasslands and the . intensification of agriculture. ‘Over the last 20 years or so, the world’s tiger population is thought to have halved,’ said surveys officer David Wembridge. ‘Although they are very different animals and there are many fewer tigers left in the wild, the fact that we are losing hedgehogs in Britain as quickly should ring alarm bells as loudly. 'We are very concerned. Hedgehogs are quite not fussy feeders, so they should be able to get by even in a bad year. Problems: The dramatic fall in the population of one Britain's most beloved garden visitors is being blamed on a loss of hedgerows, larger fields sizes and greater use of fencing . 'So a fall in numbers suggest a bigger problem, particularly with the diversity of creatures in our soil and the health of the land. 'The biggest issue is the loss of habitat, such as hedgerows, and bigger intensively-farmed fields. In urban areas, the use of fences makes many gardens inaccessible, while paving and decking are not good hunting ground.' In an effort to gather further data about hedgehogs, the trust is appealing for volunteers to take part in the Hedgehog Hibernation Survey which starts on Friday 1 February. 'Continuous monitoring each year is vital to help us build a more complete picture of the state of the UK's wild mammal populations,' said Mr Wembridge.","Sightings have fallen by 37 per cent between 2003 and 2012 .

Busted: George Boedecker, 51, plead guilty to DUI in court yesterday after his bizarre arrest in Colorado last year . The founder of Crocs decided to change his 'not guilty' plea over a DUI arrest, and admitted in court yesterday that he was 'wasted' at the time. George Boedecker, 51, plead guilty in a Boulder, Colorado, courtroom on Thursday, after he was pulled over in his Porsche and blamed his 'girlfriend' Taylor Swift for the incident, last August. The entrepreneur has been sentenced to two years probation and 96 hours of community service, TMZ reported. Police found Boedecker slumped over the wheel of the black Porsche in Boulder on August 12, and when cops decided to arrest him, he said: 'Go f**k yourselves in the a**.' The bizarre confrontation with police also saw Boedecker allegedly blame country star Taylor Swift - who was thousands of miles away with her then boyfriend Conor Kennedy. Police and paramedics said that when . Boedecker got out of the car, which was partially on the sidewalk, he . had trouble keeping his balance and was slurring his words. A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy'. Boedecker, whose other business ventures . include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who . asked what had happened. A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument. When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift. When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighboring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville. The officer wrote that Boedecker then became agitated, saying he was done with the questions that that things were about to get 'mid-evil'. Wild claims: Boedecker is not believed to have ever been romantically linked to Taylor Swift . Shortly after that, Boedecker was . arrested, but he apparently was not done talking, as the officer noted . that the philanthropist told him and another responding officer to 'go . f*** themselves in the a**' and that he hoped the cop would 'f****** . die.' Unfortunately for . Boedecker and his story, Swift was in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at . the time of his arrest with her actual boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his . family - about 2,000 miles away.

Peter Andre has launched a scathing attack on ex-wife Katie Price's whirlwind third wedding, raging at friends: 'What kind of example does this set for our children?' In shocking new claims, it has emerged the Mysterious Girl singer only discovered former glamour model Katie, 34, had married stripper Kieran Hayler, after a six week romance, by reading it online. It was reportedly a distressing blow to Andre, 39, who was looking after the couple's children, Princess, five, and Junior, seven, at the time and had 'no idea what to tell them'. Gobsmacked: Peter Andre discovered his wife had married for the third time by reading it online . The singer, who is still grieving the death of his brother Andrew, told friends: 'Kate thinks of marriage and divorce like most people think of buying something and returning it if it goes wrong. 'What does that say to Princess?' The pal revealed to Now magazine that Andre was shocked at the news Katie had secretly wed Kieran, who has appeared as a stripper in BBC 1 soap EastEnders, in an intimate Caribbean wedding with just six guests. Family guy: Peter was looking after his children Princess, five, and Junior, seven, when he heard the shocking news . It is thought Pete's first concern was the impact another husband would have on his children's life and what they are learning about marriage. A source told Closer magazine: 'Pete's worried Princess thinks getting married is an everyday thing. He's told the kids it's a special commitment to a person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with. 'He doesn't give a t**s about her marrying again, but he can't believe she'd do this to the kids. they'd only just got used to Leo. He wishes she would act her age - not her boyfriend's.' In love, but will it last? Kieran and Katie are no strangers to sharing PDAs on Twitter . Another friend spilled the beans to Heat: 'The kids have had three different men living in that house since Katie and Pete split up, and he's worried it could be distressing for them.' Friends have speculated that since Pete  split from his wife in 2009, Katie's mission has been to make her ex jealous and she wanted to beat Pete, who is happily dating medical student Emily MacDonagh, to getting hitched. Since Katie and Pete split in 2009, businesswoman Katie married cage-fighting drag queen Alex Reid in February 2010 before splitting in January 2011. Getting serious: Peter Andre and girlfriend Emily MacDonagh are thought to considering marriage . 'She's insane': Friends of Pete's believe the former glamour model was happiest when she was married to the star (pictured here in 2008) From marriage to marriage: Katie wed Alex Reid in February 2010, their marriage lasted less than a year . Relationship breakdown: Katie was recently engaged to model Leandro Penna but the relationship deteriorated . In claims which will devastate Katie Price bodybuilder Jodie Marsh has revealed Kieran Hayler pursued her on twitter. The former model has labelled the stripper 'fame hungry'. Jodie claims she was bombarded with messages from gym enthusiast Kieran, telling Heat: 'He was obsessed with me... I started to believe he was one of those ""party boys"" -boys who just want to get with someone famous.' The messages began ten months ago, when Kieran sent Jodie snaps of himself in his underwear adding he wanted to help her out with her fitness range. Jordan and Jodie famously fell out after a spat more than ten years ago over surgically enhanced breasts. Jodie added: 'I almost feel sorry for Katie now.' She then met Argentine model Leandro Penna in February 2011 at an Oscars' party before getting swiftly engaged in April 2012 - they had split by last October and her former lover later said she had a 'crazy mind.' 'Kate's completely crazy - she honestly believes every man she marries will make Pete jealous, ' a friend of Pete's said. Although Katie has gushed about her marriage and how brilliant her new gym enthusiast husband is, close friends of the reality star are thought to be worried about her diving in to marriage so soon, including her usual stanch supporter, mother Amy. A friend told Closer: 'Amy is worried about the whole thing. She says that Kieran is just a boy and he has no idea about what is to come.' But never one to encourage the critics, mother-of-three Katie, who has made no secret of her desire to have another baby and some say Pricey is thought to be expecting already. 'Katie told pals she thinks she is pregnant and that it could be twins. She's overjoyed.' A spokeswoman denied that Katie was expecting twins but did not comment on pregnancy rumours. Pete is said to be concentrating on his own life and recently celebrated his six month anniversary with his 23-year-old lover. There have been rumours Pete may be planning to marry Emily, which sources say could have pushed Katie over the edge. A spokesman for Pete said he has not spoken publicly to any family or friends about his ex's new nuptials. Katie married Kieran in an intimate Bahamas ceremony and the reality star is thought to have talked to her children before tying the knot. Just hours after Pete's alleged reaction came to light Katie hit out at 'people surrounding her ex' and added that she refused to get into an argument affecting her children. In a statement posted on her website, Katie writes:  'I know my marriage to Kieran is going to attract criticism and that there will be people selling stories on the back of their perception of me and my decision. Heartfelt: Katie's full statement was in response to stories claiming Pete was 'gobsmacked' at her whirlwind wedding . 'I will take that criticism on the chin and argue my corner where I feel it is necessary. What I won't do is get dragged into a tit for tat argument with Pete about the children to be played out in public - they are old enough to read these things. She adds, in an apparent scathing attack on her former management company CAN associates: 'I know he has people around him that would want him to do an article running me down if I took up stamp collecting let alone get married quickly but I believe him to be a bigger man than that. 'If Pete has an issue or concerns, he has my number. Pete is a good father - everyone knows he loves our Children. So do I. 'Our Children are happy and healthy as he knows.

It comes from donations.' The only criteria for couples is that both bride and groom attend a four part pre-nuptial counselling course, a wedding rehearsal and, ideally, Sunday services for three weeks before the wedding . So far the church have provided eight receptions; three where they have cooked a three-course meal for the couple, and five where they have provided a buffet.

Anti-capitalist activists protesting against the World Economic Forum in Davos have claimed responsibility for explosions that broke a window at a Zurich branch of Credit Suisse and blew up the postbox of the boss of commodity trader Glencore. Police confirmed on Friday that attacks had been made on a Credit Suisse branch in the upmarket residential area of Hottingen and a postbox in the lakeside suburb of Rueschlikon in the early hours of Thursday morning. Credit Suisse confirmed a security window of its branch had been shattered. Police said the damage, caused by an unidentified explosive device, amounted to several thousand francs. Targetted: A  postbox outside a property owned by Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg was blown up by activists protesting against the World . Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland . A spokesman for Zurich police said investigations were continuing into who was behind the attacks and what had caused the explosions, while Glencore confirmed an incident had taken place on the property of CEO Ivan Glasenberg. No-one was injured in either attack. An unnamed group posted a letter on . the indymedia.ch website claiming responsibility for the attacks. The . letter said the group had targeted Credit Suisse and Glasenberg due to . their support of the WEF. In the letter, the activists . criticised poor working conditions at Glencore and said it had targeted . Credit Suisse for a host of reasons, including food price speculation, . mass job losses and 'betting against the Greek people'. Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg has been scrutinised for his company's involvement in mining operations in countries from Zambia to Colombia . Glencore's 2011 stock market flotation has led to increased scrutiny by environmental and anti-corruption campaigners over its involvement in mining operations in countries from Zambia to Colombia. Until the listing, Glasenberg, who grew up in South Africa and became CEO in 2002, had lived with his family in relative anonymity in Rueschlikon, a lakeside town about 6 km from Zurich where he moved in 1994. In 2011, left-wing activists claimed responsibility for a small explosion that broke windows at a hotel in Davos without hurting anybody. At the time, a group calling itself Revolutionary Perspective said in a statement on an activist website it had targeted the ski resort's luxury Posthotel with a fire bomb as Swiss ministers and representatives of top bank UBS were staying there. Last night British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson were pictured enjoying  a ‘raucous’ meal in an expensive restaurant in Davos. The group were spotted at the ‘cosy’ Alte Post restaurant in Davos where the cheapest option is a £22 pizza and some wine runs into hundreds of pounds.

'Vulnerabilities': The British military's head of cyber security Major General Jonathan Shaw (above) says the Ministry of Defence has been attacked by hackers . Cyber criminals have managed to hack into some of the Ministry of Defence's top secret computer systems, the military's head of cyber-security has admitted. Major General Jonathan Shaw said the number of serious incidents was 'quite small', but conceded it was likely that some attacks had gone undetected. Maj Gen Shaw said the level of cyber . attacks were 'still on an upward curve', meaning increasing the security . of the military's computer networks was now a top priority. The admission comes just days after . The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was forced to take its website . offline after being targeted by hackers. In March, it emerged that senior British military figures and MoD staff . opened themselves up to potential security breaches by accepting friend . requests from a bogus Facebook account set up in the name of Nato's top . commander. It was also revealed earlier this year how British military officials and civil . servants in the Cabinet Office were victims of cyber group Anonymous that hacked into a . U.S. intelligence firm's computers over Christmas. Maj Gen Shaw said: 'The number of serious incidents is quite small, but it is there. And those are the ones we know about. The likelihood is there are problems in there we don't know about.' Maj Gen Shaw, a veteran of the Falklands and Iraq wars, did not say who was behind the attacks on the MoD. He said that next year's MoD budget was expected to include new money to improve cyber-defence despite widespread cutbacks. 'Need to engage': The MoD's headquarters in Whitehall. The department is expected to get new money in its budget to improve cyber-defence . 'I think it was a surprise to people this . year quite how vulnerable we are, which is why the measures have . survived so long in the (budget) because people have become aware of the . vulnerabilities and are taking them seriously,' he said in an interview with The Guardian. Maj Gen Shaw, who has spent the last year reviewing the MoD's approach to cyber-security, also said the MoD had to embrace unconventional ideas and develop an array of its own cyber-weapons if it wanted to catch up with and then stay ahead of its rivals. 'One needs to engage in internal defence and be quite aggressive about it. And if you are going to manoeuvre in cyberspace, that is something that obviously involves action across the spectrum.' Earlier this week, SOCA was forced to take its website offline after being targeted by cyber criminals. It was the victim of a scam known as . distributed denial of service (DDOS) whereby an internet address is . flooded with bogus traffic, effectively making it unreachable. Breached: Last month, the Home Office website went down after an apparent cyber attack by hacking group Anonymous (above) The Home Office website also went down last month after an apparent cyber attack in protest against Government surveillance plans. A message on Twitter claiming to be from Anonymous, a loosely organised group of hackers who promote access to free speech, information and transparency, said the action was 'for [the Home Office's] draconian surveillance proposals'. Over Christmas, the online 'hacktivist' group also claimed via Twitter on that it had stolen a trove of emails and credit card information from U.S. intelligence firm Stratfor's member subscribers. Details of senior British intelligence officials and U.S. defence staff were hacked, according to analysis by John Bumgarner, an expert in cyber-security at the US Cyber Consequences Unit, a research body in Washington. Some 221 British military officials and 242 NATO staff were also victims along with advisers to Britain's Joint Intelligence Organisation, a body which reports sensitive information to Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Bumgarner found. In March, it was revealed that Nato's most senior commander had been embroiled in a major security alert after a fake Facebook account was set up in his name by ‘Chinese spies’. Senior British military officers and Ministry of Defence staff are understood to have accepted ‘friend requests’ from a bogus account for Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis. In the mistaken belief they had linked up with the American admiral on the site, they then unwittingly provided a treasure trove of personal details – including pictures, phone numbers and email addresses. Nato did officially say who was behind the cyber-fraud or who accepted friend requests but it is understood that evidence points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers.","Cyber attacks are 'still on an upward curve', says chief .

Complex charges are allowing the big banks to make almost £9billion a year from current account holders, a report reveals. Five years after many banks were saved by receiving billions of pounds in public money, they continue to give customers a raw deal, the Office of Fair Trading says. Little or no interest is paid on balances in current accounts, people do not understand overdraft charges and there is no sign the banks compete to offer a better deal, the report says. Big profits: Banks make the equivalent of £139 per customer and year on current accounts, mostly through loans using customers' money . Competition has declined since the financial crisis that saw operations such as the Halifax, Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley swallowed up or shut. A review of the current account market found that 75 per cent of people never change their bank. This means that they are effectively a captive market for banks to sell expensive loans, credit cards, mortgages and insurance. As a result, the banks are making £8.8billion a year from current accounts – the equivalent of £139 per customer – the OFT says. Much of this is made by using the billions of pounds of customers’ money sitting in current accounts to loan out at high rates. Complex payments: When current account customers go in the red they are often subjected to fees which are difficult to understand . At the same time, banks hit people who go into the red with charges that are difficult to understand and compare. Comparing the cost of current accounts ‘continues to be challenging’ and people fear switching banks if they are mistreated, the OFT says. It identified a lack of competition, unclear costs and low levels of innovation. Chief executive Clive Maxwell said: ‘Personal current accounts are critical to the efficient functioning of the UK economy. Despite some improvements, this market is still not serving consumers as well as it should. ‘Customers still find it difficult to assess which account offers the best deal and lack confidence that they can switch accounts easily. ‘This prevents them from driving effective competition between providers. The retail banking sector needs to become more competitive and customer-focused.’ Laura Willoughby, chief executive of Move Your Money campaign, which encourages customers to switch banks, called the report ‘damning’. ‘Five years on from receiving the biggest taxpayer bailout in history, the big banks are still failing to deliver even the most basic of services to their customers,’ she said. The British Bankers’ Association said reductions in overdraft charges mean customers are saving almost £1billion a year. Chief executive Anthony Browne said: ‘The banking industry is committed to modernising and improving current accounts so that customers get the best possible service.’","Banks give a 'raw deal' for current accounts says Office of Fair Trading .

Doctors are being urged to use a new blood pressure measuring device that detects a dangerous heart condition which makes sufferers more likely to suffer a stroke . Doctors are being urged to use a new blood pressure measuring device that can also detect a dangerous heart condition. Atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate, can lead to dizziness, shortness of breath and palpitations. The condition also makes a person up to five times more likely to have a stroke. But some of the 800,000 people who suffer from the condition in the UK have no symptoms and are not aware that their heart rate is irregular. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) said if doctors suspect a patient has high blood pressure, they should use the WatchBP Home A device which could ‘opportunistically’ detect atrial fibrillation. Nice said that if medics in England used the device it would increase the discovery rate of the condition. It said use of the device would mostly benefit those over the age of 65, many of whom would already be having their blood pressure measured. Professor Carole Longson, director of the Nice Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ‘The evidence indicates that the device can offer advantages in detecting atrial fibrillation opportunistically while measuring blood pressure, and that using the device in primary care could increase the detection rate of atrial fibrillation compared with taking the pulse by hand. ‘This would allow preventative treatment to be considered to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation-related stroke. ‘The guidance is not about screening for atrial fibrillation, but about the benefits that the device offers in helping to pick up atrial fibrillation by chance in people with suspected high blood pressure or those being screened for high blood pressure, in primary care.’ If doctors suspect that a patient has high blood pressure through routine tests, they should use the WatchBP Home A device which could ¿opportunistically¿ detect atrial fibrillation, says NICE . Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘This new device won’t replace electro-cardiograms but any device that aids in earlier detection of atrial fibrillation should be welcomed. ‘Atrial fibrillation is a potentially dangerous condition that affects roughly one in 100 people in the UK and can increase four-fold the risk of a stroke. ‘With appropriate treatment that risk can be substantially reduced so early diagnosis is vital.’ Dr Clare Walton, of the Stroke Association, said: ‘Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for stroke, increasing your risk by up to five times and resulting in around 12,500 strokes every year. ‘Unfortunately not everyone who has atrial fibrillation will know they have it, yet we know that around 4,500 strokes each year could be prevented if atrial fibrillation patients received appropriate treatment.’ Dr Walton added: ‘A blood pressure testing machine that can detect an irregular pulse will help identify more people with atrial fibrillation and in turn enable them to receive medication to reduce their risk of stroke.’","Doctors should use a new device if they suspect a patient of having high blood pressure .

Situated in the exclusive neighbourhood of Bel Air, the 6,400 square foot property boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lavish living room, media room and huge master suite.

Spacious: The bungalow boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lavish living room, media room and a huge master suite . The spacious bungalow, priced at £11,171,390 - $17,900,000 - also has an large outdoor swimming pool set in huge grounds with panoramic views over the city. Designed by famed architect, Richard Neutra, in 1959, the property has been decorated in a simple sixties style. Sassoon passed away at the Bel Air home on May 9, 2012, at the age of 84 after battling leukemia. Icon: Vidal Sassoon, pictured at his Los Angeles home, died in May from leukemia . The sale comes less than a month after a host of celebrities from the world of fashion, film and hairdressing attended a memorial service at London's St Paul's Cathedral to celebrate his life. Sassoon was married four times and was made a CBE in 2009. His widow, Ronnie Holbrook, was joined by his famous friends and colleagues including actors Sir Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons and hairdressers Nicky Clarke and John Freida as they remembered his life. During his long-standing career, which he began as an apprentice during the Second World War Sassoon created a network of academies and lent his name to various hair products and salons turning his craft into a multi-million pound industry. Some of his most famous clients included Quant, model Jean Shrimpton and film stars Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner. Born to Jewish parents, Sassoon fought with the Israeli army in the War of Independence in 1948 and founded the Vidal Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in 1982. On his return to the UK after the Israeli war, he worked for famous London hairdresser Raymond 'Mr Teasy-Weasy' Bessone before opening his own Bond Street salon in 1958 where he began developing his creative, geometric cuts. Sassoon told the Los Angeles Times in 1967 of his method: 'Whether long or short, hair should be carved to a woman's bone structure. Actually short hair is a state of mind... not a state of age.' Back to basics: The property is simply styled - just like the famed hairdresser's iconic bob cut . Contemporary: The house was designed by famed architect, Richard Neutra, in 1959 . Retro: The homes is sparsely decorated with sixties furniture and decor . His styles were embraced by the women's liberation movement who wanted an effortless look without having to spend hours styling and short hair that also looked feminine. Sassoon's haircare mantra was: 'To sculpt a head of hair with scissors is an art form. It's in pursuit of art.' He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. The Boys Clubs of America and the Performing Arts Council of the Music Center of Los Angeles were among the causes he supported through his Vidal Sassoon Foundation. He later became active in post-Hurricane Katrina charities in New Orleans. Making an entrance: A sophisticated pathway leading into the sprawling home .

By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 04:43 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 15 October 2012 . A cruel comment from a school boy over her weight has prompted a teacher to lose almost nine stone. Claire Mills, 31, was mortified when she . overheard students poking fun at her size, with one pupil calling her an 'upside down king prawn' because he'd 'keep the head but throw away the body.' 'Hearing that comment broke my heart, but it gave me the motivation I needed to shift the flab,' said Claire,  from Llandrindod, Powys. Who's laughing now? Claire Mills lost nearly nine stone after hearing school children mocking her size . The mum-of-one was a size 26 and tipped the scales at almost 18 and a half stone at her heaviest. But after cutting out comfort food . and taking up jogging, she has shed almost nine . stone - and now weighs just over 10 stone. She said: 'I was always one of the bigger children in school, and as I got older, I became very conscious of my size. I was so much bigger than all my friends, but I never had the motivation to do anything to change the way I looked. 'I got upset about it, so I'd stay in at night, sitting on the sofa, eating comfort food.' Claire said her weight then crept up further after she married husband, Darren and had a daughter, Jessica. Mummy's shrunk: Claire's daughter Jessica shows how her mum no longer fits into her old size 26 jeans . Baggy trousers: The mother can now fit both her legs into the trouser leg that used to fit one after she slimmed down through healthy eating and exercise . 'When I met Darren, a farmer, and got . married, I was so happy, I couldn't believe that someone would want me . to be their wife - so I didn't worry about losing weight then either,' she explained. 'And when I fell pregnant in 2008, I took that as licence to eat whatever I liked. 'I was so unhappy with myself when . Jessica was born though, I refused to have my photo taken with her - I . really regret that I only have a handful of snaps of us together when . she was a baby.' The teacher also found her size was affecting her work. Part of her job as a Duke of Edinburgh Development Officer involved . accompanying groups of young people on Duke of Edinburgh expeditions. But . she couldn't keep up with her pupils on the outdoor treks and had to . completely rule out fun activities like canoeing. 'King prawn': A pupil said he would 'keep the head but throw away the body' when Claire looked like this, prompting her to lose weight . She said: 'I love my job, being outdoors with the . children, and I wouldn't change it for the world - but I was so big I . couldn't do it properly. 'My job also involves a lot of driving . round the country to different sites, so I'd always have plenty of . sweets and sandwiches in the car for when I got bored.' It . was on one of these trips that Claire heard some children mocking her . figure and that finally gave her the push she needed to lose weight. 'One day I overheard a group of . boys talking about me. They didn't know I was there, and they were . laughing about how fat I was,' she recalled. 'One of them said: ""Her face is alright, . but you wouldn't want the body. She's like an upside down prawn - keep . the head, chuck away the rest."" 'I pretended I hadn't heard, and carried . on as normal, but when I got home I broke down in floods of tears. I . realised I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my . health, my family and my pride.' A rare picture of Claire with Jessica when she was younger: The mother avoided cameras at the time because she was ashamed of her size . Claire signed up with the Cambridge Weight Loss plan which restricts dieters to eating only soups and shakes for a set period . of time. 'The first week of sticking to the plan . was really tough - but I soon realised that once I stopped thinking . about what I was going to have for tea every night, and obsessing about . food, it didn't matter that much,' she said. New wardrobe needed: The teacher once tipped the scales at almost 18-and-a-half stone but is now a size ten . 'Once it was time for me to reintroduce . healthy cooked meals back into my diet, food wasn't such a big issue for . me, and I'd lost so much weight, I wasn't going to spoil it by eating . takeaways every night.' As the pounds fell off, Claire then took up running and two years after being spurred into action, she is now . thrilled to be able to slip into a size 10 dress. Health kick: Claire said she hasn't been happier since losing weight as she can now be a more active wife and mother to husband Darren and daughter Jessica . She said she couldn't be happier with her new figure. 'It wasn't long before people at work started to notice the difference in me, and I was soon the talk of the village. 'My little girl looks at pictures of me . now from a few years ago and doesn't recognise me. It's wonderful to be . able to do so much with her now. She added: 'My husband, Darren, has been so supportive of me - he'd love me no matter what I look like, but he's pleased there is a bit more room for him in the bed now!'I feel so much better for being fitter and healthier - losing weight is the best thing I've ever done.'","Claire Mills heard a pupil compare her to a king prawn because he'd 'keep the head but throw away the body'

'Nothing is more important than my personal life,' Portman recently told France's Madame Figaro magazine. 'It's something which comes first, always makes sense, and compared to the happiness of a successful family life, everything else is practically superficial.' Portman went on to say: 'I now have the possibility of taking on French nationality. It would accomplish the Francophile dreams of my father and myself.

As well as the foundations, priced at £31, lip and nail shades in a nude palette are also available. Natalie wears one of the Rouge Dior Nude shades in the adverts.

A dancer has told of her joy at being able to hold hands with her boyfriend for the first time, thanks to an operation to cure an excessive sweating disorder. Lynsey Dare, 22, from Worcester, was too ashamed to hold her partner’s hand because her condition left her hands constantly dripping with sweat. Her disorder was so severe that it even ruined countless mobile phones and laptops, which became water damaged. Underarm patches: Lynsey Dare suffered from excessive sweating disorder before having an operation on the NHS to sever her sweat glands . Dancer: Miss Dare's disorder was so severe that it even ruined countless mobile phones and laptops, which became water damaged . A result of overactive sweat glands, it also affected her feet and armpits, meaning she also had to avoid high heels as they slipped off her wet feet, while she dreaded parties because she would be left drenched. At one stage the condition even threatened to destroy her career as a dancer because her body was too wet and sweaty to be lifted by her dance partner. But now an operation to sever the sweat glands has changed Miss Dare's life. She said: ‘Being able to hold my boyfriend’s hand is the best thing ever. He always offered to hold my hand and said he didn’t care if it was wet or not, but I was too embarrassed and ashamed. ‘Now I want to hold his hand all the time to make up for lost time.’ Miss Dare was just 12 when she first noticed her hands were sweating at school. She was unable to write in her exercise book without leaving the pages soaked and had to pile paper towels under her hand to mop up the sweat. Her mother took her to her GP, who assured her it was normal, but then Miss Dare noticed her feet and armpits were sweating excessively too. She said: 'I could hide my feet in socks and wear baggy jumpers but there was nothing I could do to hide my hands. It was awful.’ Quality of life: Miss Dare is now able to hold hands with her boyfriend Alex Ward for the first time . Neck scars: Miss Dare had an operation to sever her sweat glands . Over the following years she tried tablets and prescription strength deodorant, but nothing worked. And when she left school at 16 to study dance, the condition threatened to destroy her career. She said: ‘We trained barefoot but my feet were so wet I would slip over, it was embarrassing. Ballet was a nightmare because my body would be too slippery for my partner to hold me. ‘I was totally distraught that sweating was ruining my life and nobody seemed able to help. ‘I dreaded parties because I couldn’t wear heels without them slipping off and even a little bit of dancing left me dripping with sweat with horrible patches on my dress. ‘Even my mobile phones kept breaking due to water damage from the sweat.’ It was only after watching Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies that Miss Dare turned to the Internet and learned about a surgical procedure that could help. It involved cutting under her armpits and severing the sweat gland in a procedure known as ETS. It was carried out under the NHS in March this year. Miss Dare was delighted to notice the immediate difference it made to her hands. She said: 'They were bone dry, I couldn’t believe it. It was amazing. 'I couldn’t wait to hold hands with my partner in public. It might sound something small but I’d always been envious of couples that could.’ She also noticed an improvement to her feet and armpits. She added: ‘Sweating ruined my life for too many years, I want other sufferers to know help is available.'","Lynsey Dare, 22, from Worcester, suffered from excessive sweating disorder .

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 05:14 EST, 22 January 2012 . Three babies have died from an infection in the same neonatal unit at a hospital in Northern Ireland. Staff are clearing the room where the infants were treated at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Belfast, after finding all three deaths were caused by a bacteria called pseudomonas. Other vulnerable babies have been swabbed for signs of the infection,  and the room will undergo deep-cleaning over the weekend as staff try to find the source of the infection. An investigation has been launched after three babies died at the Royal Jubilee Maternity Service . Two heavily pregnant women  have had . to travel from Northern  Ireland to Dublin to have  their babies because . of the deadly outbreak. The expectant mothers were due to give . birth at the Royal Hospital in west Belfast, but were forced to endure . the 100-mile journey after pseudomonas struck the neonatal unit. The parents of the 23 babies left in . the unit, which is used to treat extremely premature and small infants, . are now anxiously awaiting test results. The mother of one baby girl said: . ‘She’s just seven weeks old and was born at just 24 weeks, weighing just . one pound seven ounces. ‘She has come so far, past illness and the fact that she could get sick again – we really don’t want to think about it. ‘It takes about 48 hours for results . to come back so hopefully we’ll find out today.’ The bacteria can cause . infections in the chest, blood and urinary tract. Consultant Clifford Mayes said: ‘Where . it is possible, we will transfer a mother and  baby out before delivery . to other hospitals. ‘The large area with 13  babies is being deep-cleaned. There are only three babies remaining in that room.’ Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots has urged parents not to panic . The first baby died on January 6 and the second on January 13. The third infant died late on Thursday night. Doctors first became aware that there . was a problem with the infection on Monday night, after test results . came back for the second baby. Mr Mayes said: ‘Every baby has been . screened with skin swabs, looking for any evidence of pseudomonas. ‘It is a germ which can be on your skin and not cause any harm but with a sick patient it can cause very serious problems. ‘The babies now are being moved depending on results as they come back.’ Pseudomonas is not itself infectious . but because it exists in water or moisture patients can carry it on . their skin. It can be treated with the right antibiotic, but the third . baby died despite the treatment. The bacteria infects the lungs of those with weak immune systems and  causes breathing problems. Belfast Health and Social Care Trust . chief executive Colm Donaghy said: ‘The trust will be carrying out a . full investigation and an analysis over the circumstances over this . period to see exactly what did happen and if there’s anything else that . we could have done. ‘Our first priority at this point in time is the safety of the babies.’ A large intensive care room which can take up to 13 babies is in the process of being cleared. The infants are being separated into small rooms and the deep-clean will be carried out over the weekend. Dr Mayes said it would be some time . before other information about the outbreak was collated, as blood . samples take 48 hours to be analysed. Edwin Poots, the Northern Ireland health minister, said the authorities were taking the matter very seriously. ‘It is important that we remain calm. Infection control teams are now in the process of trying to identify the . source of the infection and minimise the risk of spread to other babies . in the unit.’ Some babies may be moved to other health trusts or even outside Northern Ireland if the pressure becomes too great. It will take at least a week to find out if the deaths were related to different strains of the infection. Between 3,700 and 4,000 cases are . reported to the Health Protection Agency every year. There are usually . fewer than 80 cases of it annually across Northern Ireland. a . Pseudomonas aeruginosa magnified hundreds of times: The bacteria is dangerous to those with vulnerable immune systems . Pseudomonas is bacteria which multiplies in the lungs of people whose immune systems are weakened by illness or medication, or have lung conditions like Cystic Fibrosis (CF). It is found in many natural places including plants, soil, surface orstagnant water and warm moist environments. It can also be found on food, taps, in sink reservoirs, bath toys, pools, jacuzzis, hot tubs and flower water. Pseudomonas can be spread from one person another person via unwashed hands. It can live on hands and surfaces for up to two and a half hours. Symptoms of a Pseudomonas chest infection can include increasedcoughing and tiredness. It is usually detected by cough swab or sputum specimen. The treatment for Pseudomonas is an antibiotic given through a nebuliser for three months twice a day after physiotherapy, along with a three week course of antibiotics. Sometimes it can be difficult to treat the Pseudomonas, due to a slimy barrier the bacteria forms around itself. It can also become resistant to some antibiotics. Sometimes intravenous antibiotics may need to be given if the condition persists to try and prevent the bacteria damaging the lung tissue and becoming permanent.

"By . Linda Kelsey . PUBLISHED: . 09:14 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:14 EST, 12 December 2012 . Every year, on the night of 30 November, I perform my special Christmas countdown ritual. First I go up to the loft to collect a blue cardboard storage container. Next I place the large, shallow box on my bed and carefully lift the lid, tantalised by the memory of the treasures within. Not, as you might think, the decorations for the tree or the lights to festoon the doorways of my house. No, nestled inside, lovingly wrapped in tissue paper, are my collection of Christmas jumpers. 'Far from stressing me out, Christmas . puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout December' For a full month from 1st December until the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve I become the woman that style forgot, never missing an opportunity to sashay forth in a jazzy jumper, festooned with Christmas cheer. Long before Colin Firth wore his embarrassing Christmas reindeer jumper in the film Bridget Jones's Diary, and aeons before jumper fiend Sarah Lund had started parading her vaguely Christmassy, Faroese star sweater in The Killing (available from Gudrun and Gudrun online, 100% organic wool, E280, if you're interested in dressing up as a detective yourself when the Cluedo comes out on Boxing Day), I was making my annual pilgrimage to Oxford Street in search of a Christmas sweater. 'What I've noticed is that my Christmas . jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well' And this year looks to be a vintage year for the jazzy jumper - they've made it back into fashion in a big way. Now even upmarket online retailer net-a-porter has sanctioned the Christmas sweater with a range of exclusive jumpers designed by the likes of Stella McCartney, Moschino and hot new design duo Meadham Kirchoff whose contribution, featuring metallic-embroidered Christmas tree decorations, costs £945. Meanwhile, the Christmas Jumper Company, launched three years ago by Manchester-based couple Erica and Dave Ratcliffe, after amateur musician Dave failed to find the suitably 'daft' Christmas jumpers he and his band-mates wanted to wear for a Christmas gig, is riding the crest of a Yuletide woollies wave after featuring in a Sony ad and on the X Factor. At a somewhat more affordable £40, and available for men and women, they can barely keep up with the demand, especially for their shiny-nosed Rudolf model. Only last week I was tempted by a Markus Lupfer number, featuring a rosy-cheeked Santa, not quite a snip at £225. But what I eventually opted for was a more reasonably prices black Top Shop knitted number, £50, featuring the cutest robin in a woolly hat with a ruby glass bobble and sporting a red breast shot through with lurex thread. Net-A-Porter are selling Meadham Kirchhoff's Maria metallic-embroidered jumper for £945, left, and Stella McCartney's reindeer intarsia wool-blend sweater for £695 . Then, while scanning the rails at River Island, I spotted a sweater that managed to feature snowmen, snowflakes, pudding and Christmas trees all at once, and what looked like some tiger stripes added in for good measure. 'Christmas jumpers put everyone in a good mood' A miracle of excess, and only £35. So I . bought that, too, on the basis that that just as there is no such thing . as a turkey with too many trimmings, the same applies to dressing to . spread tidings of comfort and joy. I can't help myself. All year long I am a paradigm of pared-down style. My clothes are classic, tasteful - and probably a trifle dull. But come Christmas I become as ho-ho-ho as Santa and as tinselly as the Christmas tree. Far from stressing me out, Christmas puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout December, and I dress to match my mood, regardless of the sniggers I engender. For me a cosy Christmas jumper or sparkly top or something unsuitably sequinned, which looks more barmaid than elegant lady of a certain age, represents the fantasy Christmas I long for. On the one hand yule logs and real fires burning in the hearth, real candles on real trees, the scent of cinnamon and mulled wine; on the other, glamorous parties, champagne and all-night dancing. The reality may be cooking 24/7, grumpy relatives, uncooperative kids and a desultory dance around someone's kitchen table on New Year's Eve, but for the weeks leading up to Christmas I am more relaxed – and hopeful - than at any other time of year. What I've noticed is that my Christmas jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well. Complete strangers come up to me in cafes to remark on my jumper and we invariably end up getting to know one another. At the British Library, where I go to study, there is a permanent hush – but everyone looks up from their books and smiles as I pass. And now silly Christmas sweaters have been co-opted for a good cause with a host of celebrities joining in the fun. Myleene Klass, Lauren Laverne, Jon Snow and Alison Steadman are just some of names who have been posing in Christmas woollies, in aid of Save The Children, which has designated Friday 14th December as Christmas Jumper Day, inviting the nation to pull on a kitsch festive jumper and donate £1 to the charity.

A woman who tipped the scales at 23 stone shed half her body weight in just eight months allowing her to fit into a size 10 wedding dress. At the start of the year Shannon Barclay, from Aberdeen, knew that her lifestyle was far from healthy. 'I got tired easily. My legs would . burn half way up the stairs. I’d get breathless and if I was late and . had to run for the bus I’d feel like my lungs were going to explode,' she said. But it wasn't until she found she couldn't fit into an airplane seat in February that she decided enough was enough. The 32-year-old said: 'It was the worst moment of my . life. I got on a plane to Birmingham for work and I had to ask for a . seatbelt extension. I was mortified. It was so embarrassing. 'I have struggled with my weight my whole life but there and then, I just thought, that’s it.' She . signed up to a weight loss programme that provided low calorie foods . and drinks as well as group counselling sessions to address the reasons . behind excessive eating. She said: 'People perceived me as happy . and that nothing bothered me because I suppressed my feelings by eating. Being big my whole life, I was constantly being put down, even if . people didn’t mean to. Sometimes I’d feel embarrassed going to a . restaurant and ordering. 'The counselling really helps you to deal with everything. I didn’t have any . significant health problems. But I knew if I was to continue the way I . was, I’d have one foot in the grave.' Mrs Barclay has battled with her . weight since she was in her early teens, tipping the scales at close to . 15 stone when she was just 14.  She believes her overeating started shortly after her grandfather was knocked down and killed by a car when she was 13. Before she started the LighterLife programme Mrs . Barclay, an assistant manager of a lingerie shop, would skip breakfast . and be so hungry by lunch time that she would gorge herself on fast . food. She would snack on chocolates and sweets . throughout the day and not eat another meal until she got home at 8pm . when she would tuck into a huge plate of lasagne or pasta. Now she follows a health eating routine and goes to the gym three times a week. She also enjoys swimming and cycling. Shannon when she was 23 stone (left) and on her wedding day (right). She said her husband Alan could now wrap his arms around her . She said: 'I am a very strong minded . person and when I put my mind to something, I’m going to accomplish it. I . don’t do things by halves. 'I was constantly losing three to six pounds a week. But I lost 14lbs in the first week.' Bounce in her step: Shannon is now training for a half marathon . As the weight dropped off, Mrs . Barclay - who was engaged at the time - had to have her wedding dress . taken in several times. By the time she was married two weeks ago, she . walked down the aisle in a svelte size 10 having dropped nine dress . sizes. She said: 'Some people who I hadn’t seen in a . while were shocked. They came up to me afterwards and said if they saw . me in the shop they wouldn’t have known it was me. I’m glad I did it. It made the whole experience better.' The newly wed added: 'I’m still getting used to my new look. I will walk past a mirror at work and have to take a minute. My arms look really small. 'But I love it and my husband is happy . as long as I’m happy. He loves me if I’m 23 [stone] and he loves me if . I’m 12 (stone). He can now wrap his arms around me. Before he could only . get them half way.' Mrs Barclay, who is originally from . Canada, said losing the weight meant she had a fantastic time on her honeymoon with new husband Alan in Tenerife. She said: 'I was . able to go paragliding. We also went walking along the beach and sunbathing, . which I wouldn’t have done before because I would be conscious about how . the swim suit fitted.

Susan Rostron had been told the 11lbs cancerous growth on her pancreas was inoperable and would eventually kill her . When Susan Rostron was told she had an inoperable tumour on her pancreas, she decided some good should come of her early death. Resigned to her fate, the 58-year-old emailed Cancer Research UK to see if they wanted the football-sized tumour after she had died. It was an email that quite literally saved her life. In an amazing twist of fate, her message was message was forwarded to Neil Pearce, one of the country’s leading consultant surgeons specialising in pancreatic treatment. He asked to meet Miss Rostron and then told her he could perform ‘extreme surgery’ which would remove her pancreas, spleen, stomach and part of the oesophagus. She decided to go ahead with the 12 hour procedure which was a success. She has since undergone a gruelling recovery process and has been given the all clear. Miss Rostron, from Dorchester, Dorset, had the tumour growing inside her for 20 years without realising. It was when she went to hospital with stomach pains in April 2011 that she was diagnosed with the cancer. Miss Rostron, a former school headteacher who now runs a pottery studio, said: 'I went to my GP with a persistent stomach ache and was sent for a gastroscopy.' This is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the oesophagus (the pipe that goes from the mouth to the stomach), the stomach and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). 'The results were inconclusive so I had further tests which revealed I had a huge tumour that had been growing for about 20 years, it was bigger than a grapefruit. 'I was told it was incurable and inoperable and even chemotherapy might not work. Resigned to her fate, Miss Rostron emailed Cancer Research UK to see if they wanted the football-sized tumour after she had died . 'I decided that if I was going to die, I wanted to make sure some good could come from my death and that my tumour could help with research into pancreatic cancer. 'I just thought ""it isn’t doing me any good, so hopefully it can do some other people some good in the future"". 'I found that at Southampton Hospital they had a tissue bank so I emailed to ask how I could offer my tumour for research.' Luckily, Miss Rostron's email was forwarded to Neil Pearce (pictured), one of the country¿s leading pancreatic surgeons, who removed the tumor . Shortly afterwards she was contacted by her local hospital who told her was a surgeon at Southampton who thought he could operate. 'I was told there was a 20 per cent chance I could die on the operating table, but when you've basically been told you are going to die anyway you might as well go for it. 'I had my pancreas, stomach, spleen, and part of my oesophagus removed - the remaining part was attached to my intestine. 'It’s amazing this was all because of an email. Every time I see the consultant he says it’s just as well I sent it. 'I have my ups and downs but I feel a million times better and life is definitely worth living' Because she now doesn’t have a . stomach, Miss Rostron has to eat small, regular meals and take special . medication to help her digest food. 'Whatever I eat now goes straight into the beginning of my intestine, so I eat small meals about six times a day,' she said. 'I can eat normal food and I don’t have a special diet, but I do feel as though I am perpetually eating, I take pancreatic enzymes to help digestion and I also take antibiotics.' Her tumour is likely to recur again but at the moment she has been given the all-clear. Clara MacKay, charity director of Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: 'Susan’s circumstances are unusual in that it was as a result of a chance email. 'That led to her case being reviewed by a surgeon at a leading, specialist pancreatic cancer centre. 'However, it does echo our concern that not all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are being referred to specialist teams in order to give them the best chance possible for treatment. 'Patients, like Susan, should not have to rely on their own initiative to get referred to expert teams.'","Susan Rostron, 58, had been told the 11lb cancerous growth on her pancreas was inoperable and would eventually kill her .

It's the face that has taken the internet by storm - and now it seems that McKayla Maroney's unimpressed pout has spread to television screens. The 16-year-old Olympic gymnast became the focus of online comedians when she failed to hide her anger over an embarrassing tumble during the London Games. But the pretty brunette has proved her sense of humour, again, by making the same face during an appearance on The Colbert Report two days ago. Posing as interns, she and her 'Fierce Five' teammates performed a series of impressive gymnastics tricks before coming together to smile and wave to the audience as a group. But while the other girls were noticeably beaming, Miss Maroney barely managed a smile, lifting her arm up only slightly to offer a half-hearted wave. Scroll down for video . That pout: McKayla Maroney has appeared with her Fierce Five teammates on The Colbert Report, her sourpuss face on full display. The team posed as Stephen Colbert's interns during the episode . Not happy: Her face was made famous when she accepted a silver medal during the Games, above . Clearly playing up to her fans who can't seem to get enough of the disgruntled look, and have, as a result, Photoshopped photos of hers in several hilarious scenarios online, she stayed in character during the groups' entire appearance. It follows the equally-funny picture she posted of herself on Twitter last week that captured her and fellow U.S. gymnasts Kyla Ross and Aly Raisman pulling the notorious face. During the Colbert episode, which aired on Wednesday night, the U.S. gymnastics team which also consists of Miss Ross, Miss Raisman, Jordyn Wieber and Gabby . Douglas, each posed as the host's eager assistants. In a highly-amusing comedy sketch, the . five teens are seen back-flipping, cartwheeling and hand-standing their . way over to the show's host from behind the curtains in order to drop . off a pen to his desk. Demanding: Team USA's 'Fierce Five' Olympic gymnastics team have appeared on The Colbert Report where host Stephen Colbert (above) asked the teenagers to deliver a pen to him. They do so in spectacular style . Work it: A Colbert crew member (left) offered the pen to the 'interns'. Gabby Douglas (right) snapped it up first . Mr Colbert starts out by telling his audience that he has 'a new batch of interns and they might be the best ones to date'. 'Five bright young women who just returned from some kind of study abroad program in London,' he continues. 'Anyway, they're very helpful and, you know what, speaking of which, I don't have my pen... could somebody bring me my pen please?' Jay 'the intern', who looks to be just one of the show's crew members, then holds a pen out in the air before saying: Can you get this to Stephen?' Miss Douglas, 16, pops out on the stage, snapping the pen up from Jay's hands before striking a pose for the camera which sends the unsuspecting audience wild with delight as they begin to realise who the host's new interns are. Skills: Miss Douglas launches into an impressive cartwheel after she lodges the pen between her teeth . Passing it on: Like a relay baton, Miss Douglas passes the pen onto McKayla Maroney before she somersaults . Impressive: Miss Mahoney (left) is seen performing a fantastic somersault before landing in a perfect dismount . Success: Miss Maroney then passes the pen onto Aly Raisman (right) who uses it to spin and high-kick . The Flying Squirrel then lodges the pen between her teeth as she takes to the floor to perform a cartwheel before passing the pen over to McKayla Maroney, 16, who has just popped out from behind another curtain. As the crowd continues to cheer and clap, Miss Maroney lodges the pen between her own teeth and proceeds to perform a somersault on a long mat that has been spread across the ground. The teen dismounts perfectly, taking the pen out from her teeth before placing a hand on her hip to strike her own pose towards the audience. Aly Raisman, 18, then takes centre stage, who performs two spins with the same pen, given to her by Miss Maroney, in her hand and then a high kick. As she performs, Mr Colbert is shown, glued to the girls' every move as though he were watching them compete at the Olympics once again. Continues: Miss Raisman (right) then passes the all-important pen onto 15-year-old Kyla Ross (right) Back-flip: Miss Ross performs a double back-flip on another mat that has been laid onto the studio floor . Finally: The pen is then passed to Miss Wieber (left) who proceeds to stand on her hands and walk to the host . Kyla Ross, 15, then takes the pen from Miss Maroney before placing the pen between her own teeth and launching into an impressive double back-flip performance on another mat that has been laid out. Finally, Jordyn Wieber, 17, takes the pen herself and slips it between her toes, stepping into a walking handstand that ends with the show's host snatching it from her foot as it comes towards him. The comedian then launches into his own comical dismount, which attracts a standing ovation from the excited crowd. The end: The TV host reaches out for the pen, which is lodged between Miss Wieber's foot (pictured) Mission completed: Mr Colbert launches into his own ridiculous dismount as he takes hold of the pen . Fierce Five: The entire squad then comes together to wave to the audience who offer a rousing applause . The five girls then take to the centre . of the stage in order to wave to the crowd as a team united, much like . the scene at their gold medal presentation ceremony in London. A close-up of Miss Maroney shows a sour expression as she stays in character with the low-level intern she is portraying. To top the entertainment off, the camera then rolls over to the girls' mothers including Miss Douglas' mom Natalie Hawkins, who pretend to be asleep in the audience. Sticking together: The group were photographed atop the Empire State Building (above) two days ago . 'That was beautiful,' the host concludes before noting that he actually wanted a black pen, not the blue one that was delivered to him. The team are currently in the thick of a jam-packed publicity schedule that has seen some of its members appear on other talk shows and breakfast programs.

Five years on Terri Roberts recalls crawling into a foetal position when she heard her son had committed ‘the worst crime imaginable’. Five years on: Charles Roberts, 32, burst into an Amish school in Pennsylvania in October 2006 in an horrific mass murder that shocked the world . Her son allegedly admitted to his wife just minutes before the killings that he had sexually assaulted two young female relatives when he was 12. Roberts was a father-of-three when he shot ten schoolgirls in the rural county, killing five and seriously wounding the other five. In an extraordinary show of reconciliation, his mother regularly visits an 11-year-old schoolgirl who was paralysed by her son's attacks. ‘As we reach out in ways that bring a touch, we can find great healing,’ Mrs Roberts told Religion News Service. Grievers: A funeral procession for one of the victims of the school shooting makes its way through the town of Nickel Mines in Pennsylvania in October 2006 . When Mrs . Robertsheard about the massacre she crawled into a foetal position and her husband Chuck cried into a . tea towel, she recalled. 'As we reach out in ways that bring a touch, we can find great healing' Terri Roberts . ‘Not . only was my son not alive, he was the perpetrator of the worst crime . anyone could ever imagine,’ she told Religion News Service. 'We had a son who did not have peace in his life.' She said the counsellor helped her avoid a life of ‘total darkness and sorrow’ by only thinking of the shooting as a tiny part of her son’s life. Now demolished: The Georgetown school, which was the scene of the execution-style shootings of Amish schoolgirls in Lancaster, Pennsylvania . Three months after the massacre she started to visit victims and invited surviving girls and their mothers to picnics at her home. 'Not . only was my son not alive, he was the perpetrator of the worst crime . anyone could ever imagine' Terri Roberts . But she still recalls a suicide note left by her son that said he hated God after his first child died soon after birth, reported Religion News Service. Roberts was haunted by the death of his first-born daughter Elise Victoria, who lived for only 20 minutes after a premature birth in 1997. He had chained the girls together in a line at the blackboard and barricaded the doors after sending the boys and adults away. Sad: Young Amish mourners ride as they grieve the death of Anna Mae Stoltzfus . Shock: Amish sisters ride in their family buggy in a funeral procession for a young Amish girl who was a victim in the school shooting in October 2006 . ‘Have you seen anything like this?’ he allegedly asked the terrified pupils, showing them his 9mm Springfield Arms semi-automatic pistol. But he also went with a shotgun, . bolt-action sports rifle, a stun gun, gunpowder, knives, binoculars, . wrenches, a hose, candles and torches. ‘Have you seen anything like this?’ What Charles Roberts asked pupils, showing his pistol . The dead girls were Naomi Rose Ebersole, 7; Anna Mae Stoltzfus, 12; Marian Fisher, 13; and sisters Mary Liz Miller, 8; and Lina Miller, 7. Their parents had no photographs to remember them by, because the Amish shun modern gadgetry such as cameras.

The model, who accused married actor Brain Presley of pathetically trying to chat her up on a plane in a lengthy, and humiliating, live Twitter feed, seems to have a history of stretching the truth. As the 34-year-old actor denies the encounter ever took place, model Melissa Stetten, 28, appears to have a prolific history of lying. On her blog Pretty Bored, she admits to telling large fibs at least twice in the past three months, and reveals she took the drug Zoloft earlier this year as an anti-depressant. Not guilty! Actor Brian Presley (right) has denied the claims made by model Melissa Stetten (left), that he tried to chat her up (right) on board a red eye flight that flew out of Los Angeles to New York two days ago . 'Inspired his craft': Mr Presley pictured in the 2011 film Touchback with Kurt Russell . On March 30, the model posted a Photoshopped picture of two Mega Millions 'winning' tickets to her Twitter page. Its caption read: 'I think I just won a billion dollars'. Some suggested it was an April Fools' prank. On March 7, she also admitted on her blog that she often lies about her age. The post reads: '[Casting directors] ask my age, I say 23, as usual, because if I went any younger I fear that they might question the miniscule eye wrinkle'. The blog also features posts that discuss her miscarriage, her rocky relationship with Anthony Cumia, a 51-year-old radio host, and her fondness for Matthew McConaughey, despite a later post that reads: 'If you find Matthew McConaughey attracttive I probably hate you because I hate him'. Andy Levy, who hosts the Halftime Report segment on Fox's late night show Red-Eye, also questioned her claims. Red-Eye's regular news discussion panel debated the model's alleged conversation with Mr Levy last night, questioning her claims against the actor. Bernie McGuirk said: 'She was up to something...this is what she alleges. It smells rotten, the whole thing.' Miss Stetten live-tweeted a conversation two days . ago with actor Brian Presley, from Oklahoma, who allegedly told her . that he believed they were 'brought together' by God on the domestic . flight. The model alleged Mr Presley drank 'three Heinekens' on the Los Angeles flight to New York, even . though he has previously spoken of his attendance at 'weekly AA . meetings with a group of awesome, godly men from my church.' However today, after the story of their alleged encounter went worldwide, he responded to the allegations on his Facebook page - calling them 'absurd, funny' and stating that 'none of this happened.' Snapped: The model captures the encounter on her phone (above) before posting the photograph on Twitter . In a long post, Mr Presley responded: . 'I love that I took a red eye flight to NY, had a 10 minute friendly . conversation with the person sitting next to me, had some food, and went . to sleep! 'I learned today this person has been . tweeting about me drinking beer in the airplane bathroom, and trying to . commit adultery with her on the airplane. Really absurd and quite . funny! ... They Even took pictures of me while I was sleeping. A little WIERD [sic]! I was on a soap opera for years and never did the writers write something this good:) 'None of what this person said happened is true! I guess in today's age you have to be careful who you say hello too.' And in reference to claims that he was drinking, Mr Presley concluded: 'Sobriety, God, & My Family are the most important things in my life! My Wife Rocks, My Kids Rock, and Sobriety Rocks!!! I will pay this no more attention and I encourage all of you to do the same. God Bless all of you and thank you all for all your support!' The amused model tweeted Mr Presley's Facebook post and wrote: 'Now THIS is funny...' Sobriety Rocks: The actor's response, posted this morning... by Melissa Stetten . The model had detailed the alleged encounter with Mr Presley in a series of amusing Twitter posts. She had claimed that she did not recognise him at first. And it was only when one of her 13,000 followers alerted her to his identity that the messages became more interesting. The actor, a former star of Port Charles which was a . spin-off TV series of General Hospital, has previously spoken publicly about his journey to sobriety and religion. Miss Stetten tweeted: 'Brian just said ""like us sitting here right now, talking about . where we're from, it's like divine interception"". right, interception.' 'No . thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking . about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs.' During the pair's alleged conversation, he claimed that he is not married to his wife of ten years Erin Hershey Presley. He, in fact, met Mrs Presley on the . show's set - the pair were co-stars and now have two children. The model posted at a later stage of the . commentary: 'He said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT . @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson . are.' Knowledge: Miss Stetten learns via the social networking site that the actor recently claimed he's sober . Nice one Brian: The model reveals how the actor responded to her questioning . Charmer: She tweeted that her took off his wedding ring - the tweet was later deleted . A now-deleted tweet also read: 'Holy s**t Brian came back from the bathroom WITHOUT his wedding ring on! Watch out Virgin America, you've got a real charmer on board.' The model, born in Kalamazoo, . Michigan, posted her detailed description as he chatted to her from the . seat beside her on the flight. She . expressed an unwillingness to engage in the conversation right from her . first tweet, but it seems that the actor, who has . appeared in guest roles in Beverly Hills 90210 and 7th Heaven in the . past, couldn't take the hint. Through her tweets, her Twitter . followers learned that 'Brian... is an artist and believes everything . happens for a reason like how we're brought together on this flight'. He is also 'a straightforward guy who booked a McDonalds commercial when he was 19 and then God took over from there'. The actor, who starred in a movie called Touchback, told the model further lies about his marital status. Soon enough, Miss Stetten's followers, which now total almost 18,700, began posting actual facts about the actor. The model then acknowledged the possible repercussions of her running commentary. She posted: 'Did I just ruin Brian Presley's life via Twitter?' Family man: The actor met his wife of ten years on the set of a soap called Port Charles, they have two children .

"White powder turns to gel in stomach . Volunteers consumed 17% fewer calories after in second meal . Methyl cellulose already used as an additive in ready meals . By . Toni Jones . PUBLISHED: . 06:19 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:53 EST, 22 August 2012 . Matt Lucas as Marjorie Dawes, the Fat Fighters group leader who loves to tell clients they should eat dust to lose weight . A new 'anti-hunger' powder claims to help dieters by making them feel fuller after eating just small amounts of food. Added to smoothies, soups or fruit shakes the dust-like powder turns to a gel once it reaches the stomach meaning that the user will consume less calories in the meals afterwards, and lose weight as a result. A form of this magic diet powder, methyl cellulose, has been used as a popular food additive for over fifty years, binding together baked goods, snacks and ready meals. Normally it would pass through the system, but this modified version has been designed as a satiety ingredient to form a gel at body temperature that lingers safely in the stomach before passing in to the small intestine. Volunteers at trials consumed an average of 13 per cent fewer calories when given a second meal two hours after taking the powder, which dissolves in cold water. Carsten Huettermann Ph.D. the scientist who presented the report in Philadelphia said: 'This ingredient would make people feel full after eating smaller amounts of food,' 'With that sense of fullness and hunger-satisfaction, they would not crave more food. 'In our first study, we saw that fewer calories were consumed at the following meal after eating our new product. 'Our next step now is to investigate in further studies the mechanism of action and whether this may have an impact on weight management.' A report by an FSA advisory committee said it ‘did not have any safety concerns relating to this ingredient’ but suggests it should not be given to children. They have asked food experts for their opinion before a decision is taken on approving it for use. Emma Williams of the Nutrition Society said: ‘Although these findings are interesting, because this is a proof of concept study much more research is needed to understand the processes and mechanisms of action, as well as the implications for long term weight reduction.’ In its original form methyl cellulose is used as an additive in processed foods. The additive is used to bind food together and passes straight through the system without acting as any kind of satiety ingredient. Chemists have modified the ingredient to use as a potential weight management tool, and the updated methyl cellulose powder has been named SATISFIT-LTG. SATISFIT-LTG is a white powder dissolved in water and then added to edible liquids like smoothies, soups and shakes which turns in to a thick gel-like paste once it reaches room temperature in the stomach. This makes the user feel more full as it hangs around for a few hours before passing safely through to the small intestine and out of the body. In recent clinical trials the volunteers ate an average of 17 per cent fewer calories in their second meal after eating SATISFIT-LTG in their first meal. The scientists are developing SATISFIT-LTG as a potential ingredient in cold foods and Dr Huettermann has reported that work will continue based on the promising clinical trial results.

"By . Martha De Lacey . PUBLISHED: . 04:25 EST, 13 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:04 EST, 15 August 2012 . It is only because of a sturdy laptop that Lucy Lynn Evans is here to tell her tale. Only five years ago, having just completed her first year at Sussex University, the media studies undergraduate went under the wheels of a lorry whose driver didn't spot her or her moped on a roundabout. Lucy, who lives in west London, remembers very little after turning around to see the lorry, hearing a loud crack, then feeling the sensation of 'being squeezed very, very hard around the middle - like two huge people hugging me'. Lucy Lynn Evans, founder of Bike2Basics cycling tour company, heads off on her bicycle . Upon waking in hospital, Lucy realised that the crack had been the laptop in her backpack being crushed - and that the bear-hug was the lorry's wheel rolling over her body. 'I was pretty lucky, really,' she tells FEMAIL. 'If my laptop hadn't been there that crack would have been my spine.' Told she might never walk again, Lucy spent three months in hospital, underwent 15 operations on her pelvis and legs, and endured a year of intense rehab. She eventually fought her way back onto her feet, but while walking was still immensely painful, the Human Science Bsc student discovered that cycling was not. 'I could just cycle forever,' she says. 'And all of a sudden I was pleased to be in my body rather than frustrated.' Lucy Lynn Evans set up Bike2Basics after being hit by a lorry while on a moped and told she would never walk again . Returning to Sussex University to complete her degree, Lucy quickly became a cycling fanatic, even encouraging her two brothers Harry and Sam (plus their dad) back into the saddle. 'Suddenly the three of us were always on our bikes, spending our summers cycling around the country and even Europe for as long as our money would allow. 'We're all big on music so began cycling to music festivals, and when we got there everyone we met and told was really keen to join in - and suddenly we saw a business opportunity.' And so Bike2Basics was born. Using DIY free website builder Wix, Lucy had a fully-functioning website just two days later and £100 lighter. Charging around £25 per cyclist per trip, Lucy and her brothers lead . groups of people to music festivals such as Secret Garden Party all over the country - all on two wheels. Lucy and her brothers Sam and Harry set up their Bike2Basics website with the help of free website builders Wix . 'The trips are such fun and a terrific bonding experience. They've become a great way of meeting like-minded people and making friends. 'If it's a small trip, say to Brighton for a weekend, we tell people to pack light panniers. Otherwise - like on the weekend when we took 30 people to Wilderness festival in the Cotswolds -  we have a support van carrying all our backpacks. 'And we always cycle alongside a train line, just in case anything goes wrong and we need to get on. Not that anything ever has gone wrong! 'On the way home after the festival we tend to put the bikes in the van and get the train home because we're all exhausted. 'Some keen people start out saying they want to cycle home too, but they always end up changing their minds after the festival!' An excited Bike2Basics tour group set off on their journey towards a music festival . Being a seasonal operation, Lucy currently tutors during the winter months, but hopes to turn Bike2Basics into a full-time operation by next year - and possibly expand to festivals in southern hemisphere countries with opposing seasons, to enable trips all year round. 'We'll make just under a £10,000 turnover this year, almost £7,000 profit, but that also includes a bit of merchandising - having jumpers made up and selling them to people on the tour. 'I've been really frugal though and not spent any money on advertising, but what's also been good about my website builder Wix is that as well as being really easy to use they also give you £100 of free advertising on Facebook and Google which teaches you about online marketing.' Three members of a Bike2Basics tour group finally reach their festival destination . Lucy is now hoping that the successes of Team GB's cyclists at the London 2012 Olympics will encourage more Brits onto bicycles. 'It's really important that we address cycle safety, too. I mean, having soft, fleshy cyclists on roads alongside massive heavy lorries is never going to be a good idea. 'We need to split up cyclists and cars, like they do in Holland and Denmark, so it would be great if the Olympics put some pressure on changing the infrastructure of the road system. 'Luckily, even after the accident, I don't ever feel scared on my bike in London. 'The only time i . get a little antsy is when I'm on my bike on a busy road and a truck . overtakes. When its wheels are eye level and it wobbles and makes loud noises by stomach turns a bit. 'I still think about the accident every now and then - I had my last operation only in September so it's still very much a part of my life - but weirdly I think the driver of the lorry was more cut up about it than I was!

"By . Mary Mcconnell . UPDATED: . 06:11 EST, 28 December 2011 . Barack Obama has topped a list of Americans' most admired men, even though his presidential approval ratings stand at just 47 per cent. When asked which man they most admired, 17 per of Americans named the US president, while Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, topped the female list, also with 17 per cent. US TV star Oprah Winfrey was the second . most admired woman, and Mr Obama's wife, Michelle, was third. Former . British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was seventh and The Queen ninth . on the list. Public support: Barack Obama was the most admired man among Americans despite low presidential approval ratings . The poll was carried out by public . opinion website Gallup, who asked Americans, without prompting, to name . their most admired man and woman living today. Behind Mr Obama in the men's poll were former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, who gained three and two per cent of the vote, respectively. The evangelical Christian Reverend Billy Graham was fourth. Americans' support for Mr Obama hit an all-time low in October when he was given a 38 per cent approval rating. It has since risen to 47 per cent but it remains a far cry from the 69 per cent approval rating he gained when he first came to office three years ago. Seal of approval: US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been named the most admired woman for the tenth year in a row . Mrs Clinton has topped Gallup's poll, which has been running since 1946, for the tenth year in a row, while Mr Obama has been the most admired man for the past four years. 1. Barack Obama . 2.

The Queen has never finished first in the poll but she has been in the top ten more than any other woman, making a record 44th appearance this year. She first made the top ten in 1948, five years before she was crowned. Mrs Thatcher has the second highest number of appearances on the top ten for women at 33. Rev Graham has clocked up the highest number of appearances on the men's list, making the top ten 55 times, although he has never been voted the most admired man. That accolade usually goes to the American president, who has topped the list for the past 31 years. Admiration: The Queen has been on Gallup's top ten 44 times . The most admired men and women typically come from the worlds of government, religion, business and entertainment or humanitarian causes.

Dwight Eisenhower holds the record for first-place finishers among men, with 12, followed by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton with eight each.

A former high-flying City lawyer who was jailed after being found guilty of fraud has admitted she's glad she was convicted as prison 'saved' her from her corrupt career. Kate Johns said she was originally in denial over the £6.7million fraud she committed while working at one of the world's richest banks. But her time behind bars has made her realise the 'moral and ethical' mistakes she had made after becoming an 'arrogant lawyer.' Johns denied the charges against her when she faced a jury at Southwark Crown Court in 2009 and attempted suicide when she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. Reformed: Kate Johns, pictured at Southwark Crown Court when she was jailed for fraud, said she has now seen the error of her ways . But now she has been released after serving half her sentence in HMP Holloway and  then the private Bronzefield prison, she has admitted she's seen the error of her ways. The 43-year-old told today's Independent that if she hadn't been convicted, she may never have left her corrupt career in the City where she felt driven by greed thanks to her toxic working environment. 'The more one gets caught up in it, the . harder it gets to walk away. If my conviction hadn't come about, I'm not . sure to this day whether I'd have ever walked away,' she confessed. Driven by greed: The former City lawyer said she is glad she was caught so she can now move on from the corrupt career she had at a London bank . Johns was jailed for tricking her employers at Japanese . bank Tokyo-Mitsubishi into falsely approving huge sums of credit for a . friend's struggling airline. For her role, the 43-year-old received kickbacks worth £1.95million . which she used to pay off the £1.1million . mortgage on her Georgian townhouse in Camden, North London. She also spent her 'ill-gotten gains' on daily manicures, . designer dresses, breast surgery and extravagant shopping trips, . including blowing £40,000 on a pair of diamond earrings. She admitted she had 'wanted for nothing'. 'I'd enjoyed a very good career, and I'd become a very confident, maybe arrogant, lawyer in the process,' she added. 'There were moral and ethical issues in my background that were . troubling, which I had to face before moving on' The fraud behind her lavish lifestyle was exposed when the airline finally went bust in 2008 and her illegal money transfers were investigated. After she was jailed, she said it took months for her to accept her sentence but she finally had 'an epiphany' thanks to the help of a probation officer. 'I realised . there were moral and ethical issues in my background that were . troubling, which I had to face and identify before moving on,' she said. The former Oxford and King's College London student is now using her legal know-how to help people by working for Hibiscus, a charity for women affected by the criminal justice system. She has also written a book about her experiences in which she reveals how the City can turn employees into 'corporate scapegoats' and how she's glad her life of corruption and crime is now behind her.","Kate Johns was jailed in 2009 for tricking her employers at Japanese .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:04 EST, 30 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 30 November 2012 . When Lily Aird went from being an active toddler to one that could barely walk within the space of weeks, her mother knew that something was seriously wrong. Claire rushed her two-year-old to the doctor and after months of testing and treatment was shocked to be told her daughter had arthritis. Usually associated with the elderly, Lily had developed a condition which would immediately change her life. Lily, pictured in her new school uniform left, never complains despite her chronic condition. She was diagnosed at the age of two (pictured, right) Running, playing, dancing, even walking, would be impossible for the little girl unless doctors could find a treatment that would soothe the pain in her knees and hips. But Claire soon realised that Lily would have to spend years of her life going to and from hospitals and medical practices. Claire Aird, 32, from Heathfield, East Sussex, said: 'When I found out she had arthritis I was in complete shock. 'I just started crying. I was worried that she’d never be able to do the other things normal children do. 'I thought why is it my child? Her life will revolve around going back and forth to the hospital.' At first Lily was given large quantities of liquid ibuprofen and cortisone shots to her knees and hips to help numb the pain. But when both only offered temporary relief, doctors realised her condition was more serious than first thought. They decided the best treatment would be chemotherapy drugs normally used for cancer patients. Lily was prescribed with methotrexate number of unpleasant side-effects, which include vomiting, hair-thinning, weakening of the nails, and a lowered immune system. For the first three hours of the day Lily can't bend her legs at all without her medication and has to be carried . Lily swallows the medication in liquid form, but each time it causes her to be sick, upsets her stomach and leaves her mouth sore. Because the medication lowers her immune system it also makes her susceptible to children’s illnesses and her body weaker at fighting things like chicken pox. That is because Lily’s juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is caused by an over-active immune system that attacks her joints, as well as protecting her from illnesses. Around one in 10,000 children aged 16 or under suffer from chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, though it is much rarer among those aged two or under. There is no cure for the illness, but methotrexate works by stopping the immune system from attacking the joints. But the drawbacks of the medication lowering the immune system means children’s illnesses like chicken pox and whooping cough could be deadly if Lily contracted them. Doctors have to regularly blood-test Lily to make sure she does not have them and her school also has to warn her parents if any of them are going around. Claire said: 'Doctors don’t know how badly chicken pox might affect her, so she has to have blood tests. They’re not nice for a child to have to go through. But the nurses do say she’s very brave about it though.' Lily (left) enjoys dancing with her younger sister Holly to Gangnam Style, her mother says . Lily will soon start taking the chemotherapy drug by injection, because it makes it more effective. But rather than complain about the discomfort her medication causes, Lily is more concerned about making sure her youngster sister Holly, who is nearly two, is OK. 'When you go through the things Lily has been through you have to grow up quickly in a lot of ways. But you won’t hear Lily complain. She’s more worried about Holly and making sure she’s OK. She’s always looking out for her and they’re always playing together,' Claire said. Other treatments Lily takes include large amounts of liquid ibuprofen for flare-ups of her arthritis and regular doses of folic acid. Lily also has to be carried up stairs by her mother because of the pain it causes, and needs to wrap up to avoid the cold, which worsens her condition. The ritual of medication-taking is a difficult one both for Lily and her mum, but Claire knows that without it her daughter would not be able to walk and do the things she loves. 'For the first three hours of the day she can’t bend her legs at all without her medication and has to be carried. 'She loves to dance. Her and her little sister, Holly, love to dance to Gangnam Style, but without the treatment she couldn’t dance at all. There’s no way.' For the next 10 years much of Lily’s life will be spent travelling to and from hospital for treatment. It is not known whether she will suffer from the condition for the rest of her life or make a recovery, though the odds are in Lily’s favour. There is no medical cure, but around 75 per cent of children are expected to recover from the illness before they are adults. Claire added: 'Lily always takes it in her stride. We have a few tears but she always been ever so good with it.'","Lily has chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which affects one in 10,000 children aged 16 or under .

Television shows and movies may portray people getting hit in the crotch as comical, but it's a serious issue that sends thousands of men and women to emergency rooms every year, according to a study. Bicycles, personal grooming accidents and unfortunately placed furniture have all been blamed for the eye-watering injuries. The incidents can go on to cause people physical, psychological and reproductive problems later on, according to researchers from the University of California, San Francisco. Not so funny? Charlie Sheen's character in Two and a Half Men receives a painful knee to the crotch in the popular sitcom . They found that 16,000 Americans visit emergency rooms due to genital injuries every year. Study author Benjamin Breyer, said: 'To put this in perspective, the yearly incidence of these (injuries) is almost twice as much as dental injuries, and about the same as electrical and chemical burns.' In the past, most research looked at severe genital and urinary tract injuries caused by major trauma, such as car accidents. For the new study, which appeared in The Journal of Urology, Breyer and his colleagues decided to look at those injuries thought to be caused by common consumer products. One cause of groin damage is when people fall forward on their bicycles and land on the centre bar . The team analysed a national database of emergency room visits caused by consumer products, identifying all genital injuries to men and women 18 years and older between 2002 and 2010. Overall, 142,143 injuries sent people to an emergency room over the nine-year period, which worked out to about 15,794 per year - a  number that didn't seem to change over time. Sporting items were the most common cause of injuries among people of all ages. These included bicycles as well as basketball, soccer, football and baseball equipment. Breyer said one example of damage from a sporting item is people falling forward on their bicycles and landing on the center bar. He said padding or cushioning could help avoid injuries. Other accidents involved clothing, shaving items and bathing products, including men becoming caught in their trouser zips or people cutting themselves while trying to shave sensitive areas. 'I was surprised to find how many injuries from bicycles, personal grooming and bathrooms there were. Those to me were unexpected,' Breyer said. The types of injuries also differed by age and sex. Men were injured the most, accounting for about two-thirds of the emergency room visits. Young people were the most often injured, with 18 to 28-year-olds making up roughly 40 per cent of the visits. Older people sustained only about eight per cent of the injuries, but were more likely to hurt themselves during everyday activities, such as taking a shower. 'The next step is to get a little more information on the actual injuries, what happens to the patients and the mechanism of how it happens,' Breyer said, noting that this could be used to develop programs to prevent these injuries.","Genital injuries can cause physical, psychological and reproductive problems, say experts .

"PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 8 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:15 EST, 8 November 2012 . Many complaints related to mistakes in care not being acknowledged and inadequate apologies being offered . The number of complaints made to the Health Service Ombudsman increased by 8 per cent in a year, figures show. Between 2011 and 2012, 150,859 complaints were received. Of those, 16,337 patients or family members were dissatisfied with the way the NHS tried to resolve their concerns and referred the complaint on to the Health Service Ombudsman. GPs fared particularly badly. The ombudsman said that despite issuing a . warning about GPs unfairly or hastily striking off patients from their . practice lists, the number of such cases has risen by 16 per cent since last . year. Almost 100 people said they had been unfairly removed from GP practice lists after a dispute or disagreement. Health Service Ombudsman Dame Julie . Mellor said: 'Our casework tells us there needs to be a clear shift in . the attitude and practice of some GPs towards complaints. 'Our concerns about how GPs are handling complaints about their practices need to be addressed as a priority. 'As the new NHS begins to take shape, . GPs and other providers, GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups and the . NHS Commissioning Board will need to work to embed good complaint . handling across the NHS.' Elsewhere, there were 1,523 complaints about the NHS not acknowledging mistakes in care, according to a report by the ombudsman. And more than 1,600 people complained about inadequate remedies being offered, including inadequate apologies. Dame Julie is also calling on the NHS to improve the way it deals with complaints on the ground. Another complaint involved a surgeon calling a male patient a 'baby' when he expressed anxiety about having a general anaesthetic . 'All too often the people who come to us for help are unhappy because of the careless communication, insincere apologies and unclear explanations they’ve received from the NHS,' she said. 'A poor response to a complaint can add to the problems of someone who is unwell, struggling to take care of others or grieving. The NHS needs to get better at listening to patients and their families and responding to their concerns.' In one of the cases highlighted in the ombudsman’s report, a bereaved daughter was told 'death is rarely an ideal situation for anyone' and that 'truth be told your mother probably said her goodbyes long before the final moments'. Another case details how a surgeon called a male patient a ‘baby’ when he expressed his anxiety about having a general anaesthetic. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: 'The vast majority of NHS patients are happy with the care they receive, but if things go wrong, some NHS organisations respond to complaints better than others. This is something that the NHS must improve. 'That is why, under the NHS constitution, we have proposed introducing a new right for complaints to be acknowledged within three days and stronger rights to make sure complaints are handled openly. 'We want to see a patient-centred NHS where patients have a stronger voice. This means making the NHS more accountable for the quality of care it provides for patients. 'The Government has set up the new patient champion HealthWatch, which will argue on behalf of patients and help drive improvements in the quality of health and social care services.'","Health Service Ombudsman received 150,859 complaints between 2011 and 2012 .

Difficult decision: After being told there was a chance the cancer would return Emma Neville underwent a double mastectomy . A 23-year-old decided to have a double mastectomy, after doctors told her there was a chance her breast cancer could return. Emma Neville's difficult decision began when she discovered a lump in her breast last August. But doctors reassured her it was unlikely to be anything to worry about. Due to her young age and with no history of breast cancer in her family, medics suggested it could be linked to her hormone cycle rather than anything as sinister as breast cancer. But when the lump was still there eight weeks later, she returned to her GP for further investigations. She asked to be referred to the Nightingale Centre - Europe’s first purpose-built breast cancer prevention and research facility - to undergo more tests. Ms Neville's worst fears were realised when a scan revealed she had cancer - making her one of the youngest women in Greater Manchester to be diagnosed with the disease. Doctors advised she needed surgery and intensive chemotherapy to save her life. Ms Neville, now 24, said: 'It took a few weeks for me to be diagnosed, I think because the doctors thought I was just too young to have breast cancer. 'I was really shocked when I was told. I don’t remember much about that day but I know it didn’t seem real to me at all. The whole experience was traumatic.' At the same time Ms Neville, from Wythenshawe, also decided to undergo egg harvesting because there was a risk that the treatment would leave her unable to have children naturally. Decision: Ms Neville asked to be referred to the Nightingale Centre, right, Europe’s first purpose-built breast cancer prevention and research facility to undergo more tests after she found a lump in her breast . Graph: Female breast cancer is strongly related to age, with the highest rates overall being in older women so Ms Neville's case is very rare - this graph shows in 2007/2008 only 28 women aged 20 to 24 were diagnosed with breast cancer . Surgeons initially believed she had responded well to the chemotherapy, but she was dealt a fresh blow when further checks showed that traces of the disease remained. The next step was to undergo radiotherapy. But doctors told her there was still a 38 per cent chance of the disease returning, leading to Emma’s brave decision three months ago to undergo a double mastectomy. She first talked through the procedure with counsellors at the Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention charity, and later also underwent reconstructive surgery. Cancer is less common in adolescents and young adults than in older people, and for this reason it can often be misdiagnosed or overlooked. Lester Barr, breast cancer surgeon and chairman of Genesis, says less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer. He adds: 'It’s very rare that Emma has developed breast cancer at such a young age - 23-years-old is particularly young. 'It is thought that at least half of the young women in this age group who develop breast cancer do so because they have a strong genetic predisposition to the disease, such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.' One person in every 200 carries one of these faulty genes, which cause an 80 to 90 per cent risk of developing breast cancer in a lifetime. This compares to the ‘normal risk’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer. The procedures have given her the best protection against the cancer coming back, and doctors now believe she has an excellent prognosis. But there is no denying the circumstances Ms Neville faced were rare. Lester Barr, breast cancer surgeon and chairman of Genesis, says less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer.

This compares to the ‘normal risk’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer. Ms Neville’s case was different because she could find no evidence of breast cancer when she looked through her family tree. 'We looked back at my family history and could find no history of the disease which makes it more unusual,' she says. 'It was out of the blue.' It is boosting research into the condition which is now driving Emma forward as she organises a charity ball in aid of Genesis. The former pupil of St James’ High School in Cheadle is organising The Black and Pink Party at Bowdon Rugby Club, which will take place on October 27. She hopes it will become an annual event, and is also taking part in the Race for Life through Tatton Park next month. Ms Neville, who has just returned to work in customer service for a clothing company, says: 'I want to give something back to Genesis.' Although rare, other young woman in the UK have undergone a double mastectomy in the battle against cancer. In 2009, aged 18, Hannah Fitzpatrick became the youngest woman in Britain to have a double mastectomy in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of breast cancer which has haunted her family. It followed the diagnosis of two of her cousins with breast cancer, both in their early twenties  -  an unusually young age. Both were subsequently found to have the same faulty gene.","After being told there was a 38% chance the cancer would return Emma Neville underwent a double mastectomy three months ago .

"By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 2 November 2011 . A cruel man imprisoned 23 wild garden birds and kept them locked up in his own avian Alcatraz after snaring them with homemade traps. Twitcher Robert Grivelle, 61, caught eight greenfinches, nine sparrows, five goldfinches and one blackcap using a bird table and a piece of string leading to his home, Bristol Magistrates Court heard. Grivelle would watch in his conservatory until an unsuspecting bird landed, then he pulled on the string - trapping the feathered creatures in wire cages - and then kept them at his home. Crime: Robert Grivelle, pictured at his home in Bristol , imprisoned 23 wild garden birds and kept them locked up in the house and garden . He has admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the wild birds and a canary, keeping them contrary to the Wildlife and Countryside Act. He was ordered to pay almost £1,000 after being prosecuted by the RSPCA. Grivelle, from the Lockleaze area of Bristol, said he caged the birds because he did not want to pay £16 each for them at a pet shop. RSPCA inspectors were alerted to Grivelle's house because of two birds in a cage in his front garden. Elaine Laken, prosecuting, said: 'These two birds turned out to be quails, which are allowed to be kept. 'However, inspectors gained entry to the house and found many wild birds being kept in homemade cages in the defendant's three bedrooms and in the back garden. Almost empty: Mr Grivelle is shown next to one of his cages, which he filled with eight greenfinches, nine sparrows, five goldfinches and one blackcap . 'Grivelle admitted trapping all 23 birds over the last two years.' The birds have since been released back into the wild, the court heard. Ms Laken explained that Grivelle also kept a canary which was found by inspectors with a broken leg. She said: 'The leg was hanging off by a thread. The bone was protruding and a vet said the canary would have been suffering. 'It has subsequently been euthanised. 'Grivelle's explanation was that the bird became injured only the night before when he was trying to catch it to put it back in its cage.' Cruel: His back garden, with the bird table contraption he used to catch them, as well as cages where he kept them . She told the court that a veterinary specialist said he was in no doubt that being captured by means of a trap caused the wild birds 'chronic stress'. He also said that being kept in a cage could cause the birds weight loss, anaemia and feather damage. The court heard Grivelle also kept 11 other birds, which had been bought legally from a pet shop. Grivelle, who represented himself, said: 'I would really like to keep the birds. 'I made a mistake taking them from the wild which I shouldn't have done. 'The one thing I did was take the birds in from the wild and break the law - if I don't do that again I should be alright keeping my other birds, shouldn't I?' Bird man: Mr Grivelle was ordered to pay almost £1,000 after being prosecuted by the RSPCA, and stole the birds because he refused to go to a pet shop . He claimed he had heard that 80 per cent of wild birds died during the winter and wanted to 'save them'. The defendant admitted making the traps and said he realised the birds were 'stressed' after being caught. Terence Pavey, chairman of the bench, fined £400, ordered to pay £500 costs plus a £15 victim surcharge. He said: 'One thing we would say is we do not think you did this particularly deliberately but you did it with some thought.' He was also banned from keeping birds for five years. RSPCA inspector Miranda Albinson said: 'This is quite an unusual case. 'Usually people catch wild birds to sell on or to collect their eggs but it seems Grivelle was genuinely keeping them as pets. 'The birds we found in cages in his bedrooms and back garden were massively stressed out. 'Some were flying back and forth in the cages hitting their heads and damaging their beaks. They were constantly trying to escape. 'We can only hope that they will survive now they are back in the wild.'","Robert Grivelle caged the birds because he did not want to pay £16 each for them at a pet shop .

"By . Lucy Buckland . UPDATED: . 02:58 EST, 22 December 2011 . Stabbed to death: The killers of Zac Olumegbon have been caged for 76 years for the gang attack . A knife-wielding gang of teenagers stabbed a rival boy to death in a vicious revenge attack as he made his way into school. The killers were all members of the notorious GAS gang - short for 'Guns and Shanks', and set-upon Zac Olumegbon, 15, as he arrived at the school gates. The youths wanted revenge on the TN1 'Trust No-One', which Zac was linked to, after another stabbing a month earlier. On the day of the killing all five . turned up at Park Campus school in West Norwood, south London, and . chased their victim armed with two knives. Kyle . Kinghorn, 18, and Helder Demorais, Jamal Moore and Ricardo Giddings, . all 17, chased Zac into a nearby garden and stabbed him to death. All four were convicted of murder after a two-month trial at the Old Bailey last month. Get . away driver Shaquille Haughton, 16, was cleared of murder but was . convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to a 12-year sentence. In court it was revealed before stabbing Zac all but Moore had been in trouble with the police for carrying knives. Yesterday at the Old Bailey Giddings, the knifeman who struck the fatal blow, was jailed for 18 years. Kinghorn and Demorais were each jailed for a minimum 16 years and Moore was given at least 14 years. Describing the day of the murder Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the court: 'Before he was able to start his school day he found himself hounded down and killed by these five defendants, armed as they were with at least two large knives. 'As he ran from them Zac was separated from his school friends, he was chased, caught and stabbed to death. Killers: (top row left to right) Helder Demorais, Ricardo Giddings, (bottom row left to right) Jamal Moore and Kyle Kinghorn were convicted of murder and handed down sentences from 18 to 14 years . Zac was knifed in the heart, neck and . buttock and left dying in the back garden of a house just 100 metres . from the school on July 2. All five each originally denied being at the scene of the killing, but subsequently four accepted being present after police found their fingerprints and Zac's blood in the get away car, a stolen Nissan Almera. A second boy was also stabbed and was 'lucky' not to have suffered fatal injuries. Zac, from Brixton Hill, was a member of the TN1 'Trust No-One' gang from the Tulse Hill. Chase: Haunting CCTV footage shows Zac Olumegbon sprinting away from his killers, one of which is brandishing a large knife . Sinister plan: CCTV captures the moments four of the attackers leave home covered up on the morning of the killing . Running for his life: Zac Olumegbon (behind black car) being chased towards Gipsy Gardens by one of the defendants before his murder . In June 2010 Zac was said to be present when a member of TN1 stabbed a member of the Gas gang. Pupils at Park Campus had either been excluded from other schools or were waiting for a place at a mainstream school. One of the killers used Zac's mobile phone 28 minutes after the stabbing. Jailing the gang, who are all from . south London, Judge Giles Forrester said the attacks were 'vicious, . shocking and sickening acts of violence outside a school in West Norwood . at a time when pupils and staff were gathering at the start of the . school day'. He added: 'All of you had chosen to be there probably in a misguided attempt to look big in front of other gang members. 'Zac was aged 15 years, he was chased . along the street as he fled for his life. He was trapped in a nearby . back garden and stabbed to death which was a terrifying and terrible way . for him to die,' said the judge. 'Vicious': Getaway driver Shaquille Haughton was . convicted of manslaughter as he picked up the knife weilding gang in a . stolen car (left) Weapon: One of the knives used to kill Zac Olumegbo by rival gang . Moore was a promising grime artist, known as J-kid or Younger Sneaky, who had posted videos on YouTube under the GAS gang name. Some of the footage, which includes . the sound of shots being fired, shows hooded and masked youths making . gun symbols with their hands as he raps lyrics. Houghton was jailed for eight years for manslaughter and four years consecutively for wounding with intent. Outside the court, Zac's mother Shakira Olumegbon tearfully told of her grief as she watched the last moments of her son's life played out on CCTV footage during the trial. A mother's grief: Shakira Olumegbon, in tears surrounded by her family outside The Old Bailey after the five teenagers were sentenced . Surrounded by family members, she said: 'This has been an extremely painful process for us as family, who had to witness the last moment of Zac's life lived out on screen, all the while fighting the urge to reach out into the screen and help him as he ran for his life. 'We had to listen to the gut-wrenching detail of his injuries, knowing he suffered an extremely painful death that no one should have to endure, let alone a 15-year-old boy. 'Now he's gone we will never be the same. There will always be something missing. He was such a lovely boy and we bitterly regret the cruel way in which he was taken from us.'While there is great satisfaction that justice has finally been achieved there is no sense of victory or conclusion because nothing will ever bring Zac back.'

Her little boy had a temperature, was sensitive to light and so poorly he couldn’t even get out of bed. With the GP surgery shut for the weekend, Georgina Houghton-Small rang NHS Direct, who said it could be meningitis and told her to take seven-year-old Colby to hospital as fast as she could. Mercifully, Colby was diagnosed with a viral infection and sent home with antibiotics. Colby Houghton's mother was told by NHS Direct to take him to A&E with suspected meningitis. The family received a stinging letter from the local medical centre a few days later, accusing them of wasting NHS time . But Mrs Houghton-Small’s relief . turned to outrage a few days later when a letter arrived from the GP . addressed to Colby – admonishing him for going to A&E instead of the . surgery. The practice said it had received a . letter from the hospital about his visit, and continued: ‘A&E is for . life-threatening situations such as a heart attack or stroke and for . the care of people who show the symptoms of serious illness or who are . badly injured.’ A furious Mrs Houghton-Small condemned the surgery yesterday, saying its attitude could put lives at risk. ‘I was so angry that they would make . us feel that we were wrong to seek medical advice over something like . that,’ said the 33-year-old mother of four. ‘The letter said A&E is only for . people with serious symptoms. How much more serious does it need to be . for a child of seven? ‘This sort of thing needs to be . stopped. It could put people off taking their children to hospital when . they are seriously ill.’ Colby developed a temperature at his . home in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, on November 9. The next day he started . vomiting. By the third day he was too lethargic to walk or stand and was . highly sensitive to light. Colby's parents rushed him to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage on the instructions of NHS Direct. Doctors there established he had a viral infection and sent him home with antibiotics . His parents tried giving him fluids . and Calpol but eventually rang NHS Direct. Their local GP surgery was . closed as it was the weekend. ‘He always has the energy to get up . and play, but he didn’t get out of bed and all he wanted to do was . sleep,’ Mrs Houghton-Small said. ‘We were really worried. If a kid is so ill they don’t want to watch TV or play with their toys, you know something is wrong. ‘NHS Direct said get him to A&E . immediately and take another adult in case he takes a turn for the worse . on the way so someone is free to call 999 as the other drives. That . scared us even more.’ She and her husband Gavin, 34, dashed . over to Lister Hospital in Stevenage. Staff there said he had a viral . infection and prescribed antibiotics.

A spokesman added: ‘It’s current . practice for some GP surgeries to write to their patients advising them . of the importance of using their A&E departments for emergencies . only and to promote the use of their GP service or the local . out-of-hours GP service for non-emergencies. ‘We very much regret if the letter . caused distress but it was intended to help the family make the right . choice about the service they need to ensure they receive the best . possible health care in the future.’ An extract from the letter the GP surgery sent, addressed to Colby .","Georgina Houghton, 33, called NHS Direct one weekend after son Colby, 7, developed a temperature, vomiting and sensitivity to light .

Those who take on many tasks at once often wrongly believe they are good at multi-tasking - and have trouble focusing on one task at a time, researchers at Utah University in Salt Lake City said. The U.S. professors found the motorists most likely to talk on their mobile phones while driving tend to be ‘impulsive, sensation-seeking’ individuals who have a heightened risk of having a crash. Concentration: The professors found the motorists most likely to talk on their mobile phones while driving tend to be 'impulsive, sensation-seeking' individuals who have a heightened risk of having a crash (file picture) Some people like doing two or more things at once because it is stimulating, interesting, challenging and more exciting - even if it hurts their overall performance, the findings suggest. ‘What’s alarming is people who talk on cell phones while driving tend to be the people least able to multi-task well,’ Professor David Sanbonmatsu said in his report for the PLOS ONE online journal. ‘People talking on cell phones while driving are people who probably shouldn’t. We showed people who multi-task the most are those who appear to be the least capable of multi-tasking effectively.’ He gave 310 undergraduate psychology students tests and questionnaires to measure their actual multi-tasking ability, perceived multi-tasking ability and mobile phone use while driving. Researchers: University of Utah psychology professors David Sanbonmatsu (left) and David Strayer (right) with the driving simulator they use in some of their research on mobile phone use and driving . They also had to look at their use of a wide array of electronic media and personality traits such as impulsivity and sensation-seeking. 'What’s alarming is people who talk on cell phones while driving tend to be the people least able to multi-task well' Professor David Sanbonmatsu . Study co-author Professor David Strayer said: ‘The people who are most likely to multi-task harbour the illusion they are better than average at it, when in fact they are no better than average - and often worse.’ Those who scored highest on actual multi-tasking ability tended not to engage in it because they were more able to focus attention on the job at hand. Their perceived multi-tasking ability ‘was found to be significantly inflated,’ the study said. In fact, 70 per cent of participants thought they were above average at multi-tasking. People with high levels of impulsivity and sensation-seeking reported more multi-tasking. Project: The study was conducted by psychology researchers at Utah University in Salt Lake City (pictured) Those who engaged in multi-tasking often do so ‘because they are less able to block out distractions and focus on a singular task' - rather than because they have the ability. 'The people who are most likely to multi-task harbour the illusion they are better than average at it, when in fact they are no better than average - and often worse' Professor David Strayer . The researchers said: ‘The negative relation between cellular communication while driving and multi-tasking ability appears to further bolster arguments for legislation limiting the use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle.’ Professor Sanbonmatsu said the 25 per cent who performed best on multi-tasking ability ‘are the people who are least likely to multi-task and are most likely to do one thing at a time.’ The study was funded by the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety.","Psychology study by U.S. researchers at Utah University in Salt Lake City .

Eight large hospitals across England have experienced death rates higher than expected for two years in a row, figures show. The hospitals, run by five English NHS trusts, have been 'persistently high' between . July 2010 and June 2012, according to the Health and Social Care . Information Centre (HSCIC). The Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) compares the number of patients who die following hospitalisation at a trust with the number who would be expected to die. Tameside Hospital near Greater Manchester, had a higher than expected death rate: Medical director Tariq Mahmood insisted the Trust's mortality rate was normal according to a different measurement . Analysts said that the death rate was higher than expected at hospitals run by Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust for two years running. Experts said that the indictor should be seen as an 'early warning mechanism' so trusts can examine why their score was higher than expected. The SHMI data, which includes all deaths in hospital as well as deaths occurring 30 days after discharge, also shows that there were 11 trusts which had higher than expected mortality between July 2011 and June 2012. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust: runs Colchester General Hospital and Essex County Hospital . Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: runs Tameside Hospital near Manchester . Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: runs Blackpool Victoria Hospital, two community hospitals and two rehabilitation units . Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: Basildon Hospital and Orsett Hospital, both in Essex . East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust: Royal Blackburn Hospital, Burnley General Hospital, and a community hospital . While the majority of trusts (115) fell into the 'as expected' category, 16 trusts had lower than expected mortality rates in the same time frame. HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'Today’s report, based on two years of data, shows an emerging picture of which trusts are categorised over time as having higher or lower mortality ratios than expected; and indeed also shows that the vast majority of trusts in England have a mortality ratio that is as expected, based on the characteristics of the patients they will typically treat. 'As always with such a complex area, this mortality indicator should be seen as an early warning mechanism, rather than a definitive judgment, to examine the reasons why a trust’s ratio is higher or lower than expected.' Dr Sean MacDonnell, medical director at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, said the trust planned to monitor, analyse and investigate mortality trends. He said the trust took the mortality indicator 'extremely seriously' adding: 'The number of deaths at Colchester General Hospital and Essex County Hospital is falling year-on-year. 'In 2011/12, there were 18.28 deaths per 1,000 spells or admissions compared with 20.22 in 2010/11 and 21.42 in 2009/10.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'I . expect trusts to examine this data carefully and take action to . investigate if necessary and ensure they are providing safe, high . quality care. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said he expected trusts to examine the data carefully to ensure they provide safe, high quality care . 'This data alone cannot be used to judge the quality of care. However, the CQC examines mortality data and a range of other information to target their inspections and to ensure trusts take appropriate action where there are problems. 'Where trusts have a higher than expected ratio, the department will work with strategic health authorities to investigate the underlying reasons for this and ensure that firm action is taken.' A spokeswoman for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said that last year the trust took steps to investigate its historically high mortality rates. Dr Mark O’Donnell, the trust’s medical . director, said: 'We are committed to improving the outcomes for patients . and the safety of our services and have already undertaken much work . which has now resulted in figures at or near the national average.' Tariq Mahmood, medical director at Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said that another mortality indicator - the Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR) - showed that the trust had a “normal” death rate. 'We would like to reassure our patients, relatives and carers that we continue to work with our local health partners to look at all the factors throughout our community which influence this data,' he said. 'We take this very seriously as patient safety is our top priority. 'It is important to stress that our mortality rate, as indicated by the HSMR for exactly the same period, was normal. In fact Tameside has had a normal HSMR mortality rate with this indicator for over three years.' Rineke Schram, medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, added: 'The SHMI indicators are very complex and should not be looked at in isolation. 'The population of East Lancashire has some of the poorest health and deprivation indices in the country and it is these indices that are not taken into account when the mortality ratio is calculated. Death rates at Essex County Hospital (pictured) and Colchester General Hospital have been higher than expected since 2010, although numbers have been dropping year-on-year . 'The trust agrees that the indicator should be used as a warning signal rather than a judgement and used to examine the reasons why the ratio is high, particularly as other mortality ratios do not give the same result. 'Clinicians at the trust systematically review mortality data from all causes. This includes reviewing every patient’s death to see if anything could have been done differently, and looking at trends and patterns in disease categories to see if different treatments or methods of management should be introduced.' A spokeswoman for Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust is working hard to improve its mortality ratio performance. 'While the figures relating to July 2010-June 2012 show the trust’s mortality rates as being higher than expected, the figures are still within expected limits for our demographic.' She added that the trust reviews all hospital deaths “to see if there are any deficiencies in care”.","The eight major hospitals with 'persistently high' death rates are run by five NHS trusts .

Forty per cent of girls born in the UK this year will become centenarians, experts say. This is up 13 per cent of girls born in 1951 who are expected to reach this milestone, and scientists say there is no sign the trend will end any time soon. By 2060 they estimate there will be around half a million centenarians living in Britain, and 60 per cent of girls born that year can be expected to receive a birthday card from the monarch. John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund think tank, revealed the predictions in an article published in the British Medical Journal. Sweet dreams: Baby Aseda Mensah was born in Coventry yesterday. She, like the 400,000 other girls expected to be born in the UK this year, has a 40% chance of reaching 100 . He said the rise in life expectancy . revealed by the Office for National Statistics mirrors worldwide trends, . apart from notable exceptions including Zimbabwe and the Ukraine. He attributed it to the fact that . people are dying at older ages as they are more likely to survive . childhood thanks to better education and improved healthcare. The trend has certainly put pressure on Royal resources. When the tradition of sending a telegram from the monarch to all new centenarians began in 1917, King George V dispatched 24 celebratory messages. By 1952, the number had increased ten-fold and by 2011 it had increased to nearly 10,000. This graph reveals life expectancy at birth of UK males and females: The principal projection is the best estimated age based on current trends . Population survival curves: The red line shows the percentage of women who are expected to survive to ages up to 100. The black line is an estimation for girls born in 2060 . Mr Appleby warns living longer can bring its own problems, with more years of disability. While life expectancy for women has risen by 4.6 per cent since 1990, healthy life expectancy has risen by only 3 per cent. Mr Appleby writes: ‘Living longer is a good thing but not much fun if those extra years are lived in pain and discomfort. ‘How healthy humans will be in the future . is an open question, but historically at least, previous gains in . healthy life expectancy have more to do with reductions in mortality . than reductions in years lived in disability.’ In Europe as a whole, the proportion of people aged over 65 is predicted to hit 40 per cent by 2030. Young and old: Researchers estimate that 40 per cent of girls born this year will become centenarians . Mr Appleby questions whether the world can support ageing populations. He writes: ‘Is there a cloud to this . silver lining? As more and more people live to older ages what will . happen to the world’s population? Could we ﬁnd our aged selves . scrabbling for resources as the world’s population explodes?’ The economist says this is unlikely because population growth will slow over the coming decades. Question: John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund thinktank, writing in the British Medical Journal, asks: 'Where will it all end?' He adds: ‘As life expectancy improves, people – as we know from the history of industrialised nations – adjust their family to the point where populations in aggregate more or less hit the replacement rate, where births equal deaths. So, until the next set of population predictions, no need to panic.’ Pensions minister Steve Webb said earlier this month that rising life expectancy meant a higher retirement age was essential. ‘If people are going to live on average to late 80s and beyond, retiring in late 50s is just never going to make the sums add up,’ he said. He suggested further changes were in store for younger generations. ‘If someone tells a 30-year-old what their state pension age is going to be, they are lying,’ he added. Large variations remain between men and women and different social groups.One study found a difference of 11.4 years between women in the poorest and most afﬂuent social groups.","13% of girls born in 1951 expected to reach 100 compared to 40% born now .

Sprinter Elizabeth 'Libby' Clegg already has a Paralympic medal (a silver one pocketed in Beijing), but winning one this week would be extra special. Not only is London 2012 a home games for the 22-year-old Scot, but her brother James is also competing in the swimming pool. And if that wasn't enough, it is also the first games in which Clegg's running guide Mikail will be eligible for a medal, too. Libby Clegg in action with Mikail Huggins during the womens 200m race at the AVIVA Birmingham Grand Prix in 2011 . In Beijing, only pilot cyclists in the tandem race were eligible for medals. But this time around the work of guide runners and . sighted goalkeepers in blind football will also be recognised. To Clegg, Mikail Huggins is as integral a component to the T12 100m and 200m dashes in which she competes as her own arms and legs. 'You have to be completely in synch and get the start absolutely right,' she says of the relationship she has with Huggins - who is, incidentally, the stepson of her former running guide, Lincoln Asquith, with whom she won silver in the T12 100m in Beijing. 'We’re kind of a team — wherever I go, he goes.' Libby Clegg and her former guide runner Lincoln Asquith competing in the T12 200m in Beijing during the 2008 Paralympics . She told BBC Sport how thrilled she is that Huggins will finally get the recognition he deserves: 'It is a bit like doing the three-legged race but attached by your hands rather than your feet. 'To execute the run properly you need to be smooth and in time, with . both the pace and the stride length correct. Mikail and I need to . communicate to make sure our performance is the best it can be. 'It's a team effort, . it's not just me. I'm the one that has to cross the line first, but when . I get medals I want Mikail to be with me because he helps me do it.' Huggins himself said: 'It's a souvenir for the hard work and dedication I've put in. One of the biggest things is being able to help someone achieve their . dreams. 'I know that I'm Libby's guide, but we come as a team – if she . loses, I lose, and if she wins, we win as a team.' Libby Clegg, left, and her brother James, right, in their official Team GB Paralympic portraits . Huggins accompanies Clegg on each of her races, ensuring she doesn't veer out of her lane by running alongside her and talking to her throughout. They each hold one end of a rubber figure-of-eight loop made from physiotherapy tubing stuck together with electrical tape. 'I have to trust Mikail because I am . running at full pelt,' she says. 'He talks throughout the race, . indicating where we are in the bend, whether I need to accelerate or . hold or relax and he always tells me to put my chin back in because I . tend to push it out when I run. 'He definitely has the harder job. All I have to do is run, which is the easy part. He has to talk and run.' Happily, the pair - who have been working together for the past two years - get on well both personally and professionally . Clegg worries she can get moody before races but Huggins has learned simply not to talk to her then. Libby and Mikail get in sync in the T12 100m event during the BT Paralympics World Cup Athletics in Manchester in 2011 . Just . like her brother (18-year-old Paralympic swimming hope James), Clegg . suffers from the genetic, degenerative eye condition Stargardt’s Macular .

Oxford has been overtaken by the London School of Economics in a university league table published today. The ancient university was forced into third place behind the LSE and arch-rival Cambridge, which took top spot. A decline in the job prospects of Oxford's graduates contributed to its slide from second place in last year's table. Third class: Oxford University has been overtaken by the London School of Economics in a new university league table . The prospects of Cambridge leavers suffered a lesser fall while the LSE, which concentrates on a narrower range of subjects, bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates. It is the first time in the 15-year history of the tables, which rank universities on a range of measures including research quality, entry standards, staff-to-student ratios and job prospects, Oxford has been beaten by the LSE. The tables - part of the Complete University Guide - show how leading universities are toughening up entry requirements to counter rising A-level pass rates. The average student accepted to Cambridge now achieves the equivalent of almost five A grades. There are also wide variations in the likelihood of gaining a good degree - a first or 2.1 - depending on the university attended. Oxford handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students and Cambridge 87 per cent, while just 44 per cent of University of East London graduates achieved the distinction. Fall: A decline in job prospects for Oxford students has been blamed for the university slipping to third in the tables. Pictured is Christchurch College, Oxford . Despite relatively lowly positions in the tables, some universities gave out large numbers of firsts and 2.1s, with 69 per cent achieving good degrees at Gloucestershire University, which was ranked 74th. The table, which ranks 116 universities at www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk, also showed stark differences in graduate job prospects. Across all universities in the list, 63.7 per cent of leavers from the class of 2010 were working in graduate-level jobs or taking further qualifications six months after graduating. The rest were on the dole or under-employed in jobs unlikely to justify the time and expense of studying. Embarrassment: London School of Economics has come under fire for its close links to Colonel Gaddafi . At Bolton University, the figure was 41.1 per cent and Southampton Solent it was 41.9 per cent. In contrast, the LSE boasted the highest employment rate, with 87.8 per cent of graduates in good jobs or further study six months later - up from 84.1 per cent last year. Average employment rates have declined from 68.6 per cent among the class of 2007. Dr Bernard Kingston, principal author of the guide, said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession. Some had adapted to the changing financial climate by focusing sharply on the employability of their graduates. 'The employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings. Some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions,' he said. 'League tables carry a health warning for good reason and the order at the top of the ranking should be treated with some discretion. 'What is beyond dispute is that all three institutions - Cambridge, the London School of Economics and Oxford - are outstanding in their fields. The LSE's range of disciplines is less broad than Oxford's, and it has a better record for graduate prospects.' He suggested employers with typically recruit Oxbridge graduates may be struggling, affecting their employment rates. In separate listings covering 62 subjects, Cambridge takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers, and is in the top ten for 46. The LSE is in the top ten for all twelve of the subjects offered and is top for three. Oxford is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects, and is placed first in 12. Across all measures, the top ten universities were Cambridge, LSE, Oxford, Imperial College London, Durham, Warwick, St Andrews, University College London, Lancaster and Bath. Oxford has previously been beaten in the table by Imperial College London, in 1999 and 2000, when it again took third place. However, Oxford has taken top spot in the tables more times than Cambridge over the past decade. The new rankings are a boost for the LSE after it suffered acute embarrassment last year following revelations of extensive links to Colonel Gaddafi's regime. It accepted a £1.5million donation from Saif Gaddafi, the son of the then Libyan dictator, a year after Saif was awarded a PhD and also agreed to a £2.2million contract with Libya to train its civil service.","Oxford slip down table as graduate job prospects slip .

Fat-busting: Scientists believe a drug could be developed to tackle obesity by targeting hunger pangs in the brain . A super diet pill aimed at curbing fat people's appetites could soon be a reality thanks to boffins who have found the secret to tackling obesity may lie in the brain. The pill would not only shrink waist lines but also the £4.2 billion NHS bill for treating obesity related illness such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Scientists in the US believe the hypothalmus area of the brain - a receptor controlling body temperature, hunger, thirst and fatigue - is particularly sensitive to drugs which could hold the key to fighting flab. Professor Domenico Accili, from Columbia University Medical Center, said: 'We've identified a receptor that is immediately involved in regulating food intake. 'What is especially encouraging is that it is a highly 'druggable' target. In fact, several existing medications already seem to interact with this receptor.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the Cell journal, studied insulin and leptin hormones, which inhabit the AgRP molecule and are vital to maintaining the body's energy balance. They did so by creating a strain of mice to explore the effects of appetite stimulation and discovered a gene called Gpr17. The scientists found that when the gene was injected into normal rodents, it resulted in an increase in appetite and a decrease when it was blocked - without negative side effects. They said the gene is also found in humans and would be a good target for fat busting drugs, which could be available in only a few months by modifying existing medicines to target the brain. Nearly a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese, with the figure predicted to rise to 40 per cent by 2022. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, told The Daily Express: 'Of all the measures that over time will quell obesity this has got to be one of the most promising avenues.'","Scientists in the US have found the secret to fighting the flab may lie in the brain .

Deputy headteacher Ann Adair had a ground-breaking procedure which transplants cells from dead patients. Experts hope it could lead to a diabetes cure . A mother has become one of the first in the country to undergo a pioneering operation which it is hoped will one day lead to a cure for diabetes. The ground-breaking procedure takes cells from dead patients and transplants them to the living. Deputy headteacher Ann Adair, from Birmingham, who suffers from type one diabetes, has undergone the operation to replace the vital Islet Cells, which are responsible for producing insulin, and has started to see her symptoms reverse. In type one diabetes the immune system mistakenly destroys the cells so they no longer make the hormone, which leads to dangerously low blood sugar levels. But now medics have discovered the a way to transplant the pancreatic cells from deceased patients - which means the recipient’s body can once again produce insulin. The breakthrough could potentially lead to a cure for hundreds of thousands of diabetics, according to Birmingham medic Dr Ming Ming Teh. Mrs Adair, 43, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, had the transplant as part of a trial at Heartlands Hospital three weeks ago - and has already started to feel the positive effects. The teacher, who is mother to Eve, four, and three-year-old Grace, said: 'This operation has turned back the clock for me. 'The side effects of diabetes become worse as you get older but, since the operation, my symptoms have started to reverse. 'I am now on a significantly lower dosage of insulin and I have only suffered one hypo (hypoglycemic attack) this week, whereas before I was having around five.' Hypoglycemia occurs when the level of glucose present in the blood falls below a set point. If severe, it can lead to a coma. Mrs Adair had the transplant at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital three weeks ago - and has already started to feel the positive effects . Mrs Adair, who is married to chartered surveyor Kieran, was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 19. Her consultant Dr Teh suggested an Islet Cells transplant when her condition worsened this year. 'I looked into it and saw that it was quite cutting edge. He put me forward for it and I was lucky that a match was found so quickly,' she said. Dr Teh, consultant physician in diabetes and endocrinology at Heartlands, is the first to set up an Islet Transplant Clinic in the Midlands. He said: 'This procedure could potentially lead to a cure one day. 'There are still a few challenges ahead, but this transplant could make it feasible one day to find a cure for diabetes and hope for the 250,000 sufferers in the UK.' The procedure involves obtaining . cells from the pancreas of a dead donor and injecting them into the . diabetic's liver. Once there, the cells get to work producing insulin. Throughout the pancreas are clusters . of cells known as the islets of Langerhans. These islets are made up of . several types of cells, including beta cells which make the insulin. People with Type 1 diabetes fail to . produce enough insulin or cannot use it properly, which means they have . to rely on injections of the hormone. The minimally-invasive transplants, . which can take just 45 minutes, mean diabetics can live their lives on . fewer or no injections.","Ann Adair, who suffers .

A new mother told of the terrifying moment she took her two-week-old baby to doctors with a chest infection to be told the youngster had whooping cough. Aimee Webber, 26, took her daughter Poppy to Kent Elms Health Centre, in Southend, Essex three times, but the condition went undetected. The youngster's clear chest meant medics never even considered she might be suffering from whooping cough. It wasn't until Mrs Webber stayed in . the surgery chatting to the doctor after her third examination that the . medic picked up on the youngster's distinctive cough. The doctor told Mrs Webber and her husband, policeman Rob, 26, to take their daughter straight to Southend University Hospital. Hospital . staff hurriedly ran tests after hearing the recognisable 'whooping' sound and discovered to her parents dismay that one of her little lungs . had collapsed. Struggling . and fighting for her life the little youngster was unable to feed . causing shocking water retention - making her tiny body DOUBLE in size. Today Mrs Webber warned all parents to be on guard against the killer virus as the outbreak of a new whooping cough epidemic was confirmed. She said: 'We brought her home from the hospital after she was born and the whole family had colds and coughs. 'So when Poppy started to develop a little cough and became a little groggy we didn't think anything of it we just thought she had caught our cold. 'I took to her the doctors for the first time when she had just turned two-weeks-old because she still sounded chested. 'When doctors checked her chest they said it was all clear, I went back a week later because nothing had improved but once again the doctor said her chest was completely clear. 'While we were chatting in the doctors surgery Poppy started to cough and the doctor just looked so alarmed - she said ""I think it's whooping cough"" and I just burst into tears. Doctors realised one of Poppy's tiny lungs had collapsed after she was rushed to Southend University Hospital . 'In the hospital me and my husband were sat beside her and she started to make the unusual coughing noise - which we were use to by now. 'And suddenly we were surrounded by doctors and nurses who were frantic that she wasn't going to be able to breathe. 'It was terrifying because she was just under four-weeks-old and I wanted to cuddle her and tell her she's going to be OK. I was helpless. 'It was unsettling because whooping cough has only recently started reoccurring again. 'One member of staff said it was only the second case they had ever seen.We worried because Poppy is so precious and tiny and she was brand new. 'The injection for whooping cough was released the day Poppy was submitted into hospital, if I was pregnant now I wouldn't even question having the jab. 'If you see your daughter struggling to breathe, covered in tubes, fighting for a life she's barely lived yet there is no doubt that you would want to stop that from happening. 'You never think it will be your child.' On the mend: Poppy is now recovering according to medics . Cases of whooping cough (pertussis) have soared since 2011 . Poppy, who was born on September 5, developed cold-like symptoms shortly after Mrs Webber gave birth. Unaware of the deadly symptoms, Mrs Webber from Southend, Essex, continued to monitor the ""cold"" taking her back and forth to the doctors. Little Poppy caught what is known as the ""100 day cough"" which lays undetected in the chest but can be picked up on early cold-like symptoms. The baby, now three-months-old, is still suffering from the illness but doctors hope she will make a full recovery. Mrs Webber, a care assistant who is currently on maternity leave, added: 'Me and Rob looked back over the video of Poppy coughing last night and you forget just how poorly she was. 'At one point her whole body was retaining so much water that it had collected to a point on her head. 'I panicked, I was unconsolable, I thought the worst - that she was going to be brain damaged. 'As the doctors moved her the water which had collected spread back through the body. 'Now she is slowly getting better, she is still coughing but she is out of the worst of it. We can only pray that she doesn't pick up any infections because her immune system is so weak. 'We just hope she'll get better and not have any long term effects.' Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The medical term for whooping cough is pertussis. The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough which progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise. The coughing can last for around three months. Other symptoms include raised temperature and vomiting after coughing. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every 3-4 years. There is currently a peak occurring. Whooping cough is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis, which can be passed from person to person through droplets spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery, however measures should be taken to stop it spreading. Children with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery until they have taken antibiotics for five days. The same applies to adults returning to their workplace. Young babies under the age of six months are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications, such as serious breathing difficulties. They will be treated in isolation to prevent the infection spreading and will be given antibiotics into a vein through a drip (intravenously).Source: NHS Choices .","Poppy's condition was missed three times because her chest appeared clear .

She is the youngest of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia's three children and is fourth in line to the throne.

Princess Madeleine of Sweden, 30, has announced that she will marry British-born, U.S.-based banker Chris O'Neill, 38 . Mr O'Neill proposed to the princess earlier this month, and the couple confirmed the news in a brief video clip posted on the royal website. 'Chris proposed to me in New York at the start of October, and we are very happy,' Madeleine said in the video, which was recorded Wednesday at the Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm. Madeleine described the proposal as 'very romantic and intimate' but would not reveal anything beyond that. In love: The couple were pictured on 23rd September in Manhattan, just a week before their engagement . 'Madeleine . and I have known each other for two years and I recently summoned up . the courage to ask her to marry me. Thankfully she said yes,' Mr O'Neill . said in English with a British accent. He added a few words in Swedish, saying he was trying to learn the language 'but it is difficult.' Mr O'Neill revealed that he had followed procedure and asked Madeline's father, the king, for his daughter's hand in marriage. She said yes! Mr O'Neill, pictured with Madeline in an official engagement photo, 'summoned the courage' to propose in New York at the start of October . In turn, King Carl XVI Gustaf . 'requested the approval by the Swedish Government, in accordance with . the procedures set out in the Swedish Constitution,' the court . announcement said. Madeline's mother, Queen Silvia, was thrilled by the news, describing Mr O'Neill as 'a real . dream-son-in-law', according to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. In turn, the banker says he has been warmly welcomed by the Swedish royals. Thrilled: Mr O'Neill's mother, Eva Maria O'Neill, will now have a royal daughter-in-law . 'I felt part of the family right from the very beginning,' he said. 'Madeleine's . family is very warm and we have a very good time when we all see each . other.' Indeed, while most men would be intimidated by the idea of marrying a princess - Mr O'Neill's family is no stranger to royal connections. His . German mother, Eva, is a former girlfriend of Prince .

Charles . and Eva apparently met at a polo match and started an affair in 1986, . when his marriage to Princess Diana was starting to break down. One . anecdote claimed that the couple were nearly caught in flagrante by . Diana herself when she walked in to the changing room at the Guard's .

St James's Palace . denied that the Prince had had a romantic relationship with Eva, while . she told the Mail that she invited him to Salzburg 'because I know he is . a classical music lover'. Greeted with a kiss: Prince Charles and Mr O'Neill's mother, Eva, pictured at the Amadeus weekend Mozart festival in Salzburg, Austria, in 2003, are old flames, and are believed to still be friends . But while Eva may never have become a royal bride herself, her own marital history has hardly been uneventful. Her . first husband was Wolfgang Schoeller, the German honorary consul to . Indonesia, before she left him for an American cement magnate. She then married Paul O'Neill, Chris's father, who was a leading banker well-known on the New York Stock Exchange. Love rivals: A friend of Eva O'Neill told the Mail that she stole one of her husbands from Elizabeth Taylor, pictured here circa 1953 . A friend of Eva told the Mail that she stole one of her husbands from legendary screen siren Elizabeth Taylor. He . had apparently been dating the Hollywood icon and the two looked like . they were headed to the altar, before Eva ended up joining a two-week . cruise party he had organised with friends. The two hit it off so well that by the time the cruise was over they were engaged, and he stood Liz up at their next meeting. These . days Eva concentrates on hosting lavish parties in Salzburg and . elsewhere, which are attended by royals and aristocrats from across . Europe. Eva issued a statement, released via the Swedish royal court, saying: 'I look forward to welcoming Princess Madeleine, who I am very fond of, into our family. I wish them both all possible happiness.' Madeleine, who lives in New York and works for the World Childhood Foundation, a nonprofit founded by her mother, said the wedding would take place in Sweden next summer, and that more details would be released later. It is likely that the couple will marry in Stockholm Cathedral where Madeleine's elder sister, Crown Princess . Victoria married her former fitness trainer Daniel Westling in a lavish . ceremony attended by over 1,000 guests. Crown Princess Victoria gave birth to a baby, Princess Estelle, . this year, and Mr O'Neill accompanied Madeleine to Estelle's baptism ceremony . in May - a significant indicator of the proposal to come, as partners of royals . are usually not invited to such occasions unless they are officially . engaged. Old flame: Mr O'Neill previously dated lingerie model Maryam Abdullina, pictured together here in 2008 . Madeline has not always been so lucky in love however. Though she has been linked to some of . the world's most eligible bachelors, including Greek playboy Stavros .

Lawyer Jonas Bergstrom, who she dated for eight years, is said to have enjoyed a liaison with a 21-year-old at a ski resort. Shortly after the break-up, Madeline moved to New York, taking refuge on the Upper East Side. Rumours of a romance with Mr O'Neill, . who was born in London and holds dual American and British citizenship, . first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were seen together at the . Central Park Boathouse. A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.' Madeleine says she and her new fiancé were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time. 'I . appreciate Chris for his warmth and his humor,' she said. 'He has a . very big heart and he manages to make everyone in his presence feel . good. Christopher is a very thoughtful and generous person. Mr O'Neill, however, says that 'from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine.' Mr . O'Neill, who previously dated lingerie model Maryam Abdullina, studied at a boarding school in St Gallen, Switzerland, and holds a . bachelor's degree in international relations from Boston University and a . master's degree from Columbia Business School in New York. He now works as a partner and head of research at Noster Capital, a . hedge fund with offices in London and New York. His interests include .

Boris Johnson earned just under £900,000 in freelance earnings on top of his salary as London’s Mayor during his first three years in office, it emerged yesterday. He earned £363,000 from freelance work in the first year after he was elected  in 2008. Over the four years to April 2011 he earned £1.7million, including his mayoral salary for the last three years of that period. 'Liar': Mr Johnson, right, has accused Mr Livingstone of concealing the fact he avoided tax by channelling media earnings through a private company . In the last 12 months Mr Johnson earned an extra £339,625 – paying £214,000 in tax – on top of his £143,911 salary. The Conservative Mayor earns £250,000 a year from a column in a national newspaper. A Labour source asked: ‘How can a mayor have a second job? Even David Cameron said his Cabinet ministers should not have outside interests.’ The figures were revealed as Ken Livingstone was accused of paying a lower rate of income tax than a cleaner at London’s City Hall after he refused to release full details of his tax affairs. Labour’s candidate for Mayor had joined his main rivals on Wednesday in promising to publish his entire personal tax details. But although he published some figures yesterday, Mr Livingstone said he would give full details only if other candidates agreed to disclose information concerning their spouses and partners. Mr Livingstone, who is fighting to win back the job he lost to Mr Johnson in 2008, has come under fire for channelling earnings through a company so that they are liable for corporation rather than income tax. Open book: Lib Dem candidate Brian Paddick joined Mr Johnson in revealing his income, while Mr Livingstone initially refused . During a radio debate earlier this week a furious Mr Johnson accused Mr Livingstone of telling the ‘bare-faced’ lie that he has also avoided tax by channelling his media earnings through a private company. When they later came face to face in a lift Mr Johnson reportedly called him a ‘f****** liar. On BBC2’s Newsnight on Wednesday he refused to apologise, while Mr Livingstone said all candidates should be prepared to set out their earnings over a four-year period. He said: ‘I’m happy to publish details of everything I’ve earned in the last four years. Are you going to do the same? – and was met with an immediate ‘yes’ from Mr Johnson. While Mr Johnson and Lib Dem candidate Brian Paddick published their tax details yesterday morning, Mr Livingstone initially refused. He then published partial details which included the tax he pays in a personal capacity, but not that paid through his private company Silveta Ltd. The partial information, which was not signed off by an accountant, showed that in 2010/11 he paid £22,691 in income tax and £11,970 in corporation tax. Mr Livingstone said that was an effective tax rate of 35 per cent on ‘total income’ of £94,568 in that year. But Matthew Hancock, a Tory MP and former adviser to George Osborne, said the effective income tax rate was in fact 14.5 per cent, if the total amount of income channelled through Silveta – more than £200,000 – is taken into account. He said: ‘By funnelling his earnings in this way, Mr Livingstone has been paying tax at just 14.5 per cent – lower than a City Hall cleaner.’ Brian Paddick, whose income is mainly a £63,000 police pension, earned £334,146 in three years to April 2011 and paid £100,693 in income tax.","Conservative Mayor earns £250,000 a year from a column in a national newspaper .

It was credited with fanning the flames of unrest across the Arab world as citizens took to the streets in protest and decades-old regimes fell. It helped co-ordinate the Occupy movement that swept across the globe, and was blamed for playing a key part in last year's devastating riots in London. But Twitter's role as the modern bastion of free speech is now at risk as the firm moves forward with an aggressive expansion strategy to grow from 100 million to 1 billion regular users. Today the firm revealed it planned to censor messages on a country-by-country basis. Before, when Twitter erased a tweet it . disappeared throughout the world. Changes: Twitter's role as the modern bastion of free speech is now at risk as the fledgling firm moves forward with an aggressive expansion strategy . Uprising: Twitter was credited with the change of regime in Egypt last year, where the site was used to co-ordinate protests . Now, a tweet containing content . breaking a law in one country can be taken down there and still be seen . elsewhere. So people outside the country will be able to view what is . being tweeted. But, crucially, groups within the state will not be . able to co-ordinate protests, as they did in the Arab Spring. The plans have sparked . fears Twitter will jump into bed with tyrannical governments to 'work . with' on blocking 'offensive' messages in that country. And they are a radical change for Twitter who, only 12 months ago, underscored its commitment to freedom of speech in a blog post. Burning down: Twitter was also blamed, in part, for the co-ordination of the London 2011 riots. But, it was also used to track down several looters, who posted pictures of their ill-gotten gains online . Under the headline The Tweets Must Flow, . it said in January 2011 that, while it did not always agree with the . things people choose to tweet, 'we must keep the information flowing . irrespective of any view we may have about the content'. The move is critical, said the San . Francisco company, to broadening its audience by expanding into other . countries and to ultimately making more money. Twitter explained its policy change on its blog by saying: . 'As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. 'Some differ so much from our ideas that we will not be able to exist there. Others are similar but, for historical or cultural reasons, restrict certain types of content, such as France or Germany, which ban pro-Nazi content. 'Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries’ limits was to remove content globally. 'Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country - while keeping it available in the rest of the world. We have also built in a way to communicate transparently to users when content is withheld, and why. 'We haven’t yet used this ability, but if and when we are required to withhold a Tweet in a specific country, we will attempt to let the user know, and we will clearly mark when the content has been withheld.' 'As part of that transparency, we’ve expanded our partnership with Chilling Effects to share this new page, http://chillingeffects.org/twitter, which makes it easier to find notices related to Twitter.' But . it has sparked outrage across the world, with Twitter . users themselves taking to the site to vent their anger. Many have . signed an open letter demanding its cancellation. But Twitter sees the censorship tool . as a way to ensure individual tweets remain available to as many people . as possible while it navigates a gauntlet of different laws around the . world. The blocking tool is designed to comply with local laws, such as bans on pro-Nazi content in Germany, it said. Twitter will post a censorship notice whenever a tweet is removed. Any user, it is believed, will be able to report an offensive message. This obviously includes governments and big businesses. It is a similar tactic to what search engine Google has been doing for several years when a law in a country where its service operates requires a search result to be removed. Like Google, Twitter also plans to the share the removal requests it receives from governments, companies and individuals at the chillingeffects.org website. The similarity to Google's policy is not coincidental. Twitter's general counsel is Alexander Macgillivray, who helped Google draw up its censorship policies while he was working at that company. 'One of our core values as a company is to defend and respect each user's voice,' Twitter wrote in a blog post yesterday. 'We try to keep content up wherever and whenever we can, and we will be transparent with users when we can't. The tweets must continue to flow.' Twitter is tweaking its approach now that its nearly six-year-old service has established itself as one of the world's most powerful megaphones. Blocked: Twitter said the new tool is designed to comply with local laws, such as bans on pro-Nazi content in Germany . Daisy chains of tweets already have . played instrumental roles in political protests throughout the world, . most notably in the uprising that overthrew Egypt's government a year . ago. Gossip spread on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter would be exempt from any new regulations of the media, Lord Justice Leveson suggested yesterday. The chairman of the inquiry into press standards had earlier said his recommendations would not just cover print but also news and entertainment websites. He said concerns had been raised about showbusiness websites, which served to 'underline why the rules have to cover everybody' but suggested exceptions. He said: 'I might see a distinction between Facebook where one person is communicating with friends or Twitter, and organisations in the business of selling themselves by reference to news or information. 'That's the difference between the pub chatter, and that which the state has an interest in seeing is conducted on a level playing field.' It is a role that . Twitter has embraced, but the company came up with the new filtering . technology in recognition that it will likely be forced to censor more . tweets as it pursues an ambitious agenda. Reaching . the goal of one billion users will require expanding into more . countries. It will mean Twitter will be more likely to have to submit . to laws that run counter to the free-expression protections guaranteed . under the First Amendment in the U.S. If Twitter defies a law in a country where it has employees, those people could be arrested. That is one reason Twitter is unlikely to try to enter China, where its service is currently blocked. Google for several years agreed to censor its search results in China to gain better access to the country's vast population. But it stopped that practice two years after engaging in a high-profile showdown with Chain's government. Google now routes its Chinese search results through Hong Kong, where the censorship rules are less restrictive. In a blog post yesterday Twitter said it had not yet used its ability to wipe out tweets in an individual country. All the tweets it has previously censored were wiped out throughout the world. Most of those included links to child pornography.","Twitter to start blocking 'offensive' messages .

"By . Paul Scott . PUBLISHED: . 19:29 EST, 28 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:29 EST, 28 September 2012 . There is something vaguely disconcerting about the sight of Adrian Chiles with a smile playing on his pudgy lips, not least because he usually bears such a strong resemblance to a lugubrious Toby jug. Yet there is no doubt that the perennially gloomy TV presenter has plenty to be jovial about at the moment — this week the 45-year-old was photographed canoodling with his girlfriend, comedienne Catherine Tate. He and Miss Tate, 44, were kissing and cuddling like lovestruck teenagers in a park in Santa Monica, California, she sporting a slouchy, tartan shirt-dress, while he wore a pair of faded cargo shorts of the type that might constitute warm weather attire on any British building site. New couple: Perennially gloomy TV presenter Adrian Chiles, 45, has plenty to be jovial about at the moment after being photographed canoodling with his girlfriend, comedienne Catherine Tate, 44 . The fact that the Chiles-Tate liaison is already nearly a year old apparently means they’re well past the stage where they’re dressing up to the nines for each other. But what they lack in sartorial punch, they certainly make up for in easy togetherness. Clearly, it is not an interest in fashion that unites the pair. In fact, surprisingly, they have bonded over a mutual and deep faith in God. ‘They are both devoutly religious,’ a friend and colleague of Worcestershire-born Chiles told the Mail this week. ‘I’m pretty sure they have also gone to church together from time to time, and they pray together. ‘It’s not something either of them really talks about, but their faith is very important. They’re not happy-clappy or evangelical, they just share a love of God.’ Looking at them, it is certainly hard to imagine a more content-looking couple. One Los Angeles-based Briton, who saw the couple out in the city this week, told me: ‘They were window shopping in the sunshine, but every time they stopped, or waited to cross the road, he had his hand on her stomach like an expectant father would. ‘Maybe it’s that they are so comfortable with each other and he’s just the tactile type, but my immediate thought was: “I wonder if she’s pregnant?” ’ Whatever the case, Miss Tate’s relationship with Chiles is progressing apace, to the extent that in the summer he flew his lover out to Poland, from where he was presenting ITV’s coverage of the Euro 2012 football tournament, and, apparently, took her on a ‘date’ to the Auschwitz death camp. So what is the story behind their spiritual connection? In love: Mr Chiles and Miss Tate were kissing and cuddling like lovestruck teenagers in a park in Santa Monica, California, she sporting a slouchy, tartan shirt-dress, while he wore a pair of faded cargo shorts . Chiles, who was brought up in the Anglican church but converted to Catholicism five years ago, is understood to have introduced convent school-educated Miss Tate to a select group of his religious mentors over the past year. Key figures in his life include Father Ben O’Rourke, an Augustinian Friar who lives at Clare Priory in Suffolk, and John Maguire, a television director and, like Chiles, an avid West Bromwich Albion fan, who acted as his ‘sponsor’ during his conversion. Understandably, both men are protective of their protege. 'It’s not something either of them really talks about, but their faith is very important. They’re not happy-clappy or evangelical, they just share a love of God' Friend and colleague of Adrian Chiles . ‘I couldn’t say anything without talking to Adrian about it first,’ Mr Maguire told me this week. However, other friends admit that Chiles and Miss Tate — famous for her catchphrase ‘Am I bovvered?’ — are uncannily similar. Both confess to being natural-born worriers and pessimists, and both have seen long-term relationships founder — all of which makes their public display of affection all the more endearing. Miss Tate is understood to be renting a house close to the Pacific in LA, where she is filming the U.S. version of The Office. Sources in Hollywood say she has been commuting between London and the programme’s set since early May. After appearing on-and-off in the show as socially inept Briton Nellie Bertram for the past 18 months, Miss Tate plays a much bigger part in the current series, which began airing last week in the States. She has become something of a regular fixture in the starry  enclave of Santa Monica, but, as a  non-drinker, she avoids the British-style pubs where LA-based expat actors congregate. Happy couple: Rumours that Miss Tate, 44, and Mr Chiles, 45, were dating first emerged a year ago . Rumours that she and Chiles were dating first emerged a year ago. And in July this year Miss Tate, who has a nine-year-old daughter, Erin, with her ex-partner, was photographed on the back of Chiles’s motorbike in London, wearing  knee-high boots. But their nascent love affair was dealt what might have been a terminal blow by the arrival on the scene at the end of last summer of Take That’s Jason Orange. Catherine and the handsome 42-year-old singer met when she played him in a spoof version of the band for Comic Relief in March last year. 'They were window shopping in the sunshine, but every time they stopped, or waited to cross the road, he had his hand on her stomach like an expectant father would' Los Angeles-based Briton, who saw the couple in the city this week . When she and Jason were introduced during the filming of the sketch, people on the set at the time say, she confidently asked the lantern-jawed singer for his number. Meanwhile, members of Jason’s inner circle told me this week that Little Britain comic David Walliams acted as matchmaker between the two after Miss Tate and Jason went to cheer him on when he swam the Thames for charity last year. But they made an unlikely couple — a view shared by countless  Take That fans who went on internet forums to accuse Miss Tate in unflattering terms of punching above her weight. Perhaps unsurprisingly, her relationship with the pop star cooled around Christmas, when she stayed at home and Jason went off to detox at a Thai spa famous for its colonic irrigation and yoga in Koh Samui. With Jason off the scene, Chiles made a sudden re-emergence in  the life of the often-troubled  comedy star. Born Catherine Ford on the Brunswick Centre council estate in London’s Bloomsbury, she never knew her father, who split from  her mother, Josephine, before she was born. Bullied for having ginger hair, Catherine was afflicted as a child by a strange obsessive-compulsive disorder linked to the letters of the alphabet. One symptom meant she was convinced something terrible would happen if she left her jumper on the floor, because it began with the same letter as her mother’s name. All smiles: Surprisingly, Mr Chiles and Miss Tate have bonded over a mutual and deep faith in God . After attending the Catholic Notre Dame school in Southwark, South London, she won a place at Central School of Speech and Drama and took a string of bit parts before being spotted performing at the Edinburgh Fringe by a casting director. A role in the sitcom Wild West, with Dawn French, followed, before she was given her own BBC2 show in 2004. But even as she was filming the first series of The Catherine Tate Show, she was succumbing to the trauma of acute postnatal depression following the birth of her daughter. Her then partner, Twig Clark, from whom she split last summer, gave up work as a stage manager to help her cope with the baby. Clark now has a flat around the corner from the £800,000 mews house where Catherine and Erin live in East Sheen, West London. Friends says the split has been amicable. Clark is regularly seen arriving in the morning to do the school run, and Erin often stays overnight with her father. Catherine’s career success has done little to lift the impression the comedienne gives of being shrouded by a pall of melancholy and angst. Until recently, she fretted that Erin would choke on her breakfast cereal while she was away filming, and admits to suffering panic attacks, which she has sought to dispel with a rather obsessive interest in, among other things, astrology and the alignment of the planets. ‘I’m an incredibly negative person,’ she says. ‘I’ve realised I need a gnawing, nagging, anxious doubt when I wake at 4am.’ Which is where, one imagines, the overcast Adrian Chiles comes in. After all, he has made a career of his distinctly downbeat demeanour. He married Jane Garvey, now a presenter of Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, in 1998, but they divorced three years ago on the grounds of his unreasonable behaviour. They have two daughters, Evelyn, 12, and nine-year-old Sian. Adrian did a disastrous stint with his former One Show co-host Christine Bleakley on ITV’s Daybreak. Their reunion in September 2010 lasted until December last year, when they were axed as ratings tumbled. There had long been rumours about the nature of Chiles’s relationship with Miss Bleakley, which was warm and affectionate and involved after-work curries at his West London flat. But their friendship cooled when Ulster-born Christine began dating Chelsea and England footballer Frank Lampard three years ago. Judging by how things looked this week, however, it would seem that Chiles’s relationship with Miss Tate is hotting up very nicely.","Adrian Chiles, 45, and Catherine Tate, 44, were pictured in California .

An ex-Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader who was convicted of having sex with an underage student was all smiles as she arrived at court today for her defamation case against thedirty.com. Jurors in Covington, Kentucky, heard new details of text messages between Sarah Jones, 27, and the then-17-year-old boy she admitted sleeping with as part of her $11 million lawsuit against the gossip website. Jones, the teen's former teacher, texted him that it was love at first sight when he walked into her freshman English classroom. Smiles: Sarah Jones, pictured, was all smiles as she arrived at court for her defamation case on Tuesday . She also said in the text message that she knew they would be together one day, according to WLWT.com. Jones was convicted three months ago of having sex with the former student. She and the young man, who is now 18, are understood to still be in a relationship. Jones emerged from her car and walked, grinning, towards a man wearing a hooded sweater, though it is unclear whether this was her younger lover as his face was obscured. The woman is suing the Scottsdale, Arizona-based gossip website and its owner over lewd comments made about her online long before any accusations involving the teenager surfaced. The trial over the lawsuit began today with jury selection. It's expected to last less than a week. Jones . is seeking $11 million in damages, accusing thedirty.com and its owner, . Hooman Karamian, of defamation and invasion of privacy. Karamian, who goes by the name Nik Richie and lives in Orange County, California, has been posting racy photos and biting comments for years on the website, mostly picking apart a woman's looks. Among some of his lines: 'There is a line on her chin that bothers me', 'her hips exceed her shoulders', and 'her arms are blotchy'. Convicted: Jones, pictured, was convicted three months ago of having sex with the former student . Texts: Jurors in Covington, Kentucky, today heard new details of text messages between Sarah Jones, pictured, and the then 17-year-old boy . Particularly unappealing women get nicknames like 'Leper' and 'Chewbacca'. The photos that Richie posts are sometimes submitted by the women themselves seeking Richie's opinion, but more often they are posted by people who want to gossip about someone online. In Jones' case, Richie posted a photo of her on December 7, 2009. The post, submitted by someone who knows her, called her a 'dirty Bengals cheerleader'. It claimed that her ex-boyfriend contracted chlamydia and gonorrhea after cheating on her with more than 50 women, and that he likely gave it to Jones. TV star: Former Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader, Sarah Jones, pictured, who carried out a sordid affair with one of her 17-year-old high school students is set to get her own reality TV show . Richie, a 33-year-old married father . of a one-year-old girl, said the only thing he wrote about Jones was, . 'Why are all high school teachers freaks in the sack?' 'It's . sad that I will be sitting in a courtroom in front of a jury who will . decide how many millions of dollars I need to pay a convicted criminal . who had sex with an underage boy if I lose,' Richie told RadarOnline.com. 'Sarah Jones has lied to the world over and over again. Nobody can tell when she is telling the truth. Even her mother told Dateline how Sarah is an amazing actress,' Richie said. 'I feel like I'm being extorted by Sarah Jones and her lawyers. 'This just defines who her true character is and how she manipulates people into believing that she is someone she is not.'She got off scott free,' he said. 'If she was a male teacher she would be in jail right now. There is a double standard and that's not fair.' If Jones' lawsuit succeeds and is awarded a large sum of money, other websites including Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Amazon could be bombarded with lawsuits over material posted by their users. 'It opens the floodgates,' said Richie's Phoenix-area lawyer, David Gingras, who has successfully argued dozens of similar cases across the country. 'It would basically destroy the ability of websites like Facebook that allow users to post comments. ... Once you strip away their immunity, once you make it conditional, you open the door to allow them to get sued.' Gingras said those websites and Richie's are clearly protected under the federal Communications Decency Act. Passed in 1995 by Congress, the law was designed in part to provide immunity to website publishers from liability for content that comes from third parties. Happy: The couple are now free to talk openly about their relationship after Sarah Jones, center, pleaded guilty to having sex with Cody York, left, when he was 17 and her student . Jones' attorney, Eric Deters, said Richie could be responsible for the entire post involving his client because he hasn't said who submitted it and will argue that the Communications Decency Act doesn't protect thedirty.com. 'Unlike social media sites such as Facebook or YouTube that allow someone to put up something and they don't comment about it, Nik Richie personally acts as the editor in determining what goes up,' he said. 'It's nothing more than an electronic newspaper that peddles smut.' Richie, who has been sued 17 times over his posts, defends the site as a form of entertainment, created to be a sort-of TMZ for non-celebrities who crave attention or present themselves as perfect. 'The site was created to make people laugh and give them an escape from their job and see people they know, not Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan and the same regurgitated celebrity stuff, but the pseudo-celebrities in their town, who go out to the clubs, the popular kids,' he said. 'It's not intended to harm people.' Gingras said nearly all 17 lawsuits were settled after Richie agreed to take down a given post; he lost only one because a business partner didn't fight it. As for the 'freak in the sack' comment, Gingras said he can argue that it's the truth. Clueless: Nathan Wilburn said he had no idea his wife was cheating on him during his short-lived marriage but as one of the cheerleaders for the Cincinnati Bengals she had ample opportunity to be away from home . To do that, he'll draw on text messages Jones exchanged with the student. The messages are under a court seal, but Gingras has access to them as part of the lawsuit. 'She testified under oath that she was not a freak in the sack, but anyone who reads these text messages would not agree with that conclusion. They're extremely, extremely graphic,' he said. 'Based on the contents of the messages, she acknowledged that she was, quote, ""A freak in the sack"".' Jones admitted in court to having sex with the student in February 2011, when she was 26. The teen had been in Jones' freshman English class in 2008, and she was his peer tutor in 2010 and 2011 before he graduated last year, according to a plea agreement signed by Jones — a move that allowed her to avoid jail time. The day after, Jones and the student sat down with NBC's Dateline and said they were still in a relationship, in love and didn't care what other people thought. Richie's post about Jones came more than two years before her relationship with the student, and Deters argues that they caused her severe emotional distress and prompted her to quit her teaching job. Jones resigned as a teacher at Dixie Heights and from the Bengals cheer squad in late 2011 after four years with both jobs. Deters said at the time that Jones had done nothing wrong and stepped down because a rumor that she had become involved with a student became too much. It was reported last year that she was set to get her own reality show after the creators of Jersey Shore, 495 Productions, reportedly approached the Kentucky woman about the program. She said of their relationship: 'The truth will set you free. The stress fell off of me when I didn't have to hide anymore.

When I read Sharon Osbourne recently chose to have both her healthy breasts removed, it took me back to the decision I made 12 years ago to have the same operation. On the surface, everything in my life looked rosy. I was in my late 30s, working as a PA in Leeds and living with my husband, Stephen, a printer, and raising our beloved son, Josh. But inside I was a walking health time bomb. I was utterly convinced I was living on borrowed time, because my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother had all been diagnosed with cancer in their ovaries or breasts at the age of 52. Each of them had died as a result. Every time I looked at the little boy I had given birth to in 1995, I shuddered to think I might not be here to see him grow up and become a father himself. As time passed, the advice my dear mother Joan had given to me soon after she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1989 began to dominate my thoughts. Over and again, she had begged me to get my ovaries removed. A brave and indomitable woman, she lived for six years instead of the six months predicted by doctors at diagnosis. And, as she lay on her deathbed, her concern, as ever, was only for me. ‘Tracey,’ she pleaded. ‘Please don’t keep your ovaries.’ As she was the third generation to be diagnosed at exactly the age of 52, she was convinced cancer ran in our family. In 1994, two years before she died, as news about the BRCA1 gene (which gives a much increased cancer risk) emerged, she and I went for tests with a geneticist. Mum knew any breakthroughs doctors found would not alter her own fate, but she hoped and prayed they would help me and, ultimately, save my life. We went to St James’s University Hospital, Leeds, for a discussion about genetic testing. Scientists were very close to identifying the gene but were not quite there yet. Tracey pictured at home in 2002 . Mum gave samples of her blood to be used in the future — we all knew she would be dead by the time the gene had been pinpointed. Ten months after her death on Boxing Day, 1996, I received a letter from the hospital saying Mum had tested positive for the BRCA1 gene and that I could be tested if I so wished. They called me in April 1998 and I was tested for the first time. As I nervously faced the geneticist at Jimmy’s, he told me what I instinctively already knew — that at the age of 38 I had a 60 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer and an 85 per cent chance of breast cancer. If you have the gene and the familial link, then you have an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. Tracey pictured on her web page . My grandmother had breast cancer first and ovarian as a secondary. The latter is known as the silent killer, as it is usually too advanced before any major symptoms — such as a bloated stomach — are obvious. I did not have too many problems accepting that I needed to have a full hysterectomy. This disease had killed my mother and I was glad to get rid of the shadow of death which was hanging over me. The alternative of undergoing constant monitoring did not appeal to me at all. Even though the odds on my getting breast cancer were higher, I chose to have my ovaries out in August 1998, probably because it had killed so many women in my family. I felt incredibly relieved afterwards — as if I had guaranteed my future. But as my 40th birthday approached in March 2000, I had to address the issue of a mastectomy. I’d tried to shut my mind off from dealing with it — but I had no choice. Even though doctors had never insisted I should have my breasts removed, the statistics spoke for themselves. Keeping my breasts would be hugely high risk. It was like playing a lottery of life or death and the odds on surviving without an operation were just too slim. Still, the prospect of having two healthy breasts amputated was utterly agonising. I had always taken care of my appearance, enjoying running and keeping fit. Having my breasts removed seemed to equate with losing my femininity. It was hard to come to terms with the fact that while I looked so fit on the outside, I could have been carrying a killer on the inside, but I couldn’t ignore the bleak statistics, my family history — or my young son then aged just five. I did not want him to grow up without a mum or see me suffer as I had my own mother. I wanted to see Josh grow up, and to enjoy his grandchildren. And I am sure Sharon Osbourne must have been thinking the same thoughts about her own family when she opted to have both her breasts removed. Tracey and son Josh pictured in 1999 when he was aged just four . I also wanted to live beyond my 50s — and owed it to my family to do it for them. In July 2000, three months after my 40th birthday, I had the four-hour operation at Manchester’s Withington Hospital. After the surgery, I immediately had implants fitted so I wouldn’t look too different. I told Josh that I was having the operation so that I wouldn’t get ill in the future. Tracey pictured with her son Josh now . Stephen was with me as I was treated, but the whole trauma put immense pressure on our marriage and, a year to the date of my mastectomy, we split up. Stephen, who is 12 years younger than me, had clearly been very scared and I don’t think he had the maturity to deal with what was happening. I felt let down by Stephen, which made it harder to recover. He did his best within his capabilities, but I felt rejected when he wouldn’t look at my new breasts. That was extremely difficult to deal with and knocked my confidence terribly, . Slowly, I began rebuilding my life and self-esteem. I have, over the years, had several relationships. One or two men were uncomfortable with my breasts, so I didn’t pursue the relationships. I am now totally confident showing my body because it makes me realise that I have defied death. As my 40s progressed, I made major changes to my life — swapping my office job to train as a hypnotherapist and inspirational speaker. At the age of 48, I even started to run marathons. I am now 52, the same age when my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother died or were diagnosed with cancer. I fleetingly think about that, but I focus on living. I hope by undergoing the radical surgeries, I have fulfilled my promises to my family — and it also means their deaths were not in vain. What a gift that is to me — and to Josh — who is now studying sports coaching at colleges.

Traditionally, mother and daughter would share fashion and style tips, but according to the latest research, it is sons that mothers are turning to for advice. In the age of the metrosexual male, where the beauty and fashion boundaries between men and women are increasingly blurring, it seems young adult men aren’t just conscious of their own appearance with one in four now admitting to giving their mother style advice. And according to the research almost a third of mothers trust the fashion advice of their son more than their daughter. It is the classy and demure Helen Mirren that sons would most like their mothers to emulate the style of, but steer clear of Nancy Dell'Olio they warn . Perhaps that’s because 78 per cent of mothers say they are more likely to get an honest opinion from a style conscious son. When it comes to celebrity inspiration, sons would most like to see their mothers dress like Oscar winning actress Dame Helen Mirren, followed by Loose Women presenter Carol Vorderman. The look they are least likely to favour is that of Italian celebrity Nancy Dell’Olio who is well-known for her vampish, provocative and revealing outfits. The ‘Don’t do a Dell’Olio, Mum’ message is reflected in the style choices sons say are a fashion no-no. Carol Vorderman and Fern Britton were also voted high in the style stakes by savvy sons . Half of sons say they would express an opinion if they felt their mother was wearing something inappropriate with fishnet tights the biggest offender (51 per cent), followed by low-cut tops (50 per cent), leather trousers (49 per cent), thigh high boots (39 per cent) and shell suits (28 per cent). Julie Donnelly, Head of Womenswear Buying at online fashion retailer isme.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'The idea of a woman turning to her son for fashion advice may seem to some a little unorthodox. 'However, many younger British men are now more relaxed talking about fashion and style. 'Mums value an honest and informed opinion on size, shape and what look to go for, whilst also getting a confidence boost, before leaving the front door.'

Children born to overweight mothers face a higher risk of being fat themselves – but breastfeeding can help offset the effect, a study has shown. Being overweight and smoking during pregnancy both increase the chances of a child being obese, along with being heavy at birth and rapid weight gain as a baby. But breastfeeding and the late introduction of solid foods can reduce a baby’s risk of becoming overweight by about 15 per cent, claim the researchers. Big inheritance: Children born to overweight mothers face a higher risk of being fat themselves, according to a study which could help parents make healthier choices for their babies . They say it should help new mothers make healthier choices for their babies. Stephen Weng, who undertook the study, led by Dr Sarah  Redsell, of Nottingham University’s School of Nursing, Midwifery and Physiotherapy, said complex influences affected child development, ranging from genetics  to parents’ lifestyle. He added: ‘We can speculate about how breastfeeding  mitigates the risk of obesity in childhood – it could be mixed feeding, reduced calories from breastmilk, parental attitudes, or a combination of things. ‘The research shows that breastfeeding your baby compared with never breastfeeding does have a modest benefit.’ Link: Six out of seven studies looking at infant birth weight showed a correlation between babies who were heavy at birth and obesity in later childhood . In the UK a quarter of children aged four to five and a third of ten and 11-year-olds are overweight. Evidence suggests that children who are overweight by five are more likely to become obese – so overweight it threatens their health – in adulthood. The findings come from a systematic review and analysis of data from 30 previous studies involving 200,000 people. The studies investigated factors affecting babies during their first 12 months and their potential link with childhood obesity. The . study, published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, . discovered that children who were breastfed and introduced to solid food . later  had a slightly reduced chance of becoming overweight. Children . whose mothers were overweight before pregnancy were 1.37  times more . likely to be overweight at the age of three; 4.25 times more likely to . be overweight at seven; and 2.36 times more likely to be overweight . between nine and 14 years. Six . out of seven studies looking at infant birth weight showed a . significant link between babies who were heavy at birth and obesity in . later childhood. Similarly, rapid weight gain in a . baby’s first year often led to obesity, with one study showing those who . gained the most weight were almost four times more likely to be . overweight at four. Children who were breastfed - however briefly - were 15 per cent less likely to become overweight. Giving . solid foods early may be linked to later obesity, with one study . showing formula-fed babies given solids before four months were six . times more likely to be overweight aged three than those getting them . for the first time between four and five months. Smoking . during pregnancy alone increased the risk of children being overweight . by 47.5 per cent. However, this may be because smoking is a good . indicator of other social and lifestyle characteristics, said Dr Weng. He . said the findings could be used to compile a ‘checklist’ for GPs and . health visitors to help them spot infants most at risk of becoming obese . later in life. Healthier? Breastfeeding and the late introduction of solid foods can reduce a baby's risk of becoming overweight by about 15 per cent, researchers claim .

This is the lucky baby who has finally been declared cancer-free after battling seven tumours since her birth just nine months ago. Darcie Kay, from Canterbury in Kent, was diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma  at just seven weeks old and is thought to be the only child in Britain to have been born with the rare form of cancer. She has battled through seven months of chemotherapy with a constant smile on her face, despite coming terrifyingly close to death after reacting badly to the drugs. Still smiling: Darcie Kay was diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma when she was just seven weeks old . Delighted: Mother Natalie, 30, puts Darcie's amazing recovery down to her ability to be endlessly cheerful . Terrifying operation: The little girl had an operation in August to remove the tumour from her back, along with three ribs and part of her lung . Her relieved parents Natalie, 30, and . Michael, 32, today put their cheerful daughter's remarkable recovery down to her naturally sunny disposition. They are now looking forward to celebrating her first birthday free from the fear that has affected Darcie's entire childhood so far. The little girl seemed perfectly healthy when she was born, weighing 8lbs 2oz, on January 7, but her mother soon noticed she was not feeding properly. When Darcie was just three weeks old, Mrs Kay felt a lump on her back and immediately took her to the GP. She was referred to the William Harvey Hospital in Kent, where doctors discovered a 7.5cm-long tumour growing from the tenth rib on the right-hand side of the baby's back. Shocking discovery: The tumour in the little girl's back was 7.5cm long when her mother found it three weeks into her life, before doctors spotted six more lumps in her lungs . An ultrasound showed the tumour had blood vessels and Mr and Mrs Kay were told it was cancerous. They also found a staggering six tumours in . Darcie’s lungs. Fortunately, seven gruelling months of chemotherapy killed them and shrank the tumour in her back to 2cm so that doctors could remove it. In August, she had drastic surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to remove the tumour along . with three ribs and part of her right lung. Cheerful Darcie beamed happily throughout the painful cancer-killing treatment, despite coming frighteningly close to death in May. Mother-of-four Mrs Kay said: 'Darcie has been absolutely amazing throughout her whole illness. 'People in the hospital would often comment that she hardly ever cried and she was always smiling. 'It was a real comfort for Michael and I to see her smiling - it kept us going. Darcie is such a happy little girl. Absolute trooper: In May, Darcie began bleeding from the nose after having an adverse reaction to the chemotherapy and nearly dying . 'I cannot put in to words how happy I am that Darcie has been given the all clear. Only now have I started to feel hopeful.

It is a headache familiar to many parents  - the foul smelling lotions, the painstaking grooming of figdety heads, while fending off little hands desperate for a scratch. But head lice don't just affect children, as 36-year-old Liz Slimon found out. The mother-of-two caught the itchy critters from her young son Dylan. She spent hundreds of pounds on treatments, potions . and even new bed sheets and towels as she tried to get rid of the . infestation, but to no avail. After six months of having a headful of nits Ms Slimon, of Eastbourne was so desperate to get rid of them she even considered pouring bleach on to her head. Ms Slimon of Eastbourne even considered pouring bleach on to her head to remove the lice . Ms Slimon's ordeal began when five-year-old Dylan started school last year. Head lice are tiny wingless insects that live in human hair. They are common, particularly in children. They are grey-brown in colour, the size of a pinhead when hatched and of a sesame seed when fully grown. They cannot fly, jump or swim and are spread by head-to-head contact, climbing from the hair of an infected person to the hair of someone else. A head lice infestation is not the result of dirty hair or poor hygiene. Head lice can affect all types of hair irrespective of its condition and length. Head lice only affect humans and cannot be passed on to animals or be caught from them. She said: 'He was really excited when we enrolled him in September. 'But the following January, we noticed Dylan had brought home a few of his less welcome friends, head lice. 'By the time I’d found a few on his head, it was too late. They’d managed to spread from Dylan to my daughter Elsie, my partner and even my own head was itchy with lice. 'My first thought was embarrassment and disgust. I had never had head lice as a child, so to find that the entire family had caught them left me reeling. 'My partner had heard that the best thing to do was to shave off all the hair, so standing in front of the mirror, he methodically shaved off all of his hair. 'Our son saw him doing it and wanted his hair done as well. 'Dylan looked terrible but my partner and I thought it would be the best action to take against the head lice.' Liz Slimon with son Dylan, five, and Elsie, one. The whole family were infected with nits, but Ms Slimon had the infestation for six months . But unfortunately for Ms Slimon, who also has daughter Elsie, one, there was no remedy that worked for her. Head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing, using a specially designed head lice comb . She said: 'I went through almost every lotion and potion, asking the pharmacist what the strongest pesticide treatments were, I was that desperate to be rid of them. 'I tried almost everything and for six months, we went back and forth to the pharmacist for a new treatment. I wasn’t able to have my hair cut at the hair dressers for the entire six months, because I knew they’d find the lice in my head and turn me away, it would have been so embarrassing. 'I was close to pouring a bottle of bleach on my head in a last ditch attempt, the months on end of disgust, constant itching and embarrassment had taken their toll and I was completely fed up.' Head lice can usually be effectively treated using medicated lotions or by wet combing, using a specially designed head lice comb. Wet combing can be used without medicated lotions, but needs to be done regularly and can take a long time to do thoroughly. However, no medicated treatment is 100 per cent effective. Ms Slimon finally found relief with a medicated lotion called Hedrin, and said she was disgusted - and relieved  - when she washed her families hair and watched the dead lice drop out in their hundreds. Luckily Ms Slimon has remained lice free since the summer, but she says she is well-prepared should they make a come back. She said: 'I have a bottle in my bathroom cupboard to catch any quickly if we do have the unwelcome guests come back. It will save the family shaving their heads again and I can finally have a haircut!'","Liz Slimon also spent hundreds on lotions, new bedding and towels as she tried to get rid of them .

Most of us have seen the arresting TV ad starring hard man Vinnie Jones illustrating (in his unique rough and ready manner) how best to resuscitate a cardiac arrest victim. The advert shows him foregoing mouth-to-mouth, instead to explaining how apply chest compressions. The idea is that mouth-to-mouth is often . ineffective if performed by an untrained member of the public. It also . gets in the way of the crucial chest compression’s need to keep the . victim’s heart beating. Now, Japanese researchers say chest . compressions alone really do save more lives - and can reduce the risk of brain . damage. Scroll down for video . The British Heart Foundation's advert featuring Vinnie Jones attempting to resuscitate a victim of cardiac arrest . They found that CPR . recipients were actually more likely to survive with good brain function . if they received hands-only or compression-only cardiopulmonary . resuscitation (CPR) compared with traditional CPR with chest . compressions and rescue breathing. The latest findings suggest . hands-only CPR is more effective than traditional CPR in emergency . situations, adding that not only is hands-only CPR easier to learn, it . is more comfortable to perform on a stranger. Dr Taku Iwami, a senior lecturer in the department of . preventive services at Kyoto University School of Public Health, . said: 'We would like to suggest that compression-only CPR should be the standard and conventional CPR with rescue breathing the option.' The latest findings will be welcome news to those who are put off by performing mouth-to-mouth breathing or cannot perform chest compressions and rescue breathing at the same time. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), as it is officially known, is given to patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest . The study examined 1,376 patients who suffered sudden cardiac arrest between 2005 and 2009. In each of the cases, bystanders had witnessed the cardiac arrest and provided CPR and shocks from an automatic defibrillator to the patient. Researchers said that about 37 per cent of the patients received hands-over CPR and 63 percent received traditional CPR. The study found that about a month after their cardiac arrest, about 46 per cent of patients who received only chest compressions were still alive, compared to about 40 per cent of those who received traditional CPR. Researchers also found that more than 40 per cent of people who received chest compressions alone retained good brain function, compared with 33 per cent who received compressions and rescue breathing. According to the American Heart Association, people should perform hands-over CPR by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest if they see an adult suddenly collapse. However, infants and children should receive traditional CPR that includes mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Prosecutors fear a 15-year-old girl fatally mauled by dogs outside a Mexico City park in mid-December may have been the first victim of a feral pack suspected of killing at least four other victims over the last month. Authorities began capturing dogs in the park this week after a mother and her infant boy were found dead and covered in dog bites on December 29 and the bodies of a teenage couple were found covered in fatal bites from as many as 10 dogs a week later. The four were believed to have been the only victims until the mother of 15-year-old Ana Gabriela Nataret Ramirez brought attention to their daughter to Milenio Television on late Tuesday. Death toll rising: Prosecutors say this 15-year-old girl found fatally bitten by dogs outside a Mexico City park in mid-December may have been the first victim of at least four others . Behind bars: 12 scrawny pooches sit imprisoned as they face murder charges over the death of now potentially five people in Mexico City over the last few days . Just day earlier, Mrs Ramirez's daughter died in hospital after found covered with apparent dog bites near the Cerro de la Estrella park in the poor southeastern Mexico City district of Iztapalapa on the night of December 16. It was the same park where the bodies of the 26-year-old woman and her 1-year-old child were found, as well as the teenage couple. The city prosecutor's office confirmed the details of the case on Wednesday and said it was looking into whether the 15-year-old's case was connected to the other deaths. 'An autopsy revealed that the victim had multiple injuries and puncture wounds on both arms,' the prosecutor's office said. 'After the events of recent days, the Mexico City district attorney's office broadened the investigation and confirmed the possibility of a new case of homicide resulting from wounds caused by dogs.' The 26-year-old woman, Shunashi Mendoza, was missing her left arm, and prosecutors said that both she and the boy had bled to death and been partially eaten. The teenage couple, Alejandra Ruiz, 15, . and her boyfriend Samuel Martinez, 16, also bled to death after visiting the park that afternoon. Nabbed: A puppy and another small dog caught near the site of four fatal maulings sits inside a cage at a city dog pound in Mexico City on Wednesday . Outcry: The white puppy was just one among a litter captured by police among outcry by even the victims' families on the dogs' responsibility in the attacks . Reaction: Rather than calming residents, photos of the forlorn dogs brought a wave of sympathy for the animals and upset of their potential death . On trial: The dogs' fur will be tested for blood and their stomach contents also examined to see if they are guilty of eating the victims . Injuries: One of the victims was found missing a left arm while all were found having bleed to death from their injuries . The girl called her . sister Diana Ruiz at around 7 p.m. pleading for help, the sister told . Milenio Television. Mexico City prosecutors said that due to the gravity of the wounds they believed at least 10 dogs were involved in each attack. Animal control officers swept the park for feral dogs again on Wednesday after capturing 36 animals over the last two days. Borough president Jesus Valencia told reporters at the pound where the animals are being kept that 33 dogs were captured but his office said later that 36 dogs had been caught. In addition to rabies, the dogs have been tested for traces of human blood and DNA in order to determine if they were involved in the killings. Valencia said the rabies tests had all come back negative, and the prosecutors' office said the other tests were pending. He said the borough was helping pay funeral costs for the victims and get psychological help for the relatives. Policemen practicing lassoing search a park in southeast Mexico City for stray dogs on Tuesday following the killings . Hunt: Police fan out as they search for dogs that may look like they are responsible for the murder of a woman and her toddler and two young teenagers . Hunted down by police and thrown behind . bars, the first batch of stray pooches pictured have sparked outrage and . protest by even family members of the victims who say their injuries . appeared too devastating to have been the result of dog bites. Many believe the 12 scrawny and meek dogs pictured - arrested merely because they were found nearby the crime scene - could no way be the perpetrators of the horrific killings. Forensics are testing the imprisoned dogs' fur for blood, and examining their stomach contents to determine whether they are guilty of partially eating the victims. If damning evidence is found, the wild feral dogs - including Labradors and Golden Retrievers - will be placed on death row and given a lethal injection. The photographs of the animals, released by the Mexico City's Attorney Generals Office on Monday, show just 12 of the dozens of dogs arrested in connection with the incident in recent days. Authorities captured the stray pooches as they were located near to the scene of the attacks in the capital's poor Iztapalapa district. And rather than evoke anger towards the brutal pack of wild dogs that savaged innocent victims in a park, the pictures sparked a wave of sympathy for the animals throughout Mexico. Police officers patrol a makeshift altar at the site where the bodies of Shumashi Mendoza and her daughter were found. Residents nearby started running frantically to collect their dogs when police began seizing strays on Monday night . Doubts about their involvement in the killings arose as the images showed Labradors, Golden Retrievers and a Border Collie stood timidly in their cells. The killings have set off a fierce debate about how to handle the thousands of stray dogs that roam Mexico City. In response to the killings, police searched the urban park for dogs and tested dozens of captured animals on Tuesday. The dogs live in caves and hollows in the area. But after images of the dogs were released, activists started an online campaign protesting the dogs' innocence and calling for authorities not to euthanize them. The . hashtag for the campaign became the top trending topic on Twitter in . Mexico by midday Tuesday, with some users furiously accusing the . authorities of cruelty to animals and others sarcastically calling the . dogs 'political prisoners' and mocking the fuss over the fate of the . animals. Many people re-posted the images of the dogs staring sadly from behind bars at an animal shelter. Liliana Hernandez, a psychologist and self-described street dog rights activist who lives near the park said: 'Officer, you're hunting for dogs again, but don't you already supposedly have the 25 killers in custody?' No stones unturned: A group of officers scour the wooded area in the hope of finding clues . Hernandez said many people let their dogs out during the day because their cinderblock homes are too small to keep them inside. Residents of their neighborhood started running frantically to collect their dogs when police began seizing strays Monday night, she said. The furor has forced a public response from Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera, who called for animal-rights groups to help study the guilt or innocence of the 25 dogs, and the broader effort to reduce the number of street dogs in Mexico City. He said: 'We're not taking any decision. The dogs are in a shelter and we have to check on their health,' he told reporters after a midday press conference. He also said the government would launch a new program to spay and neuter dogs, sending 25 mobile surgical units to neighborhoods where residents would be encouraged to take advantage of free sterilisation for their pets. Neighbours of the Cerro de la Estrella, a partly wooded, hilltop park, pictured, surrounded by the city's poor and populous Iztapalapa district, found the bodies . Mexico City Attorney General Rodolfo Rio held a news conference late Tuesday to reiterate the victims bled to death after dogs mauled them. 'We didn't find any other type of wound different from those produced by dogs,' Rios said. Antemio Maya, president of the Street Dog Protection association, said many people in Mexico City treat dogs as disposable, buying one for their children for Christmas and abandoning it in a park or suburb when the responsibility becomes overwhelming. Residents who live around the park and relatives of the 16-year-old high school boy who was killed refused to accept that dogs killed the youngest member of their family. 'It's not logical. I mean the dogs are small, they are domestic dogs. We don't believe what the prosecutor's office is telling us,' brother Enrique Martinez told The Associated Press. Martinez said police told the family the couple was perhaps carrying a fish fillet which alerted the dogs. He said identifying the body was a horrible experience for him and his loved ones. Fatal maulings of humans by dogs are extremely rare, but Dr. Sophia Yin, executive board member of the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, said they can happen, particularly when dogs that are used to being around people are moving in large groups, and people shout or run in fear when accosted by the animals. 'It's hard to tell people, stand completely still and relax, don't turn your back. Almost anything else you do can get the dog more excited,' Yin said. 'The more animals involved, the higher the excitement is.' A veterinarian at the Iztapalapa shelter where the 25 dogs were being held said it appeared that at least one of the captured dogs had been a pet. A poster with an image of a dog reads in Spanish: 'Feed the stray dogs, help them so they do not die. God will reward you', on a wall in the hilltop borough of Iztapalapa . Posters of missing dogs blanket a wall at the animal shelter in the hilltop borough of Iztapalapa in southeast Mexico City . 'A family came and recognized a dog but we couldn't give him to them because investigators have to decide what to do,' he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Rios said authorities will keep the trapped dogs until investigators determine whether they were involved in the attacks. He said people who can prove one of those dogs belongs to them can take the animal home. He said the rest will be put up for adoption. Tens of thousands of dogs are euthanised . each year in Mexico if they are captured by animal control officers and . not claimed within 72 hours.","Prosecutors say a 15-year-old girl was also killed by a pack of dogs in the same Mexico City park potentially rising death toll to five .

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 07:07 EST, 7 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:05 EST, 7 May 2012 . Record numbers of British couples are heading abroad to get married in a bid to avoid the spiralling costs of UK weddings, a study revealed today. More than a third of couples have booked a wedding abroad, research suggests - a 15 per cent hike compared to figures for previous years. That means as many as 80,000 Brits will shun the UK in favour of a foreign wedding over the next 12 months. Hard to beat: Couples are heading abroad to get married in their droves thanks to a combination of spiralling wedding costs in the UK and a desire for warmer weather . The average cost of a UK wedding has topped more than £18,500 and a rate rise from the Church of England will see 40 per cent added to the cost of church weddings from January next year. Yesterday Elvin Eldi, from foreign exchange provider Travelex, which conducted the research, said: 'It seems that the increasing costs associated with weddings these days, combined with the unpredictable British weather is driving many Brits to celebrate their nuptials abroad. 'With the pound at a 22 month high against the Euro and the likes of Spain and Portugal boasting less than half the average rainfall of the UK, it's little wonder we're saying 'I do' overseas.' The study asked 500 engaged couples why they will ditch UK shores to get hitched. It found three in ten said 'saving money' was one of the biggest reasons behind the trend. Being able to invite fewer guests and combining the wedding with a hen and stag do, were also cited as further helping to drive the cost of an overseas weddings down. One in three couples said a ceremony away from home was a great excuse for avoiding unwanted guests. When asked how much they thought they could save by heading abroad, 30 per cent of couples predicted that they would be up to £5,000 better off. One in three of the couples getting married abroad revealed they had deliberately cancelled UK wedding plans as a result of the increase in costs. It is expected that the number of weddings in the UK will fall to an all-time low next year. Savings: With the average UK wedding costing £18,500, couples say they can shave £5,000 from that price - and still have their dream wedding - by travelling to foreign climes . Italy was cited as the most popular destination, with more than one in five (22 per cent) of the couples questioned revealing they have booked a wedding venue in the country. It comes as a recent rise in the value of the Pound has knocked nearly nine per cent off the cost of a wedding in the Eurozone. It means that couples getting hitched in Paris, just over two hours on a train from London, could save nearly £1,000 off the cost of a £10,000 wedding in the UK. Laura Hutchinson, from Oxfordshire has moved her wedding from Buckinghamshire to the Italian Lakes. She said: 'We're getting married in May next year and had originally booked a venue in the local area. 'We'd deliberately kept it small to . keep the cost down but then we got a call from the vicar saying he was . going to have to increase the fee for getting married in our local . church. 'It was when we started looking . around for another venue that a friend said they'd recently got married . in Italy. 'We checked it out and discovered we could have a similar . wedding as in Oxfordshire, and get everyone over for less than in the . UK.' Daring to say 'I do' in the desert is also a popular choice with Brits, with 20 per cent saying they are heading to Las Vegas. The Caribbean and Hawaii were also common destinations. Amanda Statham, Travel Editor at You and Your Wedding said: 'Getting married abroad has been a popular option for British couples, particularly in Europe, ever since the onset of budget airlines, which brought hundreds of romantic destinations and the promise of good weather within easy and cheap reach.

But sadly for the young royal, his tried-and-tested tactic didn’t work the second time he went head to head with an Olympian.

He’s a great guy, and it was a . huge honor [sic] to meet him. ‘I was surprised that he challenged . me actually.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . PUBLISHED: . 12:03 EST, 11 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:40 EST, 11 July 2012 . It has been called the colour of the moment. As Prince Harry, Ed Sheeran and Rupert Grint fly the flag for natural gingers and celebrities like Christina Hendricks, Cheryl Cole and Amy Childs go red by choice, there has never been a hotter time to be ginger. As the fashion for fiery locks gathers pace, it has become an oft-repeated cliche that every celebrity that goes red by choice makes it cooler to be ginger. Effectively, they say, elective redheads are taking the stigma out of being ginger. But for natural born ginger Rebeckah Vaughan, who was forced to leave school after her life was made hell by bullies, this theory is nonsense. Bullied: Big Brother 12 contestant Rebeckah Vaughan says she was forced to leave school after being taunted for years over her ginger hair . Appearing on This Morning today, Rebeckah, 28, who appeared as a contestant on the 12th series of Big Brother, said that unless you carry the 'ginger gene', you can never really be a redhead. Real gingers have freckled, pale skin, 'albino' eyelashes and no eyebrows, she says. As such, fake redheads - with their 'normal' eyebrows, their skin that tans, and their freckle-free complexions, are doing nothing to help the millions of redheads in Britain - four per cent of the nation - who are persecuted on a daily basis for their hair colour. 'It annoys me when people say Cheryl Cole is ginger. She's not at all. She has just dyed her hair red,' Rebeckah says. 'She is not a real redhead. Cheryl Cole is beautiful – she does not have the gene – and it’s the . gene that messes you up! The eyebrows, the eyes, the freckles – . everything. 'If you don't have the gene, it's totally different.' Rebeckah, whose mother and sister both have red hair, says that from the age of seven she would come home from school in tears after being taunted by bullies. She had no defence mechanism to cope with it, because her family were collectively ashamed of their hair colour. 'I grew up in a family that was embarrassed by their ginger hair,' Rebecca says. 'My mother had red hair. And when she was pregnant with my younger sister, I would hear her say, ""Please God, let the second one escape the ginger""'. Outcast: Rebeckah hates her 'blue' skin and 'albino' eyelashes - and says even her boyfriend thinks ginger girls are 'disgusting' 'I left school for a year - I couldn't face it. I didn't want to be a target any more.' Rebeckah, who dyes her hair blonde in sessions costing thousands of pounds every year, says it's not just the colour of her hair that marks her out. She has been bullied all her life for the pale skin she says was 'blue', as well as her freckles and what she calls her 'albino' eyelashes. 'You can't ever get away from it,' she says. 'I wear so much make up. I put it on an inch thick because I don't like anyone seeing my freckles. 'I wear excessive amounts of fake tan. I have my eyelashes tinted every weekend and spend a fortune in the hairdressers when I go every three weeks. 'I've ruined my hair. I've dyed it so many times it's falling out. I have to have extensions because it is so damaged.' And Rebeckah says her sister, who is also a redhead but dyes her hair brown, tells her she'd better not leave the house without her 'albino' eyelashes thickly coated in mascara. Even more distressing is the news that Rebeckah's own boyfriend is 'disgusted' by ginger hair. 'I show him photos of myself as a child and he says I look disgusting,' she says. 'He would never go out with me if I looked like that.' As for the word 'ginger', Rebeckah considers it an insult. 'It's got nasty connotations,' she says. 'Playground connotations. It's been used for so long to bully redheads that I hate the word. But Sam Heakin, a redhead who recently launched a dating site specifically for ginger people called Top Carrots, says redheads need to stand up for themselves and embrace their hair colour. Every redhead gets teased – but that’s when you need to step up and be proud,' he says. 'If you embrace it, the bullies lay off.' 'Is it unfair that you have to fight against people over something you were born with? Yes, but children get picked on for so many things. For being a bit overweight, for being ginger. 'You need to embrace it.' Faking it: Christina Hendricks has been dyeing her hair red since she was a little girl, inspired by Anne of Green Gables, while Cheryl Cole, right, tinted her hair a pale red tone last year .","Rebeckah Vaughan says it is the 'ginger gene' that 'really messes you up'

A pair of childhood sweethearts who were inseparable during their younger years have revealed how fate brought them back together after more than 60 years apart. Brenda Loy, 82, and Fred Wilcock, 81, were best friends growing up in the village of Hoyland in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, from the ages of four to 17. And they are now enjoying their golden years together after becoming separated when Fred left for military service in 1948. Brenda Loy and Fred Wilcock were separated for 60 years when Fred joined the RAF in 1948 - but now they have been reunited and theirs has been named the perfect 'Yorkshire Love Story' by a local theatre . Their heartwarming tale has won a local theatre competition to find the 'perfect Yorkshire love story'. After being split up by Fred's military obligations, both went on to have successful, long-lasting marriages while living just 30 miles apart. But it wasn't until a chance meeting at a local hospice that they met up again. And love blossomed following the death of Fred's late wife, Dorothy, in 2010. Fred Wilcock, 81, left, and Brenda Loy, 82, right, as teenagers in the Forties . Brenda, 82, a former Boots worker who still volunteers at her local hospice, said: 'We did everything together when we were kids. 'We were both born in the small village and held hands as we walked together to the infant school down the hill. 'We played in the woods together and then, as we got older, we went to the pictures and attended local dances. He joined the local brass band and I used to go to watch him. 'We had an incredibly close relationship from infants school until our teens. He always looked after me. 'We were together so much growing up that everyone just expected that we'd end up together.' Brenda said: 'We had an incredibly close relationship from infants school until our teens - e always looked after me' Fred, 81, said: 'I wasn't one for girls when I was young. I was naive in that sense, but me and Brenda always shared a special friendship. Brenda Loy in her teenage years, when everyone thought she and Fred would end up together . 'Everybody thought we'd be a couple but events transpired to split us apart. But when we were apart I often wondered how she was.' Fred's military service began in 1948, while Brenda found herself moving away from Yorkshire to live with her sister and brother-in-law who served in the Royal Air Force. Both ended up in happy marriages. Fred married Dorothy in 1958 and went on to have two children, four grandchildren, 12 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren while Brenda married Len in 1953 and now has two children and three grandchildren. After her husband died in 1998, Brenda started working at the local St Luke's Hospice which is where she met Fred again. She said: 'One day a couple knocked on the door of the hospice. I didn't recognise the man but then he said he was Fred.' Fred joked: 'Brenda looked at me as if I'd come to clean the windows.' Brenda got to know Fred again, and his wife Dorothy, over a cup of tea before going their separate ways. But following Dorothy's passing two years ago Fred got back in touch with Brenda earlier this year. Fred said: 'I wasn't in a good way after my wife died two years ago but since meeting Brenda I'm a changed man. We have great days out and we're hoping to go on holiday next year. We have a good laugh together. 'We . have no plans to marry because I made a commitment to my wife and to me . that is sacred, but what Brenda and I have is special. 'I'll never hurt her and I'll always be there for her. I think it is fate that brought us back together all these years later.' Fred said: 'I wasn't in a good way after my wife died two years ago but since meeting Brenda I'm a changed man' Brenda still lives in Hoyland while Fred currently resides in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Brenda said: 'Eventually we arranged a weekend in Leeds and a weekend in Hoyland. We've been doing that ever since. I never thought we'd be so close again, like we were when we were young. 'We are looking forward to the next years we have together being happy ones.' Brenda entered the competition run by The Civic in Barnsley. Their win means the couple will be VIP guests at the premiere of Hans Christian Andersen's The Tin Soldier at the venue in December. Ian Morley, Theatre Programmer at The Civic, said: 'There could be only one winner. It's a fairy-tale story and we're looking forward to welcoming them as our guests for the opening.' Brenda said: ' I never thought we'd be so close again, like we were when we were young - we are looking forward to the next years we have together being happy ones' Fred and Brenda kiss under the mistletoe as they prepare for their first Christmas together, some 60 years since they were first friends .

A study has shown that believing a meal was bigger than it actually was can curb appetite. One hundred men and women were shown either a large or small bowl of soup and then given it to eat. Crucially, some soup was removed from or added to the bowl as they tucked in, without them realising it. Hungry: Forget the diet, losing weight might be as simple as thinking yourself thin . Immediately afterwards, those who ate the smaller portion felt more hungry. But after just two or three hours, the amount eaten had little effect on hunger. Instead, those who believed they had eaten the big bowl of soup felt the most satisfied. This meant that if two people had each eaten a small bowl of soup, the one that had been initially given a large portion felt fewer hunger pangs. A day later, those who had been shown the large portion also rated soup as being more satiating. The study, published in the journal PLoS ONE adds to evidence that our memory of what we have eaten plays a key role in dampening appetite. Amnesiacs, for instance, might eat three or four meals one after the other without feeling full. Bristol University researcher Jeff Brunstrom said: ‘Obesity remains a major public health concern. ‘Therefore understanding controls of energy intake should be high priority. ‘This is showing that the amount of hunger we experience between meals isn’t a simple product of the amount or type of food that we actually consumed - there is some sort of psychology involved. Professor Brunstrom has previously shown that those who are distracted while eating are hungrier afterwards. He said: ‘We have shown that if you distract someone when they eat, they have a poorer memory of that meal and also eat more at a subsequent meal. ‘Generally speaking, it’s perhaps important to have a good memory of what you have eaten. ‘One way of doing that is to make sure you don’t eat in front of the TV or computer screen.’","The study, published in the journal PLoS .

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 9 December 2011 . A new study shows exposure to stress can shorten the length of pregnancy . Mothers-to-be who are highly stressed during the second and third month of pregnancy are more at risk of giving birth prematurely and losing boy babies, say researchers. A new study shows exposure to stress can shorten the length of pregnancy, making it more likely that babies will be born early and for boys to be miscarried. It is the first time stress has been shown to affect the balance between the sexes, known as the sex ratio, which normally favours an excess in the number of boys being born. It has been described as nature's way of balancing an increased risk of premature death in young men, starting in infancy. The latest findings suggest the extra risk to boys starts even earlier – in the womb. The results come from a study investigating the effect on pregnant women of the stress caused by the 2005 Tarapaca earthquake in Chile. But US researchers claim there could be implications for pregnant women in more normally stressful situations, because the effects are independent of poverty, bad housing and poor diet. Professors Florencia Torche  and Karine Kleinhaus, of New York University, analysed birth certificates of all babies born between 2004-2006 in Chile, where there are 200,000 births a year. The magnitude of the earthquake was measured at 7.9, which is classified as ‘disastrous’. The researchers found that women who lived closest to the quake during their second and third months of pregnancy had shorter pregnancies and were at higher risk of delivering pre-term, before 37 weeks gestation. The pregnancies of women exposed to the earthquake in the second month of pregnancy were on average 1.3 days shorter than those in the unaffected areas of Chile. The pregnancies of those exposed in the third month were almost two days shorter. Normally, about six in 100 women had a pre-term birth, but among women exposed to the earthquake in the third month of pregnancy, this rose by 3.4 per cent, meaning more than nine women in 100 delivered their babies early. Researchers found that women who lived closest to the quake during their second and third months of pregnancy had shorter pregnancies . The researchers found a decline in the sex ratio among those exposed to the earthquake in the third month of 5.8 per cent, meaning fewer boy babies survived to delivery. The study is published online in the leading reproductive medicine journal Human Reproduction. Prof Kleinhaus, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Obstetrics & Gynaecology, and Environmental Medicine, said ‘Generally, there are more male than female live births. ‘The ratio of male to female births is approximately 51:49 – in other words, out of every 100 births, 51 will be boys. ‘Our findings indicate a 5.8 per cent decline in this proportion, which would translate into a ratio of 45 male births per 100 births, so that there are now more female than male births. This is a significant change for this type of measure.’ Previous research has suggested in times of stress women are more likely to miscarry boys because they grow larger than girls and require more sustenance from the mother, and they may also be less robust than females and not adapt their development to a stressful environment in the womb. Prof Torche said ‘Our findings on a decreased sex ratio support this hypothesis and suggest that stress may affect the viability of male births. She said the study provided strong evidence that stress independently affected the outcome of pregnancies, rather than being a side-effect of poor housing, poverty and bad diet. ‘In terms of implications, it is clearly unrealistic to recommend avoiding natural disasters. However, this research suggests the need to improve access to healthcare for women from the onset of pregnancy and even before conception. ‘Obviously this will not reduce the exposure to stress, but it may provide care, advice, and tools that would allow women to cope with stressful circumstances’ she added.","First time stress has been shown to affect the balance between the sexes .

What does a 53-year-old male, over-rated Eighties pop star know about morning sickness? How dare he say that, 'Kate Middleton was in the hospital, as far as I could see, for absolutely no reason'. The Smiths' frontman Morrissey, left, said no blame had been placed the Duchess of Cambridge, right, for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, an accusation Tracey Blake finds 'despicable' Does he not believe that feeling constantly nauseous and being unable to hold down food or water is quite bad for your health? Has he got a medical degree that we are unaware of and does he dispute that such a condition as hyperemesis gravidarum exists? Perhaps he'd like to try enduring chronic flu-like conditions - I imagine this pampered pop star would be calling the emergency services before you know it. Even more shockingly, he appears to be trying to blame Kate for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who put the hoax call through at the hospital where Kate was receiving treatment. This is despicable. Prince William and his pregnant wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, leave the King Edward VII hospital on 6 December . Poor Kate is in the fragile early stages of pregnancy and was forced to announce it when she fell ill and felt there would be too much speculation if she remained silent, she doesn't need idiots like Morrissey wading in with accusations that are likely to raise her stress levels even further. Let's not forget that this is man who has form for  piddling on people's bonfires. Earlier this year, while we were all caught up in Olympic pride and joy, he slammed the ‘blustering jingoism' of London 2012 and even compared the support of athletes to Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. The Manchester-born star said, 'I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. The spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand Britain.' Benedict Barboza, the widower of nurse Jacintha Saldanha - who was involved in a hoax call concerning the Duchess of Cambridge at King Edward VII hospital - wiith their children Lisha, 14, and Junal, 17 . Clearly the man has a very warped perception of the world. But it also smacks of a desperate clamoring for headlines, a conscious decision to court controversy. I am faintly proud that I have disliked him and his faux whacky, attention-grabbing efforts since his Eighties heyday.  When I was about eight years old I saw him dancing around the Top of the Pops stage with plants sticking out of his trousers - I immediately dismissed him as weirdo who wasn't worth listening to. I only hope that Kate can take a similar attitude. Read Tracey's baby blog at http://blakesmalltalkblog.dailymail.co.uk/ .

This is the tragic family picture that they will have to remember and cherish for the rest of their lives. Sisters Ashlea, Leanne and Carys Looms all have a rare genetic disease which means they are losing their sight. It means Ashlea, 25, will no longer be able to watch her four children grow up, Leanne 24, won’t be able to see her two children, and if Carys, 22, has a baby she may never see it, as the three sisters are all going blind. As each day passes their sight deteriorates further. Ashlea and Carys already can no longer drive and they struggle to work. Family: Sisters Carys (back), Ashlea (left) and Leanne Looms who all have a rare disorder effecting their sight with Ashlea's daughters Jessica, Brooke, Gracie-May and Esme and Leanne's children Oliver and Ryley . But they are determined to watch their six children grow up for as long as they possibly can. Ashlea, who has daughters Jessica, eight, Brooke, five, Grace-May, two, and newborn Esme, said: ‘At the moment there is no cure for our condition. 'We know that one day all three of us will be blind and we make the most of each day with our children and family whilst we can. ‘We just all wish that we could have our sight back, but we know that is not going to happen. We won’t be able to see our children grow up, so we cherish every moment with them.’ Sisters: Carys, Ashlea and Leanne are intent on making the most of their sight which is deteriorating because of a rare genetic disease . Brave: Although Leanne, pictured here with her two children Oliver and Ryley, is losing her sight more slowly than her sisters she is still facing the prospect of going blind . Ashlea, who lives with partner Sean . Johnson, in Radcliffe, Manchester, was the first to be diagnosed with . the condition Stargardt Disease in December 2008, when she was pregnant . with her third daughter. She said: ‘I started having spots in front of my eyes and had bad headaches. At first I thought it was due to my pregnancy, so I wasn’t worried at first, but mum insisted that I get it checked out. ‘When I was tested at the hospital they told be that I had this disease. They told me that I could lose my sight and I was absolutely devastated. All I could think of was how I was going to look after my children. ‘I had another baby on the way too - would I ever see them grow up.’ Stargardt Disease is a hereditary eye . condition which affects the central area of the retina called the . macula. There is no cure for it. Doctors . then tested her two sisters Leanne and Carys for it. The girls also . have a sister Laura, 29, and brothers Alan and Robert,  but they have a . different father so they didn’t need to be tested. Two weeks later the three sisters were given the shattering news that they all had the condition. They were going blind too. Alesha said: ‘It was devastating. We . just hugged each other and couldn’t stop crying. We were devastated that . we may not see our children grow up or get married.’ Ashlea and Carys are both now partially sighted. They can’t drive anymore, and daughter Brooke has become Ashlea’s eyes. Tragic: Ashlea with her four children, who she says have already had to learn to act as her eyes because of her sight is rapidly deteriorating .

Ashlea said: ‘I can’t see the television anymore, or read text messages on my phone, and when I take Brooke to school, she has to watch out and tell me if there are any steps infront of me. 'She has become my eyes for me, she watches out for me and makes sure I don’t bump into anything or fall.’ Leanne’s sight is better than her sisters, although hers has started to deteriorate too. They all wear special lenses to try and slow down the deterioration and are taking care of their health. Their elder sister Laura, a mother of three, said: ‘It is heartbreaking that all my sisters have this awful disease. ‘If I could have just one wish, it would be that they could all have their sight back. I wish I could have it for them. Not being able to do anything to help them is heartbreaking.' The sisters are making the most of the time that they have left with their sight, and are enjoying family holidays and days out. Ashlea added: ‘We want to create as many wonderful memories that we can, so we are doing as many things as a family all together that we can. ‘We don’t want to ever forget what our children look like, so we are taking as many photographs as we can too. ‘We want to make the most of every day that we have with them. A mother should be able to see her children grow up. We won’t, and its heartbreaking.’","Sisters Ashlea, Leanne and Carys all diagnosed with Stargardt Disease, which will leave them blind ."

A mother whose daughter suffered nappy burns had her children taken into care because social services wrongly thought she had scalded her deliberately. Natalie Tung, 25, found three-year-old Adelle with injuries after her nappy burst and leaked water-absorbing crystals on to her legs. She took her to hospital, but when doctors examined her, they called police and Miss Tung was arrested on suspicion of abusing the little girl by scalding her with hot water. Reunited: Natalie Tung with her children Daniel and Adelle who were taken into care for eight months . Adelle and her six-year-old brother . Daniel were taken into care while the false allegations were . investigated, and pregnant Miss Tung was warned she could also lose her . unborn son Kaiden, who is now six months old. The nightmare only came to an end . eight months later after an independent medical expert finally proved . Adelle’s injuries were caused by a chemical burn from the crystals in . the burst nappy. The family have now been reunited, but Miss Tung believes her children are still affected by ‘the worst time in my whole life’. The nightmare began in May last year . when full-time mother Miss Tung woke to find Adelle’s nappy had burst, . spilling chemical crystals on to her skin. Natalie said she was told doctors were fearful of missing another case 'like Baby P' Fearful: Natalie says she now panics every time she takes her children for medical check-ups . Miss Tung treated the area with . Sudocrem nappy rash cream, but when it had not healed days later, she . took Adelle to Alder Hey children’s hospital. Within hours, Miss Tung and partner Brendan Vevine, 23, were arrested. Adelle’s biological father was arrested the next day. Miss Tung said: ‘They said they were trying to protect Adelle and did not want another Baby P case. It was heartbreaking.’ Miss Tung protested her innocence, . claiming she had changed from Pampers nappies to a supermarket own-brand . which were prone to leaking and must have caused the painful burns. But social services placed her . children with their paternal grandmother, and Miss Tung’s contact with . them was restricted under her bail conditions. When the case came before Liverpool . County Court, Catherine Raraty, a specialist in burns and plastic . surgery at Alder Hey, said she believed the injury was ‘most probably a . scald’. However, Miss Tung secured a review . and an independent expert, retired forensic burns consultant Colin . Rayner, confirmed the injury was a ‘chemical burn’ due to the burst . nappy. In his report, he said the rash was a . reaction to ‘prolonged contact on a flat surface with a relatively weak . chemical . . . exacerbated by soakage due to a large amount of urine or . faeces’. Miss Tung was released from her bail . conditions last November and no charges were brought. She was finally . allowed to take her children home in January. She said: ‘We are trying to have some sort of normal life now but Daniel is still affected by it.’ A spokesman for Alder Hey children’s . hospital said: ‘Patient safety is the number one priority and we have a . legal obligation  to follow safeguarding policies and procedures.’ A spokesman for Liverpool social . services said: ‘When concerns are raised by clinicians, we have to carry . out a full and detailed investigation.’","Mother says her children are still affected by our forced separation last year .

Clare Greasly claims venison and swede are the only two foods she can stomach, because her body appears to be intolerant to everything else . A mother-of-two has been forced to eat a bizarre diet of only vension and swede after becoming intolerant to almost all foods. Clare Greasly claims these are the only two foods she can stomach, because her body appears to reject everything else she eats. The once healthy mother has lost more than four stone due to the bizarre condition - yet doctors are unable to find an answer to her problems. Mrs Greasly, from Manchester, said: 'Venison and swede are the only foods that give me the mildest reaction. I have to experiment with what I can eat, and I just about seem to be able to cope with those. 'Other than that, I'm limited to rhubarb and dried cherries.' 'I used to love my life, running the house, and looking after my teenagers, but now, I barely have the energy to do anything. 'My husband and children are worried sick about me and I have to admit, I think my days are numbered.' Her intolerance to food began back in the spring of 2011 when she started to develop abdominal pain. She said: 'I started getting awful pains in my stomach, side and abdomen so I went to the doctor. He organised to run a few tests but every time they came back normal. 'Throughout the year I had endless visits to A&E but again the doctors couldn't find anything wrong. 'Eventually I was told to forget about it and go on holiday, as though it was all in my head.' It was after her stay in hospital that she began to wonder if her eating habits could be causing the excruciating pain. Mrs Greasly said: 'Venison and swede are the only foods that give me the mildest reaction. I have to experiment with what I can eat, and I just about seem to be able to cope with those.' The 45-year-old said: 'I decided to try a gluten free diet to see if that would help. It made me feel a little better but still not completely well. 'Eventually even gluten free foods seemed to cause a bad reaction. I ate some brown rice at the beginning of the year and was in the worst pain I've ever experienced. It was horrendous. 'As the weeks went by, my intolerance became worse and worse, I was starting to wonder if there was anything I actually could eat. 'But whenever I spoke to the doctors they just told me it was impossible - I was literally laughed out of the surgery.' Mrs Greasly reached breaking point when she collapsed at home after suffering terrible pains and headaches. She said: 'I was rushed to hospital . and stayed their for four weeks. I was given millions of tests but . nothing seemed to work. I was even reacting to being fed through a tube. Despite dozens of hospital tests and her trying a gluten-free diet, doctors can find no cause for Mrs Greasly's excruciating abdominal pains when she eats most foods . 'I've had an assessment to show that I'm not making it all up, and mentally, the assessment showed that I'm fine.' The full-time mother is devastated by the change in her life in such a short period of time. She said: 'I was a bright, happy, energetic, slightly overweight lady, but now I'm a shadow of my former self. 'I used to love a good takeaway, and spent days walking through the Derbyshire Dales. The problem has caused the mother-of-two to lose more than four stone, and forced her to abandon her hobbies such as hill walking. Right: With her son Chris before she became ill . 'But now I'm all skin and bones, and my hair has started to thin. People look at me and say I have a figure to die for, but I don't want to be like this.' The only comfort the 45-year-old has managed to find is thanks to fellow sufferers of Total Food Intolerance. She said: 'The only people who seem to understand are people like me. It's like a mixture of having the worst hangover in the world, and being poisoned. You can't understand it unless you've been through it.' 'The more people that hear about Total Food Intolerance the better. I need to get the message out there. Even some of my family and friends don't believe me - I barely believe myself!

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 11:06 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:46 EST, 15 November 2012 . From stiff backs to sore joints, there’s no doubt we are a nation in pain. But exactly how much we suffer – and the effect it has on our lives – appears to vary dramatically depending on where we live. New research unveiled today has revealed . that people living in Wales find pain the most distressing, while those . living in the West Country can tolerate it the most. The survey, of 1,000 people around the . UK suffering from chronic pain, gives an insight into how the condition . blights millions of people’s lives. The survey, of 1,000 people around the UK suffering from chronic pain, gives an insight into how the condition blights millions of lives. The different colours show pain thresholds apparently vary around the country . In Manchester, for example, 50 per cent of respondents said pain affected their mobility, while 61 per cent of Southampton residents said it made them feel depressed. Joint pain is particularly common in Leeds, affecting 41 per cent of those questioned, while a third of people living in Norfolk suffer from backache. In the nearby East Midlands, 59 per cent of people reported that back pain affects their ability to do daily chores. Chronic pain is estimated to affect 10 million Britons.  The research, commissioned by Lloydspharmacy, also found that 77 per cent of those living with chronic pain have suffered for years, yet  many are not seeking professional support from GPs or pain clinics. The study also highlighted the huge impact pain has on people’s lives, with nearly half of those questioned admitting to feeling depressed as a result of their condition. Nearly 10 per cent said it had made them feel suicidal at some point. Almost half said they were not accessing regular support from their GP and over two thirds had never used a pain clinic or a support group for help. Chronic pain, such as back ache, is estimated to affect 10 million Britons . Overall, regardless of area, almost two thirds said their pain affected their mobility and 55 per cent said it kept them awake at night. The same number said they struggled to carry out everyday tasks such as shopping and cleaning. Chronic pain has become an increasingly important area for the health sector. A Royal College of General Practitioners’ announcement in 2011 identified the treatment of pain as one of its four priorities for 2011-14 – with a view to improving education, training and the patient experience. More recently Jeremy Hunt, in one of his first public addresses as Health Secretary, announced that people with long-term conditions were one of his four priorities for the NHS. Despite this, just under a fifth of respondents who had not sought support for their chronic pain cited ‘not wanting to bother healthcare professionals’ as the reason. Meanwhile, more than half said they didn’t feel anything could be done, so it was ‘better to just put up with it’. Ian Semmons, chairman of the charity Action on Pain, said: ‘Many people tell me that chronic pain is dominating their life, affecting not only their social life and family time, but even their ability to hold down a job. ‘I would actively encourage people to seek out help – you may feel that there is little hope but it shouldn’t have to be like that. By asking for support and advice you will be making a positive step towards improving your life.’ The research was commissioned to co-incide with the launch of a free, nationwide pain assessment service at Lloydspharmacy. Nitin Makadia, pharmacist and pain expert at Lloydspharmacy, said: ‘Nearly one in seven of us suffer with chronic pain in the UK yet a worrying number of people clearly feel that they have nowhere to turn for support. ‘We know that often there’s no cure for chronic pain but there are ways you can manage it better and with regular ongoing support you can make positive steps to improve your overall wellbeing.’","Chronic pain is estimated to affect 10 million Britons .

Codylily Parkin was rushed to Rotherham Hospital after she was misdiagnosed at a NHS walk-in centre . A four-year-old girl was left fighting for her life hours after medics at an NHS walk-in centre sent her home claiming she was suffering from a minor infection. In fact Codylily Parkin was suffering from a diabetic attack and had to be placed in a medically induced coma in an intensive care unit after her brain swelled dangerously. Her shocked parents say her life was saved by a quick-thinking emergency paramedic and hospital doctors at Rotherham General Hospital and Sheffield Children’s Hospital. The walk-in centre who have been criticised by two coroners over recent incidents. Mrs . Parkin said: 'We could have lost our daughter that day due to the utter . incompetence of the staff at that walk-in centre.We’re so lucky not to . be in that situation. 'Codylily . had displayed a classic array of symptoms that should have been spotted . but they weren’t and that could have proved a fatal mistake. 'Two . nurses have been suspended and I’m told that they won’t return to work . until they have received extra training, but that’s not really enough in . my eyes.' Just a few hours before her collapse . Codylily was taken by her dad parents to an NHS Wallk-in Centre in . Rotherham town centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an . insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue. Four days earlier her GP . had diagnosed vaginal thrush. Medics at the walk-in centre then diagnosed Codylily with oral thrush and she was sent back to the family home in Rotherham. Later the same day on September 15th, the little girl began suffering from confusion and vomiting and an emergency paramedic was called. Codylily's father took her to Rotherham Walk-In Centre suffering from breathing difficulties, an insatiable thirst and whitening of her tongue . As soon as the paramedic arrived he said Codylily was slipping into a diabetic coma and she was rushed to hospital suffering from severe diabetic ketoacidosis. She was placed in an induced coma before being transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital ten miles away. She returned to Rotherham Hospital two days later and was allowed home on September 20th. Codylily now faces a lifetime of insulin dependence because of the diabetes. Mrs Parkin paid: 'The paramedic said straight away ‘She’s slipping into a diabetic coma’. We need to get her to hospital. We weren’t even aware she was diabetic but we were distraught. 'I’ve been told to take it further because there have been a number of inquests carried out as a result of people being sent home with and incorrect diagnosis, and I intend to.We’re so lucky not to be in that situation. 'Throughout her treatment doctors were talking about our treatment at the Walk-in Centre.' Care UK, who operate the centre have . apologised.In a statement Sheila Roberts, from the company , said: 'We . have apologised to Codylily’s family for the distress caused to them and . acknowledged that care in this particular case fell below the normal . high standards expected at the walk-in centre. In May the centre missed an opportunity to save the life of 12 month old Lewis Mullin, pictured her with mother Jodie Conlay . 'We have conducted a full review of the circumstances surrounding Codylily’s attendance at the Rotherham walk-in centre. 'This review was triggered by the notification of Codylily’s admission to hospital and both nurses involved were immediately suspended from duty, which is normal practice for us when a clinical investigation takes place. 'The investigation included an internal audit of both nurses’ clinical performance, reviewing the consultation and written statements from the nurses involved. 'The review was underway before Mrs Parkin contacted the walk-in centre and we felt it important that the investigation was completed before replying, so that we could inform Codylily’s parents of the findings and outcomes. 'A letter has been sent to the family and steps have been taken to minimise the risk of a recurrence, including further training for both nurses.' In May Rotherham Coroner Nicola Mundy said the centre missed an opportunity to save the life of 12 month old Lewis Mullins, from Maltby, Rotherham, who was suffering from chicken pox and breathing difficulties. He was sent home and died from complications. In June staff at the centre were criticised by Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries over the death of superfit kick boxer Mark Mason,36, from St Helens. He had been unable to eat or drink for a week, had diarrhoea, could not walk unaided and went in unable to breathe. He was not referred to hospital and was found dead the next day from swine flu. After both cases the centre claimed it was improving training and communications.","'We could have lost our daughter because of the incompetent staff', says mother .

A young woman saw a mystery tiny spot on her head grow to the size of a golf ball - and discovered it was a rare cancer with only 30 cases in the world. Rhianna Thomas, 24, was told by three different doctors it was just a harmless lump on her scalp. But over the next seven months it grew to the size of a golf ball. Surgeons finally operated after Rhianna was told it was caused by a cluster of blood cells growing under her scalp. But when she returned to have the stitches out in August she was given the earth-shattering news that she had the rare bone cancer. Still smiling: Rhianna, pictured with her mother Diane, said the most important thing to her was keeping her sense of humour . The Topshop assistant from Cardiff, South Wales, first noticed the spot last Christmas. She said: 'I was washing my hair and I felt a small spot. At first I didn't think much about it but as the weeks passed I realised it was getting bigger and bigger. 'It wasn't painful just a big soft squidgy lump on my head. Soon it was the size of a golf ball. 'The doctors really didn't think it was anything to worry about - just a simple cyst to be removed.' It was only when Rhianna had an operation at Coventry University Hospital to remove it that doctors discovered it was the very rare bone cancer. 'I was told it had come back as cancerous - a rare form of Sarcoma, with only 25 to 30 cases in the world,' she wrote on her blog. Rhianna Thomas pictured before her operation . Sarcomas are rare cancers that . develop in the supporting or connective tissues of the body such as . muscle, bone, nerves, cartilage, blood vessels and fat. Rhianna underwent a life-saving operation to remove any remaining cancer cells, which involved a skin graft from her leg. Rhianna said: 'I couldn't take it in because it was such a huge shock. Not knowing what was going to happen was pretty scary. 'I had to have part of my head shaved. I loved my hair and would spend hours straightening and going to the hairdressers having it coloured. 'But I knew losing my hair was the least of my worries. After the operation my head was bandaged up for a week so I couldn't see it. 'Thankfully the operation was successful and all the cancer was removed and the doctors able to obtain a clear margin around where the cancer had been.' But the fashion marketing graduate has refused to stop smiling. She has even managed to switch jobs and now works for George, the fashion label of the Asda supermarket. She said: 'On the bright side I'm saving time not having to do my hair each morning and I haven't had any bad hair days. 'Hats have become my new best friend and I have at least 15 different ones. I am saving a fortune on going to the hairdressers too! 'I might invest in a blonde wig soon but for the moment the hats are keeping my head warm.' Rhianna is about to start chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions but doctors say her prognosis is good. A side effect of the cancer treatment can be infertility and Rhianna has been given £3,000 NHS funding to freeze nine of her eggs. She said: 'I do want children in the future and I joke that if Olly Murs is around please feel free to come and donate! Rhianna pictured after her operation. She is about to start chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions . 'The most important thing to me is keeping my sense of humour. I try to laugh a lot and stay positive.I am looking forward to Christmas and hopefully I will have a few new hats. 'I . want to travel when my treatment is over and go to America. My cancer . has put everything into perspective and makes me realise that I have to . live for today.' Rhianna's she has been inspired by her father Gareth, 58, who has successfully battled throat cancer. Rhianna's mother Diane, 54, has put her job and life on hold to look after her at her new flat in Birmingham, close to Queen Elizabeth hospital where she is having her treatment. She said: 'I wanted a flatmate but I never expected it to be my mum. She's been brilliant taking me back and for to all my hospital appointments I've started calling her Florence after Florence Nightingale.' Rhianna has started a blog about her cancer fight to keep family and friends up to date with her progress. She said: 'The feedback from it has been incredible, with many saying how inspirational and brave I am. 'If I can inspire even just one person to put lives 'stresses' into perspective, then I'll be pleased. I'm the sort of person that once I get over the initial shock of something I just get on with it.'

Britain is a nation of hoarders with the typical house filled with 3,540 pounds worth of unused clutter, a new study found. Almost two thirds of Brits say they 'dislike' the amount of junk in their home and a quarter even say it makes them 'stressed'. But many householders do nothing about it because they fear they may need their items one day or attach sentimental value to them. A third say they do not have time for a . clearout and 12 per cent feel guilty about throwing out or selling . gifts somebody else had bought. The . biggest space-wasters are old clothing which is never worn, DVDs and . VHS videos, the study by online noticeboard gumtree.com found. These are followed by shoes, kids' toys and computer games. The value of all clutter is worth a staggering £93billion nationally. One in five homes have enough unwanted items to fill an average bathroom and a similar number enough to fill an entire bedroom. But the junk is generally spread around the house, most commonly in cupboards, wardrobes, under beds and in garages or sheds. Some people even admit to keeping items in bathtubs, car boots and the fridge to hide them from view, the poll of 2,000 people found. Four in ten people say the clutter makes them feel disorganised and a third 'worry' about their home looking messy to visitors. Almost two thirds of Brits say they 'dislike' the amount of junk in their home and a quarter even say it makes them 'stressed' The type of clutter stored by men and women varies, with women typically having seven pairs of unused shoes while men have just five. However, men have an average of two old MP3 players, with 7 per cent even hoarding seven or more. Women have an average of one. Both genders keep two old mobile phones as 'spares'. Self-confessed hoarder James Evans, from Southampton, Hampshire, never throws anything away. 1. Items of clothing (12)2. DVDs (10)3. VHS videos (7)4. Shoes (6 pairs)5. Kids toys (5)6.

'However, I would kick myself if I threw something away and then found I needed it a few months down the line. 'I realise my clutter takes up a lot of space and may be worth a small fortune but I like keeping spares of everything.' Author and broadcaster Jamie Breese, who has written about decluttering, said getting rid of clutter makes people feel happier. He said: 'The vast majority of UK households underestimate the value of their unwanted items so aren't aware of just how much value is sitting in their cupboards and under their beds. 'With some people even stashing their clutter in car boots and in washing machines, it's obvious that it's time for a spring clean.

'In some cases, very early mobile phones and early home computers, such as the Sinclair ZX80, can be worth more money today. 'I once read that all clutter is postponed decisions, which is an eloquent and revealing description. 'Your motivation really should be to free yourself. It's amazing how good you and your loved ones feel once you've had fun with a clutterbust.' Hamish Stone, from Gumtree.com, said: 'For any households looking for a quick and easy way to find extra space in their homes, a good spring clean session can really help. 'With many homes across the UK now wasting whole rooms storing unwanted items, a good clear out can really make a difference.

Hardly a role model: Joanna Lumley as her character Patsy Stone in the television show Absolutely Fabulous . Patsy Stone is the last woman you would expect – or indeed want – to dispense motherly advice, particularly when it comes to alcohol. But Joanna Lumley, who plays the perennially drunk Absolutely Fabulous character, is more than happy to dole out wisdom to the younger generation. Miss Lumley, 66, yesterday urged young women to stop behaving badly and take more responsibility for their actions, warning them that binge drinking and dressing ‘like trash’ made them vulnerable. She said: ‘I promise you it is better to look after yourself properly, which means behave properly, be polite, be on time, dress properly – I don’t mean dully – but don’t be sick in the gutter at midnight in a silly dress with no money to get a taxi home, because somebody will take advantage of you, either they’ll rape you, or they’ll knock you on the head or they’ll rob you. ‘Don’t look like trash, don’t get drunk, don’t be sick down your front, don’t break your heels and stagger about in the wrong clothes at midnight. This is bad. ‘It’s not me being a snob about it. It’s not me being an old woman talking to young women, it’s just standard practice for how our species should behave. Don’t behave badly.’ Miss Lumley said she had never got so drunk that she wandered the streets at night looking dishevelled and without knowing how to get home. But she conceded there was now ‘something in our society’ which caused young women to behave badly. ‘It could be to keep up the laddish thing which makes you look funkier,’ she said. The actress added that she did not approve of raucous behaviour in boys either, but that girls were more vulnerable and had to be aware of ‘predators’. She added: ‘Girls used not to get legless and now they do, and so I think that’s a trend which we should pull back from.’ Miss Lumley, who in recent years has become known for her charity and human rights work, gave her advice as she backed a Marks & Spencer campaign to encourage people to donate their old clothes each time they buy new ones. She added that women often fail to dress appropriately – and usually buy clothes a size too small. ‘I think often it’s about wearing the wrong size or the wrong age and I’m very guilty of this myself,’ she said. ‘I often wear things that are clearly mutton dressed as lamb and I go “why have I got this? Why am I even holding this?”.’ A storm is brewing on Twitter where users have said the star's comments reveal 'depressing ignorance.' They say that rapists must must be held accountable for their actions - and it is downright dangerous for anyone to suggest that a woman could avoid a rape by dressing in a conservative manner. One, calling herself London Feminist, said: 'Joanna Lumley seems to think alcohol rapes people. No, rapists rape people.' Another says: 'Rape is an act of violence, not sex. To suggest women could avoid rape by drinking less or wearing different clothes is ignorant and insulting.' Not so Ab Fab: Joanna says she 'detests' Patsy Stone, the drunken character she plays in the hit comedy Absolutely Fabulous . Vivienne Hayes of the Women's Resource Centre says: 'Such comments . frighteningly normalise ""victim blaming"". They re-allocate blame from . the perpetrator to the victim. 'It is horrifying that Ms Lumley would . claim that ""something in our society"" has caused young women to behave . badly; the focus here is entirely upon the women who have experienced . rape and other forms of violence at the hands of male perpetrators, as . opposed to condemning a society which breeds male rapists. 'If Ms Lumley were to understand the statistics around rape, she would . know that the overwhelming majority of rapes are perpetrated by someone . the woman already knows, rather than on the street. 'Would she contend . that those women 'behave badly' and wear the 'wrong clothes' and are . therefore to blame at the hands of men they know and have trusted? 'The problem is not that of female ""vulnerability"" but of a ""macho . culture"" which produces the notion of male entitlement – a culture which . consistently fails women through disbelief, victim blaming and failure . to investigate.' Vulnerable: Girls need to be aware of predators, Joanna says. 'Don't break your heels and stagger around in the wrong clothes at midnight, this is bad,' she adds . The charity Rape Crisis has dedicated a page of its website to dispelling myths surrounding rape. Two of the main myths repeated time and time again regarding sexual violence towards women are that a) women are 'asking for it' if they dress  a certain way, and b) that they are more likely to be raped if they are out at night. They say: . 'The suggestion of avoiding walking alone, especially at night is a common suggestion to avoiding sexual assault. However, only 9% of rapes are committed by 'strangers'. Women are raped in their homes and in their work places where they are less likely to be believed and even less likely to report. This myth can control movements and restricts freedom. This can feel like women are living under a 'curfew' and that it is a woman's responsibility to be either in or out at certain times. More than 80% of rapes are committed by known men. Regarding dress and appearance: . 'Rape is an act of violence not sex. Women and girls of all ages, classes, culture, ability, sexuality, race and faith are raped. Attractiveness has little significance. There is a great diversity in the way targeted women act or dress. Rapists choose women based on their vulnerability not their physical appearance.'Lumley's comments have reignited a topic that hit the headlines in 2011 when a Canadian policeman caused an outcry by telling a . group of students that women should 'avoid dressing like sluts' in order . to avoid being sexually assaulted. A controversial movement named 'SlutWalk' was launched in response to the policeman's condemnation of women and saw protest marches held in Toronto, London and other major cities where women took to the streets in revealing clothing to challenge the notion that women are ever to blame for the sexual violence of men. In September last year, the semi-naked protestors converged outside Downing Street to demand justice for rape victims and petition David Cameron to ensure the criminal justice system takes rape and sexual assault cases more seriously. I like Joanna Lumley but it saddens me that her advice for girls is HOW NOT TO GET RAPED rather than telling boys NOT TO RAPE IN FIRST PLACE @SoniaPoulton . Yeah staggering about p***** up with no clothes on isn't a good move, but it shouldn't warrant rape/ assult @FennelwOh Joanna Lumley, I'm so disappointed in your misguided rape comments@elle_c_emm . ‏Joanna Lumley seems to think alcohol rapes people.

"By . Liz Jones Column . PUBLISHED: . 20:03 EST, 13 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:56 EST, 17 October 2012 . Nigella Lawson was a bit in the bain-marie last week for saying that French food is all about fancy sauces and plate decoration, and that she far ­prefers Italian food. This was perfectly reasonable, I thought. This is not Russia, and she should be able to voice a preference without being put in prison. I'm a huge fan of Nigella, not because I ever cook any of her recipes – I have a phobia about ingredients, and do not possess an oven, nor much like food – but because she is so breath­takingly beautiful. Breathtaking: 'She looks Italian with a teeny waist and hair colour of liquorice' I once had lunch with her, and it was like being seated opposite a great Hollywood star, like Sophia Loren in her prime, or Gina Lollobrigida. She looks Italian, with a teeny waist and hair the colour of ­liquorice, so why shouldn't she cook Italian? She was nice, too, grabbing my hand and exclaiming that neither of us was wearing a huge diamond engagement ring (I was married then). 'I hate women who show off,' she said. And now along comes a French chef, Jean-Christophe Novelli, a man who has a greasy slick of black hair that falls into his eyes, like an apron-clad Shakin' Stevens. He said of the goddess Nigella and her favouring Italian food: 'Having witnessed her for the last 30 years of my life, it's rather amazing for someone who has looked well over 60 for more than two-thirds of her life from behind, and who has scavenged a big part of her starting life on mostly amazing basic French cooking. Greasy: 'How dare' Jean-Christophe Novelli say Nigella looks old . 'She is not even capable of supporting her own native cuisine.' Nigella looks 60 years old! From behind! This from a man who might have Italian roots, but comes from a country that drowns wild birds in alcohol, then eats them, bones and all. A country where people eat horse, and foal stew, and foie gras. I once sent a young female food writer to interview Novelli when he was running the restaurant at a country house hotel, and he was rude and mono­syllabic. He raises money for the British Heart Foundation (and also charges £695 and upwards for his masterclasses where you have your photo taken with him), but have you seen his recipes? Baked Vacherin cheese, wrapped in ham. Crispy ham and cheese pork chops, fried in a knob of butter.Why not use the sebum from your dreadful bonce to fry a wild hare's heart? He is stupid, too. On his website, he spells Eton Mess with an 'a', as in Eaton, and uses brands that sponsor him, such as Carte D'Or ice cream. How dare you say our Nigella looks old from the rear, when she doesn't remotely look her age from any angle? Women in Paris, in their fur pelts and with their hoisted faces, emaciated bodies and lack of humour, look ancient. Nigella is both creamy and dreamy. I hate male chefs, all of them. Isn't Paul Hollywood arrogant on The Great British Bake Off, while Mary Berry is so encouraging, sweet as an English strawberry? Gordon Ramsay once cooked me dinner: baked little gem hearts. Translated, that means hot lettuce. Seriously. Even I can do better than that. He once made marks on my virgin kitchen table, too, cutting pasta shapes. 'What are you!' I yelled. 'A toddler? Use a chopping board! Do you scribble on walls as well?' Jamie Oliver invited me to lunch, then served me an entire meal made of truffles. Everything was foamy. Who wants that? The worst meal I ever ate was cooked by Marco Pierre White – he of the dead shark's eyes. When I told him I don't eat meat he sent out a plate of asparagus, with nothing on top. Female chefs are more open to new ideas, to people who are altogether less carnivorous than they are. I sat next to Lorraine Pascale last week – we were both in a studio having our make-up done – and I told her I don't own an oven. 'What on earth do you eat?' she said, eyebrows in her ironed hair. 'I'm sad that there is no woman in the final of The Great British Bake Off' 'Um, muesli with rice milk. Anything cold, like an avocado.' 'I think we should all eat less meat,' she said gravely. Male chefs regard women who dare to have flesh on their bones as a sign of matronhood, of letting the side down, of not being attractive enough. But Nigella is bigger than Jean-Christophe in every way: he is merely jealous. I'm sad that there is no woman in the final of The Great British Bake Off, which airs on Tuesday. It's the women of this country who have to cook, day in, day out, without plaudits. Men merely make a mess, then expect to be praised like puppies who have used a puppy training pad.","'I'm a huge fan of Nigella Lawson, not because I ever cook any of her recipes, but because she is so breathtakingly beautiful'"

'Let's do this': Aimee Copeland did not cry when her father told her she would have to have her remaining foot and fingers amputated . A young Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating bacteria has learned she will lose her hands and remaining foot, and responded by saying 'Let's do this'. Aimee Copeland's father recounted the conversation in an update on his Facebook page today. Andy Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after the 24-year-old woman contracted the bacteria after an accident. He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote. It was not immediately clear whether the surgeries had already happened. Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from a homemade zip line on May 1 over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. Copeland said he was finally able to tell his daughter on Thursday what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world. 'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote in Friday's update. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.' He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened, her jaw dropped. Then, Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face. 'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote. He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said. 'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote. 'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - ""Let's do this"".' Traumatic: The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles an infection called necrotizing fasciitis . The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles an infection called necrotizing fasciitis. Doctors hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. But they learned today that they would have to amputate that and her fingers. The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a week ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival. But in recent days she has been alert and bored enough to have asked for a book to read. Distraught: Paige Copeland, center, cries as her parents Donna and Andy Copeland speak about their daughter Aimee after she had her leg amputated . Doctors had to amputate most of Miss Copeland's left leg to save her life. She has been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in he throat, but her parents said they've learned to read lips and are now able to communicate with their daughter, who was also asking for ice-cream. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said earlier this week. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed.' Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . He said his daughter seems aware that she's in the hospital after an accident. But for now, they're sparing her the details of her condition until after she has been removed from a respirator and is breathing on her own. He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counselor was available to help Copeland once she is informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound she suffered in the zip line accident with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) Some news reports have said Miss Copeland was recently diagnosed with lupus, a chronic disease that compromises the immune system, but her father said that was not true. Andy Copeland said his daughter had sought treatment for a skin rash. Doctors initially feared it might be a symptom of lupus, but tests revealed Copeland had a food allergy. 'She was a vegetarian and she had a soy-based diet,' Copeland's father said. 'And it turned out she was allergic to soy.' More than 50 people lined up in the first hour for a blood drive earlier this week at the gymnasium at the University of West Georgia, where Copeland attends school 200 miles from the Augusta hospital. Some students walked to the blood drive, while others drove from other parts of the state. Kara Dermo, a chemistry student who worked with Copeland at the Sunnyside Cafe, was one of the first in line. She was among the friends invited to try the zip line that sent Copeland plunging to the rocky river, but declined. Dermo said Copeland's illness has been weighing on the minds of people on campus. Even the slightest amount of good news has been enough to raise the hopes of fellow students. 'It's very close to home. It makes you realize anything could happen at any time,' Miss Dermo said. Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland, 24, looked at her hands without any tears, says father .

A beauty cream ad promising to give women the same body as Mila Kunis has been banned for being misleading. Rodial failed to convince experts at the Advertising Standards Authority that its anti-cellulite product could really deliver the promised effect. The email advertisement for a body sculpture cream was headlined ‘Get a body to die for with 50% off body sculpture for 24 hours’. Mila Kunis as she appears in a photoshoot for Esquire - the image has been used in an advert that the ASA says is misleading . It featured an image of the 29-year-old actress, who starred in the 2010 film Black Swan, in her underwear and linked this to an Esquire magazine feature where she was described as ‘the sexiest woman alive’. The ad went on: ‘Get Mila Kunis’ Esquire look with this intensive formula that helps reduce the appearance of cellulite fast’. Potential customers were urged to ‘streamline your bum, thighs & tummy with this A-list must have!’. Rodial’s website says its products are the skincare choice for Angelina Jolie, Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Defending its claims for the body sculpture cream, which costs £75 for 200ml, Rodial said it includes bio-marine actives, wheat protein and caffeine ‘to help break down stubborn fat and promote drainage and reduce fluid retention in the body’. It also said the gel is ‘infused with pomegranate tannins to firm and tone your skin  and boost collagen production’, which is associated with young skin. Misleading: The advert featuring Mila Kunis sent by Rodial as an email to potential customers . The ASA said: ‘Most consumers would understand that the claim ‘‘streamline your bum, thighs & tummy with this A-list must have!’’ implied that consumers who used the product would be able to reduce the appearance of cellulite and tighten and smooth their bottom, thighs and tummy. ‘Evidence presented consisted of information about two active ingredients within the body sculpture product which made reference to in vivo trials on those ingredients. However, the trials themselves were not supplied. Because robust evidence was not presented to demonstrate the implied efficacy claims for the product or that Mila Kunis had achieved the look featured in the photo as a result of using the product, we concluded that the ad was misleading.’ The ASA said it should not be repeated.","Ad promised Mila Kunis' look with its 'intensive formula'

The inauguration is barely over but the vice president already is dropping plenty of hints that he might have another political act. Biden packed his schedule with events and receptions attended by party stalwarts throughout the long weekend of inauguration festivities, stoking speculation he may be laying the groundwork to carry the torch from President Barack Obama. It comes after Biden played a prominent role in brokering a compromise on the fiscal cliff standoff with Congress and his work developing gun violence legislation following December's deadly school shooting in Connecticut. Scroll down for video . A taste of things to come?: Joe Biden gestures to the crowd as he walks down Pennsylvania Avenue en route to the White House yesterday . The next presidential campaign is a long way off and the Democratic primary chase will be dotted with plenty of 'ifs,' most notably whether outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to seek the nomination. Clinton, the former New York senator and first lady, remains the heavy favorite among party activists but several notable Democrats, including Biden, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, are said to be keeping their options open in case Clinton decides not to run again. As vice president, Biden can stay in the spotlight and is no stranger to the demands of a presidential campaign after failed bids in 1988 and 2008. The former Delaware senator has racked up a long list of domestic and foreign policy achievements even as his occasional off-script moments have become fodder for Republicans. The one-day President and First Lady?: Joe Biden and his wife Jill wave to the crowd as they walk down Pennsylvania Avenue yesterday . 'There's a whole lot of reasons why I wouldn't run,' Biden, who will be nearly 74 on Election Day in 2016, told CNN in an interview before the inauguration. 'I don't have to make that decision for a while. In the meantime, there's one thing I know I have to do, no matter what I do. I have to help this president move this country to the next stage.' Yet with his high-profile perch, Biden is doing nothing to tamp down the speculation. Biden's private swearing-in ceremony on Sunday was attended by recently-elected New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, someone who would be a potent ally in the state's first-in-the-nation primary. Attendees at a Sunday afternoon reception at the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory said they noticed a lot of party activists from early voting states like New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill wave to the crowd as they walk down Pennsylvania Avenue en route to the White House . Capitol Hill is now openly speculating that vice president Joe Biden might plan a run for the White House in 2016 . 'We can always start the political calculations in terms of the number of delegates needed to secure a nomination. But let's just say I see a number of superdelegates here as well,' Democratic strategist Donna Brazile told reporters following the ceremony. Biden later dropped by the Iowa State Society Inaugural Ball, slipping up and telling partygoers he was 'proud to be president of the United States,' prompting cheers. He quickly corrected himself, saying he was 'proud to be vice president of the United States, but I am prouder to be ... President Barack Obama's vice president.' Laughing it off, he said, 'There's goes that.' During the weekend, Biden attended a ball at the Kennedy Center celebrating the party's Latino voters, who turned into a powerful voting bloc in November's election. Biden called the Latino community 'a decisive factor' in the election. 'This is your moment,' Biden said. 'America owes you.' Some party stalwarts said it was noteworthy that Biden asked Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina justice, to administer the oath of office. In four years time will Joe and Jill Biden be dancing to his victory as the 45th President of the United States? Powerful: As one of the chief negotiators of the fiscal cliff compromise and one of the key authors of the upcoming gun control legislation of the Obama administration, Biden is a very influential vice President . Biden also attended a ball honoring environmentalists, sponsored by the National Wildlife Federation and other environmental groups, where he said the Obama administration was committed to confronting climate change. 'I don't intend to let these four years go by without getting a hell of a lot done,' on the environment, Biden said. On Inauguration Day, Biden and his wife, Jill, walked part of the parade route, waving to the cheering crowds in a made-for-TV moment. At one point, the vice president even jogged across Pennsylvania Avenue to shake hands with 'Today' show weatherman Al Roker. 'It seems obvious that he's going to keep that option open for himself and do the right things,' said Mike Gronstal, the Democratic leader of the Iowa state senate who attended the reception. Gronstal said Biden actively worked the room, thanking supporters for their help during the 2012 campaign. 'It was very personal time,' he said. Despite the fact he would almost be 74 if he achieved victory - Joe Biden remains the picture of health . On Tuesday afternoon, Biden met with members of the Democratic National Committee at a private reception after a DNC meeting, where delegates unanimously re-elected Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to another term as chairman. A frequently played campaign theme song, REO Speedwagon's 'Roll with the Changes,' could be heard from outside the room and attendees said Biden thanked them for their work during the campaign and offered an upbeat assessment of the second term. If Clinton decides not to run, Biden could draw upon good will from party activists, an ability to connect with regular folks and extensive campaigning in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida and Ohio. But he would also need to deal with personal poll numbers that rank below Obama's and a propensity to commit foot-in-mouth moments in an era where political gaffes can quickly sink a campaign. New Hampshire state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, who was among the attendees at Biden's Sunday reception, said it was 'early to read into' Biden's interest in 2016. But said there was 'huge support' in the key primary state. 'He's deeply admired and loved in New Hampshire,' Clark said. 'Clearly Joe Biden occupies a key place in our hearts.'","Speculation is rife on Capitol Hill that Biden may be laying the groundwork to carry the torch from President Barack Obama .

The National Transportation Safety Board has said that the lithium battery which caught fire in a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 was not overcharged and experts have said the cause could be because of a 'chain of events' on-board the troubled passenger airliner. An examination of the flight data recorder indicated that the battery which caught fire mid flight and forced the Boeing aircraft to make an emergency landing didn't exceed its designed voltage of 32 volts. NTSB investigators are continuing to look at the battery system and plan to meet on Tuesday with officials from Securaplane Technologies Inc., the manufacturer of the charger for the 787s lithium ion batteries, at the company's headquarters in Tucson, Ariz., said Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the board. Culprit: The Boeing 787's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes, which may have caused this battery fire on a Dreamliner at Logan Airport, Boston on January 7 . 'Potentially there could be some other charging issue,' Nantel said. 'We're not prepared to say there was no charging issue.' Even though it appears the voltage limit wasn't exceeded in the case of the Japan Airlines 787 battery that caught fire on January 7th in Boston, it's possible that the battery failures in that plane and in an All Nippon Airways plane that made an emergency landing in Japan last week may be due to a charging problem, according to John Goglia, a former NTSB board member and aviation safety expert. Too much current flowing too fast into a battery can overwhelm the battery, causing it to short-circuit and overheat even if the battery's voltage remains within its design limit, he said. 'The battery is like a big sponge,' Goglia said. 'You can feed it with an eye dropper or you can feed it with a garden hose. If allowed, it will soak up everything it can from the garden hose until it destroys itself.' The . plane made the landing in Takamatsu after a burning smell was also . detected in the cockpit. Both All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines . have grounded their entire fleets of the problematic aircraft . Both Japan and the United States have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns . There are so many redundancies and safeguards in aviation that when an accident or mishap occurs, it almost always is the result of a chain of events rather than a single failure, he said. The Japan Airlines plane caught fire Jan. 7 while it was sitting on the tarmac at Boston's Logan Airport. In a separate incident on Jan. 16, an ANA flight made an emergency landing in western Japan after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell was detected in the cockpit and cabin. An investigator in Japan said Friday that the burned insides of the plane's lithium ion battery show the battery received voltage in excess of its design limits. Since then, all 50 787s that Boeing has delivered to airlines' fleets have been grounded, and the manufacturer has halted deliveries of new planes until it can address the electrical problems. The batteries in two incidents 'had a thermal overrun because they short-circuited,' Goglia said. 'The question is whether it was a manufacturing flaw in the battery or whether it was induced by battery charging.' This preliminary finding, goes contrary to a Japanese investigation on Friday which found that the Japanese Dreamliners operated their lithium batteries at a voltage above its design limit. Following the report U.S. officials joined Japan's probe into the jets after all 50 of the 787s in use around the world have been stopped from flying. The new generation of light lithium batteries was going to deliver equal power at half the weight, but it appears that the chemistry inside the ‘thermal runway’ can self-heat if external temperature and pressure change, something which frequently occurs in aviation. Members of the press are shown the Dreamliner's innovative LED lighting system, which was designed to reduce jet lag during a tour of the aircraft in February 2012 . Concerns over the battery, prompted by an emergency landing of an All Nippon Airways plane on Wednesday, has seen the plane grounded across the globe. The American investigators - one each from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board and two from Boeing Co. - today inspected the ANA jet on the tarmac at Takamatsu airport in western Japan. An initial inspection by Japanese officials of the 787 found that a flammable battery fluid known as electrolyte had leaked from the plane's main lithium-ion battery beneath the cockpit. It also found burn marks around the battery. Eight airlines fly the ‘plastic plane’, so-called because its fuselage is ‘spun’ from super-strong but lightweight carbon fibre, which cuts weight and fuel consumption, rather than constructed from aluminium. British Airways has ordered 24 and holiday firm Thomson Airways has ordered 8 of the planes – with their deliveries starting from next month – but say they are standing by the stricken airliner. Thomson is scheduled to be the first British flyer of Dreamliners in May. Complex: Parts for the flagship craft are constructed by firms around the world . GS Yuasa Corp., the maker of the lithium-ion batteries used in the 787s, said Thursday it was helping with the investigation but that the cause of the problem was unclear. It said the problem could be the battery, the power source or the electronics system. European air safety bosses acted just hours after America’s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued an ‘Emergency Airworthiness Directive’ to halt flights of the planes - the first time a fleet of aircraft has been grounded across the world in 34 years. The FAA’s emergency  directive said the action was ‘prompted by recent incidents involving  lithium ion battery failures that resulted in the release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage and smoke’ on two aircraft.’ It said: ’The cause of  these failures is currently under investigation’ but warned more ominously: . ’These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures , and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment.’ The decision to ground the 50 planes currently in service is a humiliating blow to the world’s biggest aircraft maker, which has seen its shares plummet since the emergency ANA jet emergency landing on Wednesday. Grounded: . Passengers are forced to evacuate a Japanese Boeing Dreamliner using . the plane's escape slides following an emergency landing at Takamatsu . airport . on January 7th . Japan's two largest air carriers All Nippon Airlines and Japan Airlines voluntarily grounded their 787s following the emergency landing at Takamatsu airport . Out of service: One of United Airlines six 787s sits on the tarmac at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston . Some 137 passengers and crew members on an All Nippon Airlines flight were evacuated down escape chutes when smoke was detected on board. The Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries. They charge faster and can be better molded to space-saving shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. But the electrolyte fluid also conducts electricity, so as it spreads it can cause short-circuits and ignite fires. Its corrosiveness also raised concern about whether a leak might weaken a key support structure of the plane. Paul Czysz, professor emeritus of aeronautical engineering at St. Louis University said: . ‘Unfortunately, what Boeing did to save weight is use the same batteries that are in the electric cars, and they are running into the same problems with the 787 as the problems that have shown up in electric cars.’ The battery fire is just one of  a series of problems  - including  two fuel leaks, a wiring problem, brake computer glitch and cracked cockpit window – to afflict the 787 which got off to a bad start when launched three years late. Touchdown: A Qatar Airways Dreamliner is seen coming in to land at the Farnborough International Airshow in July last year. The aircraft has been plagued with safety issues since entering commercial service in 2011 . Among the 50 planes grounded are the six Dreamliners owned by United Airlines, the only U.S. airline to operate the plane. The Indian government also ordered Air India to ground its fleet of six 787s. The two Dreamliners owned by Poland’s LOT Airlines were also grounded alongside the 24 in Japan. On Wednesday a Qatar airlines 787 flight from London’s Heathrow airport was also cancelled ahead of the global grounding. All will be subject to strict safety tests before being allowed to take off again. Jim McNerney, Boeing's chairman, president and CEO, said the company is working with the FAA to resolve the situation as quickly as possible. 'We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity,' he said in a statement. 'We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service.' Mike Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last week that the plane's batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never had an internal fault. He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.","The battery that caught fire in a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 in Boston earlier this month was not overcharged .

Police in a Utah town dominated by one of the largest polygamous sects in the U.S. have been stopping women from leaving, according to a top lawman. Arizona's attorney general Tom Horne yesterday announced a criminal probe of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) and the Marshal's Office, which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. During a news conference held in Phoenix, Mr Horne also announced that a 26-year-old woman had been granted temporary custody of her six children and had fled the town of Colorado City, the home base of the FLDS. Arizona attorney general Tom Horne, left, and Ruby Jessop, rear centre, and her six children during the news conference where he announced a probe into a polygamist sect along the Utah-Arizona border . Hildale, Utah sits at the base of red rock cliff mountains with its sister town, Colorado City. Arizona attorney general Tom Horne says police there work with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to stop women leaving . He said she was forced by by its jailed leader Warren Jeffs to marry her brother-in-law at the age of 14, and had since been virtually held captive in the town on the Utah-Arizona border, along with many other women who want to leave. 'What they do is say, ""Everybody watch her so she won't run away"". Then she can't leave,' Horne said. 'Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the marshals against their will.' Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal's Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne's words 'inflammatory'. 'I can't speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is the Marshal's Office absolutely does not hold people against their will,' said lawyer Blake Hamilton. 'The Arizona attorney general, as the highest ranking law enforcement official in Arizona, ought not be making those statements unless he has evidence of it. 'It's just absolutely not true,' Hamilton said. Free: Ruby Jessop, who was helped to leave a polygamist sect along the Utah-Arizona border . The church does not have a spokesperson to speak on its behalf, and Jeffs, who is said to still rule the sect, is jailed for life in Texas after convictions on child sex and bigamy charges. Horne fought last year for a bill in the Arizona Legislature aimed at abolishing the Marshal's Office in Colorado City, and replacing law enforcement there with deputies from the Mohave County Sheriff's Office. It failed to pass, so he allocated funds to provide for limited patrols by deputies but says the money will soon run out, and he is again asking the Legislature to take up the bill. Flora Jessop (left) embraces her sister Ruby as they listen to Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's concerns over the Mormon church . Horne was joined at Tuesday's news conference by Flora Jessop, a vocal critic of the FLDS who fled the church in 1986. She was flanked by her sister, Ruby Jessop, and the woman's six young children. Flora Jessop said her sister, who did not speak Tuesday, had been held captive by the FLDS for years, undergoing sexual and mental abuse at the hands of her husband while not being allowed to leave with her kids. Ruby Jessop finally fled last year, and recently won temporary custody of her children who were being held 'hostage' by the sect, Flora Jessop said. 'It's a good day for freedom,' she said. Mohave County Sheriff Tom Sheahan said his agency also is involved in a criminal investigation of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office. He described authorities there as 'security guards for the FLDS church.'. Polygamist Warren Steed Jeffs before he was sentenced to life in prison on bigamy and child sex charges (left) and in court (right) 'They are corrupt and work only for the FLDS and Warren Jeffs,' Sheahan said. He said it's a dangerous situation for his deputies to be patrolling Colorado City without the cooperation of local law enforcement from the Marshal's Office. 'They are not our allies,' Sheahan said. 'I wouldn't trust them as backup for our deputies.' The FLDS Church teaches that a man having multiple wives is ordained by God and is a requirement for a man to receive the highest form of salvation. It is generally believed in the church that a man should have a minimum of three wives to fulfill this requirement. Wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands. The church has come under fire over allegations of sexual and mental abuse of wives and underage polygamous marriages. There are said to be over 30,000 people practising polygamy in Utah, Idaho, Montana and Arizona, even though it is illegal. Another attorney who represents Colorado City called the allegations outlandish, and said the Marshal's Office works well with Mohave County deputies. 'The Marshal's Office welcomes the presence of the sheriff's deputies because it provides them with backup,' said lawyer Jeff Matura. 'The more police service, the better protection for everyone.' Last year, the U.S. Justice Department sued Colorado City and Hildale, claiming discrimination against residents who are not FLDS members. Arizona also has a similar ongoing civil lawsuit against Colorado City. The criminal probe announced Tuesday by Horne and Sheahan mirrors the one that landed Jeffs in prison. After receiving a complaint of child abuse, Texas authorities in 2008 raided the FLDS' Yearning for Zion Ranch. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history. All of the children were eventually returned but 11 men - including Jeffs and other high-ranking FLDS lieutenants - were arrested on charges of sexual assault or bigamy and later convicted.

Celebrity fan: British style icon Alexa Chung toting Mulberry's 'Alexa' handbag, which she inspired . Mulberry, the luxury British fashion brand whose handbags are seen on the arms of the world’s most famous women, has suffered a share price slump.More than £230million was wiped off the company’s value yesterday as its share price fell by 25per cent plus in early trading.The business’s stock market value is down by around half over the last six months in what amounts to a remarkable reverse for what has been a British success story.The latest fall came after the iconic name revealed that sales overseas, particularly in the Far East, are running below expectations with the result that profits will fall from the £36million made in 2011.The company, along with Burberry, has been riding a wave of success in recent years which suggested it was impervious to the global economic crisis.However, all luxury brands are coming under pressure as even China fails to deliver the economic growth that has created a burgeoning  middle class hungry for designer labels.The luxury brand has benefited from its association with fashion icon Alexa Chung and more recently, American singer song-writer Lana Del Ray.The Alexa bag, has become a must-have modern classic with the standard version selling out from Beijing to New York despite a price tag of £785, while an Oak Ostrich version was listed at £3,750.The company also achieved success with the £795 over-sized Del Ray bag, which was launched in May, while the brand’s celebrity fans range from Sienna Miller to Jennifer Lawrence.Issuing a warning to investors, the company said: ‘Mulberry now expects group revenue growth for the year to March 31 2013 to be below market expectations.‘As a result of this, combined with the previously highlighted investment being made in international retail expansion, we now expect full year profits to be below last year.’ City analysts said the share price fall yesterday was the biggest one-day reverse in terms of its stock market value in 14 years.Mulberry’s shares peaked at £25 in the summer but one leading analyst has now set a target price of around £11. Celeb favourite: Mulberry handbags, including the Alexa (left), named after British fashionista Alexa Chung, and the Del Rey (right), inspired by U.S. singer Lana Del Rey, regularly adorn the arms of celebrities . The company is one of the few British fashion names to still make its products in this country and it plans to open a second factory in Somerset which will double its output. Its designs remain popular with the result that its total retail sales are up 13per cent to £46.5 million for the six months to the end of September - including a 10per cent rise in the UK. However, these positives have been overwhelmed by lower-than-expected international sales with a four per cent decline in its wholesale shipments to foreign fashion retailers.

Shock: The profits warning from Mulberry suggests the bubble in the luxury goods market has burst .

The fall-out from the Mulberry problems saw shares in Burberry marked down by four per cent in early trading.Philip Dorgan, retail analyst at Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, was optimistic that Mulberry would recover quickly from the current reverse.He said the profit warning was ‘severe’, but added that it was likely the international slowdown which caused its problems was ‘just a blip’.","More than £230million was wiped off the iconic British company's value yesterday as its share price fell by 25 per cent .

Dean Stockton was shocked at the number of festive trees that had been thrown out after the festive period so decided to give them a new lease of life. He hung a pair of white baubles with hand-painted eyes on at the top of the trees and used a piece of tinsel for a smile or frown.

One dead tree was even given 'crossed out' eyes. Some of the wacky creations resemble Oscar the Grouch from children's TV show Sesame Street. They are now providing great amusement of the people of London. Dean, 35, said: 'Every year I've always noticed the huge number of trees that are thrown out after Christmas. 'While I appreciate these cut down trees are generally replaced by seeds or saplings, there's something incredibly wasteful about them just being thrown out.

A team of intrepid explorers last night slipped into the sea in a whaling boat and began their 800 mile journey from the Antarctic to South Georgia in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Wearing obsolete clothes and equipment, and trusting their lives to a small lifeboat that could capsize at any moment, the six men have no idea what to expect on their dangerous odyssey. If it sounds like something that might have happened to legendary explorer Ernest Shackleton, it is. The six man team, comprised of Britons and Australians, are recreating the incredible journey made almost 100 years ago. Authentic: The British Australian team is sailing 800 nautical miles in a spartan lifeboat using only equipment available to Ernest Shackleton's brave team . Stoic: Antarctic explorers (left to right) Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922), Robert Falcon Scott (1868-1912 and Edward Wilson (1872-1912) The Shackleton Epic expedition aims to become the first to authentically recreate what is acknowledged as one of history's greatest journeys of survival to honour the legend of Shackleton as the centenary of his expedition approaches. In 1914 Shackleton's boat, the Endurance, became trapped in the Antarctic ice and was eventually crushed and sank. His attempt to raise the alarm is considered by many to be one of the greatest journeys ever made. Shackleton took a small party from . his crew and rowed 800 miles on the lifeboat James Caird from Elephant . Island to South Georgia, where they knew they could get help from a whaling station. The British and Australian team, led . by Australian explorer and environmentalist Tim Jarvis, will row the . same route and then cross the mountainous, glacial interior of South Georgia to reach the north coast.They will use no equipment that was not available in Shackleton's time. Shackleton Epic: Navigator Paul Larsen (left), Baz Gray (centre) and expedition leader Tim Jarvis (right) on deck as they set sail from Elephant Island en route to Antartica . Ice ahead: The crew's whaling boat is seen approaching packed ice at the start of the expedition, which aims to recreate the epic journey of legendary explorer Ernest Shackleton . Bleak conditions: The Alexandra Shackleton is an exact replica of the boat used by the adventurer, and is named after Shackleton's granddaughter . The Alexandra Shackleton, a 22.5’ whaler that is an exact replica of the James Caird used by Shackleton, has no keel and . capsizes very easily. The six British and Australian adventurers on board the boat, named for Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter, set out with the help of unusually moderate winds. Expedition leader, Tim Jarvis, 46, a well known British/Australian polar adventurer, said that while he and his crew are recreating the expedition as authentically as possible, with similar gear, navigation instruments and boat, he believes he is merely walking in Shackleton’s wake. Desolate: The whaling boat rounds craggy rocks near Point Wild, King George Island, which is home to Gentoo penguins . Recreation: As well as recreating Shackleton's perilous journey, the team is hoping their expedition will help to 'shine a light' on the changing Antarctic environment . Daring: The explorers intend to sail 800 miles from the Antarctic to South Georgia, to 'honour the legend' of Ernest Shackleton as the centenary of his adventure approaches . 'I hope this expedition not only does his memory justice but also reminds us all of how incredibly beautiful, yet fragile, this part of the world is,' the environmental scientist said. 'Hopefully, if we succeed, we’ll be able to shine another light on the changing Antarctic environment. 'I’m doing this expedition to test . the more resourceful side of myself, to honour the memory of Sir Ernest . Shackleton by undertaking this most challenging of journeys and to draw attention to the effects of climate change on Antarctica and ultimately, the planet.' Brave: The men are recreating Ernest Shackleton's perilous 1916 crossing of the Southern Ocean in a small boat . The team is braced for fearsome seas and icy, bleak conditions. The journey is being undertaken to raise money for conservation . Stark beauty: The Antarctic landscapre provides a backdrop to the start of the journey . The . patron of Shackleton Epic is appropriately The Hon. Alexandra . Shackleton, Sir Ernest’s granddaughter, who originally approached Mr . Jarvis about recreating the journey, sent her good wishes along with those of Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. She said: 'As the very proud Patron . of the Shackleton Epic Expedition I am sending my warmest good wishes to . Tim Jarvis and his five companions as they depart. 'The Expedition . will be incredibly demanding both at sea and on land, but I have every . confidence that the men will remember my grandfather's words: ""Difficulties are just things to overcome"". 'There will be a triumphant conclusion, and a wonderful tribute to Ernest Shackleton and his companions of 1916.' Australian . Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: 'On behalf of our nation – and in . the warm spirit of Anglo-Australian friendship - I wish you well in the . challenging days ahead. Wasteland: Explorer Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton and two members of his expedition team beside a Union Jack within 111 miles of the South Pole . 'I trust you will recapture some of Shackleton’s ethos as well, and thus return uplifted in spirit and full of renewed admiration for this remarkable man and what he was able to achieve in the name of science and humanity.' The expedition crew, all . accomplished sailors or mountaineers, also comprises Nick Bubb, skipper . (British), Paul Larsen, navigator (Australian), . Barry Gray, mountain leader and expedition cook (British), Seb . Coulthard, bosun (British) and Ed Wardle, cameraman and mountaineer . (British). Jarvis paid tribute to his expedition . crew who have dedicated themselves to the task of preparing for the . expedition during the past year, and to their supporters and family. 'While . we’ve been careful to plan well to avoid unnecessary risks as . Shackleton tried to do, clearly there are inherent dangers involved in . attempting an expedition of this magnitude. 'Shackleton’s journey certainly defied the odds and he and his men returned home safely and we aim to emulate them. 'The crew and I want to express our utmost gratitude to our friends and family, sponsors and supporters as well as the community of adventures and sailors who have assisted with this expedition.' Depending on weather conditions in the Southern Ocean, it is estimated that the Alexandra Shackleton will reach South Georgia within 16 days, the same time the James Caird took to cross infamous stretch of ocean. Once there, the crew will climb over South Georgia’s mountainous, crevassed interior hoping to reach the old whaling station at Stromness, before paying their respects to 'The Boss' at Shackleton’s grave at Grytviken. During the expedition, a 75’ yacht, Australis, will act as the support vessel providing a communications, safety and filming platform for Shackleton Epic . Sir Ernest Shackleton, explorer, pictured here at his desk with his exploration plans laid before him . On May 20, 1916, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton had to make a life or death decision. Twenty-two . men on his trans-Antarctic expedition had been marooned on the edge of . Antarctica for more than a year after their ship, the Endurance, had . been crushed by pack ice. To . get help, Shackleton and four companions had sailed 800 miles across . the South Atlantic in a tiny open boat, surviving a hurricane. Three . of them then trekked across mountains and made the hazardous descent . down a glacier in the belief that it would lead them to a whaling . station. But now they had discovered that the path was blocked by impassable cliffs. They had been on their feet for 24 hours, they were frozen and near to despair but they had to retrace their steps. As Shackleton pondered their next move, his two companions pleaded to be allowed to sleep. Shackleton agreed but woke them five minutes later, told them they had been asleep for half-an-hour, and insisted they carry on. The next afternoon they reached the whaling station. And three months later, a ship reached the trapped men. Later, . Shackleton admitted that he too had been tempted to lie down and sleep, . perhaps never to wake again. 'To die without any pain was an ideal of . death,' he wrote, invoking Keats. 'But . if you're a leader, a fellow that others look to, you've got to keep . going. That was the thought that sailed us through the hurricane and . tugged us up and down those mountains.' Since . those days, Shackleton has come to represent all the finest values a . leader can exhibit: courage, determination, patience, loyalty and an . absolute commitment to the welfare of his men.","The team will use similar equipment to the heroic Ernest Shackleton .

A teenage schoolgirl who dyed the tips of her hair pink has been punished with isolation for her new look. Billie Halford, 13, was pulled out of class by her head of year for adopting the fashionable dip-dye hairstyle. Isolation punishment involves pupils being put in a separate room for the day, where they can be seen by their classmates outside, but cannot mix with other pupils. Isolated: Billie Halford, 13, was put in isolation at school after dyeing the tips of her hair pink. Her mother, Leah Halford (in the background), 39, removed her from Ringwood School, Hants, after the punishment . Billie's mother Leah Halford, 39, said her daughter is a model pupil who has dyed her hair before. She decided to take Billie out of Ringwood School, in Ringwood, Hampshire, until the matter is resolved. Billie, a year eight pupil, went into school last Thursday after dyeing the inch-long tips of her hair with the Manic Panic hair dye's 'hot hot pink' shade. Extreme: Billie had not been punished by the school in the past for dyeing her hair blonde . Mrs Halford, a mother-of-five from Poulner, in Ringwood, said: 'Billie has got dyed blonde hair, and last week I put a semi-permanent pink colour on the ends. 'I didn't think it would be an issue but she went into her tutor in the morning and the head of year put her in isolation. 'Isolation would be an appropriate punishment for naughty children, not for something as minimal as this. 'I was informed and went into the school to speak to the teachers but they said she would remain in isolation until the colour was gone, but it takes eight weeks to wash out. 'So I took her out of school. I didn't know it was against the rules, I have never even seen or heard of the rules before. 'Billie doesn't get into trouble and she does well in school, but she was put into isolation in a corridor where everyone can see them and wasn't allowed to socialise at breaks. 'I thought it was a bit extreme and thought the school could have handled it differently, perhaps telling me to rectify it. 'I wouldn't have done it if I knew it would cause trouble. 'If it was all pink I could understand, but I didn't think a temporary colour would make a huge difference. 'I think it's bullying - they are saying their pupils can't have individuality.' Billie, a year eight pupil, went into Ringwood school last Thursday after dyeing her hair with the Manic Panic hair dye's 'hot hot pink' shade . Although the dye would take up to eight weeks to fade, Leah has since stripped the pink colour from her daughter's hair and she is due to return to school tomorrow. The school has defended its disciplinary action saying it is only following its 'clear' rules on students' appearance. During isolation, pupils are removed from mainstream education and are taken to a learning centre. They complete their studies between 8.45am and 3.20pm in isolation until the problem is resolved with parents or guardians. The child is set work by class teachers to complete in isolation, under supervision of support staff. Breaks are permitted for 20 minutes at 10.55am and 45 minutes at 12.50pm, but pupils in isolation must not mix with other students. Headteacher Christina Edwards said: 'We have very clear rules with regard to appearance and uniform which parents agree to when they send their child to the school. 'Our rules state that hair should be traditionally styled and extremes of fashion such as shaved hair, beads, braids, unnatural tints, dyes and highlights are not acceptable. 'If a student arrives at school with inappropriate uniform or appearance arrangements are made to continue with learning in isolation. 'At the same time, contact is made with parents to arrange to resolve the problem.'","Bille Halford was pulled out of class by head of year at Ringwood School, Hants .

And now it seems that Tulisa Contostavlos may have reason to believe her own hype as it is revealed that more people searched online for the X Factor judge during 2012 than any other celebrity. Proving she really does have the X Factor, Tulisa beat off strong competition from the Duchess of Cambridge, and knocking teen heartthrob and 2011 winner Justin Bieber from first to fifth place. While Tulisa’s singing career and role as X Factor judge no doubt inspired many of these searches, the leak of a certain X-rated video in March likely played a large part. Tulisa Contostavlos beat the Duchess of Cambridge to the top spot as most searched for celebrity of 2012 . It was also a big year for 2012’s second most-searched person, the Duchess of Cambridge. Already a top performed in internet search charts, those unauthorised holiday snaps of the Duchess sunbathing sent people online in their droves to find out more. Based on the aggregation of billions of search queries by search engine Bing, it was revealed that Prince Harry also got people searching after his royal Vegas antics. The third in line to the throne was the UK’s sixth most-searched person (poor William didn't make an appearance in the top 10), behind Cheryl Cole, the late Whitney Houston and Justin Bieber. Robert Pattinson, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile round out the top 10. Last year's number one Justin Bieber came in fifth place just ahead of Prince Harry whose Vegas antics caused an online stir . In the aftermath of the Games, it’s to be expected that Olympics and London 2012 were the most-searched events of 2012, and sure enough, Olympians led the most-searched sports stars' list. Gold medal-winning cyclist and Strictly Come Dancing star Victoria Pendleton raced to the top, followed by sprinter Usain Bolt and gold medallist tennis star Andy Murray. Stricken footballer Fabrice Muamba was the fourth most searched sportsperson, with heptathlete Jessica Ennis in fifth place. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's on-off relationship made them the most searched for couple . Most-searched celebrity couple Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart kept Britons guessing with their on-again, off-again romance this year, but their new movie, Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2, could only muster fifth place in the most-searched movies list, with the top spot taken by The Avengers. EastEnders beat reality TV rivals Big Brother and X Factor to become 2012’s most searched TV show. Bing UK Director of Search Dave Coplin, said: 'Every year, the Bing search results give us a unique insight into what and who is top of mind for Brits.

Morocco's Hind Sahli has worked for Vera Wang and appeared in the Italian and Spanish editions of Vogue . Israeli Arab model, Huda Naccache, raised eyebrows when she became the first woman to appear in a bikini on the cover of an Arabic magazine . By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 11:11 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:25 EST, 4 January 2013 . Stunningly beautiful and bearing a . striking resemblance to Italian actress Isabella Rossellini, Hanaa Ben Abdesslem hasn't been modelling long but has already made an impact - . both on the fashion industry and at home. 'This whole year has been full of unexpected and sudden changes – for both myself and my country,' the Tunisian supermodel and Lancôme spokesmodel said. 'We've both created our own revolutions.' The Middle East hasn't traditionally been the place to search for a supermodel due to opposition from conservative factions but a growing number have started to break through. Controversy: Arab-Israeli model Huda Naccache, seen here on the catwalk for Israeli designer, Michal Nagrin, caused a stir when she appeared on the cover of Arabic magazine, Lilac, in a bikini . Trailblazers: Moroccan model, Hind Sahli (left), takes to the catwalk for the Ports 1961 show in New York, while Tunisia's Hanaa ben Abdesslem (right) glams up on the red carpet in Cannes . Now Tunisian Ben Abdesslem, arguably the most successful of the new wave of Arabic models, isn't alone. Moroccan model, Hind Sahli, has made a name for herself on the catwalk at BCBG Max Azria, Hervé Léger and Vera Wang, while also appearing in the Spanish and Italian editions of Vogue. Meanwhile, Arab-Israeli model, Huda Naccache, raised more than a few eyebrows when she became the first woman to pose in a bikini on the cover of an Arabic magazine. Naccache, 23, is currently studying archaeology at the University of Haifa and attempting to put the furore behind her, although she says she intends to resume her modelling career once her studies are complete. While the Lilac cover shocked many, more controversial by far was the appearance of German-Turkish actress and model Sila Sahin in the German edition of Playboy. Pioneering: Sila Sahin (left) was cut off by her family after posing topless for Playboy, while Huda Nuccuche's bikini shoot for Lilac proved controversial . The first Muslim woman ever to be . photographed topless for a magazine was applauded by many fans but she was . cut off by her conservative family as a result of the shoot. 'I . did it because I wanted to be free at last,' commented Sila at the . time. 'These photographs are a liberation from the restrictions of my . childhood.' That Muslim women are modelling at all is nothing short of revolutionary - especially in the Middle East, where attitudes to women remain old-fashioned. But according to Sahli, while some of the reaction she's had has been negative, there has also been a considerable amount of support. 'Mostly, I have had positive reactions,' the 22-year-old said. 'Most people think it's good to have a Moroccan model. 'I have also had some young girls sending messages by Facebook asking me how I did it and how I started. 'I have had just a few bad reactions from people but I don't mind - I'm happy what I'm doing.' Huda Nuccuche added: 'Conservative factions exist in Israel and our region but fortunately my family doesn't belong to these factions. 'I have every respect for every group of people and belief, but I have my independent way in life that I believe in.' For others, both male and female, the reaction to their choice of career has been one of bemusement. Success: Hanaa Ben Abdesslem in her most recent campaign for French beauty brand, Lancôme . 'My brother supported me right from the start,' says Ben Abdesslem. 'I think it's a generational thing. 'I come from quite a conservative . family and my parents didn't really know what modelling was about. 'I . keep them updated about what I'm doing every evening, explaining how . things work and how projects progress... I Skype with them every . evening!' According to male model, Sertac Tasdelen, 29, while modelling still isn't seen as the done thing in his home country, Turkey, it is becoming more widely accepted. 'It's not seen as [being as] stable as banking or as reputable as being a doctor - modelling is obviously a bold career choice. But still just another job and a way of living your life. 'Especially in recent years, with the rapid growth of the economy and developments in the fashion industry, modelling is becoming more acceptable.' 'Before me, the profession simply didn't exist [in Tunisia],' adds Ben Abdesslem. 'They've had to create a new tick-box just for me!' Part of the reason for the growing acceptance of modelling in the Muslim Middle East is the region's increasing appetite for Western luxury goods. As a result, more and more brands are turning to Arabic models such as Ben Abdesslem and Tasdelen as a means of tapping in to the lucrative Middle Eastern market. Not quite a bikini... Male model Sertac Tasdelen strips off for a shoot in the Turkish version of ELLE . Main man: Tasdelen takes part in a shoot for Singapore-based magazine, August Man . 'Designers and brands have to go where the money is - and at the moment quite a lot of the money is in the Arab states,' Lauretta Roberts, a trend forecaster at WSGN, told the BBC website. 'You only have to look at the couture market, which is right at the very high end of fashion. That market used to appeal to rich Americans. 'Nowadays, if you look at those shows, it's all about appealing to the Arab consumer because those are the ones who can afford it right now.' Tasdelen agrees, saying: 'Designers and brands tend to incline towards where the money is - and at the moment quite a lot of the money is in the Arab states. 'Tastes and trends are being reshaped by shifting economic power.' But although money is moving and tastes are changing, for the Middle East's modelling sorority, there's still a long way to go before taking to the catwalk becomes a reputable - and accepted - career choice. Privilege: Ben Abdesslem closes the Jean Paul Gaultier A/W13 couture show on the arm of the maestro himself . While Ben Abdesslem, whose next appearance is in the fully clothed but still risqué 2013 Pirelli calendar, says that she's proud of the achievements of her generation of Arab women, others are less sanguine. 'It's definitely revolutionary and a bold career choice, particularly because in that part of the world they are quite traditional,' Shaista Gohir, a director of the Muslim Women's Network UK, told the BBC. 'You always need that first person to actually break the boundary, break the stereotypes that will inspire other girls.' Sahli certainly hopes so. 'The fact that I left, I'm working and I'm doing well, will give other young girls the courage to do it.'","Tunisian Hanaa Ben Abdesslem is her country's first supermodel and has landed a contract with French beauty giant, Lancôme .

A man suspected in an argument that exploded into gunfire at a Houston-area college was arrested Friday some 250 miles away in a Dallas suburb, authorities said. Trey Foster, 22, was taken into custody in Plano and has been returned to Houston for questioning, Harris County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Christina Garza said. Foster arrived at daybreak, handcuffed and shackled at the ankles, and was led into the sheriff's office by deputies. Officials said at least 10 shots were fired in the incident Tuesday at the Lone Star College campus in north Houston. Three men were wounded, including a maintenance worker who was caught in the crossfire. According to court documents, an argument broke out after 25-year-old Jody Neal bumped into Foster on campus. About 30 minutes later, Foster and his friend, 22-year-old Carlton Berry, spotted Neal near the doorway to the Academic Building, and Foster fired at Neal, who was wounded in the abdomen and leg, the documents said. Neal ran into the campus library and collapsed. According to the affidavit, Neal told investigators that Foster shot him.

Cruel: The kitten, which suffers with radial agenesis, had been listed for sale on the advertising website Gumtree by its cruel former owner . Operation: Harvey is missing the bones that connect the upper half of the front legs to the paws, but is due to have metal pins fitted as a replacement thanks to animal charity Cats Protection .

It causes the two long bones in the lower foreleg to be unusually short. In severe cases, the bone is almost absent and the paw appears to be attached to the elbow. The condition became well known when an individual in Texas, U.S. deliberately bred several cats with this affliction and dubbed them 'twisty cats' Cats with the condition often sit on their rump with their forelegs unable to touch the floor; this gives them a resemblance to a squirrel or kangaroo .","Harvey the kitten captured the heart of cat-lovers after pictured crawling on his elbows .

"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 07:45 EST, 24 January 2012 . A mother has been given 18 months to live after  doctors failed to diagnose her cancer more than a dozen times. Ruth McDonagh, 46, pleaded with GPs for two years to test her for the disease but was repeatedly ‘fobbed off’, and  dismissed as ‘neurotic’. Medical records show she visited GPs 13 times complaining of symptoms before she was finally diagnosed with bowel cancer. 'I need to keep fighting': Ruth McDonagh, 46, with her son Brandon . Early bowel cancer may have no symptoms. Initial symptoms can . also occur in people with less serious problems such as haemorrhoids. However, . the NHS recommends seeing your doctor if you notice the following: . Blood . in your stools or bleeding from the rectum, a change to normal bowel habits for . a number of weeks – such as diarrhoea or constipation, abdominal pain or a lump in the stomach, unexplained . weight loss. As the disease progresses it can also cause anaemia leading to . fatigue and breathlessness. If you are worried about any symptoms you can also call the Bowel Cancer UK Support line on 0800 8403540 . Despite being in excruciating pain, doctors told her simply to take warm baths or eat different foods. And when she became so ill she couldn’t . eat, an extraordinary doctor’s note shows she was prescribed a herbal . remedy, with the GP noting: ‘Admits is neurotic.’ Now 4in long, it has . spread to the bottom of her spine and is likely to kill her. Her only hope is an operation that would involve removing the tumour  with part of her spine, but she has been unable to find a surgeon capable of carrying it out. Her chance of surviving such an operation would be low and, if she did, she would be unable to use the lower half of her body. Mrs McDonagh, an office PA  from Enfield, North London, is instructing solicitors to compile a compensation claim against the NHS to help provide for her son Brandon, 11. She said: ‘I knew the symptoms of bowel cancer so I went back again and again, but I couldn’t get anyone to take it seriously. I was just fobbed off. I was in such excruciating pain and I couldn’t eat. It was obvious that something was seriously wrong with me. ‘I feel I’ve been failed by the NHS. I might have been cured by now if  I had been diagnosed when the symptoms began.’ She added: ‘Who’s going to look after my son if I go? It’s been awful for him. He’s having nightmares and even wrote to Santa asking for me to be cured. It’s heartbreaking.’ Despite pleading with medics to test her for cancer, Mrs McDonagh was told to simply 'take warm baths or eat different foods' Medical records show Mrs McDonagh, a . divorcee, first visited her GP in December 2008, when she complained of . bleeding. She asked the doctor whether it could be due to bowel cancer, . but was told it was a result of digestion problems. Over the next two years, she visited GPs in Potters Bar and Enfield another 12 times, complaining also of bloating and abdominal pain – both symptoms of the disease. In June 2009, she was referred to Chase Farm Hospital for an X-ray, which found several abnormalities in the bowel. But several days later, when she visited her GP yet again, she was told to take warm baths and drink warm fluids. Iona Millais, a solicitor at Russell Jones and Walker, said: ‘She feels very strongly that she brought the key symptoms to the attention of the medical professionals. ‘By the time she was diagnosed, many of the treatments were no longer available to her.’ Mrs McDonagh has launched a website, www.helpruthie.co.uk, to raise funds and seek a doctor to volunteer to carry out the operation that might save her. She said: ‘If it weren’t for my son I might  give up, but I need to keep fighting for his sake.’ NHS North Central London and NHS Hertfordshire, which are responsible for the two GP surgeries that treated Mrs McDonagh, said she should contact their complaints departments. A spokesman for Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust, which oversees Chase Farm Hospital, said: ‘We are currently investigating this case.’",Ruth McDonagh 'fobbed off' by doctors who told her to 'take warm baths or eat different food'
"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 12:19 EST, 8 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:22 EST, 8 September 2012 . A baby girl born with half a heart survived despite the fact her life-threatening condition was not diagnosed until she reached four months old. Scarlett Dougan was born with rare Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome (HRHS) - where the right side of the heart is underdeveloped - meaning her body was unable to pump enough blood to her lungs. Few of the 600 babies diagnosed with the condition every year survive, with many dying within days of birth. Survivor: Baby Scarlett was born with a rare life-threatening condition that went undiagnosed until she was over four months old . But fighter Scarlett, from Glasgow, is beating the odds despite the delay in detecting her condition. Ordinarily HRHS in a baby would be picked up by the 22-week scan carried out on expectant mothers. But it wasn't until Scarlett's mother Nichola spotted the difference in temperament between Scarlett and her older brother Nathanial, 23 months, that she began to suspect there was a problem. 'Nathanial is such a happy wee boy, everybody knows how happy he is,' the primary school teacher said. 'But I think people started to think: ""She's wild"", because Scarlett was just so unhappy and screamed all the time.' The 28-year-old eventually made a breakthrough while talking to a Guide leader who was also a paediatrician about Scarlett's constant crying and sleepless nights. After a quick examination, Nichola was advised to take her daughter to Yorkhill Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. Scarlett was immediately whisked to intensive care after an assessment at the hospital, and a treatment plan drawn up. Doctors told Nichola her daughter had overcome all the odds to make it so far without treatment. 'It was unbelievable,' said Nichola. 'From having a child that you think is healthy to this. I thought at worst she might have asthma.' 'It is a miracle she is still here,' said Scarlett's mum. 'The doctors can't really believe how a child can get to four and a half months with that condition. 'Normally Scarlett's condition would be picked up at the 22-week scan. In the days before scans the babies would go home and just succumb to the condition.' Happy family: Baby Scarlett pictured with big brother Nathanial, 23 months, dad Peter, 30, and mum Nichola, 28 . Baby Scarlett has since come through two major heart operations during which doctors spent hours rerouting major arteries directly to her lungs to improve her flow of oxygen. The tot's turnaround has been so remarkable her doctors are now hoping she will enjoy a relatively normal childhood, although it is likely Scarlett will need to undergo a heart transplant by the time she reaches her early teens. 'She's never going to be an athlete,' her mum said. The rare syndrome puts extra strain on the working side of the heart as it compensates for the defective heart. This strain eventually leads to the organ wearing out. Nichola, with help from Scarlett's dad Peter, 30, and her family, has organised a charity ball in Scarlett's name to raise money for Yorkhill Hospital. She is hoping the ball, which aims to raise thousands for new equipment at the hospital, will become an annual event.","Scarlett Dougan suffers from Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome, where the right side of the organ is underdeveloped .

And while in days gone by the housekeeper was employed merely to clean and maintain the home, this newly available role demands the fulfillment of extra duties - including those traditionally undertaken by a valet, personal assistant, cook and even a chauffeur. In a job description more appropriate to Downton Abbey, the assistant at Kensington Palce must polish silverware and glassware, remain loyal, and ensure 'all areas of the residence are cleaned and maintained to a high standard at all times'. Housekeeper: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have advertised for a servant to help them in their new role as parents . It comes after St James' Palace has consistently stressed the couple prefer to keep their entourage as small as possible, making it clear Kate has no plans to employ a dresser or lady-in-waiting and that the couple largely to do their own cooking and shopping.

Drugs used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain are often prescribed with simvastatin, but there are fears the combination can cause unpleasant side effects . Thousands of people taking a common statin are to have their dose reduced due to fears over side effects. The medicines regulator has warned that patients taking one particular type - simvastatin - at the same time as other drugs used to reduce high blood pressure are likely to suffer more muscle aches and pains. And for the first time, it has produced a patient leaflet to inform people of the changes being made. Statins have been hailed as a wonderdrug which can slash cholesterol and protect against a host of chronic illnesses. But the MHRA is concerned that some people taking other drugs with them could suffer painful muscle problems, lung disorders and kidney damage. Every day eight million people in the UK take various statins, which cost as little as 40p a day. Simvastatin is the most frequently prescribed one; last year GPs gave out almost three million prescriptions for it in England alone. But studies have shown that patients taking simvastatin, particularly the 40mg dose which is the most commonly prescribed in England, suffered more problems if they were also on amlodipine and diltiazem. These are used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain associated with heart disease and they are often prescribed with simvastatin. The side effects are those usually associated with statins, including muscle problems such as pain, tenderness, weakness and cramps and more rarely muscle breakdown leading to kidney damage. These occurred more frequently when patients were on both drugs at the same time. The general advice from the MHRA is . that patients should not stop taking simvastatin. However, if they . experience any muscle pain, weakness or cramps whilst taking . simvastatin, they should stop taking it and see their doctor as soon as . possible. Doctors may lower the simvastatin . dose as the side effects were less common when patients were on a 20mg . dose, or switch them to another statin. Despite advocates saying that everyone over 50 should be statins, the side effects are well-documented. Simvastatin is the most frequently prescribed statin in the UK, with GPs writing nearly three million prescriptions for it in England alone last year . Some taking the drugs suffer mild side-effects such as insomnia and stomach upsets, but others complain of agonising muscle pain and there have been reports about patients developing a rare but serious lung disorder. However most experts still agree that the benefits of taking them far outweigh any risks. Patients are being advised that if . they are taking simvastatin alongside either of the other two . medications their doctor may review their treatment at the next routine . appointment. An MHRA spokesman said: 'The MHRA is committed to public health and continuously monitors the safety of all medicines. 'We have recently published . information on dosing recommendations for simvastatin which were updated . due to a small risk of an increase in side effects when it is used at . higher doses in conjunction with amlodipine or diltiazem. 'This advice is intended to optimise . the proven beneficial effects of statins while minimising any adverse . effects and should not be a reason for stopping statin treatment. We . have advised that patients continue their treatment and discuss this . with their doctor at their next routine appointment. 'The updated information has been . highlighted in our first Drug Safety Update article designed exclusively . for patients, with the aim that people taking these medicines can . understand why their statin treatment may have changed.' Judy O’Sullivan, Senior Cardiac Nurse . at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This is not based on any new . revelations about unknown side effects of simvastatin. ‘We know that side effects with this . drug are dose related – the higher the dose, the greater the risk of . developing muscle pain. Because calcium channel blockers slow down the . rate at which simvastatin is broken down, the drug levels in the blood . stream can be higher. ‘Therefore patients taking both . simvastatin and a calcium channel blocker should discuss their dose with . their GP at their next visit or when their prescription is due for . renewal.

It should have been the happiest day of their lives, but one newlywed couple spent their wedding in hospital after the groom's mother collapsed. Frazer Mataitonga's mother Agnes, who had flown 10,000 miles from her native Tonga, was taken ill on the way to church, and died later of a major heart attack. Mr Mataitonga and his bride Victoria Reeves, 35, went ahead with the ceremony, believing she had simply fainted. Tragic: Soon after this photo was taken Frazer Mataitonga and Victoria Reeves realised the full extent of Agnes' condition and dashed from St Mary's Church, Handbridge, Chester, still in their wedding outfits, to be at her bedside . Heartbreaking: Mrs Mataitonga, 58, died two days later. She had flown half away across the world from the South Pacific Island of Tonga - a 21-hour flight - with husband Amos . It wasn’t until afterwards they learned she was fighting for her life. They dashed from St Mary’s Church, Handbridge, Chester, still in their wedding outfits, to be at her bedside. They spent their wedding night in the intensive care unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital last Saturday, but Mrs Mataitonga, 58, died two days later. She had flown half away across the world from the South Pacific Island of Tonga - a 21-hour flight -with husband Amos. Sight seeing: Bride Victoria said 'It was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, our wedding day, such a joyous occasion but in reality it was the opposite' Bride Victoria said: 'It was such a devastating shock for us all to lose Agnes. Our world has been turned upside down. It was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives, our wedding day, such a joyous occasion but in reality it was the opposite. 'Agnes was the most amazing, beautiful person, loved by so many, her death has affected so many people.' The rest of the guests were looked after by management at Chester Racecourse, where the wedding reception was due to be held, and the venue provided the anxious couple with a car and driver to get them to and from the hospital. Frazer Mataitonga, who is Tongan, is a soldier in the 1st Mercian regiment, based in Catterick, Yorkshire, and his new wife Victoria works for the NHS. Happier times: The newly-weds, from Westminster Park, Chester, celebrated a very public engagement after Frazer's surprise proposal at Chester Amphitheatre last June at an open air film screening . They now have to find an estimated £20,000 to fly Mrs Mataitonga’s body home to Tonga to be buried in the family graveyard. Frazer’s sister Mary Ann, best man and brother William, and others who had flown over especially to be at the wedding. Victoria’s devastated family, mother and father Margaret and Philip Reeves, sister Charlotte, 27, and brother James, 31, of Coed Esa Lane, New Broughton, Wrexham, have been rallying round the grieving couple. Mr Reeves is a retired operations manager at Ball Packaging and the family moved to the town from Milton Keynes when Victoria was 18. Her younger sister attended St Joseph’s High School. The newly-weds, from Westminster Park, Chester, who celebrated a very public engagement after Frazer’s surprise proposal at Chester Amphitheatre last June at an open air film screening which formed part of the Chestival programme, say they are completely broke after paying for what should have been the happiest day of their lives on Saturday. They are now desperate for help after the tragedy. Mrs Mataitonga, who had been filled with excitement ahead of her son’s big day, sadly lost her fight for life surrounded by her loved ones . Victoria said: 'We are appealing for as much help as possible to ensure Agnes is flown home to be in the family graveyard as her final resting place, close to all her loved ones and the people she loved, and who loved her dearly. 'We want to do this so much for her, it is the least we can do.' The couple, who met three years ago, wish to thank all of their loved ones from Tonga and Victoria’s family, who live in New Broughton, Wrexham, for their continuing support during a difficult time. They are now appealing to funeral directors who may be able to assist with Mrs Mataitonga’s repatriation, and businesses, or organisations who may find it in their hearts to help financially with the huge costs involved. Up to 2,000 mourners are expected to attend the’ funeral, with people flying in from all over the world. Frazer, 27, who is Tongan and originally from New Zealand, said his mother, who was a devout Christian, will be remembered for her loving caring nature, her giving ways, and not least her countless fundraising missionary travels. Victoria added: 'Our pockets are empty after the wedding, and paying for four of our Tongan relatives to fly to the UK to be here for the wedding, we have nothing left. 'The Tongans rarely travel this far and travel insurance is not a common product in the South Pacific, so our relatives also have nothing to contribute to Agnes’ repatriation.'We are hoping and praying that we can seek assistance in our sombre and most unexpected task.' 'Now, when we celebrate our wedding anniversary, we will celebrate Agnes and her life and the amazing person she was. We will miss her so much,' the couple said.","Agnes  Mataitonga collapsed on the way to church, but the couple carried on with the ceremony thinking she had just fainted .

What do you get if you mix Louis Vuitton's world famous Damier check with French conceptual artist Daniel Buren's distinctive stripes? The answer: A 1960s extravaganza showcased in a dramatic, geometric setting. Louis Vuitton's Paris Fashion Week show, helmed by LV's creative director Marc Jacobs and with the space curated by Buren, opened in typically spectacular style with models in bold checks rendered in acid brights, pale grey or stark black and white, streaming down escalators into the Louvre. Buren, known for his minimalism, rose boldly to the occasion, creating a shopping precinct with four full-scale escalators, each decorated with his signature 8.7cm stripes, that wowed spectators inside the museum -  many of whom described the scene as 'exquisite'. Back to the future: The Louis Vuitton show was a vision of checks - and managed to feel both retro and futuristic at the same time . 'It was already big, all I . did was make it bigger,' said Buren of his transformation of this most famous of French art galleries. 'It was . others that called me a minimalist, not me.' Of course, the sky's the limit when you're . backed by Europe's richest man and LVMH-owner Bernard Arnault, with whom . Buren mingled before the show. From a fashion point of view, the . collection was certainly unforgettable, with 64 retro looks with echoes of Mary Quant making a bold optical statement. While most silhouettes were slim and clean, subtle volume came in the form of gentle . puffed shoulders or a flippy pleat at the bottom of a miniskirt. Miniskirts, beehives and exposed . midriffs galore pointed to one thing: The swinging Sixties are back (viz Moschino's flower power show earlier this week). Simple silhouettes were decked out in . Damier, while skirt and trouser suits made an impact in taupe, black . and white geometric prints. Louis Vuitton is a house that is . proud of its tradition, but also likes to evolve. The collection saw the . ubiquitous monogram banished for the first time. Instead, one recurrent feature was - according to the show notes - 'the smallest sequins ever produced.' Thousands of those microscopic sequins added dazzle to the Damier check and brought metallic shimmer to . dresses and skirt suits. 'It's all about being graphic,' Jacobs said after the show. And yes, it most certainly was. Drama: Marc Jacobs' chose dramatic staging that saw models in chartreuse column dresses and maxi skirts descend escalators into the show space . Taking a bow: Marc Jacobs receives his applause at the bottom of the stairs as the show ends . Louis Vuitton's trademark Damier check was used in jumbo form across slim column skirts and maxi dresses. The check - most commonly seen in the contrasting brown and tan of the LV brand, was given a Sixties makeover in bright yellow, black and white or greys and browns . Gently puffed shoulders added volume, while exposed midriffs suggested next summer we'll be seeing a lot more exposed stomachs. RIGHT: Pleated mini skirts and bows in beehive-styled hair gave Sixties-style dresses a cute twist . A micro shorts suit would suit the younger Louis Vuitton fan, while the tunic would look just as sophisticated over a pair of white trousers.

Philip Walsh, from Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, said his quick thinking meant rescuers were able to spot his hand sticking out above the snow. They were able to dig an air tunnel to him just moments before his oxygen ran out. Safety campaign: Philip Walsh wants skiers to be more aware of safety equipment such as helmets and shovels that can help in avalanches . Philip's pal Ryan Keene, 31, from London, died in the tragedy in the Canadian Rockies - along with Katie Aring, 30, from Ohio in the US. Reliving his nightmare, Philip, 30, said: 'I was trying to hold on to the belief that I was going to get out, but as time went on I slowly started to panic. I was thinking: ""This is it, this is how I'm going to die."" 'I was trapped under the snow and I couldn't breathe at all. I was under for a few minutes, but it felt like hours. 'Everything just slowed down. Thankfully, people above the surface saw my hand and were able to get a tunnel of air down to me. When I was dug out it was complete hysteria. 'It was clear there were three people in much greater need than myself, receiving mouth-to-mouth and heart compression, and helicopters were coming in and out.' Life cut short: Ryan Keene, of London, was killed in tragedy aged only 31 . Philip had travelled to British Columbia with Ryan and three other friends to celebrate his 30th birthday. He and Ryan were in a group of four skiers lead by an instructor waiting to be collected by helicopter after completing a run on Bonnington Mountain when the avalanche struck. Philip, a sales manager for Lloyds TSB, said: 'The instructor pointed out an avalanche in the distance so we started moving towards higher ground. 'Seconds later, we realised how quickly it was coming and the instructor was shouting ""come on guys, get moving, start moving"". 'Before we knew it we were being catapulted in different directions. It was like being hit by a Ford Transit. 'I've been struggling to walk since I got back but it's absolutely nothing to what Ryan's family are going through. He loved an adventure and lived his life as we all should live it.' Lucky: Philip feared death under snow . It is believed Philip was trapped for up to 20 minutes. The events are being investigated by the British Columbian Coroners' Service. Philip is now campaigning for skiers to be given avalanche training. He said: 'Simple things like checking the weather conditions for the day, following safety instructions and taking transceivers and spades will save lives - but not enough people do this. 'It can be such a thin line between life and death. We received avalanche training beforehand when we were told to put our hands in the air and to keep our helmets on at all times and it saved my life.'","Force of impact 'like being hit with a Ford transit'

"Miss Clark had not been seen in 70 years before her death aged 104 . Lawyer and accountant accused of 'plundering' millions by family . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:57 EST, 29 November 2011 . Vast riches: The family of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark have launched a legal battle to take control of her millions . The family of Huguette Clark have launched a legal battle for her vast fortune after it was revealed the reclusive heiress had signed two wills. The first document left her estimated $400 million to relatives - while the second cuts them out completely. The two wills were signed within six weeks of each other while Miss Clark was in a New York hospital in 2005. Both wills are typed and appear to have been signed, with a steady hand, by Miss Clark. Miss Clark's vast wealth came after inheriting part of her father's Montana copper empire. She had not been seen in 70 years and spent her time in her sprawling apartment block on New York's Fifth Avenue. She died aged 104 in May. She had made no decision who would inherit her fortune by the time she was 98. Her properties included a $100 million beachfront estate in . Santa Barbara, California, a $20 million country house in New Canaan, . Connecticut and the three apartments she owned on New York's Fifth . Avenue, worth up to $100 million. There was also a collection of precious paintings by Renoir and Monet and a $2.5 million doll house. On March 7, 2005, Miss Clark signed a will from her hospital bed in New York leaving $5 million to her longtime nurse . Hadassah Peri. Everything else went to her 21 closest relatives, who are . descendants of her father from his first marriage, according to . court documents filed today. On April 19, 2005 Clark signed a second will from her room at Beth Israel Hospital on the lower east side of Manhattan. In this paperwork, Miss Clark cut out . her family completely. She then revised her nurse's share to $34 . million and half a million each was assigned to her accountant and lawyer. Her doctor received $100,000 but the largest share went to a charitable . foundation controlled by the accountant and lawyer. It was intended to set up an art gallery in her Californian mansion Bellosguardo. High society: U.S. Senator William A Clark (centre) with his daughter Huguette (right) at the Easter Parade in New York, 1922 . According to Miss Clark's . executors, her attorney and accountant, the second will was already . filed in court in June, a month after her death. The first will was turned over by the executors voluntarily . to her family. Relatives launched a court battle today in an . effort to take the millions out of the hands of Miss Clark's attorney and . accountant. The family accused the executors of 'plundering' her fortune. New York lawyers have been examining the management of of . Miss Clark's fortune by lawyer Wallace Bock, 79, and accountant Irving Kamsler, . 64. Investigations into Ms Clark’s estate . are currently underway, both by the Manhattan district attorney and the . state attorney general. War of wills: Huguette Clark's first document was signed by her in March 2005 (left) before she made another will six weeks later . It is alleged Mr Bock wrongly accepted large sums of money and gifts from Miss Clark, as well as mismanaging her fortune. Around the time that the second will was signed, Miss Clark's family claim that her attorney stopped putting through their phone calls. Relatives have argued that they were much closer to their elderly relative than her lawyer has . portrayed. Though the Clark family are spread out across the U.S. and Europe, several family members were in regular contact with her . over many years, exchanging holiday greetings and letters and having . phone conversations arranged through her attorney. Formal: Huguette (right) is pictured as an 11-year-old with her father and sister Andree in 1917 . At court in New York, the Clark family attorney John R. Morken said: 'Before the court are substantial and gravely serious issues of alleged deceit, undue influence and . exploitation of a very elderly and extraordinarily wealthy woman at the . hands of two professionals who, with the help of certain others, took . control of her life, isolated her from family, and ultimately stripped . her of her free will, as well as millions of dollars.' 'Despite her reclusive life style, . Huguette remained true to her family and her all too important family . name, by remaining in contact with certain of her relatives over the . years, sharing events in their lives. 'Indeed, she well knew and was . proud of the fact that she was a Clark, and her family was integral to . who she was. Windfall: Hadassah Peri received a staggering $34 million from her boss Huguette Clark when she died earlier this year . 'She . therefore remained close to them, but from a distance, simultaneously . preserving her desire to communicate with her relatives and her need for . seclusion and solitude.' 'Suddenly . in or about 2004/2005, phone contact ceased, and relatives who were . speaking to Huguette on the phone were no longer able to,' the lawyer . added. The Clark family claim that in 2008, . on at least one occasion when relatives sought to visit their Aunt . Huguette to check on her well-being, they were prevented from doing so . by her lawyer. Several . relatives had went to court last year to try to have a guardian appointed . to the elderly Miss Clark but the request was denied, according to . msnbc.com. Miss . Clark has been the subject of public fascination and an investigation . after a century of life as a recluse. The last photograph was taken of . her more than 80 years ago. She was born in Paris in 1906, the youngest child of U.S. Senator . William Andrews Clark, who was known as one of the copper kings. He was America's second richest man in the early 1900s behind John D Rockefeller. He . shocked the political and financial world when he was 62 by announcing . he had secretly married two years earlier and that his 23-year-old wife . already had a two-year-old daughter. Huguette Clark was married in 1928, at 22, to William Gower, a law student and Clark family employee. The couple soon separated, had no children, and divorced in less than two years, in the summer of 1930. When Huguette's father died, his millions were divided equally between his children from both his marriages. When his daughter turned 21, she received $300million or $3.6billion in today's money. Holed up: Miss Clark rarely left her 42-room New York apartment overlooking Central Park in 70 years . Court documents revealed the amazing details of the millionairess's lifestyle including a bottomless $43m checking account. The records show $126.3million was spent by her attorney and accountant from her accounts over 15 years. Miss Clark owned various lavish . mansions in California and Connecticut, also worth hundreds of millions . of dollars. But she never visited and left them vacant for more than 50 . years. A total of $2.5 . million was paid for a French doll house, as the heiress filled her home . with the delicate figurines. Another doll auction company received 21 . payments between 1997 to 2009, totaling $729,000. A total of $380,000 in cheques was . spent on November 16, 2009, written by either by Mr Bock or Mr Kamsler . from Miss Clark's personal account, including one written out to her . doctor for $50,000. Her nurse Hadassah . Peri and her husband, each received for $60,000. Vacant: The mysterious Clark estate in Santa Barbara, which has been empty since 1963. It is worth more than $100 million . For sale: Le Beau Château, in wealthy New Canaan is only an hour from New York City but Miss Clark had never visited the property . Various nurses and personal assistants also got massive sums. Mr Kamsler was not left out. He received a cheque for $60,000, and three weeks later, so did Mr Bock. In later years, a large sum of money went to cover her ailing health. Beth Israel, which housed Miss Clark for years, received $4.9million for her care between December 1997 and February 2011. Miss Clark's closet friend outside of Mrs Peri was Suzanne Pierre, the widow of her physician. Mrs Pierre would often serve as her social secretary and get regular payments of around $50,000. In all, she was paid $1.7million. Mrs Pierre was also gifted with $10million in 2000. She died only weeks before Miss Clark. Mrs Peri inherited $34 million from her late employer, making her incredibly wealthy in her own right. The Filipino-born mother tended to Miss Clark for 20 years after the nurse was randomly assigned to her by an agency in the 1990s. Media interest: The Clark family have always been the subject of media . speculation, particularly Huguette in recent years as many were . fascinated by her reclusive lifestyle . Mrs Peri earned $131,000 per annum working for the reclusive heiress. The 61-year-old nurse’s 2001 Bentley Arnage sedan cost $204,000, and her Lincoln Navigator SUV was around $42,000. The mother of three lives in luxury with her husband, with a total of five properties to her name. They include a three-story brick home in . Manhattan Beach, complete with a swan-filled canal, and a $500,000 . beach house on an exclusive strip of the Jersey Shore. Mrs Peri emigrated to the U.S. from the Phillipines in 1972. But the heiress wasn’t only fond of Mrs Peri. She doted upon Mrs Peri’s three children and spared them the experience of New York City dorm life by instead securing two lavish Upper East Side condos for university. In a statement released after Miss Clark’s death, Mrs Peri said she cared for the heiress every day for 20 years. ‘I was her private duty nurse but also her close friend. I knew her as a kind and generous person, with whom I shared many wonderful moments and whom I loved very much.’ Miss Clark died at the age of 104 in May. She hadn’t been seen in public for some 70 years, and only left her sprawling 42-room Fifth Avenue apartment to go to doctor’s appointments. Her New York apartment is believed to have a 30ft library, a 40ft drawing room and 40ft living room as well as stunning views of Central Park. It has 42 rooms covering 15,000 square feet in total. Ms Clark was buried at her family's mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where the only people present were funeral home employees. All other family members had been banned.","Miss Clark had not been seen in 70 years before her death aged 104 .

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 18:46 EST, 15 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:46 EST, 15 January 2013 . Idea: Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson has suggested that commuters should be able to avoid peak rail times by having the right to start work later if they want to . Workers who commute should be able to request the right to come into work later if they want to avoid peak time travel, a minister has suggested. Jo Swinson, a Liberal Democrat Business Minister, said that the right to request flexible working could be extended to employees who wanted to avoid the rush hour. From next year, all employees with at least six months service will be able to request the right to work flexibly under government plans - not just parents or those with caring responsibilities. Ministers even want workers to be able to ask for time off if they have hobbies that do not fit in with a typical working day. Employers do have a right to say no but will have to show there is a business case for refusing the request. Miss Swinson told the Commons Business Committee during an inquiry into women in the workplace that she wanted to change the ‘default’ position that it would automatically be parents who got priority over flexible working. ‘There are a whole range of reasons why people might want to work flexibly. They might for commuting purposes want to miss particularly busy times of the day for travelling,’ she said. Even those with sports or volunteering commitments should be able to ask their bosses for time off, if they made up the hours later. ‘They might be volunteering in their local community coaching a football team and have an afternoon where they are not working but make up for it by working at some other time,’ she said. Miss Swinson told MPs this extension of flexible working would resolve office tensions between working parents and childless employees. ‘Sometimes, there can be a little bit of stigma or resentment within the workplace where one set of employees who happen to have children can have a right to request flexible working and others do not.’ She added: ‘The right to request flexible working has been a great success in changing work culture in both public and private sector. We will be extending it to all employees, so that will take it from 10 million to 20 million people.’ The Business Chambers of Commerce said they were concerned at the extension of flexible working. Adam Marshall, director of policy at the BCC, said: ‘We don’t need extra powers to request flexible working when business and employees are already very good at organising their own agreements on this. There is no need for further regulation and red-tape.’ Rush hour: Commuters with more than six months service will be able to avoid rush hour under new plans . Mr Marshall added: ‘This can also raise unrealistic expectations on the part of employees, although the right to request flexible working is not the right to have flexible working.’ ‘If you have a small business and you grant the first request for flexible working, for example to a commuter, you may then have to tell a parent with young children: ‘sorry, I can’t fulfil that request’.’ He added this could also create a ‘perverse’ consequences where a childless worker might threaten to sue an employer for favouring someone with caring responsibilities. Priti Patel, a Conservative MP, said the measures could alarm employers. ‘I would question the viability . I just don’t see how it would work if all commuters ask to work flexibly. If anything, there should be more flexibility on using season train tickets at different times especially for shift workers.’ She added: ‘Government should avoid rushing out more legislation and telling business what is good for it.’ But ministers have insisted that ‘the business case is there’ for flexible working as it helped retain staff. Pros and cons: MP Priti Patel, left, says that the flexi-time idea may alarm employers, while Culture Secretary Maria Miller benefited from flexible working in her previous job in advertising . Miss Swinson said that a study of mothers due to return from maternity leave showed a massive disparity in those who went back to work and those who quit. She said that return rates varied from 99 per cent for the ‘best’ employers who offered flexible working and 50 per cent for those who did not. ‘For those that get this right, they get to keep their talented staff,’ she said, and this reduced the costs of recruiting and retraining others to fill their positions. Miss Swinson admitted there would be cases where flexible working did not fit with a business’s need, for example a cashier in a shop could not work flexibly outside opening hours. She also signalled that she would make the process for requesting and considering flexible working more simple. Culture Secretary Maria Miller - who worked in advertising before going in to politics - said she had benefited from flexible working as an employee. Flexible working will be rolled out to the public sector first, to set an example for the private sector. Ministers also reprised the threat of compulsory gender pay audits, but added that at the moment the voluntary approach would remain unless firms did not ‘step up to the plate’.","Liberal Democrat business minister Jo Swinson came up with the idea .

It was often likened to a skip on wheels, yet somehow managed to become a symbol of the Soviet era. But after more than 40 years on the road, Russia has finally decided to consign the much-ridiculed Lada to the scrapheap. The box-like sedan - first produced in 1970 - became the most joked-about car in the world due to its shoddy construction and infamous unreliability. End of the line: A 1970 version of the Lada, which is being ditched after its Russian makers announced it would no longer manufacture the ridiculed model . Once-popular: The Lada made a promising start thanks to strong exports, like this one in Cuba, which brought in much-needed funds to the then Soviet Union . Heading for the scrapheap: One of the later versions of the Lada Riva, a VAZ-2107, rolls through central Moscow yesterday as its manufacturers reveal it would be ceasing production of the model . 'It's time to say good-bye,' said Igor Burenkov, spokesman for makers AvtoVAZ, who announced yesterday that it would halt manufacturing. 'The demand for ""classical"" models has fallen drastically.' The Lada, known across the old USSR as the 'Zhiguli' and in the West as the 'Riva', has sold more than 20million worldwide and is still widely driven on Russian roads. Although it broke down regularly, its legend rested on the knowledge of drivers all over the country to fix it and get it going again. Loaded Lada: This image is taken from the United Aid for Azerbaijan calendar 2007, which shows the many uses for a Lada in and around the capital Baku . Pursuit vehicle: The Lada was the model of choice for some police forces . Off-roading: Lada's 4x4 Niva, first produced in 1955, which became popular in Canada . Executive: A limousine converted from a Lada 1200 parked in Heroes' Square in Budapest, Hungary, in May last year . Critics say the latest version, the Lada 2107, was outdated the moment it first rolled off the assembly line three decades ago. But unlike more sophisticated Western models, it seemed to cope better with the Siberian cold. Chelsea tycoon Roman Abramovich was . once a proud owner of a dark blue model and even asked his first wife . Olga to change the gears for him - so he could feel what it was like to . drive an automatic. A man goes into a service-station and asks: 'Can I have a windscreen-wiper for my Lada?' 'Okay' replied the man in the garage. 'It seems a fair swap'. How do you double the value of a Lada? Fill the petrol tank. What occupies the last 16 pages of the Lada User's Manual?

She . said: 'Roman was so pleased with his Lada - and that he got one before . his college friends. I crunched the gears. He was furious. 'He screamed ""Stop it. You're doing everything wrong! You'll burn my clutch out."" 'I was trying my best. I got out, slammed the door and screamed ""Drive yourself!"" and stormed off. He was like a typical Russian man.' The name 'Lada' meant 'boat' in Old Russian and the badge depicts a Viking sailing ship. The model made a promising start to life after being partly modelled on the 1966 Fiat 124 sedan. It became a successul export due to its competitive price and DIY-friendly mechanics and brought in important funds for the cash-strapped Societ Union in the 1980s and 1990s. The company even ventured into the realms of the roadster when it unveiled a concept car in 2003 and entered the World Touring Car Championships in 2008 and 2009. Renault bought a 25 per cent share in AvtoVAZ in a $1billion deal in 2008, which was expected to result in new Lada models being produced, . But the car suffered a slump in popularity and the decision to sound the death knell came after a 76 per cent fall in sales in the first three months of this year.

From playing the world’s laziest cleaner, Mrs Cakeworthy, in The Green Green Grass to a long-suffering teacher in The Catherine Tate Show, Ella Kenion has never been shy about taking on unglamorous roles. So it is a surprise when the 43-year-old comedy actress opens the door to her London home wearing a silk cocktail dress and with her long blonde hair stylishly tousled. This irony isn’t lost on Ella. But she says she is enjoying fashion for the first time after years of struggling with her weight – the lasting legacy of being blighted with arthritis in her late teens and early 20s. At its worst, it left her unable to walk without crutches. Having appeared with Simon Pegg, Martin Freeman, and most recently, Joanna Page and Sue Johnston in Sky’s comedy series Gates, Ella’s achievements are all the more remarkable as she almost didn’t get into drama school due to her severe illness. ‘I come from an acting family, so I always wanted to get into the profession,’ explains Ella. ‘I was determined to get into drama school.’ Ella’s father Geoffrey was in hit TV show Dixon Of Dock Green and her Australian great-grandmother was a film actress. When she was 18, Ella picked up a stomach bug during a trip to the United States to see a boyfriend. ‘He was training to be a chef so we never figured out if it was from a duck salad he’d made or a tin of tuna,’ explains Ella. ‘I had a bad tummy for a day, and then two weeks later I went to stay with my dad in Majorca.’ On the first night of her summer job – working as a waitress in her father’s restaurant – she felt inexplicably tired. ‘My dad joked what a softie I was,’ recalls Ella. ‘But the next night I awoke at 4am in the most excruciating pain. My knees had swollen up, my toes blew up like sausages, and my feet felt very painful. I was screaming in agony, and taken to hospital.’ Ella’s joints were so badly affected that she was bedridden for four weeks. ‘I had to have a cage around the bed, as even the weight of the sheets caused me intense pain.’ After two weeks of intensive tests, doctors finally diagnosed the problem. ‘I had a bug called Yersinia in my intestine – the food poisoning I’d had in America – which led to reactive arthritis.’ Sometimes called Reiter’s syndrome, this occurs when a primary infection, either from food poisoning or a sexually transmitted disease, triggers an inflammatory response in the body. No one knows why it happens. Up to four weeks after an initial . infection, the body’s immune systems appear to malfunction and attack . healthy tissue and, rarely, other organs. Frequently just the feet and . hips and knees are affected. Up to 3,000  Britons develop this condition . every year and one in seven people develops long-term problems. Dr . Richard Hull, spokesman for Arthritis Care, says: ‘Patients are hit . suddenly by very painful arthritis, usually when they are fairly young. It can be very hard to cope with psychologically.’ Ella . was badly affected. ‘I couldn’t walk for weeks. Medication began to . help slowly but it was ages before I was even allowed to use crutches to . get out the room,’ she explains. ‘Before this happened I was sporty, so . to suddenly lose my health like this was difficult to cope with.’ Broken dream: Ella, left, as Julie on Hardware with co-star Susan Earl and special guest Peter Davison, almost gave up on her career as an actor due to her joint pains . Dr Martin Richter, a rheumatologist at the Middlesex Hospital, explained to Ella what would happen next. ‘He told me that the condition could vanish at any point, so I just had to take painkillers and hope for the best.’ Ella tried to start a course at secretarial college but within days she collapsed and had to go home for weeks of recuperation. Eventually her health improved enough for her to complete her course. She then started temping during the day and taking part in amateur dramatic productions in the evenings. ‘I managed to get auditions for RADA and the Guildhall but was too ill at first to complete the physically demanding weekend workshops that accompanied them,’ she recalls. ‘I went back for the next three years but tutors on the panels would say, “Why are you applying if you are unwell?” I kept explaining that the condition could disappear but no one believed me. Finally I managed to get in at the London Theatre School, which was a huge relief. ‘At drama school, I was much better. I . had cortisone injections in my knees and hips every three months to . provide pain relief, so I was getting more mobile. However, the . arthritis would flare up twice a year. I was also putting on weight . because I was unable to exercise.’ Luckily . for Ella, she quickly found work after finishing her course, including . stints at the Royal Shakespeare Company. ‘My knees continued to be a . problem but I simply couldn’t afford to jeopardise my career and admit . to the pain, so I just carried on.’ She . had a series of arthroscopies – keyhole surgical procedures to examine . the inside of the joint and trim or remove cartilage or any loose bone – . when she was 24 to improve her mobility. Lazy on screen: Ella, pictured as Mrs Cakeworthy on The Green Green Grass with co-stars Peter Heppelthwaite, Ivan Kaye and David Ross, had surgery at 24 to improve her mobility . It was discovered that her knees were dysplastic, which means the shape of the kneecap and the groove that is supposed to move in do not quite match up, so the kneecap grates on the lower leg bone. ‘Doctors thought the reactive arthritis had caused damage to the joints,’ she explains. Finally, Ella’s health stabilised in her mid-20s, although there have been the occasional flare-ups. While working on The Green Green Grass in 2008, she had her first child, William, with husband Andrew Appleyard, 47,  an office manager, and has since slimmed down to a size 12 from a size 22. ‘Having a child really made it imperative I look after myself a bit better, and I did manage to lose the weight quite quickly.’ For those with knee problems, being lighter is one of the most effective ways of preventing complications. Ella hopes her story will give hope to other youngsters affected by similar problems. ‘For years I didn’t know if I’d ever get my life back or make it into acting,’ she says. ‘I’d encourage everyone afflicted by this type of illness to never give up fighting for your dreams.’ Sky Living’s Gates is now available on DVD. Ella will be appearing in Heading Out on BBC2 in the New Year.","Actress Ella Kenion got rheumatic disease Reiter’s syndrom aged 18 .

'The two Koreas are divided by the . world's most militarised border and remain technically at war after an . armistice ended the Korean War in 1953.'

Noisy neighbours: South Koreans look towards the North Korean side for any signs of the launch with binoculars at the Unification Observatory, near the demilitarized zone . The launch came just weeks after a . 'Leap Year' deal that saw Washington agree to provide food aid. Among . the promises Pyongyang made in return was not to launch any long range . rocket or undertake nuclear tests. In response to the launch the United States has now cancelled a planned food aid deal with the rogue state. A White House official, aboard Air Force One, told reporters: 'We are not going forward with any agreement to provide them with assistance.' There is likely to be pressure from . leading countries to impose more sanctions on the North. But it poses . difficulties for China which will likely resist further sanctions even . though its own diplomacy failed to stop the rocket launch. 'After giving so much aid to North . Korea, it still did not listen to China, and this hurt China-North Korea . relations and erodes domestic support in its continued support of North . Korea,' said Shen Dingli, a professor and regional security expert at . Shanghai's Fudan University. 'This also undermines confidence in . the U.S.-China relationship, and whether China had done enough to . persuade the North. So, China is also a loser, but not as big a loser as . if North Korea succeeded in its launch,' he said. A tough push for sanctions, which . Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged, could lead a show of . defiance from the North such as a nuclear test, or an attack like the . one in 2010 that saw it shell a South Korean island, killing civilians.

'Rather than any conventional . provocation, I think North Korea will watch what U.S. and South Korea . are doing and prepare for a nuclear test,' said Chung Young-chul, a . professor at Sogang University's Graduate School of Public Policy. The United States and Japan said the . rocket, which they claimed was a disguised missile test and the North . said was to put a satellite into orbit, crashed into the sea after . travelling a much shorter distance than a previous North Korean launch. Its failure immediately raised . questions over the impoverished North's reclusive leadership which . maintains one of the world's largest standing armies but which cannot . feed its people without outside aid, largely from its solitary powerful . backer, China. 'There is no question that the failed . launch turns speculation toward the ramifications for the leadership in .

The launch is in breach of United . Nations Security Council sanctions and drew condemnation from the United .

'She said I’d need to go home and come back with some identification; either my blue badge or a letter showing my disability living allowance. 'What more proof did she need than me being in front of her in a wheelchair? I clearly look disabled. 'My body is about the same size as a 10-year-old’s - surely that is enough proof.' Ms Parnell claims she asked a receptionist to look for her details on the council’s computer system as she had been to the office a month earlier to update her blue badge.

Freud famously wrote that depression was characterised by feelings of guilt or self-blame - and that was how it differed from 'normal' sadness. Scientists have shown that the brains of people with depression respond differently to feelings of guilt - even after their symptoms have subsided. Dr Sigmund Freud, who famously wrote that depression was characterised by feelings of guilt or self-blame - and that was how it differed from 'normal' sadness . Researchers at the University of Manchester found that the brain scans of people with a history of depression differed in the regions associated with guilt and knowledge of socially acceptable behaviour from individuals who never get depressed. The study, published in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry, provides the first evidence of brain mechanisms to explain Freud's classical observation that exaggerated guilt and self-blame are key to understanding depression. Lead researcher Dr Roland Zahn, of the University's School of Psychological Sciences, said: ‘Our research provides the first brain mechanism that could explain the classical observation by Freud that depression is distinguished from normal sadness by proneness to exaggerated feelings of guilt or self-blame. ‘For the first time, we chart the regions of the brain that interact to link detailed knowledge about socially appropriate behaviour - the anterior temporal lobe - with feelings of guilt - the subgenual region of the brain - in people who are prone to depression.’ The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of a group of people after remission from major depression for more than a year, and a control group who have never had depression. Both groups were asked to imagine acting badly, for example being 'stingy' or 'bossy' towards their best friends. They then reported their feelings to the research team. Dr Zahn, a MRC clinician scientist fellow, said: ‘The scans revealed that the people with a history of depression did not 'couple' the brain regions associated with guilt and knowledge of appropriate behaviour together as strongly as the never depressed control group do. ‘Interestingly, this 'decoupling' only occurs when people prone to depression feel guilty or blame themselves, but not when they feel angry or blame others. This could reflect a lack of access to details about what exactly was inappropriate about their behaviour when feeling guilty, thereby extending guilt to things they are not responsible for and feeling guilty for everything.’ He said the research, part-funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), is important because it reveals brain mechanisms underlying specific symptoms of depression that may explain why some people react to stress with depression rather than aggression. The research team is now investigating whether the results from the study can be used to predict depression risk after remission of a previous episode. If successful, this could provide the first fMRI marker of risk of future depression.","MRI brain scans show depressed people respond more strongly to guilt .

A woman who had the world’s first successful womb transplant is set to undergo IVF in a bid to fulfil her dream of motherhood. Thousands of British women born without a womb will be given hope if the breakthrough treatment succeeds. Speaking in London last week, her surgeon Professor Omer Ozkan revealed that the married housewife has responded so well to treatment that his medical team is confident the first ‘donor womb’ pregnancy is now possible. But some British experts, including Lord Winston, claim that a pregnancy could cause potentially fatal complications. And the baby would have to be born by caesarean, which carries the risks of surgery. Prof Ozkan, who performed the pioneering transplant on 22-year-old Derya Sert in August last year, announced her IVF treatment at a conference attended by the world’s top transplant specialists. The event was organised by Richard Smith, a consultant at Imperial College London who could be ready to perform similar operations on British women in just two years. Prof Ozkan, from Akdeniz University in Antalya, Turkey, also revealed three more women are to undergo transplants at his clinic, providing Mrs Sert has a healthy baby. Prof Ozkan said: ‘This is the longest time any woman has gone without rejecting an implanted womb and we wanted to reach the year-and-a-half mark before going ahead. That will hopefully happen in three months’ time as things are looking good so far.’ He described Mrs Sert’s health as ‘absolutely normal’, adding: ‘It’s not only important for us to have this contact for the patient, it’s also important for future cases.’ Mrs Sert, who is married to 35-year-old Mustafa, has said: ‘If I had  a magic wand, I would want to be pregnant now. I just want to hold my baby in my arms, to be a mother.’ Prof Ozkan and his team will take two out of eight embryos frozen before Mrs Sert’s treatment, thaw them and transfer them into her uterus. The hope is this will lead to at least one baby – or even twins. There are at least 15,000 women in Britain alone who were born without a womb or who have had theirs removed as a result of cancer or other medical issues. TV presenter Yvette Fielding revealed in 2009 that she had undergone a hysterectomy to stop her agonising periods. Fielding already has two children. However, many women are childless when they have the drastic surgery. Those in favour of womb transplants argue it is the only way to meet the desperate desire of many of these women to ‘carry’ their own baby. This need cannot be met if they use another woman as a surrogate, a controversial process that is strictly regulated in the UK and illegal in some countries, including France and Germany. Many British couples end up  travelling to India, where clinics hire out women as surrogates. However, this is fraught with legal issues. For example, couples whose surrogate children are born abroad have to go to court in the UK to ‘prove’ they are the legal parents. Adoption does not give a woman the chance to have a child who is genetically her own and, again, there is a strict vetting procedure. Artificial selection: Mrs Sert had eight embryos frozen before her treatment. Doctors will will thaw them and transfer them into her uterus . Danger: Fertility expert Lord Winston says the risks are not worth taking. Surrogacy is an alternative option . Surgeon Mr Smith has spent more than 15 years researching the possibility of pregnancy among women who have had womb transplants. In July, he revealed his team had achieved the first successful pregnancy in a rabbit with a transplanted uterus, although the animal went  on to miscarry. He now plans to carry out the procedure on five more rabbits before it is trialled in sheep. Only then will Mr Smith approach UK ethics committees for approval to try it on humans. Women who have lost their wombs to cancer need to have been free of the disease for at least five years before they can be considered for  a transplant. But womb transplants have been criticised by experts because they are not carried out to ‘save a life’. Risks include rejection of the new womb and potential side effects  during pregnancy from the powerful anti-rejection drugs. After the first womb transplant, carried out in Saudi Arabia in 2000, the donated organ ‘failed’ after three months because the blood vessels used to connect it were too narrow and became blocked by clots. However, Prof Ozkan does not doubt womb transplants are worth the risks for thousands of women otherwise unable to have a ‘normal’ pregnancy. Trials: British surgeon Richard Smith could be ready to perform similar operations on British women in two years . He said: ‘Many people think that womb transplants aren’t necessary because they’re not lifesaving operations and that women have the option of adoption or surrogacy. ‘But we’ve had applications from women all over the world wanting womb transplants. This is absolutely necessary for these women: you just have to ask them to realise this.’ A total of 100 women have now been screened by Prof Ozkan in addition to Mrs Sert, who received her healthy organ from a car-crash victim. Ten of these have been selected as possible recipients. Of these, three have been approved for a transplant and have undergone fertility treatment. This has resulted in viable embryos, which have been put on ice. Prof Ozkan could now have a race on his hands to become the first  doctor to achieve a successful pregnancy from a womb transplant. Swedish experts carried out two procedures in September, both involving the world’s first mother-to-daughter uterus transplants. This week, they announced another two operations – a mother-to-daughter and an aunt-to-niece – with more transplants scheduled for early 2013. All involve live transplants, whereas Prof Ozkan’s Turkish team used wombs from dead donors. The scientists and doctors at the University of Gothenburg have received approval to complete ten procedures in total. The remaining six procedures, scheduled for next year, include a woman donating to her son’s wife and another giving her womb to her younger sister. The next step is to begin embryo implantation at the end of 2013. Professor Mats Brannstrom, who is leading the research team, told The Mail on Sunday that some of his patients have bonded over their shared dream of becoming mothers: ‘The first couples had wanted to meet so three are now really good friends. When the first one had the transplant, she was straight on to the internet telling the others.’ All his patients are Swedish, although at least one British woman has been assessed for treatment. Eva Ottoson, who lives in Nottingham, had hoped to have her womb transplanted into her daughter Sara, 26, who lives in Sweden. But she has been rejected on medical grounds. Doctors are divided over whether to use living or dead donors. Some experts are uncomfortable with  taking the womb from a living woman when it is not for life-saving reasons. With live transplants, there are risks to two living patients. However, an organ from a living donor can be a better match.","Doctors will implant two embryos frozen before Derya's treatment .

A toddler born with a condition that meant her tongue wouldn't stop growing can now smile for the first time, thanks to surgery. Baby Olivia Gillies nearly suffocated because her tongue suffered 'accelerated growth' - caused by Beckwiths Wiedemann Syndrome. The disorder left her unable to eat or talk and strangers asked if she was sticking her tongue out at them. Scroll down for video . Olivia Gillies was born withh Beckwiths Wiedemann Syndrome which causes accelerated growth in a particular area of the body - in her case, her tongue . Thanks to surgery little Olivia, pictured recently with mother Emma and father Ian, can smile for the first time . But thanks to three rounds of surgery the syndrome is now under control. Doctors spotted the unusual growth disorder, which can affect any area of the body, while she was still in the womb. Olivia's mother Emma, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was seven months pregnant with her fourth child when she and her husband Ian, 38, paid for a private 4D scan. But during the scan the sonographer noticed the baby’s tongue was abnormally large. She referred the family back to the hospital where further NHS scans confirmed Olivia was suffering with Beckwiths Wiedemann Syndrome. Mrs Gillies, 27, said: 'It felt like somebody had dropped a bomb. We were warned her tongue would be up to three times the size of a usual newborn baby and would keep growing. Nobody could tell us how big it would get. We were terrified.' Mrs Gillies (left, with husband Ian) said: 'Olivia is the sweetest little girl you could meet' Mrs Gillies was booked in for a Caesarean section at 38 weeks but her waters broke the day before and she was rushed into theatre for an emergency operation on March 3rd 2010. She said: ‘I didn’t get to see her when she was born because she was rushed straight to baby care to check her breathing. But my husband brought me a picture on my phone and my heart melted straight away. ‘Yes her tongue was very big and protruding from her mouth but she was just as gorgeous as my other children and I couldn’t wait to hold her.’ The size of Olivia's tongue meant she couldn’t latch on to her mother's breast, so she was tube fed and kept in hospital for the first six weeks of her life. Olivia's parents said they were terrified as doctors didn't know how large her tongue would get . Back home her parents didn’t notice how quickly her tongue was growing, but at a check up aged 12 weeks doctors noticed it had got so big she was struggling to breathe. Olivia was readmitted for emergency surgery to fit a tracheotomy  - cutting a hole in the neck to access the windpipe - to help her breathe. Mrs Gillies said: ‘I was distraught. Seeing her every day we just hadn’t noticed how much it had grown. To be told her life was at risk because her tongue was so big was devastating.’ Olivia remained on a ventilator until her breathing stabilised and was kept in hospital until she was well enough to undergo her first tongue reduction operation in September 2010 aged just six months. She was finally allowed home four months later in January 2011 aged ten months old. Her father Ian gave up his job as a chef to become her full time carer, learning how to tube feed her. Mrs Gillies with Olivia just after her birth (left) and smiling today (right). Olivia had to be tube fed as she couldn't latch on to her mother's breast due to her over-sized tongue . But Olivia’s tongue continued to grow rapidly once again putting her life at risk and a second operation was scheduled for March 2011. Mrs Gillies said: ‘It was frustrating for her because she couldn’t eat or talk but she did start to learn sign language to communicate with us and her brothers and sister. ‘The worst part was when people would stare. They obviously thought she was poking her tongue out at them. 'Olivia is the sweetest little girl you could meet and would never dream of being rude or cheeky but her tongue had grown so big she couldn’t close her mouth let alone smile, talk or eat. ‘Our biggest fear was that she could suffocate.’ Olivia's abnormally large tongue was spotted by the sonographer during a private 4D scan. In this collect she (bottom left) is pictured with her brothers and sisters . Recovering: Olivia after having surgery on her tongue. Doctors think it has now stopped growing . More reduction surgery in March this year was deemed a success and Olivia’s tongue finally stopped growing. It meant that doctors could recently remove her tracheotomy and delighted Olivia now can’t stop smiling. She’s also learning to eat and talk, too. ‘We’d never heard of anything like it before and to be honest it sounded like something out of a horror film but we are so happy that the surgery has been a success because Olivia has a gorgeous smile and now she can’t stop flashing it. ‘We thought she was beautiful before but to see her smiling now melts my heart. She has been through so much and has always been such a happy little girl. But now thanks to her lovely smile it shows on the outside too.'","Olivia, now two, was born with syndrome that caused accelerated growth of her tongue.

If you feel guilty about eating a ready meal while watching TV chefs making something from scratch, don’t worry – your food’s probably healthier than theirs. Researchers say programmes from the likes of Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson should carry health warnings or even be shown after the watershed, because the recipes contain hundreds more calories than TV dinners. The claim comes after NHS Tees and Newcastle University examined the top five books by TV chefs on Amazon in December 2010: River Cottage Every Day by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Kitchen by Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver’s Ministry Of Food and 30-Minute Meals and Baking Made Easy by Lorraine Pascale. Good for you: The nutritional value of meals from books by celebrity chefs including Nigella Lawson, left, and Lorraine Pascal, right, were compared to supermarket ready meals . Nutrition: Offerings by chefs including Jamie Oliver were said to be 'less healthy' than the supermarket ready meals . After selecting 100 random recipes from them, they then compared the nutritional content with 100 own-brand ready meals from Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s. The chefs’ offerings were ‘less healthy’ than ready meals and contained ‘significantly more’ fat, saturated fat and protein and less fibre per portion, the study found. On average, the celebrity recipes contained 2,530 calories per portion, compared with 2,067 in the ready meals. None of the meals from either group met all of the World Health Organisation’s nutritional recommendations for a balanced healthy meal. Professor Martin White, whose study was published on the BMJ website, said: ‘Children are subject to a 9pm watershed that restricts advertising of foods classified as high in fat, salt and sugar, and perhaps we should be thinking of similar restrictions. ‘There is certainly a case for providing nutritional information at the bottom of the screen and possibly traffic light warnings, as well as more information in cookbooks.’ Green-fingered: Even Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's meals was included in the study . The UK still spends £2.5billion a year on ready meals, despite their unhealthy reputation. Prof White said: ‘There’s nothing wrong with some of these recipes as an occasional treat but people need to be made aware’ he added. A spokesman for Jamie Oliver said ‘We welcome any research which raises debate on these issues and in fact Jamie’s most recent book, 15 Minute Meals, does contain calorie content and nutritional information per serving for every dish. ‘We will soon also be re-launching the Jamie Oliver website with nutritional information on the recipes. However, we would regard the key issue to be food education so that people are aware of which foods are for every day and which are treats to be enjoyed occasionally.’ A spokeswoman for Lorraine Pascale said ‘Some of the recipes in Lorraine’s book are healthy, some not quite so much so. ‘There are plenty of salads, soups and light meals as well as the richer dishes. ‘Her books and shows to date haven’t been about healthy eating, they are about cooking. However, funnily enough, the topic of her next series and book specifically addresses healthy eating.'","Health warnings should be on cooking programmes, say researchers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 24 June 2011 . Hackers: The logo of LulzSec, who Team Poison have threatened to expose the names of its members . A rival hacking group has threatened to name each of the members of LulzSec. TeaMp0ison, (Team Poison) are racing against the police to expose the names of those involved with the group, who have already brought down Sony, Sega and the FBI. LulzSec’s members use a range of pseudonyms to cover their tracks while exposing others. They include 'Sabu', the groups alleged leader, Nakomis and Topiary. Now though, a member of Team Poison has claimed it will show their true identities. In an interview with Fox News, Hex0010, a member of the group said: 'We're here to show the world that they're nothing but a bunch of script kiddies. 'We're going to let them do what they do. Then we're going to do what we do,’ he said. 'We're going to hit them hard.' Hex, who refused to reveal his true name, claimed the next person to be identified would be from California. He would not reveal further details. The claim come just days after police named the first alleged LulzSec member as Ryan Cleary, a 19-year-old from Essex who was arrested on Monday. Cleary was later charged with a five offences and appeared in court yesterday. The loner is said to be helping . police with their probe into the organisation, with officers given three . extra days to question him about offences in America. Members? Sven Slootweg, left, who has had his website defaced by Team Poison, while Ryan Cleary has been charged by police for his involvement . The outcome of the investigation could lead to Cleary being extradited. LulzSec has since distanced itself from the teenager, using a Twitter account to claim the British police were 'desperate' and that they had arrested 'someone who is, at best, mildly associated with us.' Accused: Alleged member of LulzSec Casey Gardiner is seen here in his Marine uniform . However Hex believes that Cleary is connected with the group. 'Depends on how you look at it,' he continued. 'You can say he's one of the people that ran it, you can say he's a middleman. Depends on how you look at it. I think he's a middleman.' TeamPoison yesterday upped its attacks on users it believes are connected to LulzSec by defacing the website of Sven Slootweg. Slootweg, also known as Joepie, has been linked to the group but quickly issued a statement denying his involvement. He said: 'I am not a member of LulzSec (a statement I have made several times before in various places).’ Team Poison’s threats come just days after another hacking group, named Team Web Ninjas posted what they claimed where names, addresses, phone numbers and even pictures of what it considered LulzSec members. The group claimed that Sabu, a 34-year-old Brazillian, was the group's leader. They claimed to have full details but did not publish them. They also claimed that Slootweg was a member, alongside freelance journalist Barret Brown and a member of the U.S. Marines named Casey Gardiner. Team Poison are closely affiliated to the 'Mujahdeen Hacking Unit',  which attacked Facebook in December 2010. They also have connections with the 'Pakistan Cyber Army'. Both groups are said to be anti-U.S., anti-Israel and anti-India. The group of computer hackers that infiltrated Sony and the CIA has leaked confidential details of law enforcement officers from Arizona in its latest on-line raid. LulzSec owned up to posting personal e-mails, intelligence bulletins, names, addresses and phoen numbers belonging to state Department of Public Safety workers. It said it carried out the hack because of opposition to an anti-immigrant bill that has been passed in Arizona. Several DPS workers said that within minutes of their details going on the Internet they had started receiving malicious phone calls and were trying to change their numbers. The raid came after LulzSec claimed credit for hacking into Sony's system and gaining access to data on its 100 million usersIt also defaced the PBS website and attacked the U.S. Senate and the CIA website. The new attack was on the Arizona Department of Public Safety because of the state's tough immigration enforcement law known as SB1070.LulzSec said in a statement it objected to the 'the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona'. It also plans to release 'more classified documents and embarrassing personal details of military and law enforcement' until its undisclosed demands are met. DPS officer Daniel Scott told the Washington Post that he had to get a new telephone number after his was posted on the Internet. 'I've never had it happen before. It's getting real annoying,' he said.'I let the department know and hopefully they can figure it out. I might have to change my phone number. It's all over the world.' Steven Loya, another DPS officer, also had his email and home address posted on-line. 'Well, they got my cellphone. It's not a good thing,' he told the Post.LulzSec started as an offshoot of hacking collective 4chan but has become notorious of late after British teenager Ryan Cleary was charged over his alleged involvement with LulzSec in cyber attacks on the CIA website. One of the charges also relates to bringing down the website of Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency - the U.K.'s FBI equivalent - using a flood of traffic, in what is known as a 'distributed denial of service' attack.LulzSec has already taken revenge on two people it claimed had 'snitched' on them and landed Cleary in custody. And in a further sign of unrest a rival hacking group has now vowed to take down LulzSec members one by one as rivalry between such collectives intensifies. A member of TeaMp0isoN - pronounced Team Poison - said it would dismantle LulzSec because they were considered to be amateurs.'We're a group that consists of political hackers,' the 23-year-old calling himself 'Hex' said. 'A lot of people consider us being a religious type thing -- in reality it's not. When international governments are doing wrong and trying to hide from it, we're there.' Arizona DPS spokesman Steve Harrison confirmed its computer system had been breached and that additional security measures were being taken. A spokesman for the FBI's Phoenix division added it was aware of the situation but would not say if it was investigating. -by Daniel Bates .",Arizona police are the latest victims of LulzSec .
"Brainy parrot is also BI-LINGUAL and can speak English and German . By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 06:40 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:31 EST, 12 December 2012 . A grandmother claims her parrot has saved her life after she developed a life-threatening illness that stops her breathing while asleep. Barbara Smith-Schafer, 62, says the bird wakes her up by frantically flapping his wings and gnawing her shoulder. Even more astonishingly, Dominic, a seven-year-old African Grey, is also bi-lingual, and can speak English and German, she says. Scroll down for video . Not so bird-brained: Barbara with her loyal parrot Dominic, who flaps and gnaws her shoulder to wake her when she nods off . Mrs Smith-Schafer, from Skegness, Lincolnshire, suffers from sleep apnoea, an illness that stops her breathing when she is asleep. It can put a strain on the heart and cause serious health conditions such as stroke. The pensioner first noticed something was wrong in 2009, when she brought Dominic indoors after he was being bullied by another of her seven pet parrots. Sleep apnoea is characterised by loud . and heavy snoring, which she says alerted Dominic to the problem. African Grey parrot Dominic is also bi-lingual, and can speak English and German . She told MailOnline: 'I . wondered why he kept sitting on my shoulder and pecking at me. 'At first I was quite annoyed - he kept waking me up and I found it embarrassing as he would also mimic my snoring. 'But he . must have realised something was wrong and was trying to keep me awake.' 'He has kept me alive. He really is one in a million.' And . that's not the end of Dominic's talents. The exotic bird also speaks . German after learning some words from her German-born husband Bernhard - . although this has led to some embarrassing moments. 'My husband would sometimes say 'oh scheisse' when he was on the computer, and Dominic started saying it. 'If visitors heard him I would pretend he was talking about how nice it was outside.' Dominic, who could live to 60, has also helped Barbara tackle her fear of birds. 'The other parrots are really my husbands,' the mother-of-three said . 'I . will feed them if I have to but otherwise I don't go near them. But . with Dominic it is different. He liked me straight away because I was a . woman. 'He sits on my . shoulder during meal times and really likes peas and sweetcorn. He will . be getting an extra special Christmas box this year, he really is a . darling.' Barbara was diagnosed with sleep apnoea in 2009 after suffering from nocturnal incontinence. 'I . was getting up three to four times a night having wet myself. The NHS suggests the following lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of OSA : . 'I thought . that I had something wrong with my bladder and at first doctors . were looking at Botox, but then one American doctor said it could be . sleep apnoea, which I had never heard of before.' A . visit to an overnight clinic confirmed that Mrs Smith-Schafer did have . the condition. Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a potentially . life-threatening sleep disorder. It causes a person's airway to collapse . during sleep, obstructing breathing for pauses of 10 seconds or more. This can occur several times in the night and leaves sufferers exhausted . as it jolts them out of deep sleep. It also puts a strain on the heart . and can lead to serious conditions including stroke. It . also explains why the former canteen-worker had suffered with . extreme tiredness for so long. She had found herself drifting off even . when she was standing up and pitched headfirst into the coffee table. . As . a result she had broken her nose five times along with suffering a . fractured shoulder and other bumps and bruises. Mrs Smith-Schafer has now been prescribed a Philips CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway . Pressure) machine, which provides a gentle flow of air . pressure through her nose using a mask. The air pressure prevents airway . collapse, allowing her to breathe freely during sleep. 'For the first time in a long time, I feel like I can see light . at the end of the tunnel, and have got some of my mobility back after years of . feeling too tired to get off the couch,' she said. Mrs Smith-Schafer now uses a Philips CPAP machine at night, which keeps her airways open . She now finds she doesn't nod off so often during the day, which means Dominic can take a step back from guard duty. 'I’m grateful to . Dominic for keeping an eye on me, but I certainly won’t miss the painful alarm . calls or his mocking my snoring,' she said. Mr Michael . Oko, Consultant ENT Surgeon and Sleep Apnoea Specialist at Pilgrim . Hospital, Lincolnshire, who diagnosed Mrs Smith-Schafer, said: 'All too . often, chronic snoring is viewed as a harmless phenomenon, albeit an . extremely annoying one for the snorer’s bed-partner. 'But . for up to one in five who do snore, the cause will be OSA, which if . left untreated can lead to significant cardiovascular damage and hypoxia . of the brain. 'Fortunately, . for those of us without the helping hand of a uniquely talented parrot, . there are some highly effective treatments, including lifestyle and . behaviour changes, CPAP therapy, mandibular advancement devices and . surgery. 'If you experience heavy snoring and suffer significant fatigue and tiredness, it’s important that you report it to your doctor immediately.' Sleep apnoea has traditionally been viewed as a male disease, but a recent study has suggested that among women . aged 20-44, up to one quarter now suffer from it, a figure which . rises to more than half in women aged between 45 and 54, and 75 per cent . in women aged between 55 and 70. 'More women should go and get checked,' Mrs Smith-Schafer said. 'I thought it was my bladder but Dominic knew otherwise. I wish I had his brains.'

He was one of Britain’s richest young entrepreneurs, with a £45million fortune and a glamorous actress – Laila Rouass – as his wife. Nasa Khan enjoyed all the trappings of success with a £5.5million mansion in Spain, exclusive riverfront properties in London worth £5million, a yacht and a fleet of high-powered sports cars. But today the businessman was jailed for nine years after being convicted for his part in a £250million VAT fraud. Jailing Khan, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: ‘Quite why somebody who had been as successful as you were would decide to become involved in fraud I very much doubt this court will ever know. ‘I suspect the enormous profits which were available in the fraud were too great for you to resist, the figures speak for themselves... ‘You have one previous conviction for insurance fraud otherwise you tried to paint yourself as a we have seen from the press cuttings as a generous provide to charities and also as an upstanding role model for others when in truth you were nothing of the kind. ‘You were very close to the heard of the fraud and you benefited hugely from it. ‘There’s little difference between the architect of the fraud and the architect of the money laundering schemes which are essential in fraud of this type.' Khan was found guilty last week of allowing a gang of international fraudsters to launder cash through his companies in a ‘deliberate cheat on the public purse’. Southwark Crown Court heard the 39-year-old – who has now split from former Strictly Come Dancing contestant and Holby City star Miss Rouass – netted ‘staggering profits’, pocketing £15million from the scam. His role as a lynchpin can be revealed after a judge lifted reporting restrictions yesterday.

Department of Trade and Industry and Bank of England’s Young . Entrepreneur of the Year when the mobile phone accessories firm took . off. At the age of 29, he was valued at . £45million and featured in The Sunday Times Rich List as the seventh . richest in Britain under the age of 30, just behind David and Victoria . Beckham on £50million. But as the accessory market declined . around 2001, his company began a fraudulent wholesale trade in mobile . phones, boosting turnover from £13million in 2002 to £219million in . 2003. The scam involved bogus UK companies . buying high value mobile phones in Europe. The phones were then moved . through a number of British firms before being sold back to Europe. Through a series of rapid transactions, . often taking place in less than a day, the fraudsters were able to . exploit UK tax laws and claim vast sums in VAT rebates. Show stopping: Laila Rouass and Anton Du Beke appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in 2009 . Khan used his company and other firms, including Direct Accessories Ltd, to launder the cash.

Although they had a religious ceremony, their wedding was never made official. The couple had a daughter but the relationship foundered after 14 months and they split when Khan was accused of cheating on Miss Rouass with her cousin.

Now, at just 14, he's poised to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Talented: Moshe Kai Cavalin, 14, is about to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) The talented teenager has also just published an English edition of his first book, 'We Can Do.' The 100-page guideline explains how other young people can accomplish what Moshe did through such simple acts as keeping themselves focused and approaching everything with total commitment. He's hoping it will show people there's no genius involved, just hard work. 'That's always the question that bothers me,' Moshe, who turned 14 yesterday, says when the G-word is raised. 'People need to know you don't really need to be a genius. You just have to work hard and you can accomplish anything.' And maybe cut out some of the TV. Although he's a big fan of Jackie Chan movies, Moshe says he limits his television time to four hours a week. The precocious graduate and Jackie Chan fan is also publishing his first book . Hard worker: The talented teen enrolled in college at 8, earned his first of two Associate of Arts degrees at 9 and is poised to graduate from UCLA, pictured . Not that he lacks for recreational activities or feels that his parents pressured him into studying constantly. He writes in 'We Can Do' of learning to scuba dive, and he loves soccer and martial arts. He used to participate in the latter sport when he was younger, winning trophies for his age group, until his UCLA studies and his writing made things a little too hectic. Indeed one of the key messages of his book is to stay focused and to not take on any endeavor half-heartedly. 'I was able to reach the stars, but others can reach the ""Milky Way,""' he tells readers. It was a professor at his first institution of higher learning, East Los Angeles City College, who inspired him, Moshe says. He didn't like the subject but managed to get an A in it anyway, by applying himself and seeing how enthusiastic his teacher, Richard Avila, was about the subject. In We Can Do, which has been translated to English, Moshe explains how to accomplish a lot by keeping focus and approaching everything with total commitment. He's hoping to show there's no genius involved, just hard work . Mr Avila, he says, inspired him to write a book explaining his methods for success so he could motivate others. It took four years to finish, in part because Moshe, whose mother is Chinese, decided to publish it in Mandarin, and doing the translation himself was laborious. Han Shian Culture Publishing of Taiwan put the book in print, and it did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as in several bookstores in Southern California's Asian communities. He then brought it out in English for the U.S. market. Because of his heavy study load, Moshe has had little opportunity to promote the book, other than a signing at UCLA, where he also lives in student housing with his parents and attends the school on a scholarship. After earning his bachelor's degree, the math major plans to enroll in graduate school with hopes of eventually earning a degree. After that, he's not so sure. He points out that he's still just barely a teenager. 'Who knows?' he says, chuckling at the thought of what lies ahead in adulthood. 'That's a very distant future, and I'm pretty much planning for just the next few years. That's too far into the future for me to see.'",Talented teenager has also just published an English edition of his first book .

John Drewe, 64, preyed on his victim after her husband died and even made her sign over assets from hospital as she recovered from a brain operation. He took £240,000 from the sale of a property Jeanne Du Feu owned in London before arranging the transfer of the deeds to her £425,000 home in Norfolk. Ruthless: Drewe left elderly Miss Du Feu relying on the goodwill of friends and family, as well as her pension, at a time when she believed she would be living in relative comfort . When she was left penniless he convinced her to borrow cash from a friend who he then targeted for more money. Drewe had been jailed in 1999 for masterminding one of the biggest art frauds of the century. He made £1.8million by commissioning paintings and passing them off as rediscovered works by major artists. Sentencing him to eight years in jail for his latest crimes, Judge Alasdair Darroch told him: ‘In my view you are about the most dishonest and devious person I have ever dealt with.’ Miss Du Feu, 71, a retired music therapist, said: ‘It’s a nice, long sentence so hopefully he’ll never do it again to someone else. ‘I hadn’t been able to sleep for two or  three years because I woke up having  panic attacks.’ Drewe, of Reigate, Surrey, met Miss Du Feu after befriending her husband, David Greenwood. He died four years ago at the age of 68. Prosecutor William Carter told a jury at Norwich Crown Court she was at a ‘low ebb’ following the bereavement, adding: ‘Drewe took advantage of that vulnerability.’ Fraud plot: Drewe made a fortune from selling 200 fake original artworks, including this forgery of Roger Bissiere's 'Abstract Painting' In the years that followed, he persuaded her to sign papers which she later found were cut and pasted into forged documents. During a stay in hospital for an operation to treat a neurological disorder, she unwittingly signed over the deeds for her home in Cranwich, near Thetford. ‘I thought I was signing something to do with my operation,’ she said. Preying on the vulnerable: Art fraudster John Drewe was told by a judge he was the 'most devious and dishonest' person he had ever dealt with after he stole cash from Jeanne Du Feu, 71 . Drewe then took the £240,000 from the sale of his victim’s Victorian terraced property in Charlton, South London, telling her he was investing it overseas. Within eight months he had spent it all, buying a new sports car for himself and a car for his daughter, and paying off his son’s debts. When Miss Du Feu revealed she was struggling for money, he convinced her to borrow some from a friend. He then targeted this woman and obtained a further £4,760 from her. It was only when Miss Du Feu turned to another friend for advice that she was told to seek legal help and police became involved. An order was obtained preventing her home in Cranwich from being sold. Mr Carter added: ‘The effect on the victim has been very substantial indeed. ‘It has left Miss Du Feu reliant on the goodwill of others when she should have enjoyed the latter years in relative comfort.’ Drewe was sentenced on Monday after being convicted of two counts of fraud following a lengthy trial. His wife Helen, 61, was cleared of money laundering. In 1999, Drewe was jailed for six years at Southwark Crown Court for the art fraud. John Myatt, the artist who created forged paintings for him, received 12 months. Accomplice: Impoverished and little-known artist John Myatt created the fake paintings for Drewe . Replica: The 'Monet' painted by convicted forger Myatt . Drewe created bogus documents made with an old manual typewriter and rubber stamps to ‘authenticate’ the 200 works he had commissioned. Some pieces were aged with dust and mud. They were attributed to major artists including 20th century abstract British painter Ben Nicholson and Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti. One dealer he tricked called him a ‘mad genius’. At one stage Michael Douglas  was reported to be considering playing Drewe in a film about the elaborate scam. He was caught after a former lover handed documents connected to the forgeries to police. The fraudster left school at 16 and claims to have been a Mossad agent, a consultant to the Ministry of Defence, and the inventor of James Bond-style gadgets, including a chemical warfare suit that folded to the size of a golf ball.","Conman transferred deeds from 71-year-old's home to his company and kept proceeds from sale of another .

Britain has up to eight million adults who are functionally illiterate, a report out today revealed. The World Literacy Foundation said one in five of the UK population are so poor at reading and writing they struggle to read a medicine label or use a chequebook. According to research, this rate of illiteracy is costing the UK economy £81billion a year in lost earnings and increased welfare spending. Difficulty reading: Research has shown one in five of the UK population are functionally illiterate . That is the highest cost in Europe - twice that of Germany's and three times the drain on France's purse. Overall the UK was ranked third worst for reading and writing behind Italy and Ireland with six to eight million people illiterate. Report author and the foundation's . chief executive Andrew Kay said: 'We need to treat illiteracy as a disease that we are aiming to eradicate. 'We need to understand that early intervention can avert a lifetime of hardship, poverty and pain for a child, young person or adult who is struggling to read or write. 'The key message of the report is the eradication of illiteracy should be considered an investment rather than a cost. 'The fact that over six million people in the UK are illiterate and many more people struggle to read and write is shocking in 2012. A separate study has also revealed UK pupils have slipped from the world's seventh best in reading to 25th . 'Even worse is the fact that globally, almost 800 million people are illiterate and 100 children don’t attend school each day. 'No matter whether you live in the developed or developing world, poor illiteracy is ruining lives and is linked with an array of poor life outcomes, such as poverty, unemployment, social exclusion, crime and long term illness.' Next week, a collection of 300 of the world's top literacy experts will meet in Oxford for the inaugural World Literacy Summit to develop an action plan to design to help wipe out illiteracy. UK pupils have slipped from the world's seventh best in reading to 25th, according to a separate study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A spokesman for the Department for Education insisted: 'We are unashamedly determined to drive up literacy standards.' Meanwhile, another study suggested pre-schoolers whose parents provide a stimulating home life are still reaping the benefits at the age of 14. A study by the Institute of Education found the quality of learning during a child's early years has a strong impact on achievement in secondary school. It reveals that children whose parents focused on their learning at a young age are generally one national curriculum level ahead in English and science, and 1.3 levels ahead in maths. The findings come from the Effective Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education Project, which has been following the development of around 3,000 children since 1997. The study also shows that looking at students' background, the mother's level of qualifications was the strongest indicator of achievement. Students with parents who were educated to degree level were more likely to be 1.4 national curriculum levels ahead in English, 1.7 levels ahead in maths and 1.5 in science. This is compared to youngsters whose parents had no qualifications.","World Literacy Foundation says 8m adults are illiterate .

George Galloway converted to Islam in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago, socialite Jemima Khan claimed today. The maverick MP took part in a 'shahadah' conversion, attended by members of the Muslim Association of Great Britain, she said. Jemima Khan, who herself became a Muslim ahead of her failed marriage to cricketer Imran Khan, claimed she knows someone who attended the event in north-west London in an article in the New Statesman magazine. But Mr Galloway, who was elected to Parliament as MP for Bradford West in a by-election last month, angrily denied that any ceremony had taken place. War of words: Jemima Khan, right, wrote that George Galloway, right, converted to Islam in a secret ceremony more than a decade ago. He has denied ever taking part in such a ceremony . However, the four times married 57-year-old refused to deny claims that he is a Muslim. In the media, Mr Galloway has always been widely referred to as a Catholic. In the days before his shock landslide by-election victory last month, a letter - which Mr Galloway denies being behind - went out to voters highlighting his record of support for Palestine, his work for 'the freedom of Kashmir' and his abstention from alcohol. It added: 'God knows who is a Muslim. And He knows who is not. Instinctively so do you.' Elected: Bradford West MP George Galloway takes his seat in the House of Commons earlier this month for the first time after winning a by-election . Ms . Khan, who interviewed the MP in his new constituency, which has a large . Muslim community, started the article: 'George Galloway, MP for . Bradford West, is a Muslim. 'He . converted more than ten years ago in a ceremony at a hotel in Kilburn, . north-west London, attended by members of the Muslim Association of . Great Britain. 'Those close to him know this. The rest of the world, including his Muslim constituents, does not.' Claims: Jemima Khan's allegations were published in the New Statesman magazine today . Ms Khan tells Mr Galloway she knows someone 'who attended your shahadah' and says, 'so you converted?' According to the article he replied: 'I can't answer that. God knows who is a Muslim.' The interview was carried out as Ms Khan and Mr Galloway ate a halal meal. When being sworn in as an MP Mr Galloway chose to affirm, rather than make the pledge on a religious text. He told Ms Khan: 'People ask me this, why did I affirm in Parliament when I swore in? 'The answer is: I had to take an oath of allegiance in which I don't believe, to the Queen and all her heirs and successors, and I have no allegiance to any of them, and I could not possibly swear such a thing on a holy book. 'So nothing else should be read into the affirmation.' Mr Galloway claimed today the article was littered with 'deliberate falsehoods' and 'schoolgirl howlers'. He Tweeted: 'No such ceremony ever happened, in Kilburn or anywhere else.' In . a statement he added: 'The opening paragraph of Jemima Khan's piece in . the New Statesman, referring to an alleged conversion ceremony, is . totally untrue. 'Moreover I . told her it was fallacious when she put it to me. I have never attended . any such ceremony in Kilburn, Karachi or Kathmandu. 'It is simply and categorically untrue.' The New Statesman issued a robust statement in response to Mr Galloway's denial. A . spokeswoman said: 'It is notable that Galloway does not deny being a .

When Chris Taylor lost his hand in a jet-ski accident four years ago, he thought his career as a self-employed engineer was over. But he can now climb ladders, grip a length of rope and even do complex wiring, after he was fitted with a new generation of bionic hand. He is the first person in the UK to have a 'Michaelangelo Hand' - a unique prosthetic that has electronic fingers and thumb. Scroll down for video . Life changing: Mr Taylor shows off his £47,000 limb by specialists Dorset Orthopaedic . This means Mr Taylor he is able to move the five digits using the muscles in his right arm. The £47,000 device has electrodes which sense movement in the muscles and, in turn, triggers signals that are sent to the hand. It is turned on and off by pressing a button on the upper part of the hand. Mr Taylor can now hold and grip different-sized objects and perform simple domestic tasks most people take for granted, such as doing up a button or picking up a set of keys. The service engineer lost his right hand when he fell off a jet-ski in a horrific accident in the sea off Torquay, Devon, in 2009. He had been gripping a length of rope that was pulling his son on a rubber ring when a large wave struck the craft. As Chris was thrown into the water, the rope tightened and ripped his hand clean off. Since then he has experimented with a rudimentary NHS prosthetic hand but then found out about the revolutionary 'Michaelangelo Hand' that had been developed in the U.S and Germany. Mr Taylor was referred to the renowned private clinic Dorset Orthopaedic which is trialling the new device and has become the first to be fitted with it. Scroll down for the video... Chris puts on the bionic hand: The prosthetic comes in two parts that are clipped together . Chris can now enjoy everyday chores, like ironing after mastering how to use his bionic hand. He can now grip a number of different sized objects . Mr Taylor can use the bionic hand for precise . tasks allowing him to carry out complex wiring work for his job as a . service engineer . The limb gets its name from the Italian artist's famous painting of the hands of God and Adam touching. The . married father-of-three from Ivybridge, Devon, said after his accident . he had been fitted with an NHS hand, but it had limited functionality. He searched online for an alternative and came across the Michaelangelo . Hand, which he was able to afford thanks to an insurance payout. He said: 'I was attracted to the new technology in it, the fact it had a silicone socket that would fit my arm better, the overall look of it and that the thumb could be controlled electronically. 'I am really pleased that I have now been fitted with it. It is going to be a learning curve because I have been used to not having a hand for some time now. 'It will make a huge difference to my life. Now I have got something on the end of my arm that actually works. 'It obviously isn't quite as good as a normal hand but it is much better than what I had. I can pick things up and do things that everybody takes for granted. 'It is quite a weird feeling moving it and being able to do something I couldn't for quite a long time.' The Michelangelo Hand is attached to a socket embedded with the electrodes, that detect muscle movement. The electronic signals are then read by a piece of software which controls the hand and make it open, close, or grip. The . limb is made from a variety of metal, alloys and plastic, and wearers . will require sessions with an occupational therapist to refine the . movements. The hand, developed by Otto Bock, moves its fingers and thumb when it detect muscle movement in the wearer's arm stump . The hand can make seven different hand positions thanks to four movable fingers and a thumb that can be separately positioned using muscle . signals . Users are recommended to charge the hand every evening for approximately four hours, and can use it for 20 hours at a time. It costs £47,125 which includes the silicone socket, a five year warranty, and therapist sessions. Bob Watts, the managing director of . Dorset Orthopaedic, said: 'What sets this apart from any other . prosthetic hand is it is far more intelligent and it has a motorised . thumb. 'With an able-bodied person, if the brain says 'close your hand' it sends a message to the hand without thinking. 'This hand has a built-in software . programme that does the same thing, it's just that there is no human . hand there. But it has sensors that send the message from the muscles in . the forearm to the hand. 'As a result the wrist, fingers and thumb can respond in a much more accurate and faster way than any other hand. 'Prosthetic hands have been around . for 30 years but this is the only one that has a motorised thumb which . can move and grip by itself.

Schools catering for the children of British and other foreign workers in the Libyan city of Benghazi are among the potential targets of terrorists and kidnap gangs, European officials have warned. All Britons are being urged by the Foreign Office to leave the city after it became aware of the 'specific and imminent threat', just days after the deadly hostage crisis in the neighbouring country of Algeria. European officials, who did not want . to be named, said that schools, businesses and . offices of non-governmental organisations were among the potential . targets. Rebel city: Benghazi was the cradle of the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi in 2011 . Germany, Canada and Netherlands citizens . have also been warned by their governments to immediately leave the . eastern Libyan city. The British government has been . advising against all but essential travel to most of the country since . last September, but stepped up its warning yesterday. A spokesman said: 'We are now aware of . a specific and imminent threat to westerners in Benghazi, and urge any . British nationals who remain there against our advice to leave . immediately. 'We have updated our travel advice to . reflect this. The British Embassy in Tripoli has been in contact with . British nationals for whom we have contact details to alert them to the . advice. 'We cannot comment further on the nature of the threat at this time.' Adel Mansouri, principal of the . International School of Benghazi who has both British and Libyan . citizenship, said UK and foreign citizens were warned in the last few . days about a possible threat to Westerners. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to  lawmakers about the handling of the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed . He added that the school's teachers were given the option of leaving but decided to stay. The school has some 540 students, most . of which are Libyan with 40 holding dual nationality and less than five . per cent are British. He said: 'We told the British ambassador we are staying, and we'll be in touch. We don't see a threat on the ground.' The British School in Benghazi closed on Wednesday and may be closed for the next few weeks. Hundreds of British businessmen, . government officials, oil workers, aid workers, lawyers, investors and . security officials have been travelling to Benghazi as the rebuilding of . post-Gaddafi Libya takes place. Ironically, the city was the focus of . the massive help given by Britain and other countries to Libyan forces . seeking to topple the long time North African leader. Since . then, Libya has been awash with weapons, and its shaky nascent . institutions have struggled to rein in armed groups keen on ensuring . they receive what they see as their fair share of power for helping to . oust Gaddafi. Benghazi in particular has been the . scene of power struggles between various armed Islamist factions with . international terrorists aligned to Al Qaeda said to be training in the . surrounding desert sands and towns. The dangers in the wake of Muammar . Gaddafi's overthrow are said to include 'indiscriminate' terrorist . attacks against foreign travellers and kidnapping. The French military action in Mali, . which has received British logistical support, has also raised the . threat of retaliatory strikes on westerners. Benghazi was the stronghold of the Western-backed revolt that eventually ended Gaddafi's hold on power in Libya. However, Britain has not had any . diplomatic presence in the city since an attack on the US mission last . September that killed American ambassador Chris Stevens and three of his . colleagues. Benghazi, Libya's second-biggest city is bidding to regain its former status as the country's business capital and end what local residents see as decades of marginalisation . Hundreds of British workers have been travelling to Benghazi as the rebuilding of post-Gaddafi Libya takes place (file picture) Libyan officials have reportedly condemned the move as 'not rational' and have demanded an explanation from the Foreign Office. According to the BBC, a Libyan . official said: 'We are very surprised. It's not rational at all. We want . an explanation from the Foreign Office.' Terrorists linked to the Blood Battalion of one-eyed jihadist and . cigarette smuggler Mokhtar Belmokhtar kidnapped dozens of Western gas . workers at the BP plant in Algeria - 37 died, including six Britons, . after a shoot out with Algerian Special Forces - having crossed from . Libya to carry out the attack. Five of Belmokhtar's fighters were . captured and are being interrogated in Algeria, who said to be passing . on 'selective intelligence' to European allies. In . a possible sign of impending trouble, the border crossing to Egypt was . closed to all but Egyptians two days ago in an apparent attempt to keep . westerners out of eastern Libya. US drones have been deployed amid speculation about a possible attack by jihadists or an attack on them. Officials said . that following the recent French military intervention in Mali and the . Algerian hostage crisis, there was the increased possibility of . retaliatory attacks against Western interests. David Cameron's national security . adviser, Kim Darroch, was in the capital, Tripoli, on Wednesday for . talks with the prime minister, Ali Zidan, on security collaboration. The warning came a day after . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to U.S. lawmakers . about the handling of the deadly September 11 attack on the American . mission in Benghazi which killed Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to . Libya, and three other Americans. The ambassador died of smoke . inhalation when he was trapped inside as the building burned, after . armed men had stormed the compound. The U.S. mission was attacked in September 2012, leading to three other American deaths . The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is seen in flames during the attack . Members of the Ansar al-Sharia Islamic militant group were chased out of Benghazi by protestors following that attack. Mrs Clinton told the congressional . hearing on Wednesday that the Libyans had the 'willingness but not [the] . capacity' to provide security for diplomats in Benghazi In addition to . the attack on the U.S. consulate, an Italian diplomat's car was fired on . by militants.

A Colorado mother has been convicted of murdering her two young children because she was distraught over her impending divorce. Kelli Murphy, 42, of Castle Rock, was sentenced to two terms of life without parole as family members wept in the courthouse for six-year-old, Madigan, and nine-year-old, Liam, who she smothered to death in May 2011. On what would have been Liam's 11th birthday, jurors were shown photographs of the children's bodies laying face down on their beds. Dramatically, district Attorney Jay Williford described the amount of time and planning it would have required to kill each child, according to The Denver Post. Pictures of the children's locked bedroom doors came on a projector as Mr Williford paused and watched the clock. 'Liam is now unconscious,' he said after about 30 seconds. 'Liam is now dead,' he added a minute-and-a-half later. Friends and family sobbed for the children as Mr Williford explained how the mother had to tuck Liam in and make his bed before unlocking her daughter's door and repeating the process. Throughout the trial, prosecutors claimed that Ms Murphy killed the children and then tried to commit suicide because she was distraught over her divorce from her husband, Robert Eric Murphy. Prosecutor Chris Gallo described the mother as a controlling, angry, calculating woman who didn't want to share custody of the kids, according to The Denver Post. 'This is a woman bent on control,' Mr Gallo said. 'Controlling her kids, her husband and her divorce ... It was Kelli's way or no way.' He said Ms Murphy told her husband: 'I want 100 per cent custody of the kids and 100 per cent of your salary. I'm going to make your life hell.' But Ms Murphy's defense attorney . argued the deaths were accidental, occurring after she blacked out from . drinking a full bottle of vodka and taking too many pills. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

But when she woke up she found her children face down on their beds dead and couldn't remember what happened, so she cut her wrists in a bid to end her life. 'No mother who loved her children the way Kelli did would do this intentionally or knowingly,' Mr Ohanion told jurors today, adding that the woman's behaviour had become increasingly erratic in the lead up to the murders. He said Ms Murphy felt abandoned and rejected by her family because of the divorce and was acting unstable and paranoid. On .

When the police arrived at her home they found the two children dead in their bedrooms. Both of the children went to Rock Ridge Elementary School. According to Castle Rock Police Chief Tony Lane, the bodies had no visible signs of injury. In court today, the jury listened to Ms Murphy tell the dispatcher on the call that she 'hurt her two young children.' When the operator asked her what happened, Ms Murphy said: 'I have to have an attorney.' Mr Gallo said this proved beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Murphy was sober and conscious enough to know that she would need a lawyer to defend what she had done. But Mr Ohanian claimed that requesting legal representation proved she didn't know what happened. 'She asked the EMT to kill her on the way to the hospital — she was not in her right mind,' he said. Jurors found her guilty of two counts of first-degree murder after deliberation and two counts of first-degree murder of a victim under 12-years-old.","Kelli Murphy, 42, of Castle Rock, Colorado was sentenced to two terms of life in prison without parole .

Penguins with video cameras strapped to their backs have given researchers an incredible glimpse into their ruthless hunting methods. The footage shows  Adélie penguins in waters off the coast of Antarctica diving in both shallow and deep waters. During about 88 minutes of diving recorded, the Antarctic birds devoured 244 krill and 33 Arctic fish, the team found - with not a single target missed. Watch the video below . Using video cameras weighing just 33 grammes (around 1 oz) and equipped . with accelerometers, depth gauges and thermometers, researchers were . able to see exactly what the penguin sees. The accelerometers also measured how the birds moved - allowing them to see the birds using a 'snapping' motion to catch fish. 'The foraging behaviour of Adélie . penguins is remarkably fast and efficient,' the scientists write in . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study was led by two Japanese scientists, Yuuki Watanabe and Akinori Takahashi at the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo. They attached video cameras to the birds backs, and small accelerometers to the birds' bodies and heads. The film was recorded between December 2010 and early February 2011. Footage from Adélie penguins in waters . off the coast of Antarctica showed the birds darting at krill, snapping . up fish, and hunting down prey beneath sheets of floating ice in the . Lützow-Holm bay area. The video also reveals the astonishing speed of the birds. The penguins swimming out to sea before they dive, as captured by the penguin-cam . Penguins chase small fish underwater, snapping their head sideways to catch them . The video captures over 80 minutes of dives from penguins, revealing their hunting tactics for the first time . One penguin swam into a dense swarm . of krill and captured two of the shrimp-like creatures in one second, . and researchers said their ability to surprise prey was astonishing. 'Escape behaviour of the fish was not . evident in most cases, suggesting an excellent stealth approach by . penguins,' the scientists write. 'However, . in two cases, they chased a P borchgrevinki toward the underside of the . sea ice and caught it there, as if they used the ice surface as a . barrier,' they add. Adlelie penguins leaping off icebergs: Scientists have now released camera footage showing exactly what they see when they hunt . Krill and fish called bald notothens (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) made up 96% of the food the penguins caught. Watanabe said the accelerometer -- a device also used in mobile phones, . tablet computers and games consoles -- allowed researchers to precisely . measure the bird's head movements and showed how one penguin could catch . two krill in under a second. The Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)was found to be a ruthless killer that never missed its target . 'Now we know what the Adelie penguin preys on and how much it eats, we . can understand how the penguin survives and how it relates to its . environment,' he said. The cameras also revealed that the penguins turned their heads quickly to engulf prey. The penguin's fragile Antarctic habitat is at risk from climate change, with scientists warning that as pack ice melts, their numbers could fall dramatically.Watanabe said the tiny cameras and micro equipment had given researchers a much better understanding of how the penguin lives.""We now understand how much they rely on those fish that inhabit water just below the sea ice, which means that Adelie penguins can only survive in a sea ice environment,"" said Watanabe.","Video taken by cameras strapped to the back of Adélie penguins in waters off the coast of Antarctica .

The incorrect vaccines were given to 221 children by the GP in Barnsley, south Yorkshire, as a single jab instead of separate vaccinations. Re-vaccinations are now being offered to all the children affected who were given jabs between January 2009 and April this year. The incorrect vaccines were given as a single jab instead of separate vaccinations (posed by models) The jabs were supposed to protect the children against diptheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, hib and measles, mumps and rubella. National guidelines state these should be given separately to ensure maximum protection. Instead, they were mixed and given as one. Mother-of-three Rebecca Hirst, 34, whose five-year-old daughter Poppi was wrongly vaccinated, said she got a letter on Tuesday informing her of the error and offering re-vaccination. She said: 'You put your trust in a doctor to do things right. It is disgusting what has happened and in my eyes it shows incompetence. 'Poppi was given the injection when she started nursery at three years old and she is nearly six. So for three years she has been walking round and has not been immunised. The jabs were supposed to protect the children against diptheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, hib and measles, mumps and rubella . 'It is a massive failure, if anything else. I’m going to complain to the General Medical Council.' Claire Hoyes, 26, also of Barnsley, received a letter for her six-year-old who was vaccinated at the surgery more than two years ago. She said: 'It is ridiculous that she has not been protected all this time. I remember taking her for the injection and them being mixed together and never thought anything of it because you trust your doctor.' The blunder was brought to the attention of Barnsley NHS public health team in April by a healthcare professional. Since then, the trust has reviewed every child’s medical records from the practice, looked at every vaccination they received and traced the children involved. Dr Ken McDonald, the medical director at NHS Barnsley, has written to all the parents offering reassurance and re-vaccination after receiving advice from the Health Protection Agency. Sharon Stoltz, head of public health for Barnsley said: 'In April we became aware that some children at one GP practice in Barnsley were given some routine childhood vaccinations which were mixed together into a single vaccination when they should have been given separately. 'Action was taken immediately once this was identified to ensure no further vaccinations were given in this way. The GP practice is now giving immunisations in lione with national guidance. 'We have worked quickly to investigate the issue and to identify those parents that needed to be informed.' The doctor involved has been required to undertake extra training and participate in a mentoring programme. Staff at the surgery declined to comment.","Vaccines were given to 221 .

An English civil servant has been awarded the title of France’s most expert cheesemonger. Matthew Feroze, 30, defeated 15 competitors and became the first foreigner to win a bi-annual cheese competition in Lyon. Mr Feroze, who is on a two-year sabbatical from his job as a Government accountant in London, has been a professional cheese refiner and seller for just one year. ‘There was some surprise, certainly,’ he told the Independent. ‘But the members of the jury and the competitors were very encouraging and friendly. If there was any resentment, they did not show it.’ Mr Feroze had to present a cheese platter that he had selected and matured himself as part of the Concours National des Fromagers at the Salon Mondiale de Restauration et Hôtellerie. He also had to blind taste cheeses and cut slices to specified weights. The self-proclaimed Francophile included two English cheeses in his platter of 25 - a Stilton and a West Country cheddar. Organiser Catherine Bonnetaud said: ‘He was best, that’s all you can say. He worked hard on his presentations, with great passion and knowledge.’ Mr Feroze took a sabbatical from his government job in 2011 and found work with one of Lyon’s most well-known cheese shops, the Fromagerie Mons-Etienne Boissy.

Police caught up with a 'person of interest' on Monday in the gruesome massacre of four women in an Oklahoma apartment. Joseph Tillman, 33, was arrested yesterday during a traffic stop in Independence, Kansas, on an outstanding warrant for a domestic assault and battery case, police revealed today. While police have been looking to speak with Tillman, he has not been named a suspect in the murder of twins Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55. Caught: Joseph Tillman, a 'person of interest' in the grisly murder, was taken into custody yesterday in Kansas . Police told the Tulsa World that Tillman has been 'known to frequent' the 61st Street and Peoria Avenue area, a crime-ridden location and the scene of the horrific murders on Monday. Cops are now working to have Tillman transported back to Tulsa. The arrest came just after a mother of one of the victims spoke out about how her daughter was getting her life back together when it was tragically cut short. Back on track: The mother of Misty Nunley, pictured, said her 33-year-old daughter was putting her life back together . Misty Nunley's mother, Cheryl Nunley, said her 33-year-old daughter had befriended Rebeika Powell and had been staying with her on and off in the apartment for the past week. She said she called her daughter nearly every morning to check in, and spoke to her Monday - just hours before the women were found shot to death.

'She's not perfect. She ran around . with some people she shouldn't have been running around with, but she . was getting her life back together.' Misty Nunley was found murdered on Monday, along with the twins - both mothers of young children - and Julie Jackson, 55. Also in the apartment was a 3-year-old boy who is believed to have witnessed the entire shooting. He was unharmed. Detectives and officers were 'beating the bushes' to figure out what happened, police spokesman Leland Ashley said Monday. Relatives and neighbors have told Nunley's family there may have been a romantic spat between one of the women who lived at the apartment and a boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Police wouldn't comment on those rumors. In an interview with CBS News, Rebeika and Kayetie's grief-stricken father, Larry Powell cried out: 'My life's gone. My kids are gone.'

Neighbor Jamie Kramer, a 28-year-old mother of two young children, has lived at the apartment complex for 10 years. She said the crime seems to come in cycles and that things had been pretty quiet for several months until Monday. 'It escalates and goes back down, it escalates and it goes back down,' she says.

An Army brigadier general has been charged with forcible sodomy, multiple counts of adultery and having inappropriate relationships with several female subordinates, two U.S. defense officials said today. Jeffrey A Sinclair,  who served as deputy commander in . charge of logistics and support for the 82nd Airborne Division in . Afghanistan, was sent home in May because of the allegations. Sinclair faces possible courts martial on charges that include forced sex, wrongful sexual conduct, violating an order, possessing pornography and alcohol while deployed, and misusing a government travel charge card and filing fraudulent claims. Scroll down for video . Shroud of secrecy: Brigadier General Jeffrey A Sinclair has been charged with forcible sodomy of female subordinates and was sent home from Afghanistan to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in May . Sinclair was informed of the charges on Monday, and the next step will be an Article 32 investigation - an impartial investigation before he maybe referred to a general court martial. The charges were announced at a brief press conference on Wednesday at Fort Bragg, the sprawling U.S. Army base in North Carolina that is home to the 82nd Airborne. After reading a prepared statement, base spokesman Col. Kevin Arata refused to take any questions. Reporters were told all questions would have to be made in writing and that no response was likely to come until the following day. No date has been set for the public hearing. It was not clear if Sinclair had an attorney. The charges are under the military legal system called the Uniform Code of Military Justices. The term 'forcible sodomy' is defined as contact between a sex organ and any part of another person’s body. 'It's a fall back charge,' a military lawyer who asked to remain anonymous and is unfamiliar with the particulars of Sinclair’s case told Fox News. He added that when rape would be difficult to prove lawyers often opt for the 'forcible sodomy' charge. Sinclair had arrived in Afghanistan for his deployment in September 2011, but had been serving in the division since July 2010. Sinclair, a trained paratrooper who has been in the Army for 27 years, was serving his third deployment to Afghanistan. He had also served two tours in Iraq, as well as a tour in the first Gulf war. He has been decorated in battle including with the Bronze Star Medal. Sinclair was recruited through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps in 1985 from the University of West Virginia. He has a bachelor’s degree in political science from the school along with a master’s from Central Michigan University and a master’s in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College. Deployment: Members of the military at NATO's Regional Command in Kandahar, Afghanistan where Sinclair had been posted since 2010 . The 82nd Airborne Division headquarters are in charge of NATO's Regional Command South in Kandahar province, Afghanistan. Details . have only begun to emerge about the scandal with little information . available about the time frame of the charges against Sinclair. Fort Bragg spokesman Ben Abel confirmed it was a 'criminal investigation', according to The Fayetteville Observer. Sinclair was reassigned to the U.S army base in May as special assistant to the commanding general of the 18th Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg. It . is highly unusual for a senior member of the armed forces to be removed . from their position,  investigated and face a court martial. There have been only two cases in recent years. Earlier this year, Army Brig. Gen. Roger Duff pleaded guilty to charges of conduct unbecoming an officer, wearing unauthorized awards or ribbons and making a false official statement. He was sentenced to two months confinement and dismissal from the military. Under a pre-trial agreement, only the dismissal may be imposed. The case is still pending, said Army spokesman George Wright. Prior to that, Maj. Gen. David Hale pleaded guilty to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an officer and one count of making a false statement, also in connection with adultery. He was fined $10,000 and was ordered to retire at the reduced rank of brigadier general, Wright said.

Movember, Helen's moustache will grow . as the month goes on.

Dieters all have their own theories on which strategy works but according to psychologists, joining a slimming group is the best way to lose weight. Researchers found that the support received at such groups led to dieters losing three times as much as those attending  groups supervised by medical professionals. The study also found that those attending slimming classes, such as Weight Watchers, lose double the amount of weight than those who followed a strict weight-loss programme set up by a doctor. Those following a WeightWatchers diet plan lost three times as much weight as those seeking medical advice . The findings suggest that inspiration from someone who has personally had weight-loss success is often more successful than medical programmes set up by GPs. Group classes which encourage members to share experiences and reach a ‘goal weight’ proved particularly successful, it was said. In the trial, 141 overweight and obese men and women were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of weight loss treatment by a health professional, or 48 weeks of Weight Watchers, or a combined treatment consisting of 12 weeks of the former then 36 weeks of the latter. The investigators assumed that the combined treatment would produce better weight losses than Weight Watchers alone, but contrary to expectations, Weight Watchers participants had lost more weight at the end of treatment. Those participating in the study who used WeightWatchers lost the most weight . In fact, more than one third of the Weight Watchers participants lost 10 per cent or more of their starting weight, compared to 15 per cent of those in the combined group and 11 per cent in the professionally-led group. The trial, run by City University of New York, was the first to compare professionally-delivered group-based behavioural weight-loss treatment to Weight Watchers, which is led by trained peer counsellors who have achieved their own weight loss. Weight Watchers was chosen because it is the largest commercial slimming programme in the US and is behaviourally-oriented, focusing on changing eating habits and doing more exercise to lose weight. Angela Marinilli Pinto, assistant professor of psychology at Baruch College in the City University of New York, who led the trial, said: ‘This study is important because, with almost 70 per cent of American adults classified as overweight or obese, there is a need to provide practical treatment solutions that are effective, accessible, and affordable. ‘Results of this study demonstrate that the Weight Watchers program can produce clinically meaningful weight losses.’ A spokesman for Weight Watchers said: ‘Weight Watchers provides state-of-the-art weight-management services that are as good as the standard behaviour therapy delivered by healthcare professionals. ‘And Weight Watchers costs less, is fully scalable and is usually more convenient to participate in.’ The study, funded by the US National Institutes of Health, is published in the journal Obesity.","U.S study showed that group-based weight loss is the most effective .

She’s been dazzling male viewers with her array of bikinis and generous curves - but it seems not everyone is impressed by her shower scenes, as it is reported that I’m A Celebrity star Helen Flanagan has been named as the nation’s biggest HD horror. The former Coronation Street actress topped the poll of famous faces who look worse in HD than they do in standard definition. Former prima ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell was the second biggest HD disappointment, closely followed by X Factor judge Tulisa and fashion maven Victoria Beckham. Although her shower scenes on I'm A Celebrity may have impressed, Helen Flanagan was voted the celebrity who looks worst in high definition . Simon Cowell, Adrian Chiles and Jeremy Clarkson were the male celebrities who viewers said look even worse in HD than they do in standard definition. But some celebs were judged to look even better in high definition with Holly Willoughby, Kate Middleton and Tess Daly topping the list of HD heroines. Olympic gymnast turned Strictly Come Dancing star Louis Smith and all of One Direction were named as the male celebrities who looked best in HD. One survey respondent said: 'Helen Flanagan has an amazing figure but HD does her skin no favours. I suppose there’s no way to hide behind make up when you’re in the middle of the jungle.' Another voter said: 'I love Strictly Come Dancing and Darcey Bussell has added a new credibility to the show but viewed on BBC1HD she looks ten years older than on BBC1.

Tulisa Contostavlos and Simon Cowell were also classed as 'HD horrors' A male respondent added: 'For me Holly Willoughby is the celeb who looks even better in HD than she does in SD – and that is saying something.' A female X Factor fan who took part in the survey said: 'Tulisa was voted the most beautiful woman in the world last year but see her in HD and she ain’t all that. She’s covered in moles which don’t show up in SD.' Another female voter said: 'Simon Cowell looks like he’s overdone the Botox to me. Seen in HD the full horror is there for all to see. He’s like Frankenstein’s slightly younger brother.' Holly Willoughby and the Duchess of Cambridge were voted as the HD delights by TV fans . Organisers HDTVTest.co.uk stressed that the survey wasn’t a poll on attractiveness but was designed to highlight which famous names delight or disappoint when viewed in high definition. A spokesman said: 'Often it’s things like skin tones which are most dramatically revealed.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:50 EST, 6 March 2012 . A wife has defied odds of a million-to-one after discovering she is a perfect kidney match for her husband. Polly Ernest, 47, is giving husband Roger Fuller the ‘biggest gift ever’ by donating her organ to save him from a lifetime of dialysis. She made a promise to Roger nearly 20 years ago when he was first diagnosed with polycystic kidneys - a hereditary disease - that she would donate a kidney to him if he needed it. But it was not until 2009 when Roger’s health started to deteriorate that he even considered the idea. Roger Fuller and his wife Polly Ernest at home in Hereford. It is very rare for people who are not blood related to be kidney matches . Father-of-five Roger, 65, from Hereford, said: 'I never ever thought I would actually take Polly up on her offer. I never even contemplated needing it but reality has a way of coming round. 'It is the biggest gift she could ever give me. There are not many other parts of the human body one can spare. 'It is pretty unusual for strangers to be a match so it’s even rarer for a husband and wife to be compatible. It is a remarkable thing to even contemplate.' However Polly, who works with her husband as book sellers, played down her generosity candidly declaring ‘I only need one kidney’. 'I have got two kidneys and you only need one - it was as simple as that,' she said. 'If you have got something and by giving something you can help someone else why would I not do it? I had no idea about how unusual it is for a husband and wife to be a match.' Company director Roger continued: 'Since going for dialysis over the last year I really seriously considered what was going on and that’s when the promise came back up. 'There is a risk for Polly, nobody is denying that. The children are old enough to know what is going on and they don’t like it really because it takes mum out of the house and they are aware of the fact that these sort of things can go terribly wrong. 'But they see the benefit that we can be much more spontaneous in our lives. It is a gift to me and it is also a gift for the family. We are a family and we support each other.' Polly promised Roger a kidney (pictured on their wedding day in 1994 with son Sebastian) nearly two decades ago . Polly had to consider keeping her kidney in case one of her children needed it when they are older as it is likely some will have the condition. She added: 'I had to think about my children or Roger. But by the time they would need it the organ will be old and hopefully a transplant won’t be necessary by then because it should be a curable condition.' The couple, who have three sons and two daughters, lived near Montpellier in France for four-and-a-half years before they moved back to Herefordshire last year. Roger has been having dialysis three times a week, with each session lasting four hours, since September 2009. Roger said they had put their lives on hold since then. The operation has been cancelled four times so couple are eager for it to go ahead. It is scheduled to take place at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham during the first week of April. 'The first six months will be harder, it will be tougher because he will more incapacitated than he currently is but after that he should be able to go on holiday, which will be really nice,' Polly said. 'It will be really nice to be able to be spontaneous again.' Professor Neil Turner, Chairman of Kidney Research UK, said: 'For kidney patients in need of a transplant, there’s a strong chance that their parents, siblings or children will be a perfect match, because they are directly related. 'However, the chances of receiving a good match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million. 'With 7,000 people in the UK currently awaiting a kidney transplant, we desperately need more people to join the organ donor register. 'We also need more research aimed at improving the lifespan of transplanted kidneys, which currently only last around 10 to 15 years before needing to be replaced.'",Polly has decided to donate kidney to husband rather than wait to see if one of her children need it .

Christine Jorgenson underwent gender reassignment in Denmark in 1953 . and was the first person to go public after the surgery. She is seen here at the age of 26 in archive footage that was recently posted on the website of the historic newsreel company to mark the 60 year anniversary of the operation. The world's first transsexual Christine Jorgenson as seen in footage by British Pathe . The black and white clip is billed as “GI” CHRISTINE RETURNS HOME and shows Jorgenson being greeted by a huge pack of cameramen as she arrives back at an airport in the USA. She was born as the son of a carpenter and grew up in New York’s tough Bronx district. A plummy-voiced narrator tells viewers: 'A 26 year old ex GI arrives home from Denmark where doctors converted him into a woman. Two years ago the name was George Jorgenson. Today it is Christine.' Wearing a matching fur coat and hat Christine holds a cigarette while a reporter attempts to interview her. She nervously answers a few questions before being seemingly over-awed by the attention. She tells the cameramen: 'I don’t have any plans at the moment, and I thank you all for coming, but I think it is too much.' Despite her initial discomfort in front of the cameras, Christine later became a famous spokesperson for transgender people and toured universities and colleges to talk about her life.

'Christine had been born George Jorgenson and was one of the first to have a sex change using surgery and hormone replacement therapy. 'The story caused a sensation and amongst the media scrum, the Pathe cameras caught a brief interview with Christine. Interestingly, we also have a clip of Christine receiving the woman of the year award in 1953 for her contribution to science. 'Even though it was 60 years ago, the clips show a tolerance and progressive interest in sex change.' Before joining the army in 1945 she attended photography college, and in later life she also worked as an actress and a singer.

Wrapped . in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips . painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been . when she departed. Pioneer: George Jorgensen, left, shocked the . nation in December 1952 by returning from a trip to Denmark as a . 27-year-old woman named Christine, right . Jorgensen was one of the first patients to undergo both surgery and hormone therapy to change her gender, according to the BBC. 'Ex-GI becomes blonde beauty!' one U.S. headline declared as the news broke. Jorgensen . had a happy childhood, growing up in the Bronx in a close-knit family. But as she reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born . into the wrong body - that of a man instead of a woman. 'The . young Jorgensen never identified himself with homosexuality but rather . as a woman who happened to be in a man's body,' Teit Ritzau, a Danish . doctor and documentary maker who got to know Christine Jorgensen when he . made a film about her in the 1980s, told the British broadcaster. While . living as George, Christine said in her autobiography that she felt . physically sick when men approached her, despite being attracted to . them. Starlet: Wrapped in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been when she departed . Embraced: Christine Jorgensen, pictured in 1953 with Milton Berle, was invited to all the most glamourous parties . But in the late 1940s, after a . short career in the military, Jorgensen read about Christian Hamburger, a . Danish doctor who was experimenting with sex change therapy using . animals to test hormones. She booked her ticket to Copenhagen in 1950, convincing her Danish-born parents she intended to visit relatives. 'I . was a bit nervous because there were too many people at that period who . insisted I was crazy,' Jorgensen recalled years after the operation. 'But Dr Hamburger didn't feel there was anything particularly strange . about it.' Dr . Hamburger quickly diagnosed Jorgensen as transsexual and prescribed her . a long course of female hormones, encouraging her to take on a female . identity for the first time and to start wearing women's clothing in . public. 'The . first sign was an increase in size of the mammary glands and then hair . began to grow where the patient had a bald patch on the temple,' he . later said, according to the BBC. Trapped: As Jorgensen, pictured, reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born into the wrong body . Previous life: George Jorgensen, pictured left and right, had a short stint in the U.S. military before undergoing the operation . 'Finally the whole body changed from a male to a female shape.' Psychologist Dr Georg Sturup assessed Christine and was quickly convinced that she knew what she was doing. To . proceed, Dr Sturup successfully persuaded the Danish government to . allow castration for such medical purposes. It had previously been . outlawed. After . taking the female hormones for more than a year, Jorgensen underwent . the first of a number of operations to transform her genitals from male . to female. It . is unclear exactly what Dr Hamburger and his team did during the . surgeries but, according to the BBC, it's likely they followed the lead . set by a group of surgeons several decades earlier. The . first attempt at a modern sex change is believed to have taken place as . early as the 1930s in Berlin on a patient known as Lili Elbe. It, . however, was unsuccessful and Elbe died of complications during one of . the operations. But the medical notes the pioneering doctors made were a . helpful guide. Content: While not finding love, it is believed Christine Jorgenson, centre, had a contented life . Supportive: After the procedure, Christine wrote to her parents stating: 'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter' 'Apparently the surgery was . successful enough for Jorgensen to feel satisfied,' Teit Ritzau told the . BBC of Christine's operation. 'There . seemed to be no complications and no side-effects from the treatment, . which is quite amazing when you think about how primitive things were at . the time.' Christine touched on the results in interviews but never went into detail. 'Everyone . is both sexes in varying degrees. I am more of a woman than a man... Of . course I can never have children but this does not mean that I cannot . have natural sexual intercourse - I am very much in the position right . now of a woman who has a hysterectomy,' she said in 1958, the BBC . reported. Luckily, Christine's parents were supportive of her decision. After the procedure, she wrote them a note. 'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter,' she said. Later, she said her mother had always known her son wasn't like the other boys. When . she returned to New York, there was little hostility towards the . new-found bombshell. Instead she was greeted with curiosity, fascination . and respect by the media and the public. She . became a Hollywood star with theatre and film contracts piling up and . invitations to all the most glamorous parties being thrown at her. Christine was even crowned Woman of the Year by the Scandinavian Society in New York. Tragic: The influential woman died of cancer in 1989, aged 62 . Sexual revolution: Christine Jorgensen's sex change was the beginning of the sexual revolution . Trying to explain her sudden popularity, Jorgensen once said: 'I guess they all want to take a peek.' She . made a comfortable living singing and performing around the country . throughout the 1960s and 1970s but her personal life was less . successful. Her first serious relationship broke down soon after their engagement. The . next went as far as the register office, only for Jorgensen to be . refused a marriage license when she pulled out a man's birth . certificate, the BBC reported. 'I haven't found the right fella yet,' she regularly told reporters. Mr Ritzau believes that, overall, she had a contented life despite her apparent loneliness. 'There . had been ups and downs and I think she had a little problem with . alcohol, but in the end she was very straightforward, and she told me . that the best company she had was herself,' he recalls. Jorgensen died of cancer in 1989, at the age of 62. A . few years before she passed away, she travelled back to Denmark to . reunite for the last time with the doctors that changed her gender and . her life. With good humour, she acknowledged the significance of her operation, nearly 40 years earlier.

We’re often told that walking 10,000 steps a day will help keep us trim and stave off diseases such as heart disease and cancer. But with today’s hectic pace of life it can be difficult to find the time. Now an American company has come up with what it claims is the solution – exercise while you work. TrekDesk, as it is known, is a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work. The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. Incredibly, it also claims to boost mood and productivity – although it remains hard to fathom how productive typing while walking would be. A statement on the company’s website says: ‘In fact, many studies have shown that your concentration and productivity will increase walking with a treadmill desk. 'You will notice immediately that you do not suffer from the daily bouts of fatigue that may plague you after lunch and later in the day. Increased blood flow to the brain also keeps you sharp and attentive.’ Despite the possible difficulty of such multi-tasking, it adds: ‘There is a  distinction between a workout at work involving slow movement with a TrekDesk Treadmill desk and what people normally associate with exercise at a gym.’ The desk, which costs £300, is designed to fit over any treadmill and measures 72x34inches. It also features a manuscript holder, allowing you to read books, magazines or manuscripts while you type, talk and walk. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. It is also said to boost mood and productivity . There are even two cup holders in case you work up a sweat – but the manufacturer maintains the level of exercise isn’t vigorous enough to cause sweating. Research published last month found that lounging in a chair for too long can double the risk of diabetes, heart disease and death. The findings indicated that sitting is bad in itself, irrespective of other time spent exercising or playing sport. Professor Stuart Biddle, from the University of Loughborough, who was one of the researchers, said office staff should take a stand for health by refusing to sit down at meetings and moving their work station to the nearest filing cabinet. The study, published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, analysed research data on people with different levels of sedentary behaviour.Compared with the least sedentary, those who spent the most time sitting down had a 112 per cent greater risk of diabetes. Similarly, the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes was increased by 147 per cent in the most sedentary, and death linked to heart disease by 90 per cent. However one of the problems many of us face is the lack of time to exercise, said Steve Bordley, CEO of TrekDesk Treadmill Desk. ‘TrekDesk was designed specifically for individuals whose employment or daily schedules confine them to a desk all day. Study after study has confirmed that staying in motion will increase health and productivity, it is not a surprise that more physical activity would also increase levels of life satisfaction as well.’","The TrekDesk is a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work .

NHS Direct is to close most of its call centres with the loss of hundreds of nursing and other jobs, union leaders said today. Unison said 24 out of 30 sites will close at the service, which employs 1,500 frontline nursing and other professional staff. Sandra Maxwell, Unison’s convenor at NHS Direct, said: 'Hundreds of dedicated nursing and NHS professionals are to be made redundant at a huge cost, when their skills could be used within the new NHS111 service if only the Department of Health took some decisive action.' NHS Direct (left) is gradually to be replaced by the NHS 111 service (promoted right), for non-emergency medical advice in England . National officer Michael Walker said: 'The Secretary of State for Health should step in and stop this disaster immediately. We need action and we need it now. 'Axing dedicated hard-working nurses is never a good idea at any time, but this will directly impact on patient care. There is no doubt that patients will suffer as a result of this move.' Unison said large centres in Bristol, Sheffield, Wakefield, Nottingham, Hull, Stafford, Chelmsford and Newcastle were among those set to close. 'Given that many of these NHS call centres are in areas of high unemployment there are very real fears for the staff’s future job prospects. 'The Government spending millions on making nurses and NHS professionals redundant at a time when the NHS is under great strain is truly scandalous,' said a union spokesman. An NHS Direct spokeswoman said the company had been bidding for contracts across England to provide the NHS 111 service, which is used when a patient needs medical help but it is not a 999 emergency. The organisation has been awarded contracts to provide the NHS 111 services for 34 per cent of the population in England. She said the 111 service will be delivered from six of its 30 call centres. 'This does not necessarily mean we will be closing the other sites,' she said. The organisation is waiting for some decisions by the NHS Commissioning Board before the future of the other centres will be decided, she added. Dr Peter Carter from the RCN said: 'Plans to replace NHS Direct with 111 are a mistake and will result in nothing more than a pale shadow of what NHS Direct is' Every year, NHS Direct answers 4.2 million calls for health advice and information for patients in England. Healthcare professionals, nurses, and dental advisers give expert information and advice over the phone and are available 365 days a year. Nick Chapman, NHS Direct Chief Executive, said: 'We have not confirmed that any sites are closing. At this stage we have confirmed which sites we will be keeping open to deliver NHS 111 in the areas where we have been commissioned to provide the service. 'The sites are: Middlebrook, Carlisle, Dudley, Exeter, Milton Keynes and London.  Home working will be an option for some of our nurses as an alternative to working from a site. 'The future of other NHS Direct sites has not been decided. We are in discussion with the Department of Health and the NHS Commissioning Board about the future of other non-111 services that we could be asked to deliver before making decisions.' Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'For a while we have said that the plans to replace NHS Direct with 111 are a mistake and will result in nothing more than a pale shadow of what NHS Direct is. 'We have always been huge supporters of NHS Direct and believe it has matured into a highly effective service providing tried and tested quality advice. 'Everyone must be made aware that the Government is effectively abolishing this vital service purely on a cost cutting basis. This is a foolish and ill conceived decision.' NHS Direct confirmed that centres in Carlisle, Dudley, Exeter, Milton Keynes and Middlebrook, Bolton, will be used to provide the NHS 111 service. One of three sites in Greater London will also be used, but it has not been confirmed whether it will be the site in Beckenham, the Ilford office, or the centre at NHS Direct's head office in Leman Street, east London. The future of the following sites are uncertain: Chesterfield, Derby, Hull, Mansfield, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Stockton, Wakefield, Blackburn, Kendal, Liverpool, Nantwich, Stafford, Bedford, Chatham, Chelmsford, Southampton, Ipswich, Norwich, Bristol, Ferndown in Dorset, and Truro.","Shake-up will lead to loss of hundreds of nursing jobs, says Unison .

A baby girl proved she was a born fighter when she let out three yelps and lifted her arm - even though she was delivered three months premature. Isla Wilson had stopped growing in her mother’s womb 15 weeks early, weighed just 1lb 12oz and measured 11 inches from head to toe. She was so underdeveloped she spent her first five months fighting for life in an incubator. Fighter: Isla when she was in intensive care. She was on and off life support three times during her five month stay in hospital . Doctors had to battle to restart Isla's heart when she was four days old. She also suffered a bleed to her brain, was on a ventilator for almost a month and needed three blood transfusions. But despite being one of the smallest babies to be born in Scotland, her incredible actions reassured her worried parents, Julie and Steven, that their daughter was determined to live. Now aged 19 months, and against all odds, Isla, is like any other happy-go-lucky toddler, who loves being on her feet. She still needs oxygen as her lungs continue to develop, but doctors are hopeful she will be off all breathing aids by this summer. Isla is now learning to walk, talk and explore. She still needs oxygen but is expected to be off all breathing aids by this summer . Mrs Wilson, 32, from Newtonhill, Aberdeenshire, said: 'We just feel so lucky still to have her. 'In the beginning we couldn’t get past the next hour, then it was the next week and the next month. But as time went on and she got bigger we got more confident that she was going to survive. 'Things like her first smile, and even when she started bottle feeding, were all things we thought we would never see. 'We were too scared to think about it because we didn’t want to get our hopes up, in case something happened. 'Now her laugh is the best thing in the world. She’s such a lovely, happy wee thing.' Mrs Wilson, an occupational therapist, had gone to work as normal the day Isla was born. She . had a growth scan that afternoon and was expecting to return to work. But doctors discovered Isla had stopped growing just 25 weeks into her . mother's pregnancy due to a rare complication and was essentially . starving to death. So Isla was delivered by emergency caesarean section that evening 11 weeks early. Now: Isla with her delighted mother Julie and father Steven. They say she is now full of energy . Mrs Wilson said: 'It was such a shock. Isla’s heart rate dropped and she stopped moving. They just needed to get her out of me. 'It was terrifying because we had no control over the situation. 'But the first time we got to see her about five hours after she was born, the nurse said, ‘you’ve got a feisty one there‘. 'If she hadn’t had that fight in her, I don’t think she would be here now.' To recognise Isla’s amazing courage and lust for life, she recently received a Build-A-Bear Workshop Champion Children Award at the Tommy’s Lets Get Friendly Baby Awards in London. Mrs Wilson and her husband, a courier, were warned not expect their baby to cry when she was born at 29 weeks, as her lungs were so underdeveloped. But Mrs Wilson said: 'She let out three little squawks like a cat’s meow and she opened half and eye and lifted an arm. It was quite reassuring, but we never heard her make another noise until weeks after.' Isla had to be fully ventilated three times during her five months in Aberdeen Maternity Hospital and given steroids to help her lungs mature. The first attempt to take her off life support was made when she was four days old. But, struggling for breath, she had to be re-ventilated and following complications, Isla went into cardiac arrest and doctors had to battle to re-start her heart. Mrs Wilson, who had to wait 16 days before she got to hold her newborn, said: 'We were petrified. She was just so tiny. All your instincts are to protect your child. If she cried, I just wanted to pick her up but we couldn’t because of all the wires and tubes. 'She could hardly move her limbs because she had so many needles in them.' But Mrs Wilson said when she did eventually get to hug Isla, it was the “best cuddle ever”. 'She was inside my top and she just settled down and fell asleep. I just sat there with a big grin on my face.' Steven with daughter Isla. He and wife Julie have made a pact 'not to worry about insignificant little things' When she was born her head was smaller than the palm of her mother’s hand and from head to toe she measured only the length of a classroom ruler. Doctors warned Mr and Mrs Wilson that because she needed steroids at such a young age and her brain had been starved of oxygen as a result of being on and off the ventilator, there was a chance it would affect her development. But against all odds, Isla is now learning to walk, talk and explore like any inquisitive toddler. 'You can see her developing, which is great,' said Mrs Wilson. 'She is really bright. She loves being on her feet, she’s active and into everything. Out of all her toys, she’ll pick out her books. 'She wakes up smiling and laughing. 'As a first child she is always going to be special, but even more so now. I can’t praise the neonatal staff enough. They worked so hard and if it wasn’t for their care and expertise Isla wouldn’t be here today.'

The healthcare watchdog today demanded immediate improvement at a hospital where a ten-year-old child died amid allegations she was given the wrong medication. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) moved into disaster-hit Basildon University Hospital on November 3 following the tragic death. They also investigated reports a second child had become seriously unwell after being given out-of-date medication. Now the watchdog has warned the hospital to sort out its 'unacceptable' paediatric services to avoid heavy fines - or being shut down. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) moved into disaster-hit Basildon University Hospital on November 3 following the tragic death . Worryingly, the hospital was slapped with the same warnings just four months ago in its adult services. The latest CQC inspection found out-of-date medication that should have been discarded during its previous visit. Inspectors also discovered ill children who should be seen a doctor within 15 minutes were regularly waiting up to an hour. Andrea Gordon, CQC deputy director of operations, today said that  change at the blighted hospital was 'imperative'. She said: 'What our inspectors found at the trust on 3 November was completely unacceptable. 'We have taken this action to assist in driving through improvements which have a positive impact on the people being cared for at the hospital. 'It is imperative that the trust now ensures it makes changes which are sustainable, embedded and maintained for the future.' She added: 'It is highly disappointing that the trust is again in breach of the same two regulations albeit in relation to different parts of the service it offers. 'That is why we have asked the trust to look deeper at its own processes, policies and procedures by commissioning an investigation. 'We have been working closely with our partner agencies with regard to the trust and our concerns about it. 'The trust has already given us assurances of what action it intends to take and we will be closely monitoring its progress on the improvements it needs to make. 'Our inspectors will return in the near future and if we find the required progress is not made we won’t hesitate to use our legal powers to protect the people who use this service.' The little girl believed to have been given out of date medication was transferred to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, where she died. A Basildon University Hospital spokesman said the second child continued treatment at Basildon Hospital and suffered 'no long term damage.' Sources at the hospital claimed incorrect or out of date medication was dispensed by staff and may have lead to the death and illness. The CQC also investigated reports a second child had become seriously unwell after being given out-of-date medication (posed by model) The Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust had recently carried out an audit of expired medication. But CQC inspectors found medicines that should have been discarded during their visit. Hospital staff also admitted there were often considerable delays in children receiving appropriate medical attention when there was concerns over their condition deteriorating. Inspectors saw reports showing a significant drop in permanent paediatric consultants. Shockingly, investigators found waiting times shot up after 5pm and at weekends when there were not enough doctors to meet demand.Despite the shortcomings the CQC found no evidence of any effective action being taken. The trust has been found to be failing to plan and deliver care to meet the needs of children in a way that ensured their welfare and safety. The CQC warnings are in relation to the essential standards, the care and welfare of service users and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision. It must now make improvements in the two identified areas by January 13 and commission an independent investigation into its paediatric services. If the trust fails the CQC can issue financial penalty notices and cautions or prosecute the provider for failing to meet essential standards. In the most serious the CQC has the power to suspend or cancel a service provided by the trust. The crisis at the hospital, run by Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, comes after a catalogue of failings unearthed by inspections in recent years. In 2001, conditions at Basildon University Hospital were described as 'Third World' by the Royal College of Nursing because of a shortage of beds. Then, in 2004, Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was fined for failing to control the risk of legionnaire’s disease. In 2007 the Trust was forced to admit being at fault for the case of a child who was left disabled after she was starved of oxygen when she was born at Basildon Hospital in 2001. Then in 2008 more than 200 new mothers were offered HIV tests after the Trust discovered that a member of staff who had delivered their babies was HIV positive. The hospital was in the news again in April 2009 after a three-year-old girl died in the paediatric ward after intravenous drip bags were found to have been sabotaged. A report by the CQC’s predecessor, called Monitor, in 2009 found dozens of patients died needlessly as a result of filthy conditions and appalling nursing care. Shocking figures showed the mortality rate at the hospital was more than a third higher than the national average and at least 70 people may have died who should have been saved. It used its legal powers to demand that Basildon and Thurrock tackle 'inadequate arrangements to treat children in A&E, with few specialist paediatric staff'. The CQC carried out a series of unannounced inspections at the hospital in June and July this year after reports of children waiting for treatment in the A&E department. They issued the hospital trust with a formal warning after the death of an infant who was not assessed within the A&E 15 minutes target time. The child, who was suffering from blood poisoning, was not medically assessed for 55 minutes. The infant was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital for specialist care, but doctors decided no further treatment was possible.","Basildon University Hospital Under fire after child was given out-of-date medication .

The valves in Liam Dalgarno’s heart were so narrow that it caused severe pressure on the left side of his heart. His mother said doctors told her it had swollen to the size of a football. Parents Kirsty Taylor and Peter Dalgarno, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, were warned their newborn son would die unless he had an operation - but he could also die during surgery. Scroll down for video . Liam after his first operation: His heart valves were so narrow it caused pressure on the left side of his heart . X-rays showing Liam's heart pre (left) and post (right) operation. His faulty heart valve was replaced with a pig's heart valve . Now, after battling through six more operations to fix his heart, little Liam looks like any healthy three-year-old. Full-time . mother Kirsty, 22, said: 'When doctors said his heart was the size of a . football we couldn’t understand. How was our tiny baby surviving with a . heart that huge? 'We . were told we could either go ahead with the surgery or take him home to . die. Saying goodbye to our son was unthinkable so we agreed to the . surgery. 'Liam was whisked away so quickly that I felt like I didn’t have a son - the feeling haunted me for months. 'I . never even dreamed I’d be choosing schools for my little boy. It’s . fantastic to see him living like any other three-year-old.' Kirsty’s . pregnancy had been normal up to 38 weeks when she went for her final . check up. She collapsed in the midwife’s office and started bleeding . heavily. All grown up: Liam (left) with father Peter, mother Kirsty and sister Scarlett. His mother said: 'We treasure every moment' What a difference three years makes: Mother Kirsty feared she would lose little Liam (aged 3 months left), but he battled through surgery . She said: 'At first the doctors tried to say it was normal but they soon realised it was serious and I had to go into labour. It took 13 hours and Liam was two weeks early but everything seemed fine. 'Back on the ward I realised straight away he wasn’t moving and kept buzzing the nurses. They said he had a headache and was having trouble breathing. 'They took him for x-rays and checks twice, and the third time he never came back. I didn’t know where my new son was from 3am to 9am. 'When he got moved to intensive care it was petrifying. Me and Peter were only young and had never seen anyone in intensive care before. We kept thinking ‘Why us?’ 'I had to watch other new mums taking photos of their kids and taking them home when I didn’t even know where mine was. 'But all the hospital staff were incredible. In Birmingham, away from all our friends and family, they supported us the whole time.' The condition, called critical aortic stenosis, means the valve taking blood out of the heart is narrowed, affecting the flow of blood to the body and the circulation of oxygen to the brain. Liam as he was transported from Newcastle under Lyme hospital to Birmingham Children's Hospital . Precious bundle: First time Peter got to hold his son Liam . Liam’s cardiology consultant, Dr Desai, said: 'Liam was born with a very critical aortic stenosis. It causes a severe impact on the pumping chamber and hence the body circulation is significantly compromised. 'He had an emergency procedure at just 12 hours old and has since undergone a further three open heart surgeries. 'We were initially concerned that his heart function wouldn’t recover fully however we are delighted that Liam’s heart is now functioning much like any other child his age. 'He does face further operations in the future, but we are all pleased with Liam’s progress.' In May last year Liam had an operation to replace his valve with a pig’s heart valve. Kirsty said: 'I don’t really like the thought of Liam having an animal inside him but it’s whatever it takes to keep him alive.' The new family together: Liam's parents have made a book for him to help him understand his heart condition . Father Peter, 25, a fast food worker, added: “It’s a bit weird to think a pig is keeping your little boy alive. 'The valve will need replacing as Liam gets older and grows so we tell him the scar on his chest is a zip so the doctors can get in and out easily.' The young parents have also made a book for Liam to help him understand his heart condition.Kirsty said: 'It’s hard to explain to a little boy why he has to go to hospital when his cousins and friends don’t. 'We can’t give him the book yet because he’s at that age where he’ll destroy it, but we show him and tell him about his heart problem all the time.' Aortic stenosis is a heart defect that may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (develop later in life). If the problem is congenital, then something occurred during the first eight weeks of pregnancy to affect the development of the aortic valve.The aortic valve is found between the left ventricle in the heart and the aorta - the largest artery in the body. It has three 'leaflets' that function like a one-way door, allowing blood to flow forward into the aorta, but not backward into the left ventricle. Aortic stenosis is the inability of the aortic valve to open completely. With aortic stenosis, problems with the aortic valve make it harder for the leaflets to open and permit blood to flow forward from the left ventricle to the aorta. This means it's harder for the blood to flow through the valve and can cause the heart to enlarge. Congenital aortic stenosis occurs in 4 to 6 per cent of all children with congenital heart disease and is three times more common in boys than girls. Around one in 45 births is affected by a congenital heart condition. Few children show symptoms during infancy, but problems tend to increase sharply in adulthood. Christmas is a particularly special time for the family as Liam had his second operation on Boxing Day. Kirsty said: 'That first Christmas was hard because we thought we’d be at home with a happy, healthy baby by then - instead we were still back and forth to the hospital. 'This year we plan to spend as much time as possible with all our families to make sure everyone gets to see Liam and his little sister Scarlett, who is seven months old. 'We treasure every family moment because we know how close we were to losing Liam. 'Now we’ve stopped thinking ‘Why us?’ and started thinking how lucky we are that Liam is strong enough to keep going. 'I know he’ll face whatever comes his way with his cheeky smile.'","Little Liam diagnosed with faulty valve which made his heart swell .

Heather Weir and boyfriend Jamie Ness could not understand why their normally active golden labrador wanted to sleep all day . A couple say they owe their lives to their pet labrador after his strange behaviour prompted them to call in engineers. Heather Weir and Stoke City footballer Jamie Ness could not understand why their normally active dog Alfie suddenly wanted to sleep all day. Investigations eventually revealed that the couple's Aga cooker was leaking lethal carbon monoxide gas that could have killed them. One-year-old Alfie was sleepy because he was being slowly poisoned by the colourless, odourless gas. Ms Weir, 22, who works as a model, said: 'Without his strange behaviour Jamie and I would have went months not realizing what was leaking into our home. 'I love him so much and I'm so thankful to have such a wonderful companion - he saved our life.' Heather and Jamie, 21, moved from Glasgow where Jamie used to play fro Rangers to their new home in Cheshire in July. After noticing a strange smell, Heather had the stove checked and discovered it had been serviced and passed that month. However, she said: 'Within the past four weeks, Alfie was sleeping all day. He had stopped playing with his toys and was just very lethargic.' After returning from a family trip to the United States, Heather noticed Alfie was getting worse. She said: 'He just wasn't right at all. Usually Alfie would be up and down like a yo-yo pestering me to play but instead, he went up to our room and slept for five hours.' Heather had experienced a few brief moments of sickness but Jamie did not show any symptoms at all. Determined to get the bottom of Alfie's strange behaviour, she called an engineer out to the home who immediately realised what was happening. He told the couple that if Heather had not picked up on Alfie's sickness their exposure to the carbon monoxide leaking from the stove 'could have been fatal'. Heather with Alfie: 'He makes our house a home', she said . Alfie's unusual behaviour alerted his owners to the carbon monoxide poisoning . 'I explained about Alfie and myself and he was so genuinely concerned and happy that he'd discovered this for us before it could have been fatal,' she said. 'He explained that the smell of gas was not nearly as dangerous as the issue with the leak of carbon monoxide. 'I cannot believe how lucky we are - had we not caught this when we did, it could have been fatal to us all. 'I don't know what I'd do without Alfie - he makes our house a home.' She added: 'Within two days of the problem being solved Alfie is back to his usual self.' Carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of around 50 people a year in the UK. Heather and Jamie said their dog was now back to his usual happy self . Stephanie Trotter OBE, president and director of CO-Gas Safety who raise awareness and publish data of CO deaths and accidents, said that carbon monoxide prevention needs a ""belt and braces"" approach. She said: 'Firstly, well done to the dog and well done to the girl. 'Often our dogs, cats and other pets are more susceptible to the gas because of their smaller lungs and weight. 'That's . why miners used to take canaries down the mines - if they stopped . singing you knew to get out because there was CO present. 'We . encourage all homes to open windows for ventilation, have their . chimneys regularly swept and install detectors - it really has to be a . belt and braces approach to keeping an eye on CO.' The RSPCA said pet owners should be more aware of their pets' behaviour. A . spokesman said: 'This demonstrates the importance of pet owners being . aware of their pet's normal behaviour and of being observant. 'If they do notice any change in their . pet's behaviour it's important to seek advice from their vet as it could . be a sign that their pet is suffering from a medical problem.' Paul Johnston, chief executive of . Gas Safe Register, commented: 'The couple involved in this incident had a . lucky escape, but tragically others are not always so fortunate. 'Carbon . monoxide is a highly poisonous gas. You can't see it, taste it or smell . it and without an adequate supply of fresh air, it can kill quickly. 'The symptoms are also very similar to flu, which at this time of year is worrying if people get the two confused.'

Two gunmen accused of murdering Anni Dewani on her honeymoon have been told they must remain in custody while a High Court decides whether the bride's husband Shrien will be extradited from the UK to stand trial with them, a South African court heard today. Alledged gangsters Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, and Xolile Mngeni, 23, appeared in court charged with murdering Mrs Dewani, who was shot dead when her taxi was hijacked in Cape Town, in November 2010. But South African authorities have asked for the pair to remain in custody and for a pre-trial hearing to be put back until a decision is made on Mr Dewani's appeal against extradition from the UK. Accused: South African Xolile Mngeni, left, looks over at Mziwamadoda Qwabe, right, in the dock at the High Court in Cape Town, where they are told they must wait in custody while a UK court decides on Shrien Dewani's appeal against extradition . Awaiting trial: Xolile Mngeni, left, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, right, were allegedly hired to kill Mrs Dewani . Senior state advocate Shareen Riley told Western Cape High Court in South Africa . today that Mr Dewani would appear alongside Mr Qwabe and Mr Mngeni if his appeal is unsuccessful. This would make him the fourth suspect involved in the case, after taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed after he admitted setting up the murder and claimed Mr Dewani offered to pay him £1,335 to take his wife 'off the scene'. But the news comes as further delays in . obtaining vital evidence for the trial were revealed - with DNA and . blood samples still not gathered from the two accused, despite the pair . already being held in custody since her murder 15 months ago. Businessman Shrien Dewani is waiting to hear the result of his High Court appeal against extradition from the UK to stand trial for the murder of his wife Anni Dewani, 28, on their honeymoon in Cape Town . Shrien Dewani will be added as the fourth accused in the honeymoon murder of his bride Anni if he is extradited from Britain, a court heard today . Anni Dewani, 28, was travelling with her husband of just two weeks . in a taxi through . an impoverished township just outside Cape Town when it was hijacked by two armed men. Mr Dewani and the taxi driver were let go by the hijackers but Mrs Dewani was taken. Police . claim that the gunmen, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, only . carried out the hijack on the instructions of Shrien Dewani himself. This, . the South African police claim, explains why both Mr Dewani and the taxi . driver Zola Tongo were allowed out of the vehicle and only Mrs Dewani was taken. She was later found dead from a gunshot to the neck in the abandoned car. The . main evidence against the Bristol-based businessman appears to be the . statement of taxi driver Zola Tongo who earned a seven year reduction in . his 25 year sentence for murder in return for making a statement about Mr Dewani's . involvement. Mr Dewani denies . the accusations against him and his lawyers argue his life would be . endangered if he were held in a South African jail and that Mr Dewani is . too mentally unwell to stand trial in South Africa.

Smokers should consider inhaling less of each cigarette and stop lighting up at designated places such as at home or work, the health watchdog said today. Nicotine patches and gum should also be prescribed to smokers to try and help them quit gradually. Previously, smokers could only be prescribed nicotine replacement products if they were to go cold turkey and stop smoking completely. But new draft guidance, from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), suggests a new slower approach could be more effective. Quitting: Patches, gum and other licensed products should be used to replace nicotine normally provided by smoking cigarettes, the draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) says . Nice has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine-containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting, those who want to smoke less and those who want to stop smoking for a specific period of time, such as during the working day. Healthcare professionals should also advise smokers that some nicotine-containing products - such as e-cigarettes - are not currently regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and so their safety and quality cannot be guaranteed. But smokers should be told these products are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes, Nice said. The guidance also suggests tobacco retailers should display licensed nicotine-containing products in shops and supermarkets. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Nice Centre for Public Health Excellence, said: ‘Smoking tobacco is responsible for over 79,000 deaths in England each year and children’s vulnerability to second-hand smoke is well documented. Kicking the habit: Nice has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine-containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting . ‘If you are a smoker, quitting smoking is the best way to improve health, and quitting in one step is most likely to be successful. However some people - particularly those who are highly dependent on smoking - may not feel able or don’t want to do this. 'Methods such as “cutting down to quit” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step' Professor Mike Kelly, Nice Centre for Public Health Excellence . ‘Harm reduction approaches provide an alternative choice, and are more successful when used with licensed nicotine-containing products. ‘Methods such as “cutting down to quit” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step. ‘“Smoking less” is an option for those who are not interested in quitting smoking, although the health benefits are not clear. However, for some people this can kick-start a gradual change in behaviour that eventually leads them to quit smoking. The guidance suggests 'cutting down prior to quitting, by smoking fewer cigarettes or inhaling or smoking less of each cigarette, with or without the help of one or more licensed nicotine-containing products'. It continues: ‘Among the provisional recommendations, this draft guidance says that health professionals should advise people who smoke and want to try cutting down to quit, or smoke less, that this is easier when using licensed nicotine-containing products. Passive smoking: Professor Mike Kelly said smoking tobacco is 'responsible for over 79,000 deaths in England each year' and children's vulnerability to second-hand smoke is 'well documented' ‘Advisers should also reassure people that licensed nicotine-containing products are a safe and effective way of reducing the harm from cigarettes, and that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products have been shown as safe for up to 5 years’ use. 'Smokers smoke for nicotine, and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine, switching to alternatives as a short - or long-term substitute is the obvious healthier choice' Professor John Britton, Royal College of Physicians tobacco advisory group . ‘Whatever approach people wish to try, they should be advised that there are no circumstances when it is safer to smoke than to use NRT products and experts believe that lifetime use of NRT will be considerably less harmful than smoking.’ The draft guidance, which has now opened for public consultation, was welcomed by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP). Professor John Britton, chair of the RCP tobacco advisory group, said: ‘Smokers smoke for nicotine, and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine, switching to alternatives as a short - or long-term substitute is the obvious healthier choice. ‘We would encourage all smokers to take up the opportunities presented by this guidance, and if they can’t quit using nicotine altogether, to switch as much as they can to an alternative nicotine product. ‘This guidance has the potential to change millions of lives for the better. We commend it.’","Nice: Patches and gum should be used to replace nicotine from cigarettes .

Two brothers arrested for the biggest pharmaceutical drug theft in U.S history might have got away with it had one of them not touched a bottle of water at the scene of the crime. Charged in Florida on Thursday, Amaury Villa, 37 and Amed Villa, 46 are accused of stealing $80 million in drugs from a Connecticut warehouse in an elaborate scheme that could have come straight out of a Hollywood heist movie. Brought in after a three-year FBI investigation, the crucial piece of evidence was a small bottle of water Amed touched, recovered from the 70,000 square-foot warehouse they robbed in Enfield, Connecticut. Brothers: Amaury (left) and Amed Villa have been arrested after two years on the run from authorities . The Cuban citizens, who reside in Miami, were described by the FBI as having run a sophisticated gang of warehouse thieves and truck-hijackers, responsible for millions of dollars worth of stolen goods being transferred across the East Coast and Midwest of the United States. Prior to March 13, 2010, the Villa brothers and their crew allegedly traveled to Connecticut to spy on the warehouse belonging to pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly according to MSNBC. And on the evening of March 13 and early morning of March 14 the gang allegedly of cut a hole into the roof of the warehouse and lowered themselves into the building using ropes. Whilst inside they disabled the security system and over the course of five hours according to federal charges used a forklift to load 49 pallets of pharmaceutical goods into a waiting truck before making their get-away said the Hartford Courant. Stealing Gemzar, a chemotherapy drug for lung cancer, anti-depressant Prozac, antipsychotic's Zyprexa and Cymbalta, the FBI and state authorities were stunned by the scope of the theft. The Eli Lilly warehouse in Enfield Conecticut was robbed by the Villa brothers and their gang on March 13 and 14 2010 . 'As far as we know, this brazen crime was the biggest theft in the history of Connecticut and the largest theft of pharmaceuticals in the United States,' said Connecticut U.S Attorney David B. Fein. The cross-state investigation dubbed, 'Operation Southern Hospitality' led to the Villa brothers being charged in Connecticut with theft and conspiracy related to the warehouse robbery. One of the brothers, Amaury is also charged along with 10 others in Florida with selling and conspiring to sell stolen pharmaceuticals. And in another related charge, federal authorities in Illinois have accused Amed Villa with the theft of 3,500 cases of cigarettes, which are valued at more than eight million dollars. 'This investigation represents the largest take-down in U.S. history involving cargo theft. The theft involves more than $100 million, including $80 million worth of pharmaceuticals,' said John V. Gillies, Special Agent in Charge for FBI Miami. Using leased forklift trucks the brothers and their gang loaded 49 pallets of pharmaceutical drugs into a truck before transporting the goods cross country to South Florida . 'Today’s arrests have dealt a major blow to this Miami-based criminal organisation. 'Cargo theft is a growing multi-billion-dollar crime that significantly impacts consumers, local governments, manufacturers, and shipping companies.' While almost all of the stolen pharmaceutical drugs were recovered from a warehouse in South Florida in October 2011, authorities were still left open-jawed at the audacious operation mounted by the Villa brothers. The charges against the Villa brothers, which date from March 12 and were unsealed on Thursday, outlined evidence of interstate travel, hotel layovers, equipment and vehicle rentals all related with the warehouse theft. Federal authorities said the heist was planned over several months. In January 2010, Amaury made his way from Miami to LaGuardia Airport, rented a car and drove to Connecticut checking into a hotel in Windsor. The next day, Eli Lilly surveillance . video recorded him looking through the front door of the Enfield . warehouse, according to the federal indictment. The following day, he returned to LaGuardia and took a flight back to Miami. In February 2010, it is alleged one . associate of Amaury hired two tractor-trailers from a firm called . TransUSA Inc and Amaury is a registered agent of the firm. The day prior to the robbery, Amaury . again made his way LaGuardia and drove to hotel that he had stayed at . previously in Windsor. Security footage at the warehouse from 10:22 and 10:32 p.m. on March 13, 2010 shows images of more individuals. Military precision: The Villa brothers used wires to lower themselves from the roof of the warehouse into the building and disabled the security cameras beforehand too . After 10:30 p.m., people using tools . purchased earlier that day at a Home Depot in New York made a hole in . the warehouse's roof and disabled some of the security system, federal . authorities said. It is then alleged that over the next five hours, the Villa brothers stole the pharmaceutical goods from the warehouse. The federal indictment states that . the thieves left the property at 3.40 a.m and later that morning, Amaury . Villa checked out of his hotel room in Windsor and that his rental car . passed through the southbound toll on the Whitestone Bridge in New York. On March 15, he returned to Miami via La Guardia airport. The Villa brothers both face a . maximum five years in jail on one count of conspiracy to commit theft . and four counts of theft from interstate shipment, each of which carries . a maximum of 10 years in prison. While authorities were initially baffled by the audacious heist, their trail led them to a storage facility in Doral, Florida where they recovered the drugs in October 2011. Piecing together the strands of their investigation, the arrests of the brothers on Thursday marked three years of FBI work across five different states.","The brothers coordinated and planned a highly sophisticated night-time raid on a Connecticut warehouse owned by drugs giant Eli Lilly in March 2010 .

A new campaign has been launched to save traditional British rhymes and songs amid fears they are dying out. The push follows sanitised, more upbeat versions of classic nursery rhymes, including Humpty Dumpty, being taught to children. In one updated version the hero didn't get bumped or bruised at all, but instead 'bungee jumped'. In another instead of being unable to 'put Humpty together again', the new version claimed all the King's horses and all the King's men 'made Humpty happy again'. The English Folk and Dance Society is running the new National Lottery funded campaign to save traditional rhymes and songs. Rachel Elliott, the society's education director, told The Telegraph: 'There can be a risk of people being oversensitive and sanitising these things. 'They have to be contextualised – we don’t want to condone drunkenness by singing about the Drunken Sailor. 'But there was a lot of drunkenness at that time. And I don’t think the song is going to encourage it now.' The original children's poem: .

The society has warned that in some schools children are more likely to learn eastern European or African songs than English ones. Some songs have been dropped because they refer to death, disease or war in ways that have been judged as no longer be suitable for children. The society's new campaign, which has attracted a £585,400 grant, will eventually create theworld’s biggest online collection of English folk music, song and dance manuscripts. Malcolm Taylor, the society's library director, told The Telegraph: 'The other cultures that you find in schools have more of a sense of tradition than the indigenous white children. 'So they will learn about folk songs from other cultures, from Poland, and Africa – as they should, to engage those people – but you need to correct it by increasing the resources for English songs.' In 2009 a government funded song book changed the lyrics of What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor? to remove and reference to alcohol or punishment. The BBC was accused of 'outrageous' political correctness . in the same year after changing the words to a nursery rhyme on a children's show.

Casey Anthony is filing for bankruptcy and claims she has less than $1,100 to her name, . The 26-year-old expected to make millions off book deals, movies and TV shows after she was acquitted in 2011 of murder in the death of her daughter Caylee. But those big-money contracts for her story never materialized and now she faces three lawsuits and owes nearly $800,000, mostly stemming from the criminal case against her. Bankrupt: Casey Anthony, in July 2011, smiles after she was acquitted in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee . Anthony filed for bankruptcy in federal court in Tampa, Florida, on Friday, claiming she is unemployed and has had no recent income. Her listed debts include $500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her criminal defense lawyer during the trial, Jose Baez; $145,660 for the Orange County Sheriff's office for a judgment covering investigative fees and costs related to the case; $68,540 for the Internal Revenue Service for back taxes, interest and penalties; and $61,505 for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for court costs. The filling also states that she is a defendant in several civil suits, including one brought by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez for defamation in Orange County, Florida. Fernandez-Gonzalez claims she was damaged by Anthony telling detectives that a baby sitter by the same name kidnapped Caylee. The detectives were investigating the 2008 disappearance of the girl, who later was found dead. Anthony's attorney said details offered by Anthony did not match Fernandez-Gonzalez and clearly showed Anthony wasn't talking about her. Court papers list Anthony as unemployed, with no recent income. Lost: Caylee (left) was reported missing in July 2008 and her body was found in Dec. 2008 . An attorney for Anthony, David Schrader, did not immediately respond to messages from the Associated Press. Anthony lists about 80 creditors in the 60-page court filing. The claims largely cover fees for legal, medical, psychiatric and forensics consulting or services. But one claim covers a debt for scuba diving services. According to the courts, the aim of seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection is to be discharged of existing debts — essentially to get a fresh financial start. A trustee may have the right to take possession of and sell non-exempt property and use the sale proceeds to pay creditors, but Anthony lists little in the way of assets. A debtor may still be held responsible for some obligations, such as taxes and student loans. Persons found to have committed ""certain kinds of improper conduct"" can also be denied bankruptcy protection. In debt: Casey Anthony owes her Attorney Jose Baez (left, in July 2011) for representing her in her highly publicized murder trial . The filing came on the same day that a Florida appellate court set aside two of the four convictions she faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her missing daughter. Though Anthony was acquitted of killing Caylee, jurors convicted her of four counts of lying to detectives, and her attorneys appealed those convictions. Anthony was sentenced to time served for the misdemeanors. She was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for an unrelated case. For her protection, her whereabouts have been kept secret since she was released from state supervision last year.","Anthony, 26, is trying to renege on $800,000 in debts - mostly stemming from the death of her daughter Caylee .

Her mother is expected to fly her ashes back to the UK to be buried. One attendee, who wouldn't be named, said: 'Everyone was crying and sobbing, it was very sad. 'People couldn't hold back their grief . as the pastor spoke, saying how Imani had been so full of life and such . a happy girl. She was always willing to hep anyone and loved to be . around people.' Grief-stricken: Imani's grandmother Sandra Fisher (centre) is pictured comforting other members of her family during the memorial service . Imani's grandmother Mrs Fisher, 54, said: 'It was so, so . hard. I couldn't get up and say anything at the service. I wish I had . the strength to stand up and talk but I just couldn't. 'Donna felt the same, it was just too difficult. 'We had invited all of our friends so everyone who loved Imani could say goodbye to her.' Among those who paid tribute to Imani during the service was a woman police officer, while the congregation sang hymns including 'Jesus Loves Me'. Imani was shot dead on January 11 when a masked gunman burst into the family's roadside cafe in Trelawny, northwest Jamaica, and opened fire. The Tooting schoolgirl was shot in the head and shoulder and died in hospital. Tragic death: Imani Green (pictured left by . herself and right with her mother Donna, both in 2009) was at her . cousin's small shop on the island's north coast, when she was shot dead . Three of her older cousins were wounded but survived. Gunned down: Imani green, was murdered while on holiday with her family in Jamaica . Police suspect it may have been a revenge attack for a December shooting linked to a lucrative telemarketing operation which scams Americans by convincing them to hand over cash to collect bogus lottery winnings. Criminal gangs who collect the large sums of money are said to be locked in a feud which has recently erupted with deadly consequences. In the aftermath of Imani's death, police arrested eight local men and quizzed them but all have since been released. The murder investigation took on a fresh twist when a local man was shot dead in a broad daylight attack half a mile from Imani's death scene just three days later. Detectives say they have no one in custody for Imani's death but stress that their investigation is progressing. Imani had been given special permission from teachers to travel to Jamaica with her mother and sister just after Christmas. The sunshine holiday was also meant to help ease the constant pain of her genetic blood disorder in the warmer climate.","Mourners packed a memorial service for Imani Green, 8 .

An Oregon high school librarian has been sentenced to two years in prison for having sex with a 17-year-old student in her car and serially 'sexting' two others teens. Heidi Hyre, 52, and married with children, reportedly also pleaded guilty this week to buying Vicodin from one of the South Albany High School students embroiled in the affair. 'This was just a game for her,' said one mom who added her son began abusing alcohol after his illicit contact with Hyre. 'What happened is scarring for everyone involved. The word 'betrayal' comes to mind.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lecherous librarian: Heidi Hyre, 52, of Oregon was sentenced to two years in prison this week for her scandalous behavior . Betrayal: In pleading for bail, Hyre told the court in May after her arrest she was married with college-age children . Shocked community: Hyre worked as a librarian for four years at South Albany High School in Albany, Oregon, a town with a population of about 50,000 . At Hyre's sentencing in Linn County Circuit Court in Albany, prosecutor Heidi Sternhagen was quoted by The Corvallis Gazette-Times as saying the 'sexting' took place, 'All times of day, all times of night.' 'We’re shocked and appalled that a trusted adult would be...involved in this kind of behavior,' Greater Albany Public Schools Superintendent Maria Delapoer told The Albany Democrat-Herald. 'We want to make sure students are safe. They’re vulnerable.” 'This was just a game for her. What happened is scarring for everyone involved. The word . 'betrayal' comes to mind' '(It) kind of gives you that sick-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach kind of feeling when things like this come out,' the school's principal Brent Belveal told KATU.com. 'We have worked pretty closely together with Heidi.' A contrite Hyre reportedly pleaded for mercy with Judge Thomas McHill, saying through tears, 'I’d like to say how remorseful I am to the people who I’ve hurt with my self-destructive behavior.' Official probe: Police began investigating Hyre in February after rumors of her illicit behavior began circulating around the school . McHill was unmoved, reportedly levying a longer sentence that was expected because of Hyre's position at the school - and betrayal of the public trust. Hyre had worked at South Albany High School for four years as an educational assistant in the library and computer lab. 'As soon as we started hearing rumors we began the investigation,"" Principal Brent Belveal reportedly said. 'We called the police in at that point and tried to be as diligent as we could be.' Once rumors began to circulate among students, Hyre reportedly went to school officials to deny them, Sternhagen told McHill at Friday's sentencing. 'There were some rumors this winter. They were investigated at that time by the school resource officer, and there wasn’t any evidence at that time they thought would lead to an arrest,' Superintendent Delapoer added. Busted: Hyre was arrested in May after a former student came forward about her acts. She was booked Linn County Jail (pictureD) in lieu of $180,500 bail . Pleading for mercy: At her initial court appearance via closed circuit video, Hyre tearfully begged the judge to let her go home to her family, saying, 'I'm scared to death' But Delapoer told The Gazette-Times police broke the case once, 'there was some additional information provided by a former student that led to more explicit evidence – evidence of electronic communications that were inappropriate as well as some physical contact.' An 18-year-old South Albany student told The Democrat-Herald about the specifics of the investigation, saying he'd been suspended because of it. The student, who spoke anonymously, told the paper he was called into the office at South Albany and told his name was on a list of six students' names Hyre had given investigators who allegedly sold prescription medication to the librarian. Delapoer told The Democrat-Herald she believed three students had been suspended because of distributing prescription medicine on school grounds. In May, Hyre was charged with three counts each of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, three counts each of encouraging child sexual abuse in the second degree, and one count each of luring a minor, sex abuse in the third degree and contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor. She was reportedly booked into the Linn County Jail on $180,500 bail, and made news in Oregon with a tearful arraignment hearing. Disbelief: Megan Sledge, a South Albany senior, had heard the rumors, saying, 'I kind of just didn't want to believe anything so I kept everything out of my mind and just didn't think about them' More betrayal: South Albany Principal Brent Belveal (left) said he knew Hyre well - or thought he did. Greater Albany Public Schools Superintendent Maria Delapoer (right) said, 'We're shocked and appalled' 'I don't feel comfortable here,' the terrified librarian told the judge through closed-circuit video. 'I'm scared to death, and I probably shouldn't be."" Megan Sledge, a senior, said months ago she was shocked by the arrest even though she had heard the rumors. 'I don't feel comfortable here. I'm . scared to death, and I probably shouldn't be' 'I kind of just didn't want to believe anything so I kept everything out of my mind and just didn't think about them,' she told KATU.com. Sledge said Hyre was popular with the students. 'She's so nice. She's such a fun person . to be around, and she's always energetic – always has something fun to . do,' she reportedly said. Aftermath: The mother of one involved teen said her son has developed alcohol problems and suffers stress. Hyre, for her part, must register as a sex offender after emerging from a two-year prison term . The lecherous librarian eventually pleaded guilty in November to just two charges, including delivery of Vicodin to a minor and contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor. All other charges against her were dismissed as part of the plea deal. Defense attorney Kent Hickam said no photographs ever were recovered during the investigation. After serving her sentence, Hyre will have to register as a sex offender when she gets out of prison. But it wasn't enough for one bereaved parent. After the hearing the father of a victim reportedly said he was disappointed with the sentence, since Hyre, he added, was unlikely to serve the full two years in prison.

The blistering cold that has most New Yorkers staying in-doors this week has also served as a crime-deterrent for the NYPD. As of midnight on Saturday, the city reported a nine-day streak without a single murder, law-enforcement sources say. Homicide free: New York City reported a nine-day no-murder streak as of January 26 as temperatures dropped to extreme lows, law-enforcement sources say . ‘Jack Frost is the policeman’s best friend,’ one source told the New York Post. ‘The criminals are staying indoors.’ According to the Post, New York’s recorded last homicide occurred on January 16 in The Bronx, where Jennifer Rivera, 20, and her uncle, Jason Rivera, 30, were gunned down while sitting in a parked car. Rivera had a criminal drug history, sources said. No one has been arrested in connection with those two murders, police say. The no-homicide streak follows a similar dip in the city’s murder rate after Hurricane Sandy in late October. Both streaks mark the longest stretches of time with no killings in the city in recent memory, according to NYPD officials. Police sources say homicides will pick back up again in the warmer months. Crime deterrent: 'Jack Frost is the policeman¿s best friend,' one source told the New York Post. 'The criminals are staying indoors' Happy commissioner: 'I like it,' said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly . For now, city authorities are celebrating. ‘I like it,’ New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly happily told the Post. Kelly said cold weather and rain often impact the crime rate. ‘That’s sort of the anecdotal answer we have in policing,' he said. ‘There’s no single easy answer, but to the extent that weather played a role, we’re ready for more cold weather.’ The only potential snag in the NYPD’s no homicide run is a half-naked woman found dead in Brooklyn on Friday, which cops labeled ‘suspicious.’ However, police said that there were no obvious signs of trauma and that the city medical examiner has yet to determine the cause of her death. New York City’s murder rate has dropped 21.7 per cent in the first few weeks of 2013 with recorded 18 murders, compared to 23 for the same period in 2012, according to city records.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:40 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:37 EST, 23 January 2013 . Over the past few years, Japanese consumers have, as in markets the world over, abandoned their old phones for newer, shinier smartphones like the iPhone. But one particular demographic subset have remained faithful to their old flip phones - and, ironically, it's Japan's philanderers. Those who like to play away are snared in an enduring love affair with one particular series of Fujitsu mobiles which feature a range of privacy features to hide calls and texts. Fujitsu's F-06D, in 'Innocent White': The F-series range of Fujitsu smartphones has been dubbed the 'infidelity phone' for a range of features that love cheats use to hide their affairs . Fujitsu's ageing F-Series flip phones - nicknamed the 'uwaki keitai' of 'infidelity phone' - are the mobiles of choice for customers who believe newer versions are not as discreet at hiding their affairs. They feature a nearly invisible 'privacy mode' that hides missed calls, emails and texts from any contacts that are designated as private. The only indication that such a person has got in touch is a subtle change in the colour of shape of how the battery level icon of the network signal antenna bars are shown. A secret combination of keys is needed to turn off the privacy mode, revealing the concealed calls and messages and making voicemail available. Secrets: The phones feature a nearly invisible . 'privacy mode' that hides missed calls, emails and texts from any . contacts designated as private . A Japanese pick-up artist and blogger . who goes by the name Bakanabe, said he uses the phone because women he's . seeing might try to check his phone for strange calls or emails when . he's not around. 'With Fujitsu's ""privacy mode"", they can't see that information at all. The key is to give off the impression that you're not locking your phone at all,' he told the Wall Street Journal. Another Japanese blogger, nicknamed Poza, who claims to carry on various dating site romances while stringing along three girlfriends, said he uses the privacy features to avoid getting caught. Although he has had the Fujitsu phone for nearly five years and owns an iPhone too, he told the Journal giving up his stealthy flip phone entirely is 'unthinkable'. 'In terms of keeping my cheating hidden, this does more than enough,' said Poza, who declined to give his real name but said he worked for a design company in western Japan. It was more stringent security requirements for all phones offered by NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile network, that first prompted Fujitsu to include the privacy mode in 2002. Former senior DoCoMo executive Takeshi Natsuno said he insisted on tougher security after hearing of couples splitting up because unfaithful lovers left their phones unguarded. 'If Tiger Woods had this Japanese feature in his phone, he wouldn't have gotten in trouble,' said Mr Natsuno. When contacted by the Journal, Fujitsu refused to comment on its devices infidelity phone nickname. Tokyo's Kabukicho red-light district: Former senior DoCoMo executive Takeshi Natsuno said he insisted on tougher security after hearing of couples splitting up because unfaithful lovers left their phones unguarded . The enduring appeal of the Fujitsu infidelity phones has continued despite the launch of a range of so-called cheater apps that are meant to bring similar features to Android and iOS. These, and even Fujitsu's own attempts to bring privacy features to its smartphone range, have been derided by the F-Series loyal cheater fanbase. Fujitsu's offering in particular needs customers to use a separate proprietary mail and address book app rather than the carrier's default programs - giving the game away. 'It's totally useless,' Watanabe said. 'I hold out hope that Fujitsu adds the real privacy mode with its next smartphone.' But other app designers are already racing to fill the gap, with software such as the Call and Text Eraser, available on Android, which hides messages and calls from people on a 'blacklist'. The popularity of the $4.99 app is such that it has already been downloaded more than 10,000 times.","Fujitsu flip phones come with unrivalled privacy features .
