"(CNN)Today is its day! ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, debuted 25 years ago on January 22, 1990. Since then, millions of high school and college grads have heard the same zealous affirmation, a not-so-gentle reminder to live up to their potential -- ""KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!"" -- mixed with warnings about loneliness and uncertainty. It's a children's book, as most Dr. Seuss books are, but its messages have resonated through a quarter-century because adults love it too, said Philip Nel, director of the program in children's literature at Kansas State University. Children's books ""possess an enormous amount of wisdom for the adults mature enough to recognize it,"" he said. Here are a few facts about ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" and its legacy. Dr. Seuss knew it would be the last book he published . Geisel was writing and illustrating ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" in the final years of his life, as he battled cancer. Other Seuss books have emerged since his death in 1991, but this was the last he had a hand in. ""It was his swan song, and he knew it was his swan song,"" Nel said. ""It's a career summation in a lot of ways, both visually and morally, in the messages and the images."" Though it presents plenty of Seussian optimism -- ""And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)"" -- it references dark times and stumbles: ""I'm afraid that some times you'll play lonely games too. Games you can't win 'cause you'll play against you."" Geisel wrote from experience. After a successful career in advertising, his first book, ""And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,"" was famously rejected multiple times. Some projects in print and on screen simply never took off. In his personal life, he faced illness and the suicide of his first wife. ""The darkness of the book is what makes the optimism credible,"" Nel said. Geisel was known to be shy but would be ""tickled"" to know that his words still have meaning now, said Susan Brandt, president of licensing and marketing at Dr. Seuss Enterprises. He was deliberate about what his last words to the world would be. ""You can feel him saying, 'Wait, I have one more thing to say,' "" she said. "" 'Listen to me; this is important.' "" It's the top-selling Dr. Seuss book . ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" rose to the bestseller list shortly after it was released in 1990 and continues to pop up there most every spring, as high school and college grads transition to a new phase of life. Twenty-five years and more than 10 million copies later, it's the top-selling Dr. Seuss book. The company it keeps at the top? Beloved early-reading books like ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and ""The Cat in the Hat,"" perennial holiday read ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" and books with a message -- and a movie -- like ""The Lorax"" and ""Horton Hears a Who!"" Its success isn't exactly a surprise, said Mallory Loehr, vice president and publisher of Random House Children's Books. It was published the year she began her career at Random House, and she remember the buzz around the book even then. ""People knew it was special (in 1990),"" Loehr said. ""But 10 million is crazy."" The main character is You -- and you, and you, and you . Passages in ""The Cat in the Hat"" and ""The Lorax"" both slip into the second-person to make a point to readers, but Geisel made the main character of ""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" a person called You, who conveniently happens to be, well, you. ""That makes the book about the reader and puts the reader in the position of the character,"" Nel said. ""It's a motivator. See yourself as the character; take action."" Dr. Seuss had already been a major player in children's literature for decades, but this was an early entry into a burgeoning category: children's stories that appeal to adults, Loehr said. ""This is almost a self-help book. People forget that it has pages that really acknowledge that things will be tough some times,"" she said. ""Sit down; read this book. It will be OK."" As Geisel himself put it, ""I never write for children. I write for people."" The number of ""Places You'll Go"" is growing . What started as a beloved graduation gift has spread into sort of an all-purpose greeting card, shared with a personal inscriptions during any period of transition, from baby showers to big moves. This month, Random House will publish a 25th anniversary edition of ""Oh! The Places You'll Go!"" This year, it will release a baby-fied version, ""Oh, Baby, the Places You'll Go!"" and a full-color journal filled with quotes from the book. On March 2, Geisel's birthday, Dr. Seuss Enterprises will launch KidsMovingMountains.com, which calls for children age 5 to 18 to share stories of how they're ""moving mountains"" in science, technology, engineering, arts and math. They'll award scholarships and trips to some top students. There's never been a film version, but Kansas State University's Nel said Geisel hoped there would be an adaptation -- maybe something ""famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on TV."" For his part, Nel said, it's a remarkable book, but he hasn't given it as a graduation gift. ""It's not that it's not good,"" Nel said. ""It's that everybody I would give it to, someone has has already given it to them.""","""Oh, The Places You'll Go!"" by Dr. Seuss was published January 22, 1990 .
It's the top-selling Dr. Seuss book, with more than 10 million copies in print ."
"(CNN)For many kids, a trip to Disneyland is a dream come true. But for some of those kids and their families who visited ""the happiest place on Earth"" a few weeks ago, that dream has become a nightmare. In the past month, 36 people have come down with measles traced to an exposure at the theme park, including five employees of Disneyland. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1967, nearly every American got the measles; but since 2000, it has effectively been eradicated in this country, with the only sources of exposure being foreign visitors or Americans who traveled and brought it back. The threat is growing, however, because not enough people are getting vaccinated and even for those who have gotten vaccinated, the overall trend is a problem for all of us. Vaccine rates in the United States have been in steady decline since the late '90s. Seventeen states now have fewer than 90% of children vaccinated for measles. Often times, like-minded people who have unvaccinated children tend to cluster in the same communities, thus creating pockets with very low vaccination rates. The reduction in vaccination rates reveals one of the quirks of vaccines; they only protect a population if nearly everyone is vaccinated. This is the concept of herd immunity. The magic number for measles is 95,  which means if at least 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, everyone is protected. This is because the chance of the virus finding the individuals in the group who have little or no protection is very low. If a vaccinated, and protected, person gets measles they may not even know it, but the virus will be stopped in its tracks by their immune response before they can make more people sick. However, the more poorly protected, or unprotected, people there are, the easier it is for the virus to find them, make them sick and spread. For those of you who are vaccinated and might be thinking you're protected from infection even in communities with vaccination rates lower than 95%, you still need to worry. Adults can be affected, too. In fact, 13 of the 18 confirmed cases of measles in Orange County were adults. While the measles vaccine is extremely effective -- the best we have -- effectiveness can reduce over time, leaving both children and adults vulnerable, even if they were vaccinated. Therefore, the risk of any one of us coming down with a completely preventable childhood disease like measles will increase if vaccination rates continue to decline. Disney officials have recognized the importance of vaccination. After learning of the exposure, they offered vaccination and immunity tests to their employees, according to a statement issued by the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chief medical officer, Dr. Pamela Hymel. Of the five employees affected, three have been medically cleared to return to work, a spokesman said, and others are on paid leave until medically cleared. To be sure, there are valid medical reasons that some children can't be vaccinated, such as allergies to components of the vaccine, underlying diseases that compromise the immune system, or because they are simply too young. But these children vitally depend on herd immunity to protect them from childhood diseases. The unfortunate reality, however, is that more and more parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children for nonmedical reasons. Some refuse vaccines on the grounds of religious beliefs; others refuse on the repeatedly disproved argument that vaccines contribute to autism. Their high-risk decision not to vaccinate endangers not only their children, but also those who can't receive the vaccines, and even those of us who have had the vaccine a long time ago, and depend on herd immunity. 5 things to know about measles . Regardless of the reason why parents choose not to vaccinate their children, it is important for the rest of us to realize they are making the choice for all of us, too. By not vaccinating their own children, they increase everyone else's chance of getting a preventable childhood disease like measles, whooping cough or even polio. Just last week, a 25-day-old baby died of whooping cough, which, like measles, is also spreading unnecessarily in the United States due to the decrease in vaccine rates. Just like the drunk driver who makes a socially irresponsible decision that can endanger not only his life, but also the lives of the other drivers and passengers on the road, parents who choose not to vaccinate their children put everyone else at risk. We can each play a part in protecting children by making sure parents understand their responsibility to vaccinate their children and the potential consequences on all of society if they don't. It's a small world after all, and the actions of the few can, and do, affect the many.","A measles outbreak resulted after exposure at Disneyland; 36 became ill .

"(CNN)A huge hole has opened up in the earth. Thousands of people will soon be packing their belongings and moving on. In some cases, whole buildings will be dismantled brick by brick and carted off to a safer location. This dramatic scene may sound like one of the more brutal passages of the Old Testament, but the Book of Exodus this is not. Instead, it's the strange reality unfolding in the Arctic town of Kiruna, northern Sweden. A nearby iron ore mine -- Kiruna's main source of income and employment for more than a century -- has begun to encroach on the city in recent years. Small cracks have also begun to show on the streets in business and residential areas. A detailed analysis by LKAB (the state-owned company that operates the mine) has predicted that the these fractures will only get worse as it attempts to access the most difficult to reach minerals. According to Erika Lindblad of LKAB, the remaining iron ore bodies are located directly under the city. This creates a problem as the law, and the company's own policy, prohibits mining under populated areas. ""When the mines initially opened, it made sense to build housing near the workplaces, Lindblad said. ""However, no one could have imagined that over 120 years later we would be mining ore a kilometre below ground and that this would have a significant impact on the communities in which we operate."" The people of Kiruna have been aware of these developments since 2004 when LKAB sent local residents a letter detailing the severity of the situation. In the period since, they have been forced to wrestle with an unenviable dilemma. Either the mine, which employs around 4,000 local people, closes down and the city loses its primary source of income, or it continues to operate and a large part of Kiruna is sectioned off and its inhabitants are forced to move a new location. The problem is succinctly surmised by Goran Cars, head of development at the Kiruna municipality. ""The city is the mine and the mine is the city,"" Cars said. ""We have lived together for 100 years and we have a huge dependence on each other. Without the mine the town would die."" After much debate and an international competition to flesh out what the new Kiruna would look like, the option to move won the day. Over the course of the next 20 years, a new town center, municipal buildings and 3,000 homes will be constructed two miles away. When the project is finished, roughly 6,000 of Kiruna's 23,000 residents will have been relocated, according to data provided by LKAB. People forced to depart over this period will have their property purchased from them by the mining firm. They will then choose between investing in one of the newly built homes or, if they prefer, upping sticks for pastures new. On top of this, around 20 structures of cultural and architectural significance will be taken down brick by brick and rebuilt in a new, more stable location. Understandably, such an ambitious task has drawn attention from around the globe. ""The idea of having a city and then moving it has never happened before,"" Cars said. ""We are unique."" Among the buildings being moved is the local church, which was voted the most beautiful building in Sweden 2001. The bell tower from the existing town hall will also be removed and placed in the new town square. The incremental nature of the move has led to Kiruna being dubbed the ""millipede town."" Building work began last March and has been progressing at a gentle pace ever since. As things stand, the foundations have been laid for the new City Hall while one business (a shop) has been shuttered in the old town, according to Lindblad. Other buildings slated for construction include a new train station, town square, hotels, offices and schools. ""I think that we can make a lot of improvements ... (with) more modern houses and buildings,"" Lindblad said. For architecture firm White Arkitekter AB, however, the opportunity to reimagine a 100-year-old town goes way beyond the possibility of erecting some eye-catching new buildings. Co-lead architect, Krister Lindstedt, envisions a sleek, modern development that embodies the most cutting-edge concepts of design and urban-planning. He describes a town that embellishes the spectacular nature of the surrounding region and a new people-friendly town-center built entirely from scratch. There will be more social meeting places, more cafes and more scope for cultural activities than are currently available in the existing Kiruna, Lindstedt adds. For the residents of Kiruna, such changes are generally perceived positively, Cars explained. The current city has no town center and very few areas for gathering or for putting on events. It also has a long-held demographic problem of retaining female residents, many of whom prefer to move elsewhere for work. These are all problems the new design for the new Kiruna seeks to solve. Yet there remain concerns about the psychological and emotional impacts moving a city will have on its residents. Some older people even worry whether they will be able to afford home in the new Kiruna, although the local authorities are adamant that a solution will be found if anyone finds themselves in such a situation. The unique community feeling is something the architects hope to maintain. According to Lindstet, this project is as much ""a question of identity and what will make people feel like they are at home."" Social anthropologist, Viktoria Walldin, has been drafted in by White Arkitekter AB to help deal with these issues. She describes the importance of not completely banishing existing landmarks no matter how insignificant they are. People can hold strong sentimental memories over items as seemingly meaningless as a street name or a park bench, believes Walldin. A smartly named ""Kiruna Portal"" has been set up that will allow people to identify items that they would like to see moved to the new town. This could be something as small as a particular brick that holds a special memory or as big as the existing bell tower. The Kiruna Biennale, meanwhile, an event scheduled to begin in the city in years to come, will be a nostalgic celebration about what the city was but also what it will become. While far from perfect, Walldin believes these projects will help ease people's feelings about the transition. It will also serve to emphasize how unique the residents of Kiruna and their city really are. ""There's this mutual relationship (between the people and the mine) which is quite interesting that I don't see in other projects when you move cities,"" Walldin said. ""When slums are cleared its obvious who has the power. I mean, the decision is made and people are moved. ""But in Kiruna, there is this mutual (requirement) between the town and the mine. So, it has to be done in this respectful way.""","Cracks have appeared in the streets of the Arctic city of Kiruna due to mining activity nearby .

"(CNN)An Ohio man who authorities accuse of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol appeared in a Cincinnati court Thursday and entered a plea of not guilty. Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, has been charged with attempting to kill government employees, solicitation to commit a crime and possession of a firearm. The first two charges are punishable by up to 20 years in prison, while the third charge can carry a possible sentence of up to five years behind bars. Authorities say Cornell planned to set off bombs at the U.S. Capitol and then open fire on people as they fled. He came to the FBI's attention several months ago after posting about his support for violent jihad on social media, according to a criminal complaint. The FBI launched an undercover operation, with the help of a person who began cooperating in exchange for favorable treatment on his criminal exposure on an unrelated case. Cornell allegedly told that source he had been in contact with persons overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. He did not think he would receive ""specific authorization to conduct a terrorist attack in the United States, but stated that he wanted to go forward with violent jihad and opined that this would be their way of supporting ISIL,"" the complaint said, using another name for ISIS. According to the complaint, Cornell wrote: ""I believe that we should just wage jihad under our own orders and plan attacks and everything. I believe we should meet up and make our own group in alliance with the Islamic State here and plan operations ourselves.""","Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, is charged with attempting to kill government employees .

"Tokyo (CNN)As the deadline imposed by ISIS approached, the mother of one of two Japanese men held by the militant group begged for her son's life. ""To all members of ISIS, Kenji [Goto] is not the enemy of ISIS. Please release him,"" Junko Ishido, Goto's mother, said in a statement Thursday. ""There is so little time left before the deadline."" ISIS has threatened in a video released Tuesday to kill two Japanese citizens, Goto and  Haruna Yukawa,  if it doesn't receive $200 million in ransom from the Japanese government. Time is of the essence: the Japanese government says it estimates ISIS' ultimatum will expire at 2:50 p.m. Friday, Tokyo time (12:50 a.m. ET Friday). ""I sincerely apologize to the Japanese government and all concerned foreign countries for all the trouble that my son has caused,"" Ishido said. ""I have been just crying for last three days, filled with sadness. Words fail to describe how I feel. Kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little. He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.' "" Japanese officials have said they are doing their best to communicate with ISIS, but Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Thursday that Tokyo had so far heard nothing and doesn't know what situation the two hostages are in. In a Thursday news conference, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan wants to secure the hostages' safe release but will not yield to the threat of the terrorists. He said Japan was trying to reach the ISIS captors through third parties, such as governments in the region or local tribal leaders, but has not been able to determine whether Goto and Yukawa are safe. ""We are aiming to save them as soon as possible,"" Suga said Thursday. The government of Jordan has told Japan it will do as much as possible to try to secure the release of Goto and Yukawa, according to Suga. Jordan, one of the Arab nations taking part in the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, already has its own challenge to deal with: the militant group last month captured a Jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in Syria. Japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military, which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self-defense, isn't involved in the international airstrikes against ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. The masked militant speaking in the ISIS video linked the group's ransom demand to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent pledge of $200 million in financial aid to countries affected by the militant group. Video raises new questions about 'Jihadi John' Suga reiterated Thursday that the funds Japan has offered are for humanitarian purposes, like helping refugees, not military purposes. Leading Japanese news organizations have reported, citing unidentified government sources, that Goto's wife got an e-mail in December from someone demanding $8 million to $16 million for her husband's return. The government is trying to confirm if that e-mail came from ISIS, the reports said. If so, it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $200 million it had publicly demanded. But the question is what, if anything, is Japan willing to give. ISIS has a ruthless track record. It has released videos touting the killing of five Western hostages since August. Abe has called ISIS' ultimatum over the two Japanese men's lives ""unacceptable"" and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists. But he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom. Should nations just pay ISIS ransom? Some details have emerged about what spurred the two Japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody Syrian conflict. While they had different professions, the two men knew and talked to each other, said Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto. Goto, an experienced freelance journalist, made a video in October near the Turkish-Syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into ISIS-controlled territory. ""It is my responsibility if something happens,"" he explained. Goto, 47, said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region. ""Syrian people suffering three years and a half. It's enough,"" he said. ""So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."" Alaaeddin Al Zaim, who had worked with Goto in Syria previously, says he warned him not to enter the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. ""I tell him it's not safe for you,"" Al Zaim told CNN. But Goto chose to go anyway, saying, ""I am not American, I am not British. I'm Japanese. I can go,"" Al Zaim recalled. Before he left, Goto gave Al Zaim a slip of paper with contact information for friends and his wife, the mother of his young children. After hearing no word from Goto for a week, Al Zaim says called the wife. ""When I called her, she's a very strong woman,"" he said. The aims and activities in Syria of Yukawa, a 42-year-old unemployed widower, are murkier. He originally headed to the war-ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company, said his friend Kimoto. There, Yukawa met Goto, who gave him insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said. He also introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS even though both are fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded. That plea spurred Yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to Japan, according to Kimoto. ""I felt a chill when he said, after returning home, (that) he felt in Syria he was really living a life,"" Kimoto said. ""He seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals."" Yukawa went back to Syria in July, a trip that Kimoto said he didn't know about at the time. Kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company. Yukawa was reportedly captured in August. Opinion: Why countries should think about paying ransoms .

"(CNN)What is Africa's most competitive economy? Is it oil-rich Nigeria? No. Perhaps South Africa, the continent's mining powerhouse? Try again. Benefiting from a long history of political stability, a good governance record and an open and flexible regulatory system, Mauritius overtook South Africa last year to become the continent's most competitive economy. The tiny island country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar in the middle of the Indian Ocean, is regularly hailed as one of Africa's success stories -- since it gained independence in 1968, Mauritius has had an excellent record of peaceful transition of power with free and fair elections taking place on a regular basis. Surrounded by stunning coral reefs, Mauritius spans less than 800 square miles and is home to over 1.3 million people -- mainly an ethnically and religiously diverse mix of people of Indian, African, French and Chinese heritage. The country, dotted with green sugar cane fields, sparkling lagoons and jagged volcanic mountains, is well known for its perfect palm-fringed beaches and cobalt blue seas, attracting nearly a million tourists annually. Despite the global slowdown in recent years, the Mauritian economy has consistently achieved annual growth rates of more than 3%, with estimations showing a rise to 3.5% in 2014 and 4.1% in 2015. The country enjoys the best business environment in Africa, according to the World Bank, which ranks it first in the continent for ease of doing business. Over 50% of the island country's land is arable, with sugarcane occupying about 90% of its total cultivation land. In fact, sugarcane is the country's major export crop -- in 2013, Mauritius produced an estimated 407,000 tonnes. Yet, despite sugar being a major export for decades, Mauritius has managed to successfully diversify its economy, mainly by investing in the manufacturing sector. Initially, the focus was placed on the production of textiles and clothing, but lately the country has begun setting its sights on exporting jewelry and watch components. Jewelry, watch and diamond production currently make up 10% of the Mauritian foreign exports, adding more than $150 million to the country's GDP. Overall, the manufacturing sector expanded by 3.0% in 2013, up from 2.2% the year before. Besides agriculture and manufacturing, other areas of rising economic activity include tourism and finance, especially banking and business outsourcing. The infamous flightless Dodo bird was a native here but unfortunately became extinct in the 1600s.

"(CNN)The death of an Argentine prosecutor who accused the country's most powerful of a criminal cover-up has put on display a labyrinth that could have hatched from a novelist's imagination. It involves an investigation into the deadliest terror attack in Argentina's history, modern geopolitics, alleged betrayals, a puzzling death and a dose of paranoia. If you are unfamiliar with the story: Last week, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires filed a report alleging that the President, foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up Iran's involvement in the attack, which killed 85. The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was invited to testify about his allegations before Congress on Monday. But on the eve of his testimony, Nisman was found dead inside his apartment. He died of a gunshot wound to the temple. A gun and a shell casing were found near his body. The apartment was locked from the inside. At first glance, a suicide. But the untimely death raised suspicions immediately. A poll by the firm Ipsos of more than 400 Argentineans found that 70% of them believed that Nisman was murdered. Some 18% believed he took his own life, and 12% didn't have an opinion. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who initially called Nisman's death a suicide, reversed her thinking Thursday. In a statement, she called it ""the suicide (that I am convinced) was not a suicide."" It is an about-face from her position just days before. Her first statement on Nisman's death was a rejection of the prosecutor's allegations and a reflection on, ""What was it that led a person to make the terrible decision to take his own life?"" Two things happened after that: the prosecutor looking into Nisman's death said that no gunpowder residue was found on his hands, as would be likely if he pulled the trigger. Second, the locksmith who helped Nisman's mother gain access into the apartment cast doubt on reports that the door could have been opened only from inside. To the contrary, someone could have gained entry with something as simple as a wire, the locksmith said. ""Anybody could have opened it,"" he told a swarm of reporters after giving a statement to investigators. While Fernandez now considers that Nisman did not commit suicide, she still believes that his allegations against her government are false. Nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the President, but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information, Fernandez said. ""The criminal complaint by prosecutor Nisman was never in itself the true plot against the government,"" Fernandez wrote. His report ""collapses like a house of cards,"" she wrote, and Nisman probably never knew he was being fed false information. The real plot against the government was his death, which came after he accused her government of a cover-up to protect Iranian suspects in the bombing, Fernandez wrote. ""They used him while he was alive, and then they needed him dead,"" she wrote. ""It's that sad and terrible."" Nisman's report promised to provide evidence ""of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot, deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the Iranians accused in the investigation of the attack"" of the Jewish community center in 1994. Less than 48 hours after Nisman's body was found, the court that had received the criminal complaint published the entire document on the internet. Traffic was so heavy that the website hosting the document crashed for a while. The 289-page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of Argentina and Iran and concludes that the South American nation agreed to stop pursuing the named Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for an oil-for-grain-and-meat deal with Iran. A little background: In 2007, Argentina requested the arrest of several Iranians in connection with the 1994 bombing, including former Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi. Interpol approved so-called Red Notices for these suspects, alerting countries around the world of Buenos Aires' desire to have them arrested. According to Nisman's report, representatives on Fernandez's behalf held both secret and public meetings where it was agreed that the trade deal could be reached if the Red Notices were withdrawn. It was a geopolitical move to fortify Argentina's economic position at the cost of forgoing justice in the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association building, according to Nisman. Intercepted phone calls between representatives of both countries show that there was a conspiracy to create a new hypothesis for the bombing and to redirect the investigation based on fake evidence that would remove the spotlight from the Iranians, Nisman's report states. The public face of this plan was an agreement reached between both countries in 2013 to jointly investigate the bombing by creating a binational ""truth commission,"" Nisman wrote. The plan never took off, however, because of an unexpected roadblock, according to Nisman's report. Interpol refused to withdraw the Red Notices against the Iranians. Without that, Iran moved the deal to the back burner, Nisman wrote. The release of Nisman's report was not a bombshell. Its contents were widely reported, but Fernandez's government and its supporters outright rejected the allegations. Fernandez focused her attack on Nisman's sources, including two Argentineans that the prosecutor identified as working for the country's intelligence services. These alleged spies -- Ramon Allan Hector Bogado and Hector Yrimia -- never worked for Argentine intelligence, Fernandez said. Everything Nisman argues is false, Fernandez says -- the spies were spies, Argentina didn't ask Interpol to withdraw the Red Notices, trade between Argentina and Iran has actually decreased, and so on. ""We think all the allegations are baseless,"" Foreign Minister Hector Timerman told CNN on Thursday. Fernandez's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing, Timerman said. ""I am Jewish,"" he said. ""And to think that a person of my religion, the Jewish religion, can make a deal not to prosecute the death of 85 people, most of them Jewish in Argentina ... I have to tell you, it's not easy to live with."" The Argentine government was not involved in Nisman's death in any way, he said. ""Nobody, I mean, wanted more for Mr. Nisman to live and to answer questions, than the President of Argentina and myself,"" Timerman said. If the accusations and counter-accusations laid out by all sides aren't confusing enough, additional theories continue to arise. In a news conference, Argentina's chief of the cabinet ministers, Anibal Fernandez, offered new questions. Nisman was on vacation in Europe with his teenage daughter when he suddenly cut short his trip and returned to Argentina, according to the cabinet chief. ""Things just get stranger,"" he said, asking who called him back in a hurry. ""Why did he return? Why did he leave his daughter there, alone at an international airport?"" the cabinet chief said. It was previously reported in the local media that Nisman told a reporter at least twice that this investigation might cost him his life. He also allegedly got the handgun from a friend because he feared for his security, according to reports. The cabinet chief proposed another wrinkle: ""The closer we read (the report), the more we are convinced that Nisman didn't even write that complaint. What is the reason behind filing this? What is the objective? This is what we must find out."" The whole story is a tangled web that is hard to describe, but reflects an observation Argentine novelist Jorge Luis Borges once made: ""Reality is not always probable, or likely.""

"(CNN)A massive fire at a New Jersey midrise that consumed 240 apartments and permanently displaced up to 500 residents has been ruled accidental, authorities said. Edgewater Police Chief  William Skidmore said the fire was accidentally started by building workers, CNN affiliate WABC reported. ""Our hearts go out to everyone who was affected by this; it was a long and challenging night,"" Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland said during a Thursday morning press conference. ""The fire is contained and under control."" An additional 520 residents from nearby buildings were temporarily affected, McPartland said. Two residents and two firefighters suffered minor injuries, but no one was reported missing, the mayor said. Some pets, however, could not be rescued, he said. Edgewater Fire Chief Tom Jacobson said the blaze broke out around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Avalon at Edgewater, along the Hudson River across from Manhattan. More than 200 firefighters battled to bring the fire under control as the flames shot high into the sky. ""We arrived on scene and we encountered the sprinkler system going off and smoke conditions on the first floor,"" Jacobson said. ""I sent in crews to check what was going on; we had heavy fire on the ceiling."" Most residents were not home when the fire began, but some found themselves trapped in the blaze. ""The fire conditions were getting worse. It was in the floors and it just traveled,"" Jacobson said. ""We had crews on three floors. We had the task of dealing with multiple rescues on different floors because the smoke had traveled through the building, and we had to evacuate the people. We had people stuck on back balconies. We had ladders removing the victims from the balconies, and the fire just took off."" Authorities established services for affected residents at a local community center, McPartland said. 2 bodies found in ruins of burned Annapolis mansion .

"(CNN)Two more bodies were retrieved Thursday from the ruins of a burned Maryland mansion, where six people are thought to have died. Relatives of the family released the names of the four youngest victims, authorities said. The bodies were transported to the medical examiner's officer for autopsies and identification, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Capt. Russ Davies said in the statement. ""There are still two occupants unaccounted for,"" he said. ""This remains a complex scene and much work remains to be done."" Two bodies were found Wednesday in the ruins of the Annapolis mansion, which burned three days ago, fire officials said. Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife, Sandra, and four grandchildren are feared dead in the fire. Officials said the two bodies have not been identified. Relatives identified the grandchildren as Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6. They are the children of Sandra Pyle's sons, Randy and Clint Boone, according to the statement. The children were visiting their grandparents for a sleepover because Monday was a school holiday, a family spokeswoman said. ""On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event,"" the family's statement said. ""We are blessed that so many family, friends and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need."" The statement confirmed the identities of the six people firefighters and others have been searching for in the ruins of the waterfront home. ""Our love for our family is boundless,"" the statement said. ""Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones."" For the first time since the fire broke out, local and federal officials were able to secure the structure and access the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house on Wednesday. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Officials would not discuss where the bodies were or the possible cause of death. Authorities are treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""You're looking at five standard houses put together,"" he said Tuesday. ""This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. That adds to it."" Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were ""hoping for a miracle,"" CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. ""We have some very unique challenges with this house,"" Howarth said. ""The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We're looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons."" When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were missing, fire officials said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle's company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an ""industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential."" He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post.

"(CNN)Look out. The bragging war between two of the world's busiest airports just got more intense. For the first time in a decade, Chicago's O'Hare topped Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson in total flights by more than 13,000, according to new stats from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The score for 2014: Chicago, 881,933; Atlanta, 868,359. Hey, this is important. It's about who's No. 1. It's about bragging rights. ""Chicago reclaims its place"" as the ""world's busiest airport,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement Thursday, crediting new airline routes, newly relocated businesses and the city's strong economy. But Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson remains No. 1 in annual passenger traffic. Spokesman Reese McCranie said the airport is projected to top 96 million passengers for 2014, compared with O'Hare, which handled 66.7 million in 2013. That put O'Hare in fifth place globally for passengers. ""With our friends in Chicago, it's always a little bit of friendly rivalry,"" McCranie said. ""Our operations folks are probably getting ribbed by their operations folks for edging us out. But you know, we're all one aviation system, so when O'Hare does well, other airports -- including ours -- do well."" ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . So really, which airport is the busiest? Which is more challenging for an airport? Handling more airplanes -- or more passengers? Each has its own contributing factors: . - O'Hare has eight runways. Atlanta, five. - Atlanta tends to have more sunshine than Chicago, which may cut weather delays and cancellations. - O'Hare hosts many regional airlines, but McCranie said Atlanta carriers are adding more airliners with higher passenger capacity. ""So when you have that, of course that means you don't have as many takeoffs and landings,"" McCranie said. Let's stop for a minute and remind ourselves that these two airports are called upon to perform something that's really quite amazing. With incredible attention to safety, they serve nearly a million flights a year and tens of millions of passengers. Large international airports are among the world's most complicated facilities, with constantly moving components that require detailed attention. Being the busiest -- on any level -- is a true badge of honor. Emanuel said the victory comes from Chicago being ""the top metro area for foreign direct investment"" and its ""record growth in international tourism."" So, how do you define the world's ""busiest"" airport? What's the definition of ""busy?"" Webster's makes it pretty simple: ""actively doing something."" From a traveling consumer perspective, traditionally, passenger traffic has been the key stat when talking about the ""busiest"" airports. That's because the FAA takeoff and landing stats include military and other noncommercial flights. For example, an airport that includes a hub for a cargo delivery outfit -- such as UPS Airlines in Louisville, Kentucky -- is going to have more takeoffs and landings that don't include passengers. Although 2014 global stats are pending, year-to-date figures suggest that Atlanta will still be the busiest airport in the world based on passenger traffic, according to Airports Council International. In 2013, ACI said Beijing ranked No. 2 in passengers, with 83.7 million. London's Heathrow ranked No. 3 in 2013, but ACI says Dubai is poised to surpass Heathrow in international passengers in 2014. The rising passenger traffic at Dubai's airport shows how aviation's ""nucleus"" has moved eastward in the past decade, resulting in double-digit growth rates, said Dr. Rafael Echevarne, ACI economics director. Airlines, he said, are scheduling more fights out of Dubai that use wide-body, long-haul planes that carry more passengers. As for airport takeoffs and landings in 2013, it ranks globally like this (after Atlanta and Chicago): . 3. Los Angeles; 696,443 . 4. Dallas-Fort Worth; 678,059 . 5. Denver; 582,653 . 6. Beijing; 567,759 . Meanwhile, these new numbers appear to be throwing more fuel on the fire in the rivalry between Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago O'Hare. ""We'll let them hold the mantle this year,"" said McCranie. ""We'll come back swinging next year, and we'll see what happens.""","Chicago declares O'Hare International Airport ""world's busiest airport""

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN)""It's a nightmare,"" says Zaki Chairi. Chairi, a 27-year old Belgian comedian who performs with a humorous theatrical group that calls itself the ""Muslim Raiders,"" was speaking several days after a deadly gun battle erupted last week between suspected jihadists and police in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers. News of the suspected Belgian terror cell immediately sent ripples of fear through this small European country's Muslim community. ""I was freaking out. Really scared,"" said Chairi, who fears young Belgian-born Muslims could become victims of a backlash after the raid. ""My mom said no one can go out tonight because of what happened,"" said Camelia Lakhdar. The 19-year old waitress said her frightened mother made her skip work the night of the anti-terror raid. Both Chairi and Lakhdar were speaking in the lounge of a Muslim youth center, Espace Poincare. Espace Poincare opened little more than a year ago, with the goal of promoting a peaceful and productive blend of European and Islamic values. But the center's director said the recent reports of a suspected homegrown Belgian terror cell -- emerging so soon after French jihadis massacred cartoonists in the Paris office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo had threatened this vision of moderation and integration. ""We condemn what's happened. This is not our vision, our understanding of our religion,"" said director Hajib El Hajjaji. In French-accented English, he explained how Belgium's Muslim community was finding itself increasingly trapped between two ideological extremes. ""We face [Islamist] radicalization. But we also face the increase of Islamophobia in Belgium,"" El Hajjaji said. ""We know that stigmatization, Islamophobia, discrimination help this radicalization of young Muslim people here in Belgium."" The January 15 raid in Verviers resulted in the shooting deaths of two Belgian citizens. Police said they were found in possession of assault rifles, handguns, explosives and police uniforms. The suspects have been accused of being part of a plot to target Belgian police, inspired by the ultra-violent ideology of ISIS. The gun-battle triggered an international manhunt. Since January 15, Belgian authorities have arrested and charged at least seven Belgians with participation in a terrorist organization. The federal prosecutor's office announced three of the suspects were intercepted at the airport in Brussels while trying to fly to Greece, with plans to then travel on to Syria. A senior Belgian counter-terrorist official tells CNN the suspected leader of the Verviers cell is a young Belgian of Moroccan descent named Abdelhamid Abaaoud. Abaaoud -- who is still at large- appeared in an ISIS propaganda video laughing and joking to the camera while driving a pick-up truck that was dragging at least half a dozen corpses through a field.  He also brought his teenage brother to Syria, who has since appeared in photos posing alongside ISIS fighters. Abaaoud originally hails from a district of Brussels called Molenbeek. He is not the only Molenbeek native to embrace the ISIS jihad. ""There are several people who left here to fight in Syria.  And some who came back. That's the danger,"" said Molenbeek Mayor Francoise Schepmans. She spoke to CNN in the neighborhood's central square, which is ringed with halal butcher shops and grocery stores advertising their goods in French and Arabic.  A polyglot procession of residents -- many of them women wearing Islamic headscarves- strolled.  In the side streets, one could over hear conversations in French, Arabic and Turkish. Molenbeek has a large, predominantly Muslim population of first, second and third generation immigrants from North Africa. The mayor said the neighborhood also suffered from soaring youth unemployment estimated at more than 40%. Molenbeek raids . As part of their effort to stop the suspected ISIS-linked cell in Verviers, Belgian police have carried out multiple raids in Molenbeek over the course of the last week. The defense attorney for a Molenbeek native arrested by police last week said his client was innocent of terrorism charges. Didier De Quevy argued that his client, an unemployed former 25-year old security guard named Marouane el Bali, did not fit the terrorist profile because he had no previous criminal record. ""He lives in Molenbeek, which is one of the neighborhoods most infested by terrorism, and thus it's a miracle not to have problems with the authorities when you live there,"" De Quevy said. While unemployment is rampant, online propaganda for ISIS' bloody interpretation of jihad is often only a button click away. Chairi, the comedian who also hosts a radio show that touches upon Belgian Muslim affairs, laments that his radicalized peers ""don't learn their Islam in mosques or in institutions.  They learn it on the Internet."" He recalled meeting a young Muslim convert. Just a few months after embracing Islam in Belgium, Chairi said he read in a newspaper that the young man was killed fighting on the battlefields of Syria. ""It goes so fast ... even the religious leaders, they don't understand it,"" Chairi said. ""People radicalize themselves,"" said El Hajjaji, director of Point Espace. El Hajjaji says he has taken to social media, to denounce online propaganda urging volunteers to join ISIS.  But he confesses the jihadi message can be tempting to vulnerable youths. ""The speech to get you to go to Syria is very simple: you have your enemy, you want to have the power to build your future, and you don't need to find a solution to the complexity of your life that we have here in Belgium,"" El Hajjaji said. It is this toxic mix of unemployment, marginalization and the clarion call of jihad, that have helped make Brussels, the capital of Europe, a recruiting ground for terrorism.

"(CNN)I operate the only abortion clinic in Wichita. For many of our patients, we are their last hope. A woman showed up on our doorstep recently in wrinkled clothes that she had been wearing for days. She told us she had traveled across three states, spending $100 on gas alone, before finally reaching her destination. After she was unable to get the care she needed at the clinic closest to her, she left her small town in the Texas panhandle and went to Oklahoma, where she was told that her pregnancy was too far along to receive an abortion there. So she came to us. Opinion: It's a child, not a choice . Unfortunately for our patient,  and millions of women like her, anti-choice extremists in states across the country have instituted politically motivated and medically unnecessary red tape to limit  their access to basic -- and potentially lifesaving -- health care. The reality that these extremists fail to acknowledge is that abortion is one of the safest -- and most common -- medical procedures. In fact, colonoscopies are far more dangerous than abortions. When I hear about new proposals to further restrict access to safe and legal abortions, I see in my mind the faces of patients like ours. These women are forced to leave their children and jobs behind for days while they seek out a safe and legal medical procedure. In Kansas, the law mandates that women receive biased information that is designed to persuade them not to have an abortion. Among other things, patients are required to read a statement telling them they are about to ""terminate the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being."" Then they are required to wait 24 hours before their abortion. For our patient, her three-day journey turned into four. In 2014, many states made the process even more challenging for women seeking abortions. Mississippi joined a growing list of states that ban abortions after 20 weeks, well before fetal viability.  Both Alabama and Missouri expanded their state's waiting periods. And in Texas, medically unnecessary legislation forced the closure of abortion clinics across the state. Judicial hearings that began earlier this month will decide whether a component of the Texas law that requires all abortion clinics in the state -- even those that perform nonsurgical abortions and have excellent safety records -- to meet the costly standards of ambulatory surgery centers is constitutional. Cases like this one are poised to have far-reaching impact on the ability of women to access safe and legal abortion care. Unfortunately, it's already clear that 2015 is going to be another year of long legislative battles for pro-choice advocates. Before the year even began, a lawmaker in Missouri proposed legislation that would require women to receive legal consent from the man who impregnated them before getting an abortion.  When asked if the legislation would make allowances for victims of rape and incest, the bill's author insisted that there would be an exception for victims of ""legitimate rape."" Echoing Todd Akin's infamous words makes it clear that this bill intends to further strip away women's rights in Missouri. While lawmakers across the country appear poised to continue this trend, what makes me hopeful is that champions of reproductive justice have taken notice and forced decision makers to protect the rights of women. Last month, Virginia's governor took steps to roll back politically motivated, unpopular abortion regulations that his predecessor initiated.  In Mississippi, a judge blocked medically unnecessary legislation that would have forced the state's last remaining abortion clinic to close.  And in Colorado and North Dakota, voters soundly rejected personhood measures that would have given fetuses more rights than the women carrying them. All these victories have one thing in common: Someone stood up and said ""enough.""Enough playing politics with women's bodies. Enough pretending that politicians in state capitals are doctors. Enough telling women when and how to have children. Enough letting where a woman lives dictate her access to abortion services. The fight is not over for women who simply want the right to make their own medical decisions. This year, and as we mark the 42nd anniversary of the passage of Roe vs. Wade, I implore you to be one of the voices that says ""enough.'""","Julie Burkhart, abortion provider in Kansas, says some must travels days to find abortion clinic .

"(CNN)A big asteroid will fly by Earth on Monday, but NASA says don't worry -- we'll be safe. The asteroid is called 2004 BL86. It'll come about 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth, or about three times as far away as the moon at 11:19 a.m. ET, according to NASA. You're wondering, doesn't this happen all the time? Yes and no. There are lots of asteroids that pose a threat to Earth -- about 550 as of January 22. None are predicted to hit anytime soon. But asteroid 2004 BL86 (yes, we also wish it had a catchier name) is big -- about a third of a mile (a half-kilometer) in size. It will be the closest known asteroid this large to pass near Earth until 2027, that's when an asteroid called 1999 AN10 flies by us. ""While it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more,"" Don Yeomans, the recently retired manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a NASA press release. This asteroid is also interesting because you might be able to see it with strong binoculars or backyard telescopes. That's a rare opportunity for most of us. ""I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,"" said Yeomans. ""Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up."" NASA scientists will snap radar-generated images using the Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Yeomans retired January 9 after 16 years of tracking asteroids. Paul Chodas has been designated as the new manager. ""We should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid,"" Chodas told CNN. ""Radar would be the key to study the asteroid's surface, give an idea of its shape, whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it. It'll be really exciting."" If you don't have binoculars or a scope, you can watch from the comfort of your computer on The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0.

"(CNN)After enduring wounds from being struck 50 times, a Saudi blogger has been given a reprieve in receiving another 50 lashes this Friday, said Amnesty International. The case of Raif Badawi has garnered international headlines and global outrage. Badawi started a blog called ""Free Saudi Liberals"" in 2008 to encourage discussion about Islam, particularly  the intrusion of the nation's religious police in Saudis' personal lives. He was officially charged with ""adopting liberal thought,"" ""founding a liberal website,"" and ""insulting Islam."" A Jeddah court convicted him of ""insulting Islam"" and handed down a 10-year prison term and ordered that be whipped 1,000 times. Badawi received his first 50 lashes in the second week in January and was taken back to prison. He was supposed to be beaten again the third week, but Saudi officials postponed that due to medical advice, the blogger's wife said. On Wednesday, a medical committee of about eight doctors assessed Badawi at King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah and determined he was too injured to withstand the beatings this week, according to Amnesty. ""Instead of continuing to torment Raif Badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments, the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally,"" said Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. ""Raif Badawi is still at risk. There is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead,"" Boumedouha said.

"Dhaka (CNN)Thirty-one people have been killed and more than 7,000 arrested in weeks of political unrest in Bangladesh, as the country's opposition mounts mass protests demanding fresh parliamentary elections. The dead were mainly killed by arson attacks on buses and cars, police said. The two most recent victims, who died of their injuries in hospital Thursday, were victims of bomb blasts. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), along with 19 allied parties, called for general strikes and a nationwide blockade on road, rail and river transport on January 5, the first anniversary of disputed elections. The BNP and its allies boycotted those elections, with BNP leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia arguing they would have been rigged by the government, and refusing to participate unless they were conducted under a neutral caretaker administration. Her arch rival, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, refused to concede to the demands and coasted to victory. More than half of the parliament's 300 seats went uncontested. Voting was conducted under neutral caretaker governments in Bangladesh from 1991 until 2010, when the system was scrapped by the governing Awami League. Communications Minister Obaidul Quader said Wednesday that at least seven drivers and their assistants on public transport were among those killed in the renewed violence, which has seen 200 buses torched in recent weeks. The government has also blocked Viber, WhatsApp and other messaging apps, which it says are being used to coordinate the protests. Industry Minister Amir Hossain Amu, who heads a government committee on law and order, said security forces have detained some 7,015 people in recent weeks, who are still being held. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir is among those arrested. The BNP claims the true number under arrest is higher. The government is offering a reward of 100,000 taka ($1,300) for information leading to the arrest of any of those behind the attacks, Amu said. Bangladesh politics has been dominated by Zia and Hasina for decades, with both enjoying multiple stints in power. Hasina, the daughter of Bangladesh's first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was first elected prime minister in 1996, while Zia, widow of assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, first became PM in 1991. Hasina has blamed Zia for the violence and accused the opposition of trying to foment chaos, while Zia has denied her party is responsible, saying the violence is the work of the government. Both Zia and Hasina have frequently called for mass protests while in opposition. Both their parties had planned rallies on the January 5 anniversary of the 2014 election. After police banned the rallies, the opposition proceeded. Zia was confined to her office by police at the beginning of the protests, which the government said was for her own security. She has since been released.","31 are dead and thousands under arrest after weeks of political unrest in Bangladesh .

"(CNN)It now appears likely that Darren Wilson, the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, who shot and killed Michael Brown, will never face criminal charges for his actions. The state grand jury declined to vote an indictment in November, and news reports indicate that there will be no federal charges against him either. Whether these decisions are correct or not, they underline the difficulty of using criminal prosecutions as vehicles for large-scale reform. Criminal investigations are based on close analysis of what happened at a particular time and place. Brown's death at Wilson's hands is a classic example. At one level, the events of August 9 in Ferguson are undisputed. Brown robbed a convenience store. Moments later, he and Wilson had a confrontation at the window of Wilson's patrol car -- during which Wilson's gun fired. Brown, who was unarmed, walked away. Wilson pursued him and shot him dead. Outside of those facts, however, the details remain murky to this day. Who was the aggressor? What happened in the confrontation at the patrol car? Did Brown do anything to justify Wilson's decision to fire the fatal shots? Appropriately, these questions have been at the heart of the state and federal investigations. But these detailed questions about what happened between Brown and Wilson tell us little about the larger issues raised by the confrontation in Ferguson. What's it like for African-Americans who interact with the police? How do white police officers behave in largely minority communities? How can African-Americans receive dignified, equal treatment from the police -- and how can the police do their jobs in ways that keep themselves and their communities safe? How can better training of officers, more diversity in police forces and community policing make our communities safer? It's understandable to try to use cases such as those of Michael Brown and Eric Garner as metaphors for the larger issues we face as a society. We understand the world in stories, in narratives, and we use those stories to justify how we see the broader world. It's easier to try to figure out the nature of a confrontation between one civilian and one police officer than to parse the statistics that describe larger patterns of behavior. But these are two fundamentally different undertakings. Determining the distance between Wilson and Brown when the fatal shots were fired is a critical step in determining whether Wilson is guilty of a crime. But determining that distance will tell us very little about race relations in the United States. Symbols are important, but it's dangerous to think that symbolic criminal prosecutions are ever appropriate. The criminal law functions best when it is closely tethered to the facts of an individual case. Like defendants should always be treated in the same way; once a society starts singling out certain individuals as ""symbols"" of larger problems, that automatically distorts the system. Wilson deserves no worse (and no better) than to be treated like everyone else despite the symbolic importance his case has taken on. The same, of course, is true for the New York City police officers who caused the death of Garner, in Staten Island, on July 17. The failure to file criminal charges against Wilson, of course, should not be seen as a vindication of Wilson, the Ferguson police force or police officers generally. We live in a society where there are supposed to be substantial barriers to successful criminal prosecutions, like the highest standard of proof -- beyond a reasonable doubt. As a society, we care deeply, as we should, that innocent people are never convicted. But one individual's liberation should not be taken to mean that the whole society is free from scrutiny, or censure. There is much more work to do, regardless of what happens to Darren Wilson, or any other individual.","Jeffrey Toobin: Darren Wilson should be treated like everyone else despite case's symbolism .

"(CNN)A federal investigation has not found enough evidence to charge Darren Wilson for depriving Michael Brown of his civil rights, according to multiple sources familiar with the probe. This would be the second time the former police officer has avoided standing trial in the black teen's fatal shooting last summer in Ferguson, Missouri. The FBI joined local officials in interviewing more than 200 people -- and looked at much the same evidence -- as a St. Louis County grand jury that decided in November not to indict Wilson, who is white, on any charges in Brown's death. That federal law enforcement agency has now completed its investigation into the August shooting and sent its findings to the Justice Department, a law enforcement official and a separate U.S. official said Wednesday. Based on that probe, Justice Department prosecutors won't recommend civil rights charges against Wilson because there is not sufficient evidence to support them, a U.S. official told CNN. The New York Times first reported the development Wednesday. The Justice Department report has not been completed, and Attorney General Eric Holder ultimately will make the final decision whether to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson. Still, it wouldn't be a surprise if Holder doesn't call for charges. While he's been outspoken on Ferguson, met with Brown's family and said he understood African-Americans' mistrust for police after the incident, the attorney general acknowledged in November that ""federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases."" The shooting of the 18-year-old Brown stirred months of emotionally charged, widespread and at times violent demonstrations in Ferguson, a few miles northwest of St. Louis. ""Hands up, don't shoot"" became a mantra for protesters nationwide decrying what they called undue, unfair police violence against African-Americans, resonating even after grand jury testimony disputed whether Brown ever actually raised his arms in surrender. Those protests bubbled up in the days immediately after the shooting, with anger growing due to what some saw as law enforcement's heavy-handed response. And they swelled again after the grand jury's decision this fall not to indict Wilson on state charges. If Holder decides, based on prosecutors' recommendation, not to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson, that could rile things up yet again. Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who has been involved in the Ferguson protests, thinks some people will be disappointed, at the least. ""The community and the family wanted a day in court, an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out, cross-examined,"" French said. ""And it looks like that's not going to happen. I hope we don't have any violence as a result of this."" For now, though, Brown's family is laying low. What are the Brown family's options? Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, has said he felt federal civil rights charges against Wilson were ""not very likely"" given the ""very high standard"" that has to be met. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has noted that authorities would need proof that Wilson exhibited ""racial hostility,"" presumably by what he said before, during or after the shooting. The Brown camp deferred comment on Wednesday's news reports suggesting there would be no charges. ""The family of Michael Brown Jr. will wait for official word from the Justice Department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him,"" Crump said in a written statement. ""The family won't address speculation from anonymous sources."" Even without charges, this story isn't over. It's possible that Brown's family will file a civil lawsuit against Wilson, who resigned in late November citing security concerns. And the U.S. Justice Department still has another open investigation -- this one looking at the Ferguson Police Department as a whole. ""Anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,"" Holder said in September. ""Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail."" That investigation could lead to significant changes in Ferguson, much as similar federal probes have produced in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and elsewhere. But it wouldn't mean charges for Wilson, personally, or that anyone would go on trial. It's also possible there could be legislation, policy changes or personnel turnovers not forced by the federal government. In his State of the State speech on Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said addressing ""the broader, systemic issues"" raised by the unrest that followed the killing of Brown would demand ""sustained effort."" ""The legacy of Ferguson will be determined by what we do next ... to foster healing and hope ... and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities,"" he said. At the least, French said, he expects more protests to keep up pressure on authorities. ""That's a good thing,"" he said. ""But we want to keep them peaceful, nonviolent because violence makes the situation worse. It divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection."" Ultimately, he said, some of the protesters' goals can be achieved outside the courts. ""The next steps I think are legislative change,"" French said, ""trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law, and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments."" CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, Catherine E. Shoichet, Dave Alsup, Jethro Mullen and Wolf Blitzer contributed to this report.","Sources: Federal prosecutors don't think there's enough proof for civil rights charges .

"(CNN)Politicians, journalists and conservative activists will swoop into Des Moines this weekend for a major gathering of Republicans that's widely viewed as the first cattle call this cycle for the GOP presidential race. Close to 10 potential candidates will speak at the daylong Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday, co-hosted by the group Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a high-profile Republican from Iowa with serious clout among social conservatives. With Iowa the first state to vote in the presidential nominating season, it's considered a must-stop for White House hopefuls on both sides of the aisle, and this weekend gives 2016 players a chance to roll out their message to core caucus-goers, strategists say. Among those expected to speak are New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Notably, the top two potential contenders in the GOP race -- Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney -- are bypassing the event, both citing scheduling conflicts. Also skipping Iowa this weekend are Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who took a pass on a similar Iowa gathering of conservatives back in August, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who's holding his own retreat with donors and supporters in Miami Beach this weekend as he prepares to make a 2016 decision. Rubio and Paul, however, will join Cruz to speak at an event in Palm Springs, California, on Sunday that's hosted by a group backed by the Koch Brothers. The odd one out? One of the most highly anticipated speakers is Christie, who's considered the one-not-like-the-others at this weekend's assembly. Twice elected in a blue state, Christie's staked out more moderate and pragmatic territory on the political spectrum. He angered social conservatives when he dropped a legal challenge in 2013 against a court ruling that got rid of New Jersey's same-sex marriage ban. He also stirred up some controversy when he at first declined to offer his opinion on the Supreme Court's ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby last year, which said private companies cannot be required to pay to cover some types of contraceptives for their employees. Later, while Christie was in Iowa, the governor said he supported the ruling. When talking about social issues, Christie has largely focused on his efforts to enhance drug rehabilitation programs in his state, especially for non-violent criminals with drug convictions. ""When we say we're pro-life, we need to be pro-life for the entire life. We need to stand up for the hurt and the wounded,"" Christie told a religious right audience at a conference organized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition last summer. The governor has made five trips to Iowa in the past year, including stops to help raise money for King and Gov. Terry Branstad. With Romney and Bush soaking up much of the attention and resources among establishment Republicans, the summit will provide Christie a chance to stand out and earn points for simply showing up. ""In terms of optics, I think its clear that Gov. Christie intends to run — and has every intention to speaking to as many Iowans as possible,"" said Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist from Iowa. ""That's how you build a winning coalition — and he seems to get that."" What we'll be looking for . Christie has also been mum on his views about immigration reform. Political observers will be watching to see what candidates say about the issue in Iowa this week. King, one of the GOP's most vocal and flashy opponents of a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, made headlines recently when he referred to a guest at the State of the Union address as a ""deportable."" While King's comments on immigration have agitated even those within his party, he's still considered popular in his home state and a highly sought after name when candidates stop through Iowa. Other issues that could get frequent mention this weekend include same-sex marriage and abortion. Both topics have seen renewed attention in the last week, after the Supreme Court decided a week ago to take up same-sex marriage this year. The court will essentially decide whether states have the right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married. RELATED: Supreme Court gay marriage decision could have 2016 repercussions . Also on the social front, the House, in a battle that pitted Republicans against each other, passed a measure Thursday banning all taxpayer money for abortions after it failed to pass a bill that would ban so-called ""late -term"" abortions. This week also marked the 42nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, and tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists marched in the nation's capital to bring attention to the issue. Santorum, who battled Romney late into the 2012 primary season, tweeted out photos of his family yesterday explaining why they were marching. The former senator from Pennsylvania barely won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, edging out Romney in a delayed vote count—Romney was initially declared the winner—by 34 votes. Like Christie, some Republicans have also taken on criminal justice reform and anti-poverty policies as key talking points in their platforms. We'll see how potential candidates tackle those issues this weekend, especially as the party on the national level has made efforts to appeal to a wider audience. Several of the potential candidates plan to stay longer in Iowa. Huckabee has book signings on Sunday in Cedar Rapids and Windsor Heights, Iowa, while Perry is staying until Monday and Santorum until Tuesday for multiple events throughout the state.","Potential GOP presidential candidates will gather in Iowa this weekend .

"(CNN)Hopes that a peace process might take hold in Ukraine this year were quickly dashed by the resumption of heavy fighting last week around Ukraine's Donetsk airport. Now, as the tenuous ceasefire observed over the holidays falls apart, the question is whether this latest violation of the Minsk ceasefire agreement is the beginning of a separatist offensive to claim more territory. It certainly looks that way. On January 13, the leaders of Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), one of the two breakaway pro-Russian enclaves in Ukraine's Donbass region, issued Ukrainian troops an ultimatum to surrender Donetsk airport.  Since then, the long standing derelict control tower, subject to months of shelling, has finally collapsed and with it any likelihood that this conflict will stay frozen over the winter.  The assault triggered a Ukrainian counterattack, and erupted into a full scale conflagration. Ukraine's defense ministry has said it has withdrawn from the main terminal at Donetsk airport, but it is doubtful that separatist forces only have that in their sights anyway.  After all, although the site holds symbolic value for both sides, it is a hulking ruin and of little strategic relevance. And the leader of DNR, Alexander Zakharchenko, has made clear he believes the borders of his breakaway republic should include the entire Donetsk region, which is double the current territory he controls.  Such ambitions are not likely to be realized during the freezing cold of January, but separatist forces are now engaged in combat north of Luhansk and as far south as Mariupol. It is difficult to see Russia's army sitting out on the sidelines as all this unfolds, leaving the stage set for another battle between Ukrainian and Russian regular forces as Ukraine's leadership and army are put to the test again. True, the separatist force barely numbers 25,000-30,000, and only a fraction of it is combat-capable. But the timing of this latest operation is clearly aimed at fostering instability in Ukraine at a moment of economic weakness, rather than taking advantage of any newfound military opportunity.  Ukraine's cash reserves fell to $7.5 billion in December, while the political leadership is desperately awaiting a new tranche of funding from the IMF, without which Ukraine may soon go bankrupt. Meanwhile, Ukraine faces an incredibly difficult year due to GDP contraction, inflation, currency devaluation, and anticipated fiscal austerity measures.  Since much of its army depends on volunteer donations to survive in the field, prolonged fighting will create unbearable strain, on the people and the country.  And despite Russia's economic woes, as well as the impact of Western sanctions, nothing seems to have visibly constrained Moscow's policies in Ukraine. In retrospect, it is clear Russia had no intention of starting this year with negotiations, rather than military action to change facts on the ground. Russian leaders are for their part trapped in a dilemma of their own making.  They are unable to secure Russian influence in Ukraine through the current agreement, in a manner that relieves sanctions, and satisfies separatist desires for a viable independent territory. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, of course also lacks domestic political support for a genuine compromise with Moscow, having created a coalition government with his political rival.  However, it is Russia that struggles under sanctions and must find a way out of the current situation.  And unfortunately, the only way out for Moscow seems to be war. For Russia, the Minsk agreement is a dead end.  The fact is that it should be for the United States as well.  Making Russia stick to this agreement, despite its uselessness in achieving any path to settlement in the conflict, is a negotiating position that is unrealistic and has run its course.  The pressure of sanctions is insufficient to coerce Russia away from using force, meaning that instead of a diplomatic victory, the West is witnessing Ukraine cede more territory to the separatists.  Another defeat will shake its political system as well. How should the West respond? The U.S. has no good choices, only hard decisions to make.  The first priority should be to negotiate a new ceasefire to end the bloodshed.  If separatist goals are truly limited, it should not take long.  Then, the Minsk agreement should be scrapped as a basis for settlement.  That is far from Ukraine's first choice, but it is not in a position to expect best outcomes, especially when its army is in retreat. Meanwhile, the West needs to work with Russian and Ukrainian leaders to come up with new terms.  The framework will look similar to Minsk, but sanctions and economic woes have undoubtedly created strategic clarity in Moscow about the need for this conflict to end this year.  Plus, the latest fighting will change Kiev's perspective as well. If all this proves unsuccessful, then there is nothing to stop Western leaders from providing more weapons to Ukraine, or imposing new hardships on Russia.  The latest fighting demonstrates the limits of what those policies might accomplish for Ukraine.  Russia has not been brought to heel.  It is time to try for a new peace settlement.","Fighting has erupted in past week at Ukraine's Donetsk airport .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Yemen's President resigned Thursday night shortly after his prime minister and the Cabinet stepped down: seismic changes in the country's political scene that come just one day after the government and Houthi rebels struck a tentative peace deal meant to end days of turmoil. The resignations of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and other officials are the latest fallout from the Houthis' move in recent days to gain power in the capital, which included kidnapping Hadi's chief of staff on Saturday and taking over the presidential palace on Tuesday. The chaos in Yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders. For the United States and its allies, Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo. The United States responded by reducing embassy personnel in the capital because of security concerns, a senior State Department official said Thursday night. ""While the embassy remains open and is continuing to operate, we may continue to re-align resources based on the situation on the ground,"" the official said. The Cabinet and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah resigned before Hadi did on Thursday night, with Bahah telling Hadi in a letter that they essentially wanted to wash their hands of ""destructive political chaos,"" an apparent reference to the deal that was to give Houthis more power. We resigned ""so that we are not made party to what is going on and what will happen,"" Bahah wrote in the letter, which Yemeni Information Minister Nadia Sakkaf posted on Twitter. Hadi's resignation came soon afterward. It wasn't immediately clear who would succeed Hadi. The Houthis' latest push to power picked up steam on Saturday. The Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country, kidnapped presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak in the capital, Sanaa, on Saturday. The rebels then took over the presidential palace Tuesday, prompting talk of a coup. The tentative deal reached Wednesday called for bin Mubarak's release, as well as measures to give the Houthis more political power, according to a Yemeni official with access to a draft text of the agreement. But by Thursday, before the top officials quit, Sakkaf questioned whether the rebels would live up to their side of the pact. ""Ahmed Mubarak is still #Houthis hostage despite deal. They got what they want why should they fulfill their promise?"" she said on Twitter. She added, ""I have been following up the promises to release Dr. Ahmed bin Mubarak since the beginning. Conclusion: Buying time."" Mistrust was hampering the implementation of the peace deal, both sides said Thursday. One Yemeni presidential adviser told CNN the government was waiting for the Houthis to release bin Mubarak, but acknowledged that the rebels have withdrawn some forces. Ahmed Al Bahri, a Houthi official, said they were unsure of how serious Hadi was about the deal, and that they were keeping 20% of their militia numbers in the presidential palace and other key buildings as a guarantee. Questions about who was in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold. Besides the Charlie Hebdo attack, AQAP also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. ISIS is also recruiting in Yemen to expand its ranks. Under the peace deal, the Houthi rebels agreed to withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step: rewriting parts of the country's constitution, according to the Yemeni official. Under its terms, the government would accept changes in the draft of the new constitution that would grant the Houthis more political power. Word of the deal still leaves many questions unanswered: What could the reshaped constitution look like? How much power will the rebels get? U.S. officials said they're unclear about the intentions of the Houthis. Do they want to run the government? Or be a powerful opposition? There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, according to U.S. officials. Multiple policy options are being considered, the officials said, though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed. Al Qaeda benefits from Yemen takeover . Several of the constitutional changes sought by the Houthis would emphasize the characteristics of Yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups. Seven things to know about Yemen . The Houthis call for marginalized political groups to have the right to partnerships in state institutions and fair representation, according to the text of the tentative agreement. In return for these government concessions, the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital, where they control or blockade several government installations: the presidential palace, the presidential residence, the Prime Minister's residence and a military installation where missiles are housed. A Houthi official said the rebels would abide by the deal if the President follows a timeline specified in the negotiations for the political process. This isn't the first time the rebels and the government have hammered out an agreement. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 people dead in a month. In September, they signed a ceasefire deal with the government, and Houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions.

"Two men, shocked at what they saw, describe an unarmed teenager with his hands up in the air as he's gunned down by a police officer. They were contractors doing construction work in Ferguson, Missouri, on the day Michael Brown was killed. And the men, who asked not to be identified after CNN contacted them, said they were about 50 feet away from Officer Darren Wilson when he opened fire. An exclusive video captures their reactions during the moments just after the shooting. ""He had his f**n hands up,"" one of the men says in the video. The man told CNN he heard one gunshot, then another shot about 30 seconds later. ""The cop didn't say get on the ground. He just kept shooting,"" the man said. That same witness described the gruesome scene, saying he saw Brown's ""brains come out of his head,"" again stating, ""his hands were up."" The video shows the man raising his arms in the air -- just as, he says, Brown was doing when he was shot. The other contractor told CNN he saw Brown running away from a police car. Brown ""put his hands up,"" the construction worker said, and ""the officer was chasing him."" The contractor says he saw Wilson fire a shot at Brown while his back was turned. The men said they didn't see how the confrontation started. Police arrest Michael Brown protesters near interstate . Other witnesses also said teen's arms were raised . An attorney for the man who filmed the video says it was recorded 40 seconds after the shooting. The video gives new insight into the case, which has spurred a Justice Department investigation, national debate and protests over authorities' handling of the case. The construction workers said they don't live in Ferguson and don't know the Brown family, but their account squares with accounts from several other witnesses of the unarmed African-American teen's shooting death on August 9. Some witnesses say the teenager assaulted the white officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun; other witnesses say Wilson was the aggressor. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. A grand jury is hearing the case and will determine whether Wilson will face any charges. Protesters were near Interstate 70 and outside the police headquarters Wednesday, pushing for Gov. Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Brown's death. Analysts debate video's impact . CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says the video could play an important role in the case. ""You have practically in real time someone discussing what they saw, and that's just good evidence,"" he said on CNN's ""AC360."" Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, says it's important to note that several witnesses are telling the same story. ""They're saying that he was running from the police officer and that his hands were up,"" she said. ""I don't know what other witness testimony at this point or account we have to hear. The bottom line is having your hands up is the universal sign for surrender."" Neil Bruntrager, general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, cautioned against rushing to judgment. Witness accounts are important, he said, but need to be evaluated with all the evidence. ""I'm not saying disregard them. I'm saying that we will judge their credibility by all of the evidence, not by one statement, and certainly not by a 15-second video clip,"" he said.

"(CNN)Was the priceless funeral mask of King Tutankhamun damaged and hastily glued back together? That's the claim made by a museum conservator to Egyptian media. The conservator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Egypt's state-owned Ahram Online that the mask's beard broke off by accident when the mask fell as it was being cleaned last year at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. He said the blue-and-gold braided beard was fixed back in place quickly with epoxy, a type of strong adhesive. ""The epoxy was not a proper material to use to restore the mask, although it is a conservation material with a very high strength for attaching metal and stone,"" he is quoted as saying. The conservator said there was now a gap between the face and the beard where the glue had dried. However, the Egyptian Museum's general director, Mahmoud El-Halwagi, dismissed the claims in an interview with Ahram Online, saying the beard was in its original position and that nothing had happened to the mask since he took up his position in October. ""An archaeological committee was assigned to inspect the mask and beard in order to write a detailed report on the mask's condition,"" he said. Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty also told Ahram Online that media reports of damage to the mask were unfounded. The boy king's elaborate burial mask, discovered in his tomb in 1922, is one of Egypt's most outstanding artifacts. Tutankhamun, who ruled from 1336-1327 BC, is thought to have been about 17 years old when he died, based on analysis of his mummy, according to the British Museum. His cause of death is not known. If confirmed, it won't be the first time a historical treasure was damaged in an institution supposed to keep it safe. In 2006, a visitor to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, famously tripped on a staircase and smashed three hugely valuable Chinese Qing dynasty vases. The thousands of porcelain fragments were eventually painstakingly reassembled.","A conservator tells state-owned Ahram Online that the beard broke off during cleaning .

"Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up a case concerning the lethal injection protocol that left an inmate in Oklahoma to die slowly and gasping for breath last year. The case, which is likely to be heard this term, was brought by inmates who claim the state protocol violates the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and could open a new chapter in the ongoing battle over the patchwork system of execution procedures in the United States. ""Petitioners are pleased that the Supreme Court will review their case,"" said Dale Baich, one of the attorneys representing the death row inmates. In a statement, Baich said that the protocol is ""not capable of producing a humane execution, even if administered properly. "" An original plaintiff in the case, Charles F. Warner, was put to death last week. Another plaintiff, Richard E. Glossip, is set to die on January 29. It was just nine months ago that Oklahoma botched the execution of Clayton Lockett using the same protocol. Related: Botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions . Botched Oklahoma execution haunts inmate as death nears . But Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt defended the state's lethal injection procedure in a statement Friday. ""Oklahoma's execution protocol has been affirmed as constitutional by two federal courts and has successfully been implemented in Oklahoma, as well as more than 10 similar executions in Florida,"" he said. ""We will continue to defend the constitutionality of this protocol in order to preserve DOC's ability to proceed with the sentences that were given to each inmate by a jury of their peers."" In 2008 -- in a case called Baze v. Rees -- the court found Kentucky's lethal injection protocol constitutional, but since then, as they struggle to locate lethal injection drugs, many states have changed their protocols and have experimented with different drugs. In court papers, Baich asked the justices to take up the case to ""revisit Baze v. Rees because the lethal injection landscape has changed significantly in the last seven years."" ""The time is right for the court to take a careful look at this important issue,"" Baich said. Oklahoma uses  an intravenous injection of midazolam meant to cause unconsciousness, followed by rocuronium bromide, which works as a paralytic, and then potassium chloride that serves as a heart-stopping agent. Critics of Oklahoma's protocol say that the first drug, midazolam, is not FDA approved as a general anesthetic. They say midazolam fails to maintain unconsciousness. Florida, Oklahoma, Alabama and Virginia use the same three-drug protocol that includes midazolam, according to Megan McCracken, a death penalty expert at U.C. Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.  Other states such as Ohio and Arizona have used the drug in a two-drug combination. Ohio recently abandoned the use Midazolam after the execution of Dennis McGuire. ""What's at issue here is the use of midazolam and whether it is at all appropriate for execution,"" said McCracken. ""There  have only been three executions where the prisoner was not paralyzed after the administration of mid and all three went horribly awry, raising serious concerns about the drug and whether it allow humane execution,"" she said.","The high court will review Oklahoma's lethal injection procedure .

"(CNN)As a guy with a Fred Flintstone physique, competing on the same runway with a Miss Universe contestant was never on my bucket list. Yet, there I was, alone with the stunning Miss Ghana 2014, as we eyeballed each other's outfits head to toe. Abena Akuaba Appiah, who will battle for the planet's most prestigious tiara this weekend at the 63rd annual Miss Universe Pageant, was wearing a form-fitting ivory mini dress with black leather go-go boots. I was wearing a sleeveless purple satin V-neck dress with neon yellow Reeboks. ""I like your dress,"" she said, without the slightest trace of irony. Pretending to be used to such compliments, I replied, ""Right back at ya!"" before awkwardly turning the conversation to Ghana's geography, of which I knew nothing. (Note to self: The next time I hang out with Miss Ghana, remember that her home city of Accra is the capital.) The ""runway"" we shared last fall was one mile of pavement along the Hudson River in Hoboken, New Jersey. We were fellow participants in the ""Runaway Bridesmaids"" charity race for Airline Ambassadors International, an organization that trains airport employees to spot and report human trafficking. Dozens of women and men stampeded in formal gowns and party dresses for the fundraiser, prompting Ms. Appiah to switch out her high-heeled boots for sneakers. Before the race, as Miss Ghana's bodyguard snapped pics of us with her mobile phone, I imagined what she might be texting her friends and family back home: ""Dear Mom and Dad: If this contestant in the purple dress is a preview of my competition, this pageant will be a breeze!"" Her real Instagram feed was much kinder, praising me and another male bridesmaid for our ""courage."" For the same reasons I love the ""It's a Small World"" ride at Disney, I always look forward to watching the Miss Universe contest. It's a kitschy, utopian universe where countries are supposed to set aside their petty rivalries and hatreds and pretend to be BFFs. Critics can dismiss it as a sexualized hybrid of the United Nations and the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. But for the three hours the contestants stand on stage, it doesn't matter how big their country's army is, the size of the nation's gross national product, or whether it has nuclear weapons. It's fascinating to see if that façade can even last three hours. This week Miss Lebanon Saly Greige weathered a PR crisis at home for posing in a selfie taken by Miss Israel Doron Matalon along with Miss Slovenia and Miss Japan. It is against Lebanese law to make contact with Israelis. Although she is smiling in the picture, Miss Lebanon accused Miss Israel of ""photobombing"" her, and it's understandable why she's running scared.  In 1993, Miss Lebanon Ghada Turk was stripped of her title when she posed with the then-Miss Israel. The Miss Universe Facebook page is filled with fun-spirited group pics like this: Random contestants frolicking on the beach, strutting on the golf course, hugging local children and taking Zumba dance classes. I kid you not, Miss Italy and Miss Turkey even had a ""roomie-pajama party"" wearing matching socks! (Exclamation point is the pageant's, not mine.) What will happen if Miss Israel and Miss Lebanon both make the Top 5 on Sunday night? How about Miss Russia and Miss Ukraine? Will contestants from any of the former Soviet bloc countries -- Miss Poland, Miss Hungary, Miss Czech Republic -- give Miss Russia the stink eye? Just like the Olympic Opening Ceremony, the Miss Universe pageant encourages people (on stage and at home) to momentarily be classy and see each other as individuals versus national or ethnic stereotypes. Not that any of the millions of viewers around the globe will be asking for a geography lesson, but the competition also forces people to wonder: ""So where exactly IS Trinidad and Tobago?"" and ""How cool is it to have an ampersand in your country's name?"" Back to my personal competition with Miss Ghana, I surprised myself by crossing the finish line a few minutes ahead of her. For unknown reasons, she chose to walk (well, glide) through the race course and coolly acted as if winning were unimportant. However, Ms. Appiah could soundly defeat me in a burping contest. According to her official Miss Universe bio, Miss Ghana can burp ""more than 50 times in a row."" All those curves must do wonders for the acoustics. I'll definitely be rooting for her to win it all. How could I not? She liked my dress.","Darren Garnick: Miss Universe contest a kitschy, utopian event where nations put aside their rivalries and act like BFFFs .

"One week ago, Jaylen Fryberg stood tall as part of his high school's homecoming court, spurring his fellow students to cheer. On Friday, he brought them to tears. There's a jarring disparity between the celebratory scene on the sidelines of Marysville-Pilchuck High School's football field and the horrific, later one inside the Washington state school's cafeteria. Fryberg was center of attention both times: first as one of his school's most popular students, then as a student who eyewitnesses said shot his peers, killing one of them, before turning his gun on himself. As classmate Jordan Luton, among others, said: ""Nobody would have expected it from him."" 2 dead, including gunman, in school shooting . For some, high school can be a hard place to be widely embraced. But not for Fryberg, according to students there. The scene at halftime of Marysville-Pilchuck High School's October 17 football game with Arlington High School is testament. There stood Fryberg, looking dapper in a tie, vest and sneakers, with his long hair tied up tightly. A schoolmate noted Fryberg played football and planned to try out soon for wrestling; then people in the stands applauded him, with enthusiastic whistles and yells of admiration thrown in for good measure. The occasion was Fryberg being named the freshmen's ""Homecoming Prince,"" joining others in Marysville-Pilchuck High School's royal court. Friend and fellow student Nate Heckendorf explained that this honor means ""a lot of people had good hopes for him and thought the best of him."" ""That (title) means ... teachers like you. Your peers like you,"" said Rachel Heichel, another freshman. ""You're a person that everyone likes and a good person."" All those applied to Fryberg, according to Heichel. ""He was a people person,"" she said. ""... He was just a really nice kid and all-around good person."" An avid outdoorsman . Fryberg was more than a beloved student or talented athlete. He was a proud Native American. According to his social media accounts, he belonged to the Tulalip tribe, which runs a resort casino in Marysville, a city of 60,000 located 30 miles north of Seattle. A fellow tribe member and local CrossFit coach told CNN affiliate KIRO that the teenager was not only ""very nice,"" but ambitious -- such that he might have one day become a tribal leader. Fryberg was an avid outdoorsman who liked to go hunting and had guns. Just three months ago, he posted a picture to Instagram of himself holding a rifle, along with the words: ""Probably the best BirthDay present ever! I just love my parents!!!"" Schoolmates and his social media accounts suggest that all was not happy with Fryberg, especially soon before the shooting. Luton said that, a few weeks ago, Fryberg got into a fight with someone who ""said something racist to him."" Heckendorf elaborated ""there was bullying involved and a couple words said towards him that he obviously didn't like,"" noting that Fryberg got suspended after the fight. A federal law enforcement source also said he'd been suspended. That's not to say, as Heckendorf and others stressed, that this altercation necessarily had anything to do with what happened Friday. Police have not formally identified the attacker. Looking to social media for possible clues . Other potential clues might lie in Fryberg's Twitter feed, which hints at a breakup with a girlfriend in recent months. It also includes a post from Tuesday saying, ""It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to."" His final Tweet, on Thursday, was much shorter: ""It won't last.... It'll never last...."" That same day, Luton said he talked to Fryberg at football practice ""and he was all fine."" And Heckendorf chatted with him even more recently, on Friday morning, asking Fryberg how he was doing and offering him his ear whenever needed. ""And he said, 'OK, thank you,'"" Heckendorf said. ""We did a little handshake, and he was off. He looked pretty content with life."" All these impressions, all these interactions made what happened later that morning in Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria more shocking. Heichel was there when Fryberg apparently went up to a spot a few tables away and fired his gun. When she heard more shots, she turned around and ""saw him standing there ... the gun in his hand."" ""When I saw him, I was like, 'Oh my God, that's Jaylen,'"" she said. ""I would have never expected it would have been him, out of all people. ""It was really heartbreaking for me to see that.""","Jaylen Fryberg shot 5, killing 1, at his Washington high school before killing himself .

"New Delhi (CNN)India and the United States, the two largest democracies, seem like natural allies. The kinship between their leaders, however, has been a bit of a surprise. There are, of course, the obvious perceptual differences: President Barack Obama studied law at Harvard, relishes golf and prefers his suits sober, in dark gray or navy blue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a modest education, swears by yoga and readily wears flamboyant hats depicting India's diverse heritage. And then there's the small matter of paperwork: Modi was a pariah in the United States just one year ago, his visa revoked over his handling of riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state of Gujarat. But what a difference a year — and a big electoral victory — makes. When President Obama arrives in New Delhi on Sunday, he will have met Modi four times in five months: at the White House, at the East Asia Summit in Myanmar, at the G20 Summit in Australia and now in India. The latest visit is the most significant: Obama will become the first U.S. president to visit India twice, and the first American chief guest at India's Republic Day parade. It's an open declaration of friendship. What explains this unlikely rapport? Aides on both sides have pointed out that when the two leaders met in Washington in September, there was a palpable chemistry. They shared a sense of priorities, of where they wanted the alliance to head. On his previous visit to India, in 2009, Obama spoke of the two democracies forming one of the ""defining partnerships"" of the 21st century. But in those initial years, the partnership became strained. First came a stalled nuclear deal; later, a needless spat over an Indian diplomat in New York. India's disappointing growth, meanwhile, seemed to lead to declining interest. Modi has now successfully hit the reset button. By not bearing a grudge against Washington for blacklisting him, and by wooing American business with gusto, he has revived a flagging partnership. Americans who have negotiated with Indian teams under Modi say it's evident the new Prime Minister has been clear with his envoys: It's time to fix things with Washington. And so it comes down to Modi and Obama in New Delhi. Indian TV channels alternate between flashing banners saying ""Namaste Obama"" one minute and asking about ""deliverables"" from the summit the next. For days, teams in London have been hammering out a potential deal to trade civilian nuclear energy. There is talk of increased ties on defense, and on renewable energy. Climate change will be an important topic for both sides: India generates more than half its energy needs from the dirtiest fuel in common use, coal. And there will be much more soaring rhetoric. On a visit earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for trade between the two countries to multiply five times. That will be unattainable for quite a while. It may be asking too much to judge the Modi-Obama summit through deliverables alone. After all, the invitation came just a couple of months ago when the two met in Myanmar. Symbolism has inherent value: By visiting India for a second time, Obama is putting New Delhi on the map in Washington. In India, he will be seen by a generation of young Indians on TV; they will glow with pride that the world's most powerful man has come to town once again. The real work between the two countries will continue at a smaller, ongoing level: with increased people-to-people contact, with more trade, with more tourism, with an energized Indian diaspora in the United States, and with many, many more days of talks between the two countries' envoys. In many ways, the people on both sides are ahead of policy. According to a Pew Research Center survey last year, 58% of Indians view Americans favorably, with only 18% holding an unfavorable view. It's time for government to catch up. With both India and the United States benefiting from lower crude prices and a growth upswing, this is as good a time as any.","U.S. President Barack Obama travels to India this weekend .
Ravi Agrawal: Kinship between leaders has been a surprise ."
"(CNN)I was 8 when I watched my first and only Republic Day parade in my home in India. Back then, long before Delhi's population swelled to its current 20 million, the streets seemed wide and open and my eyes feasted on a sea of saffron, green and white, the colors of my country's flag. The annual January 26 parade celebrates the day in 1950 when a newly independent Republic of India adopted its first constitution. It's India's showiest moment of pride, when patriotism trumps all and the nation lays out its culture, accomplishments and military might for the world to see. This year, President Barack Obama will see the festivities firsthand. He's the first U.S. leader India has invited to be the guest of honor and the first president to visit India twice in his tenure. That's a sign, I believe, of how far India has come from the nation of my childhood. Back then, I stood in the crowd thinking of things I learned in school about India's rich history and valiant struggle for freedom from British colonizers. But it was impossible to forget I was born in the ""Third World."" Signs of poverty and despair were everywhere. I often heard this refrain: ""The East shall rise again."" But I held no expectations, no hopes, really, that my homeland would ever be any different. Not in my lifetime. But over the last two decades, I have been going home to a radically transformed India, one that has experienced immense economic growth and social change. Now, Obama is making history with his trip. He'll stand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Rajpath, the grand avenue that leads to India Gate, Delhi's version of the Arc de Triomphe. Obama will also be meeting Modi for the second time within the span of a few months; the two met at the White House at the end of September on Modi's first trip as prime minister to the United States. All this indicates India's arrival on the global stage. Rick Rossow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it this way: ""It's a big deal. There's no better way to put it."" Modi's invitation to Obama, say India experts, is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump-start relations between the two countries. Modi's a controversial figure; some blame him for doing nothing to stop a massacre of Muslims in Gujarat, the western Indian state where he was chief minister. But Indians voted him into the highest office of the land in a roaring landslide victory. They were fed up with years of stagnation and government corruption and in Modi, they saw the man who can again make India prosper. So, apparently does Obama. South Asia expert Milan Vaishnav told me the White House has been waiting a long time to conduct business with India with confidence. ""In Modi, they believe they have found that elusive leader, and they don't want to pass up the opportunity,"" says Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Both India and the United States want a strong economy and a strong defense. A good guess is that the leaders of the world's two largest democracies will talk trade and terrorism. They are also likely to take up the issue of Chinese dominance. Besides Japan, India is America's strongest ally on that matter. ""We really talk about it more as not a counterweight to China, but you want a multipolar Asian future,"" says Rossow of CSIS. ""You know, you want multiple sources of power in any jurisdiction, and we would love for India to be because, of course, we've got an alignment of values."" That last point got me thinking about India's growing prominence and what the world might look like 50 years from now in terms of power. America may not be the sole superpower anymore. And that refrain from my childhood could be ringing true after all. The East is rising. People in the West often talk about the emergence of India on the world stage. But that's because they don't know the history of my homeland: that for centuries, India was one of the richest countries in the world -- until the British Empire swallowed it up and left it destitute. The British even stole the famous Kohinoor diamond and stuck it on the queen's crown. I recently read a story in the Indian news magazine Tehelka that mentioned a 1983 study of the world economy that created quite a stir among Western economists. The study said that in 1750, China owned 33% of the global GDP and India, 24.5 %. In the same year, the combined share of Britain and the United States was a mere 2%. A subsequent analysis found that India had the largest economy in the world for 1,700 of the past 2,000 years. So to call India an emerging power is silly. If anything, my homeland is re-emerging as the global power it once was. India, of course, has a way to go to catch China, although it has already outranked Japan as the third largest economy. OPINION: ""Why 2015 will be a defining year for India"" Economic historian Robert Fogel has predicted that by 2040, the Chinese economy will reach $123 trillion. That's three times the economic output of the entire globe and quite staggering when you consider that China was considered a poor country in 2000. Fogel thinks China's per capita income will hit $85,000, more than double the forecast for the European Union. China's GDP at 40% will dwarf America's 14%. But some economists think that India has a chance to leap over China in about 50 years. The most recent World Bank forecast says growth in India is likely to outdo China's. Granted, it's a prediction that has been made before and India has disappointed. But now with Modi in the driver's seat, many experts are hopeful that India can resolve problems of political stasis and take off like it was supposed to have done a decade ago. India, says Rossow, is destined to become another pole of power. ""India is a large country that will be population-wise, in the next 20 years, probably surpassing China,"" says Rossow. ""Economy-wise, it'll be a rival and growing quite heavily."" That's why my city councilman in Atlanta, Kwanza Hall, is visiting India. Coincidentally, he will be there at the same time as Obama. I recently spoke with Hall about why he is going on the State Department-sponsored trip. ""The geopolitics of the world and its economic focus has shifted and it will continue to shift East,"" Hall told me. ""India is a very significant player."" Hall, of course, is interested in strengthening Indian business ties with the city of Atlanta, home to more than 100,000 South Asian immigrants. He says he is impressed by the burgeoning middle class in India and by the fact that India is rooted in democracy, unlike China. India has the advantage of leapfrogging its development, says Hall. Indians are innovating above and beyond what was normal in the West and they have the advantage of learning from mistakes made by developed nations. ""They have a chance to address education, poverty and heath care in a wholesale way,"" says Hall. ""Whichever emerging superpower brings its people along the best will be the most dynamic. The human element is what people always leave out."" Obama, says Hall, has every reason to reach out to Modi, a man who began as a ""chai wallah"" -- a tea seller -- and became prime minister of India. That, after all, is the American dream realized in the land of my birth.","As a child, I felt pride in my homeland's valiant history .

"Washington (CNN)Tens of thousands of pro-life activists descended on Washington on Thursday for the annual March for Life, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal — by promising to end it. By the size of the crowds and the enthusiasm of the speakers, it was impossible to tell that just the night before, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill had spiked one of social conservatives' biggest priorities, a bill banning abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy. The scramble over the bill behind closed doors was the latest in a series of conflicts within the caucus, and again underscored the challenge facing the GOP as they head into a presidential election year: How to expand the party's appeal with untapped demographic groups, while still appeasing their conservative base. That was the concern raised by Rep. Renee Ellmers, the North Carolina Republican who, along with a group of GOP women and centrists in the party, led the successful effort to get the bill pulled. ""The first vote we take, or the second vote, or the fifth vote, shouldn't be on an issue where we know that millennials—social issues just aren't as important [to them],"" she told National Journal last week. Ellmers and Rep. Jackie Walorski pulled their sponsorships because of concerns over a requirement that rape victims file a police report to get an exemption from the ban. Other centrist Republicans expressed concerns on Thursday that the party should be focusing on less controversial issues with broader appeal. ""This appeared to be messaging bill, and the message that was being sent was not a very good one,"" Republican Rep Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said. ""I would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues, because that distracts us from broader economic messages where I think we have much greater appeal to the larger public,"" he said. The GOP has long faced significant issues in wooing single female voters and young voters, which contributed to its unexpected loss of the White House in 2012. After that election, an RNC post-mortem report diagnosing the party's problems suggested the GOP ""must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming"" on social issues. SEE ALSO: House GOP leaders cave on abortion bill . But as centrists in the party look to move away from the abortion issue, they'll run up against fierce opposition from social conservatives, who were calling for revenge against Ellmers and other lawmakers who led the effort to drop the bill. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, told CNN she met with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday night and was ""shocked and surprised"" when she was told they wouldn't be bringing the bill to a floor for a vote. ""No one ever brought up any of these issues. No one ever brought it up in the Senate races where we injected it in the middle of the campaign,"" she said. ""[House Republicans] have managed to really pull [defeat] out of the jaws of victory for sure."" House leadership has told her that the bill will eventually come up for a vote, but gave her no time line. A leadership aide said lawmakers are going to discuss how to move forward with the bill, but it's not clear what's next for it. Dannenfelser said Ellmers is almost certain to face a primary challenge in 2012. ""My phone does not stop ringing with people asking me, what are we going to do about her next year? I want to stay focused on getting the bill passed — but some people ... there's no protecting some people once they've gone past the tipping point,"" she said. Ellmers represents a GOP-leaning district and won her last primary with less than 60% support, so the threat of a challenge in 2016 over the abortion issue is a significant one for her. But it's less clear how the issue will play out for the GOP as a whole. This time last year, the RNC passed a resolution urging Republican candidates to speak out on the abortion issue on the campaign trail, and attendees at the event, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, said it was a winning issue. This time around, Priebus was elsewhere, and Republicans made little mention the abortion issue at their winter meeting. Most of the GOP's likely presidential contenders kept mum on the developments on Capitol Hill. Rick Santorum, who was the favorite of social conservatives during the 2012 race and is contemplating another run, was relatively subdued about leadership pulling the bill. ""I'm disappointed,"" he said, ""but leadership is just doing what good leadership does — which is listen to its members and try to work out a bill that is acceptable to the most within the caucus."" And  few dozen protesters, mostly college students and older activists, gathered outside Ellmers' office after the march to express their frustration with her move. One, Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins, called Ellmers a ""coward"" for previously supporting a similar bill, before working to block this one. But asked whether candidates should run on the abortion issue if they hope to appeal to millennials, she demurred. ""Obviously, there are a ton of important issues that millennials care about...but I think they shouldn't shy away from it,"" she said.","At the March for Life on Thursday, thousands of pro-life activists pledged to end abortion .

"Does a terminally ill child in intolerable pain have a right to die? Belgian lawmakers said yes. The lower house of the Belgian Parliament adopted a bill that extends the right to euthanasia for minors, the Parliament said Thursday on its official Twitter account. The law passed 86 to 44 with 12 abstentions. That followed a vote by the country's Senate in December supporting the measure. The next step would see the bill go to the king, Philippe, to be signed into law. The euthanasia bill is widely supported -- but has stoked fierce opposition from critics. Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in ""constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated."" Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. The new bill would extend the ""right to die"" to those under the age of 18 only under certain strict conditions, including that the child is judged able to understand what euthanasia means. Consent of parents or guardians must also be given. Mother Linda van Roy, from Schilde, Belgium, is among those backing the bill. She could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby, Ella-Louise, in the last hours of her life. Ella-Louise, who was 10 months old when she died just over two years ago, would never have qualified for euthanasia. But her mother had to watch as her baby -- who had Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system -- slowly faded away under palliative sedation, food and liquid withheld so her suffering was not further prolonged. Children should 'have a choice' ""That whole period of sedation, you always need to give more and more medication, and you start asking questions. And you say, 'What's the use of keeping this baby alive?' "" van Roy said. She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. That's why she's campaigning for a change to Belgium's euthanasia laws, to give the choice of ending their suffering to older children whose bodies are wracked with pain. ""We want for those children to be able to talk about euthanasia and to ask those questions and if they really want to say, 'Stop, this is it, I don't want it anymore,' that they can have a choice,"" van Roy said. Pediatrician Gerlant van Berlae of the Free University of Brussels is among the medical professionals backing the change in the law. He told CNN that in practice it would make little difference. ""Doctors do terminate lives, of children as well as adults,"" he said. ""But today it is done in, let's say, a 'gray zone,' or in the dark, because it is illegal."" Pediatricians: No urgent need for this law . However, 175 pediatricians signed an open letter Thursday urging more time for reflection before any decision is made. The letter argues that the law ""responds to no real demand"" and that most medical teams caring for terminally ill children would recognize that none of their patients has made a spontaneous and voluntary demand for euthanasia. Meanwhile, medical advances mean that effective palliative care is available and that children do not suffer as they approach death. Extending the ""right to die"" to minors will only add to the stress and pain of families at a difficult time, it said. The letter also questions how any objective judgment can be made on a child's ability to understand what's at stake. The political process has created a ""false impression"" that a change to the law is urgently needed -- but in reality ""the situation in our country is far from being dramatic,"" the doctors say. Others also question whether children have the capacity to take this most final of decisions for themselves. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, told CNN she is concerned that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that it would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. 'If you leave, you leave forever' Izabela Sacewicz has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Having recently turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. ""Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God,"" she says. ""But if you leave, you leave forever."" Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. ""Do you think it's good, or not good?"" her mother asks. ""It's not good,"" she replies, the words barely audible. Iwona says that with enough support, no parent would think of euthanasia -- and that Belgium's lawmakers should instead focus on providing better support for families caring for terminally ill children. Supporters insist the measure is more a matter of principle than anything else -- and that only a small number of children will ever, in practice, ask to end their lives through euthanasia. Under its strict guidelines, no doctor would be forced to carry out euthanasia against his or her will and the child would always have the option of palliative treatment. A child psychologist or psychiatrist would have to examine the child to make sure he or she is capable of making the decision. In the Netherlands, where children have been able to request euthanasia with parental consent since 2002, only five children have ever done so.

"(CNN)Four black bears that died in the New Hampshire woods last year overdosed on chocolate bait, wildlife officials said this week. A necropsy by the University of New Hampshire showed the bears -- two adult females and two cubs -- died from too much theobromine, a chemical compound in cocoa that's toxic to animals. The bears were found dead in September within 50 feet of where a hunter said he placed 90 pounds of chocolate and doughnuts as bait, officials said. Andrew Timmins, wildlife biologist for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, and his team presented their findings to the state's fish and game commission on Wednesday. It's an awful way to die, Timmins said. Too much theobromine in a bear's system can cause severe illness, inducing vomiting, hypothermia, seizures, coma, respiratory and heart failure. Chocolate is popular among commercial bear hunting guides because it's inexpensive and easy to get, Timmins said. But, given the recent deaths, the practice should end, he says. No recommendations have been finalized, but Timmins says the most effective way to prevent these deaths would be to remove chocolate from the woods. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department does not have rules regarding what foods are best to use as baiting material, but Timmins says with the new toxicology report on the black bears deaths, the department may look into such regulations. The death of these four bears is the largest number of documented black bear deaths related to chocolate consumption that Timmins is aware of, he said in an interview with CNN. The only other known case was in Michigan in 2010, when a black bear cub died after eating chocolate. ""Not all animals that eat chocolate will automatically die, but it is clearly evident that wild animals can consume enough chocolate to reach a lethal dose,"" Timmins said. Although trapping bears is not allowed in New Hampshire, hunters are allowed to bait them. Hunters will attract bears to a location by using bait and then take a bear with a firearm or a bow, according to Timmins. The problem arises when hunters use the chocolate to lure these animals. ""We have no way to control how much chocolate a bear will consume at a bait site."" Similar to dogs, the lethalness of chocolate depends on the amount it ingests to reach toxic levels. Bear baiting is a hotly contested topic, but Timmins says it is an important tool to help maintain the bear population in New Hampshire, which has seen a rise in the past 20 years. ""We don't want to allow a bear population where people start to lose appreciation for them and they are seen as pests. That is what happened with deer. We want bears to be seen in a positive light,"" he said. Bear hunting season runs from September through mid-November and includes a four-week baiting season in September. Like deer or moose, bears are hunted for their meat. There are an estimated 5,700 black bears in New Hampshire, an optimal level for the state, officials said.

"(CNN)The world is closer to doomsday. That's the message from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which moved its iconic Doomsday Clock up two minutes on Thursday. The clock now stands at three minutes to midnight, the ""latest"" it's been since 1984, when the Cold War between the U.S. and Soviet Union was a major issue. ""Today, unchecked climate change and a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity.

"(CNN)The measles outbreak in California is growing. The number of cases has increased to 68, with 48 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, state health officials reported Friday. Two days ago, the health department reported 59 cases, 42 with a Disney connection. In addition, nine cases have been reported in Arizona, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Mexico. A new case was reported in Nevada, but the Southern Nevada Health District said it's unknown whether that case is Disney-related. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park December 15-20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended  that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. He made the same recommendation for other places where large numbers of people congregate, such as airports and shopping malls. However, Chavez said Disneyland would be ""perfectly safe"" if you've been immunized. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak . When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, ""We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated.""

"Hong Kong (CNN)In a modern twist of public square shaming, a Chinese court has blazoned the names and offenses of 50 individuals and four companies that have dodged paying fines. Their photos and personal details have been splashed across a giant electronic screen outside a major train station in Changsha city in China's southern province, Hunan. Curious onlookers and commuters gathered outside the bustling train station as a series of individual headshots, identity numbers, their offenses and amounts of outstanding court fines rolled across a massive electronic billboard, one after the other, as shown on Chinese state television. Instead of flashing ads, it serves as a public ""wall of shame"" for those that failed to pay court-ordered fines for violating property disclosure laws, disobeying court orders or failing to respond to subpoenas. The amount of outstanding fines range from 10,000 yuan ($1,600) up to 29 million yuan ($4.5 million). Wang Lifu, a court official, told Hunan city's largest newspaper, Xiaoxiang Morning Post on Wednesday, that it was part of a campaign in the new year to beef up policy implementation measures. Wang added that it was doing a ""public service"" by exposing the details. According to Chinese Supreme Court regulations, it is legal for local courts to publish private information of people or organizations who have disobeyed court orders. The advertising agency that manages the billboard confirmed with CNN that the court has authorized them to publish personal details of the individuals and companies for two weeks until they pay off their debts. ""As of today, we have taken down information of one company and two individuals because they have settled their debts with the courts,"" said Chen Kai, general manager of Changsha Gaoxun Advertising Company. He added that they did not charge the courts for any advertising fees in support of the court's decision to force debtors to pay. For now, the public also seems to support the court's pressurizing tactics. ""Now those people who are dishonest have nowhere to hide, and dare not do it again,"" Zhou Ya, a man standing outside the railway station told Hunan TV, a local channel. ""The court has played hardball by exposing these cheaters, well done!"" one passerby told local media.

"(CNN)Virginia authorities on Friday said they have found no link between Jesse Matthew, suspected of killing college student Hannah Graham, and the abduction and slaying of a teenage girl in 2013. Matthew's arrest in October in the Graham case prompted authorities to investigate his possible links to a string of unsolved killings and disappearances in the area. One of those cases involved 17-year-old Alexis Murphy of Lovingston, Virginia, who disappeared in 2013 and whose body has not been found. Another man, Randy Taylor, was convicted of Murphy's abduction and murder, but after Matthew's arrest, Taylor's attorney asked that evidence in the case be re-examined to check for any links to Matthew. Friday, the top prosecutor in Nelson County, which includes Lovingston, said fresh DNA testing conducted by the FBI after the attorney's request excluded Matthew from evidence collected in the Murphy case. ""Law enforcement affirms its earlier conclusion that there is no credible evidence linking Jesse Matthew to the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy,"" Commonwealth's Attorney Anthony Martin said. Matthew is charged with abducting and killing Graham, a University of Virginia sophomore whose body was found in October, a month after she vanished after a night out near campus. He is also charged in the sexual assault of a woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005; the trial in that case is scheduled for March. Authorities said that in September 2005, a 26-year-old woman returning from a grocery store was grabbed from behind and sexually assaulted. The attacker was scared off by a passerby. Information from the 2005 victim led police to link Matthew to the case of another missing young woman, Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in October 2009 and was found dead a few months later. Matthew has not been charged in that case. Investigators are looking into his possible connection to other similar cases in the area. They include the August 2009 killing of Virginia Tech students Heidi Childs and David Metzler and the October 2009 killing of 23-year-old Cassandra Morton of Lynchburg, Virginia. Police are also investigating Matthew's possible ties to the disappearance of 19-year-old Samantha Ann Clarke of Orange, Virginia.","Jesse Matthew is suspected of killing UVA student Hannah Graham last year .

"(CNN)They say it is the sport of kings, and a king's ransom has been paid for a single horse at auction house Tattersalls. On Tuesday, Sheikh Fahad Al Thani from the Royal Family of Qatar shelled out 4.5 million guineas ($7.3m) for Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Just the Judge, making her the highest-priced filly in training in British auction history. On what was the second day of Tattersalls' December sale, nearly $50m exchanged hands in a litany of purchases. Somewhat bizarrely, Sheikh Fahad already had part ownership of the filly, but was buying out the Sangsters -- a family with a rich history in racehorse ownership and breeding -- in partnership with new co-owners the China Horse Club. It was the first time a Classic-winning filly had been up for sale at Tattersalls for more than two decades. The bidding war at the notorious auction house in Newmarket, England, had opened at 500,000 guineas, before Sheik Fahad battled it out successfully with James Delahooke and Barry Weisbord. However, the monstrous price tag fell just shy of the 5m guineas ($8.2m) paid last year by Sheikh Joaan Al Thani -- also from Qatar -- for an unraced, untrained and untested filly bred from Galileo. The purchase means Just the Judge will remain in Qatar Racing silks next season and continue her partnership with trainer Charlie Hills. Bloodstock agent David Redvers, who acts on behalf of Sheikh Fahad, told Tattersalls: ""This is a new one-off tie-up with the China Horse Club. ""This has allowed us to race another year with her and keep her. As she was our first Classic winner, we were not going to give her up easily. ""We will campaign in the best races, get the best possible opportunities, and then she will retire to Tweenhills and visit the best stallions in the world.""","Sheikh Fahad Al Thani buys Just the Judge for 4.5 million guineas .

"(CNN)The late Saudi monarch King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud assumed the throne in 2005, but had effectively been running the kingdom since his half-brother King Fahd's stroke a decade earlier. His two decades at the helm of one of the West's key strategic allies in the Muslim world left an indelible, if ambiguous, legacy. Here are the five most notable characteristics of his reign. Hopes were high that Abdullah's reputation as a modernizing reformer would translate into gains for women in the ultraconservative kingdom. But in the face of deep-seated cultural opposition to change, the progress was less than expected, said CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson. ""He promised a lot of reforms but ... he was limited by the conservative nature of Saudi society."" Abdullah was the first Saudi monarch to appoint women to government positions. In 2013, he appointed 30 women to the 150-member Shura Council, the top consultative body that plays an advisory role within Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy. This year, women will be able to vote and run as candidates in municipal elections for the first time, and women have been elected to boards of chambers of commerce. But many other restrictions on Saudi women remain: Women cannot marry, leave the country, go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian, usually their father or husband. Saudi Arabia remains the only country where women are not allowed to drive, despite petitions and civil disobedience campaigns by activists in recent years. In November, the Shura Council recommended that the ban be lifted, with restrictions, but the recommendation has not been acted on, and those who defy the ban continue to be prosecuted. Robert W. Jordan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia form 2001 to 2003, said he had frequent conversations with Abdullah about human rights, including the rights of women in the kingdom. ""He said, 'Don't push us to breaking point',"" Jordan told CNN. ""It's a halting kind of process of reform, one that requires this kind of juggling."" Ali al-Ahmed, a former Saudi political prisoner and the director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, said Abdullah's reputation as a reformer in some quarters was unwarranted. The kingdom has been under international scrutiny in recent weeks for carrying out harsh punishments, including executions and floggings. ""Reforms in Saudi Arabia do not exist. This is an absolute monarchy, let's be honest,"" he said. READ MORE: Saudi Arabia's 'reformer' King Abdullah dies . The September 11, 2001 attacks on Saudi Arabia's key ally -- in which 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudi -- were an inflection point for the kingdom. Abdullah lobbied for the removal of U.S. troops who had been stationed in the country since 1990 --- a prime grievance for the September 11 attackers -- then set about bolstering its military with a $150 billion spend. Attacks on residential compounds housing many Westerners -- in which dozens were killed -- led to a harsh crackdown on terrorist elements within the kingdom seeking to topple the House of Saud. Leaders were captured, followers driven underground and radical preachers sidelined, said Robertson. Saudi Arabia has taken a lead role in the U.S.-led international coalition fighting the radical Sunni terror group ISIS -- which now rivals Al Qaeda as the world's most prolific jihadist group -- in Syria and Iraq. But questions remain about the links between Saudi Arabia and Islamist terror. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in October, billionaire Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal acknowledged that ""unfortunately some extremists in Saudi Arabia ... did fund certain extremist elements in Syria,"" but insisted that the support had been stopped. Others argue that Wahhabism, the puritan form of Sunni Islam that is the kingdom's official religion, promoted throughout the Muslim world, provides the ideological breeding ground for such groups. Saudi Arabia now faces a threat from ISIS on its on border. Earlier this month, ISIS allegedly attacked a Saudi border patrol near Arar. The kingdom is building a massive fence along its border with Iraq in order to keep the militants out, said Robertson. READ MORE: Amid turmoil, King Abdullah brought stability, pushed reforms . One of Abdullah's greatest legacies has been his focus on modernizing the Saudi education system, said Mark Weston, author of ""Prophets and Princes: Saudi Arabia from Muhammad to the Present."" Following a failed attempt in 1979 by extremist insurgents to capture Mecca's Grand Mosque and topple the Saudi leadership, the kingdom responded by becoming even more conservative, said Robertson. This renewed puritanism was reflected in the education system for two decades, until Abdullah began an ambitious program of modernization, despite opposition from religious conservatives. The centerpiece is the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, which has sent hundreds of thousands of young Saudis abroad to study at the government's expense. The aim is to develop a workforce of Saudi nationals capable of replacing expatriate workers in higher-skilled jobs in the kingdom, but also to bring a more modern, international outlook to the kingdom. ""Giving these scholarships recognizes that the road of modernizing Saudi Arabia comes from education,"" said Robertson. At home, the country's first coeducational campus, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, was founded amid some objections in 2009. In expressing his condolences, U.S. President Barack Obama credited Abdullah for his commitment to the education of his country. READ MORE: Who is Saudi Arabia's new King Salman? While Abdullah's legacy as a social reformer is up for debate, his achievements at economic reform are more clear-cut, say observers. Besides his educational reform, the late king's other lasting achievement was joining the World Trade Organization in 2005, integrating his country into the global economy, said Weston. Abdullah opened his country up for foreign direct investment and committed huge sums of the country's oil wealth on infrastructure and mega-projects such as the $86 billion King Abdullah Economic City, announced in 2005. The reforms reflected Abdullah's recognition of the need to diversify the country's economy ahead of the inevitable day the oil money ran out, said Robertson. READ MORE: Thousands to farewell King Abdullah . Saudi Arabia also lifted its international profile under Abdullah's rule, with the late king taking a strong role in regional and world affairs. Obama, in expressing his condolences, praised the monarch for his ""bold steps"" in advancing Middle East peace initiatives, and for greater outreach to the international community. During his reign, Saudi Arabia became the only Arab nation with a seat at the G20, and the first Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, as the Saudi monarchs are known, to meet the Pope. Abdullah espoused a message of religious tolerance, despite the strictures of Saudi Wahhabism, said Robertson. CNN's Nic Robertson, Becky Anderson and Christiane Amanpour contributed to this report.","King Abdullah had a reputation as a reformer, but his record disappointed some .

"(CNN)During the 2004 presidential election, I spent time near Canton, Ohio, trying to turn out votes for John Kerry.  I visited neighborhoods around the struggling Rust Belt town, knocking on doors and repeating a campaign-prepared script about Senator Kerry's plans to put the middle class back on track. The voters scoffed at me, surveying their decaying porches with the decaying economy all around them. They blamed trade deals, especially the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for the loss of good manufacturing jobs in the area, and laws giving steel and auto plants the chance to move jobs overseas. One after another, each voter reminded me that both parties supported the crappy NAFTA deal that got us into this mess. How could we trust any of them to get us out? A decade later, just after the 20th anniversary of NAFTA, President Obama is marking the disastrous legacy of free trade policies by working with Republicans to push for even more bad trade deals that would benefit big businesses at the expense of America's economy and workers. President Obama has outlined an ambitious agenda to help the middle class. But his eagerness to find some area of compromise with Republicans in the form of trade policy risks undermining all his other plans. ""I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but fair,"" President Obama said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night as Republicans stood and applauded while Democrats rightly stayed in their seats. Trade promotion authority is a new synonym for ""fast-track authority"" which would give the president authority to negotiate international trade agreements on his own.  Congress could veto such deals, but could not amend or filibuster them.  Fast-track trade authority removes important checks and balances not only in our legislative process but in our economy as a whole. This is a bad idea for two reasons. In recent history, trade deals enacted by Washington have been bad for American workers and our economy.  President Obama and Republicans promote trade deals as good for economic growth and job creation.  ""Ninety-five percent of the world's customers live outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those opportunities,"" President Obama said. However, government data analyzed by the nonprofit Public Citizen shows that under two decades of fast-track trade agreements, U.S. trade deficits have gotten worse -- increasing by over 440%. Nearly 5 million U.S. jobs -- 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs in America -- have been lost since fast-track deals like NAFTA and related agreements. While President Obama has emphasized that he wants to reduce income inequality, numerous studies say such trade deals have contributed to the rise in income inequality.  In fact, wages in the United States have remained mostly stagnant, adjusted for inflation, since the mid-1970s — when fast-track trade authority was first enacted -- even though worker productivity has doubled in the same period. All of this suggests we need more scrutiny on these trade deals, not less. Given the evidence of the destruction of previous trade deals, we need giant caution signs, speed bumps and roadblocks -- not a fast track. The other problem with fast-track trade authority is that it allows our trade negotiators to unilaterally undermine democratically passed legislation.  For instance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation deal championed by both President Obama and top Republicans in Congress, is not really about trade. Of the partnership's 29 chapters, only five address trade issues. The other chapters do things like create new monopoly patent extensions for pharmaceutical companies that would raise medicine prices for average Americans, and create a right for foreign firms to import food to the U.S. exempt from our current food safety standards. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would even restrict certain ""buy local"" and ""buy American"" initiatives -- in other words, preventing American consumers from protesting the trade deal with their own votes and wallets. I should add that this is what watchdogs think is in the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal -- because of document leaks. We don't know for sure, because while 600 private corporations have been involved in negotiating the terms of the trade deal behind closed doors, even Congress won't get to see the terms of the deal until after it's signed. That's why many Democrats oppose the deal, and similarly disastrous trade deals like it. If more crummy job-killing trade bills are what comes from bipartisanship, I would rather take more bitter acrimony.","American workers blame trade deals like NAFTA for the loss of good manufacturing jobs .

"(CNN)Deflategate is not just a bunch of hot air, the NFL said Friday. The league said the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots used footballs that didn't meet league specifications in the first half of the AFC championship game last Sunday. ""While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under-inflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated,"" the NFL's statement said. The statement said the NFL wants to know ""specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action. We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence."" Forty interviews have been conducted, the NFL said, but it didn't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback Tom Brady or coach Bill Belichick. Brady, the central figure in the controversy, said Thursday that nobody from the NFL had talked to him. He and the coach said they don't know how the balls became under-inflated. Internet reacts to Brady's press conference . Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft said the NFL spent three days talking to Patriots employees, but he didn't specify whether Brady or Belichick were interviewed. ""During the three days they were here, we provided access to every full- and part-time employee the league's representatives requested to speak with and produced every communication device that they requested to search,"" Kraft said in a statement, his first about the the flap dubbed Deflategate. What the heck is Deflategate? Eleven of the 12 game balls the Patriots provided were under-inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each, ESPN reported. Regulation pressure is 12.5-13.5 psi. A ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage. NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Pash and Ted Wells of the law firm Paul, Weiss are leading the investigation, the statement said, and Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm, has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. The investigation started ""promptly on Sunday night,"" the statement said, "" and so far has included 40 interviews with ""Patriots personnel, game officials, and third parties with relevant information and expertise."" The inquiry started after Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson intercepted a Brady pass in the first half. The Patriots beat the Colts 45-7. According to Newsday, he took the ball to his team's equipment staff, which then informed head coach Chuck Pagano, who told general manager Ryan Grigson, who told NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who told the officials on the field. However, on Thursday at Pro Bowl practice, Jackson said he didn't say he thought the ball was flat. ""I made a great play on a great player, and I wanted to keep it as a souvenir,"" Jackson said in an interview with CNN affiliate KNXV. ""So I handed it off. ""The next thing I know I'm in the middle of Deflategate, so I don't know how that happened, and I was just doing my job, and I seem to be in the middle of everything. But I've got a ton of respect for that organization, New England. They outright beat us hands down and that's pretty much all I can say about it.""

"(CNN)Australia has again appealed to Indonesia's new president to spare two of its citizens who face execution by firing squad. The appeal came after President Joko Widodo rejected a plea for clemency from 31-year-old Andrew Chan, the ringleader of a failed bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin to Australia in 2005. Widodo had already turned down an appeal for clemency from Myuran Sukumaran, Chan's collaborator in the scheme, which included seven other people who are serving lengthy prison sentences. Together they are known as the ""Bali 9."" ""While Australia respects Indonesia's sovereignty, we are asking that Indonesia reconsider its decision to execute two Australian citizens,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in statement. ""Both men are reformed characters and both have helped to rehabilitate other prisoners. The prerogative of mercy should be extended to them."" For the last 10 years, the pair has fought a lengthy legal battle, first to avoid conviction against charges and later to reduce the severity of their sentences. The Bali 9 were arrested in April 2005 after Indonesian police received a tip-off from Australian Federal Police. They caught four at the Denpasar airport with more than eight kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. During their 10 years of imprisonment, supporters say Chan and Sukumaran have changed their ways and are now working within the prison to help other inmates. Lawyers had hoped their rehabilitation would count in their favor, but their failed clemency bids have reinforced efforts to pursue other legal avenues. Chan's lawyers are said to be seeking to reopen the case, a controversial move that faces legal resistance from Indonesia's Supreme Court, according to Indonesia law expert Tim Lindsey. Currently, the Constitutional Court allows an unlimited number of applications to reopen a case -- the Supreme Court does not. ""There's a dispute between the two courts at the moment. There've been attempts to bring them together to work out a resolution. It hasn't been successful. So as it stands, the Constitutional Court says this application is acceptable and the Supreme Court says it's not,"" Lindsey told the ABC. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. Last week, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had ""severely affected"" relations with Indonesia. Australia's Abbott says in the best interests of Chan and Sukumaran, the government will make no further public comments but its ""support will continue.""","Indonesian leader rejects plea for clemency for Andrew Chan .

"New Delhi (CNN)A court in India's troubled northeastern region has freed a female activist who has been on hunger strike for 14 years in protest against special powers given to the military to combat rebels, her lawyer said Friday. Irom Sharmila, 42, started her hunger strike in 2000 after 10 civilians were killed in a shooting blamed on the army in Manipur state. Sharmila -- also known as the ""Iron lady of Manipur"" -- has demanded the repeal of India's Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) because it gives sweeping powers to the military to search properties, detain suspects without warrants and shoot on sight. Since 2000, Sharmila has been arrested 14 times for trying to kill herself, prompting authorities to force feed her under a law that makes attempted suicide illegal, her counsel Khaidem Mani told CNN. But Mani challenged the attempted suicide charge, citing the country's history of hunger strikes. Mahatma Gandhi used the same mode of protest during the nation's independence struggle, he told the sessions court in Imphal East, a district of Manipur. ""I also argued that a hunger strike was no crime,"" he said. The magistrate ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove she was attempting to commit suicide. In doing so, he overturned a lower court's attempt to put her on trial for attempted suicide. After the court ordered her release, Sharmila resumed her hunger strike, her lawyer added. Last year, India's Vice President Hamid Ansari admitted there had been ""serious complaints of misuse of the AFSPA."" ""This reflects poorly on the state and its agents,"" a statement from his office said. Meantime, Amnesty International called Sharmila's arrests ""farcical,"" saying she should not be taken into custody again. ""The judgment must end the farcical cycle of arrest and re-arrest that this brave activist has faced for so long. Authorities must not detain Irom Sharmila again but engage with the issues she is raising,"" said Shemeer Babu, the rights group's program director in India. Activists and non-profit organizations have repeatedly urged the Indian government to scrap the AFSPA. In 2005, a government-appointed committee recommended the law be abolished. Its recommendations remain under the government's ""consideration,"" India's Deputy Home Minister Kiren Rijiju told the national parliament last month. Manipur is an impoverished, landlocked state in India's remote northeastern belt. For years, many Manipuri tribal communities have resisted the authority of Delhi, claiming that they have suffered neglect from the central government. This disaffection has given rise to occasional outbreaks of violence.","Irom Sharmila, 42, started her hunger strike in 2000 .

"(CNN)When packing your carry-on luggage, don't forget to remove your gun. Unless you've got permission, not remembering could get you in trouble. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration seized a record 2,212 firearms from carry-on luggage in 2014, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Friday. That's more than the TSA has seized in any other year of its existence, and it's a 22% increase from the 1,813 guns seized in 2013. (The agency actually hit a record 2,000 seizures on December 1, before the year was over.) That's an average of six guns per day. Of those discovered, 83% were loaded. The department's employees ""stand on the front lines protecting our nation from dangerous contraband and people, while ensuring the free flow of lawful trade and commerce -- just two aspects of our mission,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a news release. ""This is critically important work, and our employees' achievements are self-evident: in 2014, the TSA screened more than 650 million passengers, nearly 1.8 million each and every day,"" Johnson said. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security seized the most guns last year, with 120. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport came in second place with 109 gun seizures, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport came in third place with 78 gun seizures. Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport had 77 gun seizures, while  Denver International Airport had 70. Forgetting can be expensive and even criminal. Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges, and the TSA can impose civil penalties. Members of TSA Pre-check can be temporarily or permanently banned from the expedited screening program. While the TSA's gun seizures hit a record high last year, the agency screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry-on bags. ""It is a reminder that passengers should check their personal belongings before arriving at the TSA checkpoint to ensure they do not have any prohibited items in their possession,"" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein said. The 1,813 guns seized by the TSA in 2013 was up from 1,556 seizures in 2012 and 1,320 in 2011. The agency seized 1,123 guns in 2010, 976 guns in 2009, 926 guns in 2008, 803 guns in 2007 and 821 guns in 2006. People who want to take their guns to their destinations shouldn't simply pack them. The TSA's website, www.tsa.gov, lists agency rules to follow for checking firearms and other weapons. The agency doesn't list state and local weapons laws, which vary by jurisdiction. Fake guns aren't OK, either. The TSA also found more than 1,400 firearm components, replica firearms, stun guns and other ""dangerous objects"" in carry-on luggage. Don't bring firearm replicas through passenger screening. Check them or ship them ahead of time.

"(CNN)Thousands gathered in Riyadh on Friday to say farewell to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud, a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom, but fell short in gaining greater independence for women. Abdullah died early Friday, several weeks after the state-run Saudi Press Agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to a hospital. The royal court didn't release an exact cause of death. He was 90. To ensure a smooth transition, the kingdom quickly appointed his 79-year-old half-brother, Salman bin Abdulaziz, to the throne. His half-brother Prince Muqrin, a decade younger, is the new crown prince. Who is Salman bin Abdulaziz? After Friday afternoon prayers at Riyadh's Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque, the body of Abdullah, wrapped in a pale shroud, was carried from the mosque toward a cemetery, followed by a solemn procession of Saudi men in traditional dress. He was later laid to rest after a simple, swift ceremony. Those present at the graveside -- the royals closest to the late king -- were then to move on to a royal palace, where they were to pay their respects to the new monarch. The ceremony of ""al Bayaah,"" or pledging of allegiance to the new king, followed the funeral. Condolences and remembrances poured in from all corners of the globe. ""To God we belong and indeed to him we shall return,"" said the homepage of the English-language Saudi newspaper Arab News. Bahrain, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, among others, declared days of mourning. The U.N. secretary-general praised Abdullah for his Arab Peace Initiative to end the Arab-Israeli conflict. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said he would lead a delegation ""in the coming days"" to pay respects. ""King Abdullah's life spanned from before the birth of modern Saudi Arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among Arab and Islamic nations,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. Speaking to CNN's Richard Quest in Davos, Switzerland, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with Saudi Arabia. ""I don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had, no,"" he said. In an address to the nation -- his first televised appearance since becoming king -- Salman offered his condolences to the Saudi people. ""We will, with God's will and power, adhere to the straight path this country followed since its establishment by King Abdulaziz and his sons after him, and will not deviate at all from it, since our constitution is the book of Allah (Quran) and the teachings of Prophet Mohammed,"" he said. He also spoke of the ""desperate need"" for unity and solidarity among the followers of Islam, saying Saudi Arabia would continue to promote that. He had already issued six royal decrees Friday, the Saudi Press Agency reported, including appointing Prince Mohammed bin Naif bin Abdulaziz as the deputy crown prince. Salman, who has 1.33 million followers on Twitter but follows no one, changed his Twitter handle  to @KingSalman. Abdullah became king of the oil-rich nation, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, in August 2005. But he had been running Saudi Arabia since 1996, after half-brother King Fahd's stroke. In the context of the kingdom's conservative circles, Abdullah was seen as a reformer and often came up against more hardline clerics. After ascending to the throne, Abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country's vast oil wealth in large-scale education and infrastructure projects. ""He was really quite (an) extraordinary figure. He was probably the most progressive and liberal-minded king of Saudi Arabia since King Faisal, which is a long time ago, in the early 1970s,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said about Abdullah, whom he described as ""much loved."" ""I had the opportunity to meet with him once, and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward,"" Zakaria said. ""It's a conservative country and a conservative society -- and he kept emphasizing that to me -- but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go."" However, resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts, leaving many women, in particular, disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence. King Abdullah's legacy: 5 things to know . Under Abdullah's leadership, the country slowly squashed al Qaeda, capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom, forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers. It also took a more prominent role in international affairs. Last year, it became the lead Arab nation in a U.S.-led coalition to eradicate the ultraradical ISIS group in Iraq and Syria. Analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing Saudi Arabia, including Iran, the rise of ISIS, the crisis in Yemen and the drop in oil prices. Saudi Arabia has 16% of the world's known oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The country is widely seen as the leader of OPEC and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the Middle East. ""Remember, the last time the price of oil fell like this, the Soviet Union collapsed,"" said Zakaria. ""That said, the successor is a very competent man."" He added: ""I don't expect any major shift, but it marks a big change, and we'll have to see what the new king is like."" People we've lost in 2015 . CNN's Dana Ford, Salma Abdelaziz and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","King Abdullah has been buried in Riyadh .

"(CNN)The measles outbreak in California is growing. The number of cases has increased to 68, with 48 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, state health officials reported Friday. Two days ago, the health department reported 59 cases, 42 with a Disney connection. In addition, nine cases have been reported in Arizona, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Mexico. A new case was reported in Nevada, but the Southern Nevada Health District said it's unknown whether that case is Disney-related. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park December 15-20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended last Wednesday that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. However, Chavez said Disneyland would be ""perfectly safe"" if you've been immunized. When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, ""We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated."" For the most part, measles spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus. The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases with 21, followed by San Diego County with 13.","Number of measles cases in California has grown to 68, public health officials say .

"Jerusalem (CNN)President Barack Obama and U.S. officials were completely blindsided by the announcement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will come to Washington to address a joint session of Congress this spring -- a move that's rattled the White House and diplomatic officials. The announcement from House Speaker John Boehner's office this week came after several high-level interactions between U.S. and Israeli officials, including a phone call between Obama and Netanyahu and a multi-hour meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, a senior administration official told CNN. Netanyahu's snub has once again soured relations between the two world leaders, but U.S. officials insist the tensions won't affect U.S. support for Israel. The Boehner announcement came just over a week after Obama spoke over the phone with Netanyahu and urged him not to lobby in favor of new Iran sanctions, ""asking for some space,"" a senior administration official said. But the hawkish Israeli Prime Minister has a track record of supporting tougher sanctions against Iran and he's expected to make that case when he addresses Congress in March. Obama and other world leaders negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from Congress, which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations. ""We asked the Israelis in private and public to sit tight and the President made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions,"" the official said. That's what makes Netanyahu's decision to address Congress a ""pretty big deal,"" the official added. And just a day before Boehner's announcement, Kerry met for several hours with Dermer, who reportedly coordinated the visit between Republican congressional leadership and Netanyahu. But, still, there was no word of a Netanyahu visit to Washington. ""Is this a smart way for them to manage the relationship?"" a source close to Kerry said. ""The bilateral relationship is unshakable, but playing politics with that relationship could blunt Secretary Kerry's enthusiasm for being Israel's primary defender."" While U.S. and Israeli officials insist publicly that the relationship has ""never been stronger"" -- and by most measures it remains very strong -- Netanyahu's address to Congress is just the latest in a string of diplomatic debacles that each time have sunk relations between the two leaders and their staff to new lows. Netanyahu's continued expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem has angered U.S. officials, prompting one senior White House official to call Netanyhau a ""chickenshit"" in an October article in The Atlantic that brought private tensions to light. Obama's phone call with Netanyahu and Kerry's meeting with Dermer just before the announcement give the snub a more personal veneer. Kerry had made more than 50 calls in the preceding month to world leaders on the hot topics of Israeli-Palestinian relations, such as Palestinian attempts to gain statehood through international organizations, the source said, adding that Kerry's ""patience is not infinite."" The in-your-face move from Netanyahu's camp comes at a time when Israel needs American support on the international stage, with Palestinians making a full-court press to obtain statehood unilaterally through international institutions. Another senior U.S. official said the Israeli breach of protocol and diplomatic courtesy takes a toll on U.S. officials working strenuously to support Israel on the international stage. ""They come to us with a lot of requests, but don't have the courtesy of telling us? That is what tipped it for us,"" the official said. But again, the ""core aspects of the relationship and commitment remain intact,"" the official said. The snub may not sway the U.S.'s broad commitment to Israel's security and to supporting Israel in the international arena, but Netanyahu will feel the repercussions when he comes to Washington in March without a ticket to the White House. The White House announced that Obama won't meet with Netanyahu during his visit because of the proximity to Israeli elections. Netanyahu will address Congress just 12 days before the elections. He had asked to push back his visit by nearly a month. U.S. officials aren't the only ones taken aback. Former Israeli President Shimon Peres, while refusing to directly criticize Netanyahu, conceded ""there are rules and norms (about) how two countries have to behave."" ""In that case, I think the rules created differences, and all of us have to look -- including our prime minister -- to go back to the basic rules and respect,"" Peres said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday. It would come as no surprise that Netanyahu's opponents in the election are harsher. His former finance minister and current competitor in the March election, Yair Lapid, said Saturday that Netanyahu ""is destroying our strategic relations with the United States for an election speech."" Yet ahead of the elections, Netanyahu's visit may be a boon for him and his party in Israel as he plays himself up as the best protector of Israel's security, of which a relationship with the United States is a key factor. ""Is that the relationship they want to have?"" the senior administration official said. ""The last thing we want to do is hurt Israel, but if he is able to stiff the U.S. President like that and we still offer him a meeting -- that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over."" CNN's Richard Quest contributed to this report.","Administration unhappy with Netanyahu's plans to address Congress .

"(CNN)A man who spent more than half his life in a North Carolina prison for two murders he didn't commit walked out a free man Friday, holding his belongings in two white plastic bags. Joseph Sledge, who was wrongfully convicted in 1978, said he feels wonderful about his freedom.  He is now 70-years old. Sledge was exonerated by a three-judge panel who reviewed post-conviction DNA evidence from the victims. The panel said that evidence excluded Sledge as a suspect.  A witness who testified that Sledge had admitted to the murders recanted his testimony in 2013. Josephine Davis and her daughter Aileen Davis were discovered in September 1976 inside their home in Elizabethtown, North Carolina.  The women had been beaten and stabbed multiple times; Aileen Davis had been sexually assaulted. Man freed by DNA evidence after 20 years dies a year later . The day before the women's bodies were found, Sledge had escaped from White Lake Prison Camp, approximately 4 miles from the victims' home. He had been serving a four-year sentence for larceny. Sledge was picked up after he was spotted in Dillon, South Carolina, driving a stolen car, arrested and brought back to North Carolina, where he was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the Davises. At trial, the state presented forensic evidence linking Sledge to the crime.  Two inmates also testified against Sledge, saying he had admitted to the crimes behind bars. He was convicted and sentence to life in prison. DNA frees North Carolina's longest-serving death row resident . During the more than three decades Sledge was in prison, he maintained his innocence, filing numerous post-conviction motions on various grounds. All were denied without hearing. In 2003, however, his request for new DNA testing was granted; testing began five years later. The North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission took on investigating Sledge's case. It in December found ""sufficient evidence of factual innocence to merit judicial review."" Speaking to reporters outside the Columbus County jail, Sledge said, ""When you're conscious of something you didn't do, you can live with yourself.  It's between you and your maker."" The family of Josephine and Aileen Davis expressed their disapproval with the panel's decision. Catherine Brown, Josephine Davis' granddaughter, reading from a prepared statement, said, ""We, the family, are heartbroken by this decision."" Sledge, who was wrongly incarcerated for 37 years, addressed the Davis family directly, saying, ""I'm very, very sorry for your loss.  I hope you get closure in this matter."" The commission, which began operating in 2007, is the first of its kind in the country, and is separate from the appeals process, according to the organization's website.

"(CNN)The first doses of the Ebola vaccine were on a commercial flight to West Africa and were expected to arrive on Friday, according to a spokesperson from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) one of the companies that has created the vaccine with the National Institutes of Health. Another vaccine from Merck and NewLink will also be tested. ""Shipping the vaccine today is a major achievement and shows that we remain on track with the accelerated development of our candidate Ebola vaccine,"" Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chairman of global vaccines at GSK said in a company release. Ebola who is patient zero? In December, the trial of the vaccine made by Merck and NewLink were stopped after some of the volunteers in the trial had ""transient mild"" joint pain. After investigating that side effect, scientists concluded it was not a big enough issue to stop the development of the vaccine. No similar side effects were noted in the GSK trial. There are other Ebola vaccines being tested by companies in the United States and in Russia. This first shipment will be used, along with a placebo in this first large-scale trial in the next few weeks in Liberia. ""We are expecting to start by the last week in January, but there are some details that need to be ironed out regarding the FDA,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at a press conference. Worst Ebola outbreak in history: What you should know . The tests should begin in the Monrovia area and will involve nearly 30,000 people.  People who have had the virus and survived will be excluded from this trial, according to GSK. The first people to get the vaccine will be health care workers who are some of the population that is most at risk for catching Ebola. That's because it can be easily transmitted through exposure to bodily fluids. In Liberia there have been 370 cases of health care workers becoming infected with Ebola, 178 of them have died according to the World Health Organization. The number of newly infected health care workers has declined recently, as has the number of cases in general in Liberia. Hope for Ebola epidemic's end in Liberia . In August and September of 2014 the WHO was seeing 300 new confirmed cases per week, versus the 8 new confirmed cases according to this latest incident report.

Sierra Leone has had the largest number of infections of any country with 10,340 reported cases and 3,145 deaths from Ebola.  The disease has slowed down according to the WHO, but still there were 117 new confirmed cases according to the latest report.

"(CNN) -- Guatemala's former first lady, who divorced the sitting president in order to run herself for the top post, had her candidacy rejected by the country's electoral tribunal Wednesday. The decision is a setback for Sandra Torres, who announced her intention to run for president in March, but had been dogged by critics who called her candidacy illegitimate because of a constitutional article that bars relatives of the president from seeking the high office. To get around this law, Torres split from her husband, President Alvaro Colom.

"(CNN)The fate of two Japanese men whom ISIS kidnapped and threatened to execute was unknown Friday as the 72-hour deadline that the militant group set apparently came and went. On Tuesday, ISIS released a video threatening to kill the two men -- Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa -- unless Japan paid the group $200 million within 72 hours. Based on the time frame, the Japanese government estimated that the ultimatum expired at 2:50 p.m. Friday, Tokyo time (12:50 a.m. ET Friday), and scrambled to secure the men's release. Hours before the estimated deadline, an ISIS spokesman told Japanese broadcaster NHK that the group would release a statement ""soon"" about the hostages. That statement didn't come. When asked whether ISIS has been in negotiations with the Japanese government, the spokesman told NHK he wouldn't comment. ISIS claims the ransom amount is the same as the financial aid pledged by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to countries affected by the militant group. Japanese officials have repeatedly stressed that their military, which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self-defense, isn't involved in the international airstrikes against ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. The Abe pledge is for humanitarian purposes, like helping refugees, not military purposes, Japan says. But ISIS appears unswayed. In his communication with NHK, the ISIS spokesman said the group is aware of what Japan says -- and then he went on to call the Japanese infidels for fighting with the group. Tokyo faces a dire predicament. It says it's doing its best to communicate with ISIS. It wants to secure the hostages' safe release, but it won't yield to threats. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said he was aware of reports that ISIS would soon make a statement. ""We are receiving many different pieces of information, but as a government, we cannot really comment as to whether that information is authentic,"" he said. Caught in the middle are the two men, Goto and Yukawa. As the apparent deadline approached, Goto's mother begged for her son's life. ""To all members of ISIS, Kenji is not the enemy of ISIS. Please release him,"" said the mother, Junko Ishido. ""There is so little time left before the deadline."" ""I have been just crying for the last three days, filled with sadness. Words fail to describe how I feel. Kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little. He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.' "" Leading Japanese news organizations have reported, citing unidentified government sources, that Goto's wife got an email in December from someone demanding $8 million to $16 million for her husband's return. The government is trying to confirm if that email came from ISIS, the reports said. If so, it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $200 million it had publicly demanded. But the question is what, if anything, Japan is willing to give. ISIS has a ruthless track record. It has released videos touting the killing of five Western hostages since August. Abe has called ISIS' ultimatum over the two Japanese men's lives ""unacceptable"" and said the international community shouldn't give in to terrorists. But he and other government officials haven't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom. Should nations just pay ISIS ransom? Some details have emerged about what spurred the two Japanese citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody Syrian conflict. While they had different professions, the two men knew and talked to each other, said Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto. Goto, an experienced freelance journalist, made a video in October near the Turkish-Syrian border before he embarked on a perilous journey into ISIS-controlled territory. ""It is my responsibility if something happens,"" he explained. Goto, 47, said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region. ""Syrian people suffering three years and a half. It's enough,"" he said. ""So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."" Alaaeddin Al Zaim, who had worked with Goto in Syria previously, says he warned him not to enter the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. ""I tell him it's not safe for you,"" Al Zaim told CNN. But Goto chose to go anyway, saying, ""I am not American, I am not British. I'm Japanese. I can go,"" Al Zaim recalled. The aims and activities in Syria of Yukawa, a 42-year-old unemployed widower, are murkier. He originally headed to the war-ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company, said his friend Kimoto. There, Yukawa met Goto, who gave him insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said. He also introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS even though both are fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded. That plea spurred Yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to Japan, according to Kimoto. ""I felt a chill when he said, after returning home, (that) he felt in Syria he was really living a life,"" Kimoto said. ""He seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals."" Yukawa went back to Syria in July, a trip that Kimoto said he didn't know about at the time. Kimoto said he had advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company. Yukawa was reportedly captured in August. Opinion: Why countries should think about paying ransoms .

"(CNN)The Duke of York has said his piece and personally made his position clear. In a much-trailed speech in Davos at a reception at the World Economic Forum the resilient royal ""reiterated and reaffirmed"" the categorical denials made by Buckingham Palace issued on his behalf over accusations that he was repeatedly intimate with an alleged underage ""sex slave."" Andrew, still fifth in line to the British throne and Queen Elizabeth II's second son, carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3 in filed U.S. court papers) -- the woman at the center of the sordid claims. He also did not repeat the specific allegations made against him. For the record those allegations are that Miss Roberts, now 31, was ""trafficked"" to be used as an underage prostitute and was forced to sexually ""service"" the prince -- who she knew as ""Andy"" -- by her wealthy boss financier, and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. She says she was 17-years old at the time of her first encounter with Prince Andrew, which is under the legal age of consent in Florida. She claims in court papers that Andrew's Scotland Yard protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an orgy with the Prince and approximately eight other girls. Five photos were also submitted, including one which Miss Roberts said showed her aged 15, when she says she began working as a ""sex slave""  for Epstein. She insists she is telling the truth and wants Prince Andrew to repeat his denials on oath. In his ""for the record"" speech, Prince Andrew stressed, ""my focus is on my work."" It has prompted some to ask, ""what exactly is it that the Duke of York does and what is the point of him?"" Since his association with convicted sex offender financier Epstein forced the Duke to accept a downgrading of his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011, he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself. He has continued to support business in the UK -- but without a specialized role as before. In recent months many high ranking figures at Buckingham Palace believed was on the right track and making progress in achieving that new role. I have witnessed personally what a good, no-nonsense communicator Andrew is at events he has inspired and hosted. He is particularly passionate when dealing with young start-up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at networking and showcasing events. Andrew is direct and to the point, and his methods seem to work. There is no doubt he is passionate about these issues and before this sex scandal blew up in his face he was making a good fist of it. As he said in his Davos speech -- but went widely unreported as his sound-bite about the sex allegations took all the attention: ""I focus on inspiring young people to develop skills to enable them to become economically active, and encouraging a culture of enterprise and entrepreneurship."" His work focuses on supporting entrepreneurs. Two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the Digital Enterprise Awards -- referred to as ""iDEA"" -- which he is working with the Nominet Trust to deliver. This is about to engage and to inspire young people to get, not only digital skills, but enterprise skills, and to expand their knowledge in the digital universe. So far in year one, about 10,000 young people are engaged in the program. His second big project is Pitch@Palace -- a bid to support start-up businesses. In 2014 the Duke launched Pitch@Palace, and held two competitive pitch events at St James's Palace, worked with 76 entrepreneurs from across the UK. Each event was attended by around 400 invited investors, mentors and supporters. On the day #pitchatpalace was trending 4th in the UK on Twitter. Since then more than 700 connections made between the entrepreneurs and the audience. Some results for the entrepreneurs featured include: financial wellbeing startup Squirrel, which has raised £500k ($756k) , hired four new employees, and received media coverage on CNN and other major media outlets. Andrew argues passionately that entrepreneurs need more than just money; they need business partners, they need mentorship, they need customers and they need network and of course investors. New role . Essentially, his new role is all about assisting the economic success of, and the creation of skilled jobs in, the UK. His efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact: Education and skills, promoting apprenticeships as a desirable path to a career is one of his big issues. He is Patron of the Studio Schools Trust and the Baker Dearing Educational Trust, among others. Last year he visited 9 University Technical Colleges and Studio Schools, as well as 24 other educational projects or institutions, interacting with in excess of 5,000 students and learners. Entrepreneurship is his second core focus -- encouraging entrepreneurship in the UK, supporting current start-ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise. Thirdly, supporting science technology and engineering, promoting expertise in these areas which attract investment into UK and promoting the further translation of science into business. He has also been key in showcasing the work of the UK Technology Industry and Innovators. Last month he hosted the Duke of York Award for Technical Education at St James's Palace to celebrate the achievements of students in University Technical Colleges (UTC's) across the United Kingdom. Question of judgment . There is no doubt this work is all highly commendable. But it is not his work life that is under scrutiny, but his judgment. But if Prince Andrew hopes his unprecedented move to speak out publicly about his private life will draw a line under the scandal he is mistaken. Why? Because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal engulfing him; not least what was the nature of his relationship with Epstein, a man convicted of procuring underage woman for prostitution, why did he visit him AFTER he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3) who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager. This combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the U.S. against Epstein and three women could just keep turning up new embarrassing allegations about the Duke. However, it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the U.S. claims. He has simply been named in court papers. He has not done anything illegal until someone proves he has. To date he has not been charged with anything either. It may be wiser for the media to show a measure of fairness and restraint when reporting allegations that are -- no matter how salacious and good copy -- after all just that, allegations. The only way, perhaps, Andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit.","At Davos, Prince Andrew reiterated Palace denials over accusations of underage sex .

"(CNN)New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick on Thursday said they didn't deflate footballs at Sunday's AFC Championship Game, a controversy that's cast a shadow over their team as it prepares for the Super Bowl. ""I didn't alter the ball in any way,"" Brady said at a press conference. ""I have no knowledge of wrongdoing."" ""I have no explanation,"" Belichick said of the controversy dubbed ""Deflategate."" The NFL is investigating why game balls the Patriots provided for Sunday's AFC Championship Game were underinflated. ESPN, citing NFL sources familiar with the probe, reported that 11 of 12 game balls that the Patriots used on offense were found to be underinflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each. A ball with lower inflation is said by some to be easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage. What the heck is ""Deflategate"" anyway? Brady said he picked the footballs he wanted to use five hours before the game, feeling the laces and the leather but not paying attention to the inflation level. The NFL mandates balls should be 12.5-13.5 psi. ""It's not like I squeeze the football,"" he said. ""I grip the football."" Brady said he didn't touch the balls again until the game began. The referees inspect footballs about two hours before kickoff and deliver them to ""ball attendants"" who take them to the sidelines, according to NFL rules. The Patriots' opponent, the Indianapolis Colts, provided their own footballs. Brady also said he couldn't tell any difference between the balls in the first and second halves. Internet reacts to Brady's press conference . Radio station WEEI in Boston reported that the underinflated balls were discovered in the first half and replaced with properly inflated balls in the second half, when the Patriots expanded their lead over the Indianapolis Colts. The final score was 45-7. Ball inflation may not be a problem at the February 1 Super Bowl game between the Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Michael Signora, the NFL's vice president of football communications, said Chicago Bears equipment manager Tony Medlin will oversee the game balls. Dressed casually in a sweater and a wool hat, Brady seemed amused by the controversy at times during the 30-minute press conference. Brady, 37, is the handsome face of the Patriots, one of the United States' most successful sports franchises. The team has won three Super Bowls, all with Belichick and Brady, and won its division, the AFC East, 12 times in 14 years. His stardom reaches far beyond football fans, since he's married to model Gisele Bundchen and has worked as a model himself. His net worth is $120 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. Though Brady himself has a clean image, suspicions of the Patriots remain because of a 2007 cheating incident -- called ""Spygate"" -- in which the team stole defensive signals from the New York Jets. Belichick was fined $500,000 and the NFL took away a first-round draft pick. Some people are suspicious of Brady. Speaking Thursday morning on CNN affiliate KTCK Sports Radio, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said, ""Its obvious Tom Brady had something to do with this. For the balls to have been deflated, that doesn't happen until the quarterback wants that to happen, I can assure you of that."" Hall of Fame coach John Madden told The Sports Xchange he believed Belichick was clueless about the ball pressure, but ""I can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but I can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy."" Though the NFL announced its investigation on Monday, Brady said nobody from the league has questioned him. Brady said he didn't know anything about Deflategate until a Monday interview with WEEI, in which he said the idea of tampering with footballs is ""ridiculous."" On Thursday, he said, ""I was surprised as anybody when I heard Monday morning what was happening."" When a reporter directly asked Brady whether he was a cheater, the quarterback replied: ""I don't believe so. I've always played within the rules."" He added that he doesn't have all the answers, but doesn't know of anybody in the Patriots organization who might have done something wrong with the ball. ""I don't know what happened over the course of the process with the footballs. I was preparing for my own job, doing what I needed to do,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday,  Belichick said he was ""shocked"" to hear allegations that his team's footballs were underinflated. He said that he's learned more about the football inflation process in three days than he has known or talked about in his 40 years in the league. ""In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player (or) staff member about football air pressure,"" the Patriots coach said at a press conference. ""That is not a subject that I have ever brought up. To me, the footballs are approved by the league ... pregame, and we play with what's out there."" Belichick -- one of the most successful head coaches in NFL history with three Super Bowl rings and 211 regular-season wins -- insisted he had no explanation for how the footballs his team used Sunday might have gotten deflated. But ""in the future,"" Belichick said, New England's game balls will be inflated at high-enough levels -- so closer to 13.5 psi than 12.5 psi, when they may naturally drop to below acceptable levels -- ""to account for any possible change during the game."" His comments come days after Indianapolis reporter Bob Kravitz broke the news after Sunday's game that the NFL was looking into whether the Patriots used underinflated footballs during the AFC championship contest. The underinflation came to light on the field after Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson intercepted a pass thrown by Brady. For all the talk by unnamed sources, the NFL's official statement on the controversy is succinct: ""We are continuing our review and will provide information as soon as possible."" Deflategate is not the NFL's only scandal this year. The league established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence after several players were arrested.

"(CNN)Eleven people were rescued on Thursday after their towing vessel -- carrying 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel -- sank off the coast of Oahu, according to Honolulu Coast Guard. ""Mayday, mayday, mayday."" A radio recording released by the Coast Guard established the moment an officer sent a distress call to the base. ""Approximately two and half miles west of Barbers Point Harbor,"" the officer said, ""vessel appears to have started to sink."" The mayday call came after the pilot of the towing vessel Nalani called the Coast Guard at 3:13 p.m. HST to report their ship was flooding and could sink. Two ships where in the vicinity and heard the distress call: the towing vessel Tiger 7 and a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration patrol boat. Both helped rescue the stranded crew members and as a result no injuries were reported, according to the Coast Guard. The Nalani, a 95-foot towing vessel, carried 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel. The vessel sank in about 2,200 feet of water. ""A flight went up prior to sunset and observed a very light oil sheen approximately three miles long by 100 yards wide,"" said Coast Guard spokesman Darin McCracken. ""There is a very small trace amount of rainbow sheet. Most of it concentrated around the position of the vessel,"" he said. The next assessment flight is scheduled for Friday morning. The cause of the sinking remains under investigation and it is probable the vessel will not be recovered, said McCracken. He said the fuel ""most likely will naturally dissipate"" but the full environmental impact has yet to be determined.","Eleven people were rescued after their vessel sank .

"(CNN)After days of turmoil, Yemen's President, Prime Minister and Cabinet have stood down, leaving the troubled Middle Eastern nation without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's resignation Thursday came after Houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff, seized control of key government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out Wednesday. The chaos in Yemen is cause for concern far beyond the country's borders. For the United States and its allies, Yemen's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo. For the moment, uncertainty rules. Beyond it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as AQAP could exploit. Meda Al Rowas, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated, the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim. ""Our forecast is really civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas,"" she said. Who is in charge right now really depends on where in Yemen you are, she said. The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa. But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa. ""This really creates a situation where even if the Houthis keep control over Sanaa, they have little chance of taking control of the whole country,"" said Al Rowas. ""We expect to see armed resistance."" It's possible that Hadi, himself a southerner, could rescind his resignation and put a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track. But that seems unlikely at present. According to the national news agency SABA, Yemen's Parliament is due to hold an extraordinary session Sunday, called by Parliament Speaker Yahya al-Rai. Analysts suggest that because there's no vice president, the speaker could be next in the line of succession, taking on the role of acting president. He's close to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who clung to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago. Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it's unclear whether the Houthis really want to take charge of the country. The group more likely wanted Hadi to remain in power as a figurehead behind whom they could pull the strings, without having to take on the burdensome business of governance, said Al Rowas. Under Wednesday's failed peace deal, the Hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the Houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the President's kidnapped aide. The government only finally got parliamentary approval in December, said U.S.-based Yemen analyst Sama'a Al-Hamdani. Hadi's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he won't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the Houthi takeover, she said. The Houthis are Shiites from northern Yemen who make up about 30% of the population. They've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the Sunni AQAP. At the beginning of 2014, they won a series of battles close to the Saudi border. And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa, where they took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power. In the past week, they've taken it to another level. Although they have been fighting AQAP, they are no friend to the United States. One of the main slogans of this historically Iranian-backed group is ""Death to America."" The Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former President Saleh, said Al Rowas. This facilitated the Houthis' southward expansion, but the alliance is fragile, she said, not least because Saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the Houthis. Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate AQAP is perhaps the best-known group internationally. It first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2002, but thanks to the efforts of Saudi authorities was a mostly a spent force by 2005, according to analysis from Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism. It re-emerged, reinvigorated, in Yemen in 2009 after the Saudi outfit merged with a Yemeni al Qaeda counterpart. Besides battling the Yemeni government and Houthis, it has been involved in international terror attacks, including the failed 2009 attempt to bring down an airliner over Detroit. The Muslim Brotherhood is also a powerful group in Yemen -- in the shape of the Al Islah Party -- and is well represented in the transitional government. It loathes the Houthis and has its own militias. The fighting in Yemen also provides an opening to ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis. There are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories. While in power, Hadi and the government of Prime Minister Khaled Bahah have been trying to fight AQAP on the ground and also have authorized U.S. drone strikes in the country against terror targets. As part of those efforts, the United States has several hundred American diplomats and military personnel in Yemen. But the U.S. Embassy has been on reduced staffing since September. The Houthis have publicly said they oppose U.S. drone strikes and U.S. involvement in Yemen. There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, according to U.S. officials. Multiple policy options are being considered, the officials said, though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed. ""The safety and security of U.S. personnel is our top priority in Yemen,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""We are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis. We call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community, including our personnel."" Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she didn't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen. ""I think Yemen is safe at the time being,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""The Houthis have been in charge for a while. They have popular committees all over the capital of Sanaa, and they've been running the security show. ""I do, however, want to say that the Americans might need to start talking to the Houthis. And if the Americans are talking to Iran in back channels, they need to do the same with the Houthis."" Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against the Houthis in parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the IHS Country Risk analyst. While Hadi wasn't able to unify the country while in power, she said, since the Houthi takeover of Sanaa, he has become the popular symbol of anti-Houthi sentiment across southern and central Yemen. Many there are calling for his return, she said. A chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central Marib province, she said. There have already been some low-level confrontations, and tribes are mobilizing in the area. Large-scale protests have also been seen in Aden, the main seaport in the country's south, where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement. 7 things to know about Yemen .

"(CNN)King Salman of Saudi Arabia has inherited the throne from his older brother and with it a host of pressing challenges in a turbulent region. To the south, Yemen is in chaos. To the north, the militant group ISIS is wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria. More broadly, Saudi Arabia remains locked in a regional cold war with Iran. Within the kingdom's borders, Salman has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a lid on extremism. The stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the Middle East and a key U.S. ally. ""Saudi Arabia has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing Iranian threat, during the rise of Islamic extremism that followed the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and during the new wave of upheavals that began in the spring of 2011,"" Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a commentary this month. Here are some of the main challenges Salman now faces: . The new king has been plunged straight into the deep end with a fast-developing crisis on Saudi Arabia's southern border. The pro-Saudi government in Yemen has crumbled amid sectarian unrest. The country's president and prime minister resigned Thursday night after a move by Shiite Houthi rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing anxiety, fearful of the prospect of another Shiite-dominated state in the region. ""This will terrify the Saudis, just as the Shia uprising in Bahrain did,"" said CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer. ""Saudi Arabia, all these years, has avoided sending troops into Yemen. It's a quagmire for the Saudis,"" said Baer. ""They've got a reinforced border and they've put a lot of troops down there. But, still, they are panicking."" Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, told CNN on Wednesday that without Saudi support, ""Yemen will become a failed state."" It's not far from that already. The poorest country in the region, Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which U.S. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. The Yemen crisis feeds into a broader issue for Saudi Arabia: the growing influence of Iran in the region. Yemeni officials have frequently accused Iran of providing financial support and weapons to the Houthis in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. ""That makes Saudi Arabia very uncomfortable,"" said CNN global affairs analyst Bobby Ghosh. ""Saudi Arabia, a Sunni majority country, regards Shia-run Iran as a mortal enemy. Both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of chess they're playing across the Arab world."" Tensions have simmered between Tehran and Riyadh at least as far back as Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. The conflict in Syria has been viewed as a proxy conflict between the two, with Iran supporting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and Saudi Arabia helping rebel groups. But the rise of the ISIS extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the Syrian war has complicated the equation. ""There are signs by the Saudis and the Iranians that it is in their interests to de-escalate tensions to confront ISIS,"" said Harith Al-Qarawee, a fellow at Harvard's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. ""But it's impossible to move from hostility to alliance quickly. ""Although the two sides realize that ISIS is a threat to some extent to both of them, they don't think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation,"" he said in November. The bloodthirsty seizure of large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq by ISIS has created a major headache in the region for the Saudis. And the attempts of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to style himself as spiritual leader of Muslims presents a challenge to the Saudi monarchy, which is responsible for Islam's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. ""The Saudis fear it as a potential domestic threat, turning Salafism into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the pro-regime bulwark it has usually been in Saudi Arabia,"" says F. Gregory Gause, III, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar. Saudi Arabia is considered to be a key U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS. One of Salman's sons, Prince Khaled, was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria last year. But Salman also has some responsibility for Saudi Arabia's backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts, according to David Andrew Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""Salman played a significant role in the 1980s and 1990s gathering support in the royal family for mujahedeen holy warriors in places like Afghanistan, places like the Balkans,"" Weinberg told CNN. ""A number of these Afghan and Balkan veterans have in fact come back to Saudi Arabia and sown continued radicalism."" The Saudi government, though, has denied ever providing support to ISIS, which is a splinter group of al Qaeda. Salman's predecessor, King Abdullah, is credited with managing to ride out the ructions of the Arab Spring that swept away other Arab rulers. But with a fast growing population in an unstable region, the royal family has no room for complacency. ""Saudi Arabia has faced, and will face, constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that pushes forward as fast as possible while retaining Saudi popular support, meeting Saudi Arabia's unique religious and cultural needs, and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either regression or revolution,"" said Cordesman. ""As events in other parts of the region since 2011 have shown all too clearly, it is easy to get things terribly wrong and very hard to keep them going right,"" he wrote. While some observers have applauded Abdullah's cautious reforms, others say he moved too slowly. ""If you look at where Saudi Arabia is today, it hasn't actually moved that far from when he assumed the throne in 2005,"" Weinberg told CNN. The monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women, improve the rights of the Shiite minority, modernize the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies, according to Cordesman. With the recent sharp drop in oil prices, officials will have to chart a careful course for the economy. Saudi Arabia depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government. ""Above all, the Saudi government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and futures,"" Cordesman said.","Yemen's pro-Saudi government has crumbled amid sectarian unrest .
Saudi Arabia also faces difficulties in its cold war with Iran and the fight against ISIS ."
"(CNN)To many viewers on the political right, Clint Eastwood's ""American Sniper"" is a patriotic film that celebrates a war hero and doesn't shy away from the truth about the terrorist threat. To some on the left, it glorifies an unjust war while paying homage to an unapologetic killer with a simplistic, good-versus-evil view of the world. Which is closer to the truth? Neither, say the movie's makers. In recent interviews, Eastwood, screenwriter Jason Hall and star Bradley Cooper have said they are dismayed by attempts to ascribe political meanings to what they see as primarily a portrait of real-life Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and the Iraq War's impact on him. The movie ""certainly has nothing to do with any (political) parties or anything,"" Eastwood told the Toronto Star. ""These fellows who are professional soldiers, Navy personnel or what have you, go in for a certain reason ... and there's no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones."" ""For me, and for Clint, this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier ..."" Cooper told the Daily Beast. ""But I can't control how people are gonna use this movie as a tool, or what they pick and choose (to argue)."" No, he can't. Ever since ""American Sniper"" broke box-office records with a stunning $107 million last weekend, everyone seems to have an opinion about it. Pundits, veterans and Internet critics on all sides of the political spectrum have spent the past week poring over the film's 132 minutes, and the memoir by Kyle on which it's based, in search of fodder for political arguments. ""There is nothing even close to moral equivalence in 'American Sniper,' only the truth: that there is no equivalence between the (Iraqi) barbarians who target the innocent and the American heroes who target those who target the innocent,"" wrote John Nolte on Breitbart.com, a right-wing website which calls the movie a ""pro-war-on-terror masterpiece."" ""Eastwood ... makes the moral stakes almost nonexistent,"" countered David Edelstein of New York magazine. ""The people Kyle shoots always represent a ""savage, despicable evil,"" and the physical and mental cost to other Americans just comes with the territory. It's a Republican platform movie."" Many others, from Michael Moore and Seth Rogen (on the left) to Sarah Palin and Kid Rock (on the right), have since piled on. A few people even took to Twitter to say the film made them want to kill Arabs and Muslims. All the controversy is no doubt drawing more people to the movie. But ""American Sniper's"" makers say many of these viewers are missing the point. ""People see the movie poster, and it's got a guy and the American flag, and they know Clint Eastwood — the Dirty Harry guy and the Republican convention guy -- directed it. So they think it's some jingoistic thing,"" screenwriter Hall told Time.com. ""I would challenge that in a big way,"" he added. ""Chris was a man who believed in something and who therefore was useful to a government that needed him to go to war. It cost him his physical health, his mental health and almost cost him his family."" Art, misunderstood . ""Sniper"" isn't the first artistic work to find itself claimed by both sides in our cultural and political wars. In 1984, Bruce Springsteen's song ""Born in the U.S.A.,"" written from the point of view of a contemptuous Vietnam veteran in a dead-end world, found itself celebrated for its rousing chorus. During that year's presidential campaign, no less a figure than Ronald Reagan praised the New Jersey rocker for his ""message of hope."" Springsteen, a defiant supporter of the underdog, wasn't amused. ""I think people have a need to feel good about the country they live in,"" he said in an interview at the time. ""But what's happening, I think, is that that need -- which is a good thing -- is getting manipulated and exploited."" Then there was Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street,"" a film inspired by Stone's father, an upstanding broker much like the movie's Lou Mannheim, played by Hal Holbrook. But the character from the movie who became celebrated was Gordon Gekko (played by the Oscar-winning Michael Douglas), an unscrupulous shark who famously declared, ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good."" Gekko became a model for a generation of aspiring Masters of the Universe. Even today, people hoping for the big kill keep Gekko's quotes handy, aphorisms to live by. Finally, there's ""This Land Is Your Land,"" Woody Guthrie's famed folk song, remembered by generations of schoolchildren as a paean to America's glory. It's that, to be sure -- Guthrie really does celebrate ""golden valleys"" and ""diamond deserts"" -- but the song was also a reaction to a song Guthrie loathed: Irving Berlin's ""God Bless America,"" particularly as sung by Kate Smith. Guthrie made no secret of his loyalties in one rarely sung verse. ""In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, / By the relief office I seen my people / As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking / Is this land made for you and me?"" 'The toll is man' Yes, ""American Sniper"" encourages audiences to root for Kyle and his fellow soldiers as they respond in horror to 9/11, face dangerous insurgents who try to bomb them and track down one especially lethal enemy sniper. And yes, it ends with real-life 2013 footage of thousands of Americans lining highways, waving flags, as Kyle's funeral procession goes by. But in subtle ways, the movie's message, and morality, is not so black and white. One scene shows Cooper, as Kyle, expressing dismay that his first kill as a sniper is not of an enemy soldier but of a young boy holding a bomb. Another scene shows a grieving mother at the funeral of her son, an Iraq veteran, reading aloud a letter from him questioning the point of the war. By the time he returns from his fourth tour in Iraq, Kyle has clearly lost his appetite for warfare. He is alienated and withdrawn from his wife. And as in his Oscar-winning ""Unforgiven,"" Hall and Eastwood -- who has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq -- seem less interested in glorifying the act of killing than in exploring the psychic toll it takes on the men who do it. ""The cost is man, the toll is man, and it's this man and every other soldier that fights,"" Hall told Variety. ""If we understand that, maybe we won't be so hasty into jumping into war."" If there's a message in ""American Sniper,"" it may be that Americans could do a better job of understanding what our veterans go through, and of taking care of them when they return. Then again, maybe the message of ""American Sniper"" is whatever you want it to be. ""It is one man's war -- not the nation's,"" wrote Scott Beauchamp, an Iraq veteran (and no stranger to controversy himself), in Mic. ""While (other war) films have loud, overt messages that allow us to confront the issues head on, 'American Sniper' is sort of an empty cipher, waiting for us to project already existent emotions onto the screen.""","""American Sniper"" has been misunderstood by some moviegoers who politicize it .
Filmmakers say their focus was to create ""a character study about what the plight is for a soldier"""

The circumstances around Carney's injury were not immediately disclosed, although it was described as ""serious."" The band had just posted a message on its site Wednesday saying it will headline a festival May 28 in Barcelona, Spain. Formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001, the Black Keys are essentially a duo -- Auerbach and Carney -- although they often supplement their live shows with other musicians. Their raw sound gradually built  them a devoted but modest following until ""Brothers,"" their 2010 commercial breakthrough, brought a mainstream audience. The band is best known for the hits ""Lonely Boy"" and ""Gold on the Ceiling,"" from the 2011 ""El Camino"" album. They have won six Grammys and are up for three more this year, including best rock album for their latest, ""Turn Blue."" The Black Keys were not scheduled to perform at the Grammy Awards, to be handed out February 8 in Los Angeles. They said Friday that they do not expect any dates after March 10 to be canceled. The Black Keys also are scheduled to play a handful of music festivals this summer. NKOTB, TLC, Nelly announce summer tour .","The Black Keys cancel 17 shows on their upcoming European tour .

"(CNN)Before a deadly fire that burned a home in Annapolis, Maryland, technology executive Don Pyle and his wife, Sandra, spent a day with their four grandchildren. The day included shopping for costumes, dinner at the Medieval Times restaurant and a sleepover at Pyle's waterfront mansion. Monday was a school holiday, and the children -- Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6 -- stayed over, a family spokeswoman said. Pyle, his wife and the four grandchildren are now feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed the mansion early Monday morning. Authorities have recovered four bodies from the ruins. They continue to search for the others. The smiling grandchildren and their grandparents are seen in images released by family members, who described a boundless and unconditional bond between the victims. • Lexi loved her sister and new baby brother, her classmates, field hockey, lacrosse and ice skating, the family said in a statement Friday. ""She was thoughtful, social, smart, and determined,"" according to the family. ""She loved her dog Sophie. Her favorite adventures included trips with her parents, grandparents, and cousins. Lexi wanted to be a vet or on television when she grew up. She was going to be famous."" • Katie loved her family and her new brother, the statement said. She was described as a kind and compassionate girl who enjoyed soccer, gymnastics, ice skating and singing to Taylor Swift. Her recent adventures included her birthday party with the Baltimore Ravens cheerleaders and a trip to New York City. ""Having just turned 7, she was loving and thoughtful beyond her years,"" the statement said. • Charlotte loved her family, horses, basketball and swimming. Her friend held a special place in her heart, the statement said. ""She was fun-loving, intelligent, and kind,"" the statement said. ""She wanted to be known as a gamer with an epic love of Minecraft. Charlotte loved making videos with her guinea pig, Oreo. Charlotte's future dreams were to run an animal rescue."" • Wes loved his friends and family, Doctor Who, Legos, Minecraft, Plants vs Zombies and swimming, according to the family. ""Wes was sweet and loving and looked up to his older sister immensely. He loved all his friends and he especially looked forward to seeing his classmates at school every day. He loved trips to the beach with his family. In his future, Wes wanted to build robots."" • Pyle loved his family, especially the grandchildren, according to the family. They affectionately called him ""Pop-Pop."" He treated friends as family and enjoyed long-term friendships from high school. His also liked fishing, golf, skiing and entertaining. ""Don loved the Ravens, Orioles, and Delaware Blue Hens Lacrosse. Don also cherished traveling with his wife."" • To his wife, Sandy, each grandchild occupied a special place in her heart, according to the family. They called her ""Dee-Dee."" For her, too, friends were like family. She was passionate about the Ravens, Orioles, the beach and travel. ""She was a one-of-a-kind original -- fun-loving, caring, and generous. She loved every animal, especially her rescue dogs, and contributed to numerous animal welfare groups. Sandy was incredibly sensitive to the needs of others and generous beyond words."" On Thursday, two bodies were retrieved from the ruins of the mansion, authorities said. Two other bodies were recovered the day before. The remains were taken to a medical examiner's officer for autopsies and identification, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Capt. Russ Davies said in a statement. ""There are still two occupants unaccounted for,"" he said. ""This remains a complex scene and much work remains to be done."" The family of the victims also released a statement Thursday. ""On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event,"" the family's statement said. ""We are blessed that so many family, friends and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need."" The Thursday statement confirmed the identities of the six people firefighters and others have been searching for in the ruins of the waterfront home. ""Our love for our family is boundless,"" the statement said. ""Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones."" Local and federal officials were able to secure the structure and access the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house Wednesday. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Officials would not discuss where the bodies were or possible causes of death. Authorities are treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this, and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure -- and the fact that three-fourths of it had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering -- compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation, along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""You're looking at five standard houses put together,"" he said Tuesday. ""This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. That adds to it."" Pyle had not been heard from Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were ""hoping for a miracle,"" CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. ""We have some very unique challenges with this house,"" Howarth said. ""The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We're looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons."" When the first firefighters arrived early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were missing, fire officials said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The Fire Department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the Fire Department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle's company biography described him as an industry veteran who held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an ""industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential."" He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Wes Bruer, Shimon Prokupecz and Lindy Royce contributed to this report.","Relatives remember two adults and four children thought to have died in the fire .

"(CNN)There may be a constant argument over which player is the best in the world -- but there's no doubting which boasts the highest transfer fee. Less than a week before the Ballon d'Or, the award presented to the best player on the planet, one Swiss research group has deemed Lionel Messi as the most expensive in the game. According to the Football Observatory, which is part of the International Centre for Sports Studies, Messi leads the way ahead of Real Madrid star and principal rival Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi is estimated to be worth $262 million with Portugal's Ronaldo, the reigning world player of the year, some distance behind with an estimated transfer fee of $158 million. The two, who will contest the Ballon d'Or in Switzerland on Monday, are also up against Germany's World Cup winning captain Manuel Neuer. According to the CIES, the transfer values are calculated ""using an exclusive algorithm developed on the basis of over 1,500 fee paying transfers occurred since 2009."" It also takes into account levels of performance, characteristics and results achieved at both club and international level. Read the list here . Eden Hazard ($158 million) and his Chelsea teammate Diego Costa ($100 million) are third and fourth in the list, while Juventus' French midfielder Paul Pogba is the only player in Italian football to make the top 10. Pogba, who plays for Juventus, has an estimated value of $86 million which places him ahead of Manchester City's prolific striker Sergio Aguero (£77 million). Liverpool's 20-year-old wing wizard Raheem Sterling is ranked sixth on the list after being valued at $75 million, just one million ahead of Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez is ranked ninth after being given a $73 million price tag with Real's Gareth Bale on $71 million. Brazil and Barcelona star Neymar is one notable absentee from the top 10, he finished just one place outside ahead of Manchester United's Angel di Maria, Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze and 2014  World Cup star James Rodriguez.","Lionel Messi tops list of most expensive football players .

"Miami, Florida (CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio is on track to run for president if he decides to jump in the race, an aide tells CNN. A presidential bid isn't the definite next move for the senator, who's also up for reelection in 2016 and has said he'll only run for one office â€” but for many of his donors and supporters attending his two-day summit in Miami, it's the obvious one. Attendees were given the impression by Rubio and his aides that while the senator hasn't made a decision yet, he has prepared the funding and staffing infrastructure to go all in. And speaking to some audience members who were listening, the pitch worked. ""I'm very taken with him,"" said Anthony Gioia, an ambassador under George W. Bush and a major GOP fundraiser who supported Mitt Romney in 2012. Convincing his financial backers that he has the campaign organization to launch a 2016 bid at a moment's notice is important as Rubio's would-be primary challengers have been more public and direct about their intentions for weeks now. While the freshman Florida senator gathered donors and staff at the posh Delano hotel, at least 10 Republican hopefuls were addressing potential Iowa caucus-goers and former governors Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney criss-crossed the country meeting with voters and Republican officials. Back in Miami, Gioia said that while he hasn't decided who to support in the GOP primary, he was impressed by Rubio's command of the foreign policy challenges facing the nation and, in particular, the senator's charisma and compelling personal story. ""He's extremely articulate,"" Gioia said. ""Someone who's going to be president has to be able to lead. And you have to be articulate to be able to lead."" Gioia was one of nearly 300 donors and supporters gathered at the hotel on Friday night and Saturday morning for the senator's annual ""Team Rubio"" meeting. Attendees included Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union and a supporter of both Rubio and Jeb Bush; Dirk Van Dongen, chair of Rubio's D.C. steering committee; Matt Keelen, a major Rubio donor, and Geoff Verhoff, a D.C. lobbyist and a member of Rubio's D.C. steering committee. Rubio spent nearly three hours Friday night chatting individually with attendees, telling jokes and stories with them on the candlelit patio after guests enjoyed a buffet dinner and open bar. Over a breakfast buffet Saturday morning, Rubio told the group about his thinking as he contemplates a presidential run. He's huddling with a few dozen of his top fundraisers and aides over lunch to strategize for his future, and has a more casual dinner planned Saturday night with a small circle to continue the conversation. According to multiple attendees at the breakfast briefing, Rubio said he'd make the decision sooner rather than later, as he wants to give Republicans in the state enough time to front a strong candidate to defend his seat if he does decide to go for the White House. Terry Sullivan, Rubio's former chief of staff who now runs his PAC, also gave a powerpoint presentation to the group outlining the senator's midterm efforts and successes, introducing the attendees to the new Republicans their money helped elect in 2014. Aides caution that Rubio hasn't made up his mind yet, and that these preparations will be just as useful for a Senate campaign if he decides to run for reelection. Florida Republicans are expecting to face a fierce battle with Democrats to hold onto the seat regardless of who they run, because it's both a top pickup opportunity for Democrats hoping to take back the Senate, and a key swing state in the electoral college calculus. Cardenas predicted the Senate fight alone could top $100 million. ""Florida's going to be the number one state in a presidential election and in the U.S. Senate election, and whether you're running for reelection in the Senate in a race that could cost 100 million, or you're running for president, you need an incredible effort just for the reelection,"" he said. ""So if you don't start working on that now, you're not going to be able to amass the resources you need."" Rubio's well on track to amass those resources. The senator had a record January fundraising haul, beating all of his goals, according to an aide. And he's on track to surpass his February goals as well, with fundraising trips to Chicago and Texas planned for next month. He recently brought on Anna Rogers, the top fundraiser for major GOP spending group American Crossroads, as his finance director, though his current finance director, Dorinda Moss, will still be active in the team's fundraising efforts. Still, many in the party remain skeptical of a first-term senator who's still haunted, in some conservative circles, by his role in negotiating the failed Senate immigration reform bill in 2013. That which both lost him support within the conservative wing in the party and raised questions about his ability to effectively govern. He was one of a handful of potential 2016 contenders who skipped out on a conservative gathering hosted by Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King this weekend â€” a snub that did not go unnoticed by King, who told the crowd he believed the country's next president was one of the speakers at the confab. But Rubio's own team doesn't believe immigration will be an issue for him in the race, if he runs. They note the senator's got strong credentials on nearly every other key conservative issue, including gun control and abortion, and see the immigration snafu as a mulligan of sorts that conservatives could forgive. And his supporters believe he's got the charisma and compelling personal story that many other potential contenders lack. Gioia, who's hosted fundraising dinners at his home that have netted candidates upwards of a million dollars, said he has yet to decide which Republican to support. But between Rubio and Bush, the younger senator may have won his heart. ""I'm certainly leaning very heavily towards Marco, or possibly Jeb â€” but I really like Marco. He's a really talented guy,"" Gioia said. ""He's got a good inner self too. He's comfortable in his own skin,"" he added.","Marco Rubio has the campaign organization ready to run for president, an aide tells CNN .

"(CNN)She will be remembered as the would-be bomber whose device failed to detonate in a string of otherwise deadly terror attacks at Jordanian hotels in 2005. Sajida al-Rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt, and Jordan executed her early Wednesday. ISIS had demanded her release, threatening to kill two hostages if Jordan didn't comply. ISIS carried out those killings, and Jordan carried out al-Rishawi's execution. But just who was she? And what's her connection to the new radical Sunni group that controls big swaths of Syria and Iraq? Al-Rishawi was referred to as an ""imprisoned sister"" of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known ISIS supporter. The message proposed a swap of al-Rishawi for Japanese hostage Kenji Goto. In the video, Goto was seen holding a photo of what appeared to be beheaded compatriot Haruna Yukawa. The online posts, which CNN could not verify independently, appeared four days after an ISIS video demanded that the Japanese government pay $200 million within 72 hours for the hostages' release. In the latest recording, the voice of a person claiming to be Goto was heard in English blaming Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for Yukawa's death. Forgoing the money, the voice then issued a new ISIS demand: the release of al-Rishawi. ""They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi,"" the voice said. Al-Rishawi, who was being held by authorities in Jordan, was not seen publicly in nine years. In a televised confession in November 2005, al-Rishawi calmly recounted how she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at Jordanian hotels that month that killed at least 57 people. ""My husband detonated his bomb, and I tried to detonate mine but failed,"" al-Rishawi said on Jordanian television, showing no emotion. ""People fled running, and I left running with them."" In 2006, al-Rishawi was sentenced to death, but that same year, Jordan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty. Executions resumed last month. Wearing a white head scarf and black dress during the confession, al-Rishawi displayed a belt rigged with explosives and crudely held together with tape. Jordanian authorities said al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, joined her husband, Hussein Ali al-Shamari, to carry out the suicide bombings at the Radisson hotel. His explosives went off, killing 38 people attending a wedding reception in the ballroom. Three male bombers and 57 bystanders were killed at three hotels in the series of attacks. She said she was an Iraqi who lived in Ramadi and, using fake passports, traveled to Jordan with her husband. She told Jordanian authorities that her husband taught her how to use her explosives belt. In the confession, al-Rishawi said, ""My husband is the one who organized everything."" Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. strike in June 2006. A post on a website used by al Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility for the Jordan attacks. Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher said after the attacks that al-Rishawi was the sister of Zarqawi's ""right-hand man,"" who was killed in Falluja, Iraq. He did not identify the lieutenant. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a lieutenant of al-Zarqawi, retired Lt. Col. James Reese, a former U.S. Delta Force commander, told CNN. ""There's a link back to this woman,"" Reese said of the alleged prisoner swap. ""This is just another way to help them (ISIS) bring these people back and help with their propaganda."" In February 2014, al Qaeda renounced ties to ISIS after months of infighting between ISIS and another group, al-Nusra Front. ISIS started in 2004 as al Qaeda in Iraq with the aim of creating an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. After the Jordan attacks, Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended, but two belts were found with her. One was filled with the explosive RDX, the other with ball bearings, a technique used by the other bombers. ""The aim was to inflict the largest number of casualties,"" he said. Muasher said Jordanian authorities had information that al-Rishawi's husband ""asked her to step out of the room"" when her explosives failed to detonate. In her confession, al-Rishawi said she and her husband stood at opposite sides of the room for the double-bombing. ""There was a wedding ceremony in the hotel,"" she said. ""There were women, men and children.""","Sajida al-Rishawi was named in a proposed swap for Japanese hostage Kenji Goto .

"(CNN)The English football season isn't over until May, but you can bet your bottom dollar that Chelsea will finish top of the table. That's according to a leading football simulator, which is predicting that Jose Mourinho's team will pip defending champions Manchester City to the Premier League title. Football Manager is a computer game which allows players to take control of their favorite team. Using the game's encyclopaedic database, which contains data on nearly a quarter of a million players from around the world, its makers have simulated the remaining matches of the 2014-15 campaign. This included factoring in the various injuries and suspensions EPL teams have picked up since the game's initial release in November last year. And it's Chelsea who emerged victorious, finishing three points clear of defending champions City in second place. Manchester United, under the guidance of Louis van Gaal, came in third ahead of Liverpool in fourth. This would spell disaster for Arsenal, who finished fifth in the fantasy table. If replicated in real life, it would Arsene Wenger's team missing out on Champions League football for the first time in 18 years -- unless of course the London side win Europe's premier competition. Arsenal faces Monaco in the last 16 next month with Chelsea and Manchester City also reaching the knockout stage. Despite their early season promise, and despite sitting pretty in third place in the actual league table, Southampton's charge up the table will stutter and end in a seventh-place finish, according to the game's manufacturers Sports Interactive. However, there is better news for City when the January transfer window is factored into the equation, a period during the season when European clubs can add to their rosters. The Football Manager team ran a second simulation which included speculated transfer targets for each team and in this version of the league it's City who take the title from Chelsea on goal difference.","Computer game predicts Chelsea to win English Premier League .

"(CNN)A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region said Friday he is not interested in a truce with the Ukrainian government in Kiev because his troops are on the offensive. ""Since we're attacking, there is no sense to have peace talks now,"" Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk, said in a meeting with university students, according to his media office. ""We've made this mistake before. It's not decent to repeat it,"" he said. Thousands have been killed in months of conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian troops, and a ceasefire agreed to in September crumbled long ago. Zakharchenko's comments came two days after the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met in Berlin to discuss a way out of the violence. But Zakharchenko showed no interest in the talks. ""There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire,"" he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA. ""We will be on the offensive until we reach the border of Donetsk region."" He said that he was interested in cooperating with Ukraine on prisoner exchanges. ""We need to get our guys who've been captured,"" he said, according to RIA. Despite the talks in Berlin, violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine shows no signs of abating. Power is out in and around Luhansk after militants shelled a power plant there, Luhansk regional official Hennady Moskal told Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency. Moskal noted that the local water supply and boilers are off, and trolley buses aren't operating. Thursday's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians, according to state news reports. But Ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire, as well. That includes 115 attacks in a recent 24-hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more, Ukrinform reported Friday. The news agency said that ""Russian-terrorist troops"" faced off with Ukrainian soldiers Thursday along Bakhumtka Highway, even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing, suggesting that he was part of the Russian military. This is in line with Kiev's repeated assertions that Russia has not only actively supported rebels with arms, but has sent its own troops across the border to battle Ukrainian forces. On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that ""more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops."" Claims that Russian forces entered Ukraine 'complete rubbish,' Russia says . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov promptly responded to this assertion with a firm denial, much like other denials made by Russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention. ""As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that,"" he said. ""And each time I hear that, I say if you're so confident about that, please present us with facts, but no one has been able to provide us with these facts."" Russian forces, equipment enter Ukraine, PM says . Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern Ukraine since the spring of 2014, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict had killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, said the United Nations. ""We fear that the real figure may be considerably higher,""  the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said about the death toll in a report released Friday. At least 262 people were killed in the fighting from January 13 through Wednesday alone, the report said. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union. After months of protests and days of deadly clashes between demonstrators and security personnel in Kiev, Parliament ousted Yanukovych in February. Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Then in April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev.","Aleksandr Zakharchenko: No sense in talking peace since we're on the offensive .

"(CNN)States struggling to define the question of marriage equality have an addition to their ranks: Alabama. A U.S. district judge struck down Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage Friday after two Mobile women sued the state for failing to recognize the couple's union. Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand were married legally in California and have been together for 15 years. But the issue of their rights as a couple came about after Searcy's petition to adopt McKeand's 9-year-old son was denied. Alabama's adoption code gives a person a right to adopt a spouse's child. But because Alabama doesn't recognize their marriage, Searcy could not qualify for adoption. The couple's lawyer, David Kennedy, said McKeand and Searcy were ""very pleased with the court's ruling."" ""We are happy for the tens of thousands of gay Alabamians and their children,"" Kennedy said. ""Justice and equality are guaranteed to everyone and we are proud to know that is true in Alabama tonight."" The state filed a motion Friday seeking to put a hold on the judge's decision pending a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, effectively trying to keep couples from applying for marriage licenses in the meantime. The Supreme Court has previously refused to hear cases from states -- Indiana, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, to name a few -- seeking to keep their bans against same-sex marriage in place. But the court is expected to consider petitions from lower courts in five states where judges upheld laws banning same-sex marriage. If the ruling is upheld, Alabama would be the 37th state to authorize same-sex marriage.","A district judge rules Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional .

"(CNN)Two Marines died after their helicopter crashed on a training mission in Southern California, the military said in a statement. The aircraft went down around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. ""Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the two Marines we lost in this tragic accident,"" Maj. Gen. Michael Rocco said Friday. The names of the Marines will be released after the next of kin are notified. According to its website, the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center's mission ""is to conduct relevant live-fire combined arms training, urban operations, and Joint/Coalition level integration training"" for Marines and Navy sailors. It's located in San Bernardino County some 130 miles east of Los Angeles and abuts Joshua Tree National Park. While missions in combat zones are obviously more dangerous, there are many examples of fatal U.S. military aircraft crashes during training missions as well. Last March, for instance, a F/A-18C Hornet's pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada. The Navy described the combat jet as a ""total loss."" The Marines have had their share of deaths during training missions as well. In 2012, seven Marines died in a midair collision of two U.S. military helicopters along the Arizona-California border. Six of those killed during what was called a routine training operation were based at California's Camp Pendleton, while the other was out of Yuma, Arizona, the Marine Corps said. The previous year, the Marines had at least three deadly incidents involving helicopter crashes in noncombat areas -- one off of Hawaii, another in the northern part of Camp Pendleton and the third on that same Southern California base. The latter two crashes both involved members of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, like the one of Friday.","2 die on a training mission at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Marines say .

"(CNN)The next time Ernie Banks plays two -- something he enjoyed, feeling one baseball game a day wasn't enough -- it will be in the diamond in the sky. The former Negro League upstart turned Cubs legend turned favorite son of Chicago died Friday of a heart attack in the Illinois city,  family attorney Mark Bogen said. It was a week shy of his 84th birthday. A public memorial will be scheduled, Bogen said. Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts described Banks as ""one of the greatest players of all time."" ""Words cannot express how important Ernie Banks will always be to the Chicago Cubs, the city of Chicago and Major League Baseball,"" Ricketts said. ""... He was a pioneer in the major leagues. And more importantly, he was the warmest and most sincere person I've ever known."" ""Approachable, ever optimistic and kindhearted, Ernie Banks is and always will be Mr. Cub."" Farewell to 'Mr. Cub' Ernie Banks, an elegant ambassador and all-time great . The thing is, Banks wasn't just a great baseball player, but a great champion for his sport and adopted city. The Windy City's mayor, Rahm Emanuel, called him ""one of Chicago's greatest ambassadors."" Emanuel said, ""He loved this city as much as he loved -- and lived for -- the game of baseball."" And baseball loved him back -- not just for the player he was, but the man he was. This sentiment was evident on social media, with one man writing, ""I've heard a lot of Ernie Banks stories in my life, a lot. But not one of them showed him in a negative way."" One person tweeted that, like the recently departed Stan Musial, Banks was ""never too big for fans."" ""Mr. Cub will play 2 today,"" wrote another man. ""He's with the Angels now and hopefully he'll get a ring."" That message alluded to the fact that Banks, despite all his stellar play over his career, never earned a World Series ring. In fact, the last time the Cubs won baseball's ultimate prize was 1908. But you'd never know it from Banks' omnipresent smile. He became the Chicago franchise's first black player in 1953. That happened three years after the Dallas native started his professional career in the Negro Leagues with the Kansas City Monarchs, then spent two years in the Army. After the Monarchs sold his contract to the Cubs, Banks jumped straight to the Major Leagues -- hitting .314 in the 10 games he played in that first season. He became Chicago's starting shortstop the next year, then had his real breakthrough in 1955 when he racked up 117 RBIs. His 44 home runs that season were at the time the most ever for a shortstop. (He hit 47 homers three years later, still a National League record for the position.) Banks kept it up as his career rolled along. Late umpire Tom Gorman once recalled that in 1957, pitchers Don Drysdale, Bob Purkey, Bob Friend and Jack Sanford knocked down Banks with pitches, according to a story on the Cubs' website. ""And each time he was knocked down,"" Gorman said, ""Banks hit their next pitch out of the park."" The accomplishments piled up through Banks' retirement after the 1971 season: 2,583 hits, 11 National League All-Star selections, two of the league's Most Valuable Player awards, and 512 home runs, including five seasons hitting more than 40 homers. And in 1977, six years after his last at-bat, Banks was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. It's no wonder, then, that he was voted the ""Greatest Cub Ever"" in a 1969 Chicago Sun-Times fan poll. After all, he was known both as ""Mr. Cub"" and ""Mr. Sunshine."" Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher, who was known for saying ""Nice guys finish last,"" made an exception for Banks. ""Banks is one nice guy who finished first -- but he had the talent to go with it,"" Durocher said. And this from sportswriter Arthur Daley: ""He rejoices merely in living, and baseball is a marvelous extra that makes his existence so much more pleasurable."" Bogen, the family lawyer, said that Banks ""would go right up to people and ask about their families and how they were doing rather than baseball."" ""He wanted to know all about people's lives. Baseball was not the first thing he would talk about,"" the attorney said. ""He cared about people."" His work on and off the field led to his receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2013. ""To have this award passed on to me is certainly a great joy,"" Banks told CNN's Jake Tapper at the time. ""It's something I'll never forget."" The slugger left an impression on President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, too. In a White House statement Saturday, Obama noted how Banks -- who made $7 a day coming up through the Negro Leagues -- never lost ""his cheer, his optimism, and his love of the game."" ""He was beloved by baseball fans everywhere,"" Obama said, ""including Michelle, who, when she was a girl, used to sit with her dad and watch him play on TV."" People we've lost in 2015 .","Banks started in the Negro Leagues, played for Chicago from 1953 to 1971 .

"(CNN)U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in order to meet the newly appointed monarch, King Salman, and pay his respects to the family of the late King Abdullah, the White House said Saturday. Vice President Joe Biden was originally set to have led a delegation to Saudi Arabia on Obama's behalf. However, the schedule for the President's departure from India has been adjusted to allow Obama to stop in Riyadh himself on his way home, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. Funeral services were held Friday for King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who died earlier that day. He was 90. World leaders are now traveling to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, to offer condolences for Abdullah's death and pay their respects to the new ruler. Abdullah was seen by many as a cautious reformer who succeeded in securing broader freedoms in the conservative kingdom, but fell short in gaining greater independence for women. King Abdullah's legacy: 5 things to know . His successor, who is 79, faces a number of challenges as he takes up the reins, including Iran, the rise of ISIS, the crisis in neighboring Yemen and the drop in oil prices. But Salman has plenty of experience to draw on, having served as defense minister and deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia, a vital U.S. ally in the Middle East. Like Abdullah, he is one of the dozens of sons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Abdulaziz. Obama is due to arrive in New Delhi on Sunday, on a trip intended to foster progress in sometimes thorny U.S.-India ties. On Monday, he will become the first American president to headline India's Republic Day parade, standing beside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Why Obama's trip to my homeland is meaningful . Earnest said Obama's schedule had been changed in coordination with the Indian government and that he would now be leaving India after giving a speech on Tuesday. ""The President regrets that he will be unable to visit Agra during this trip,"" Earnest said. Agra is where the spectacular Taj Mahal mausoleum is located. Biden will now remain in Washington rather than go to Saudi Arabia. Although no reason for the change of plan was given, it follows criticism this month of the Obama administration for its failure to send a senior representative to France for a huge unity march held in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. The administration admitted it erred and dispatched U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Paris the following week to offer the United States' support and condolences. Speaking to CNN's Richard Quest in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday, Kerry said he expects no changes in his government's relations with Saudi Arabia with the change of kings. ""I don't anticipate anything based on the conversation we have had, no,"" he said. Jordan's King Abdullah and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi both left Davos early to attend the funeral on Friday. In line with custom, Abdullah was laid to rest in an unmarked grave in a brief and simple ceremony after funeral prayers in Riyadh's Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","White House: President Barack Obama will stop in Riyadh to pay respects to Saudi royals .

"DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN)The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest. Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test-drive their stump speeches. On style, it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season. Marathon time . For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, ""the candidates"" -- as they were called --  joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines. Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party. It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind. ""It wasn't just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that,"" he said. Others were more blatant. ""I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am,"" former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN. Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he'll make his decision before June. ""I'm the one person who can make this country great again, that's all I know,"" he told reporters Saturday. ""Nobody else can."" Palin, in her remarks, was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader -- just not Hillary Clinton. ""Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary?"" she said, prompting the audience to cheer. ""To borrow a phrase, yes we can!"" The class of 2016 . The speakers, who were typically allotted 20 minutes, used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers. Other more well-known names in Iowa — like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state's caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008 — tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues. Given King's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued ""there wouldn't be people coming in here if there wasn't a magnet pulling them in,"" suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers. The main target in the immigration battle, however, was President Barack Obama's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it, in her folksy swagger, Obama's decision makes him seem ""like an overgrown little boy who's just acting kinda spoiled."" Speakers railed against the President's pledge to use his ""pen and his phone"" to work around Congress, with immigration as just one example of what many called the president's ""overreach."" That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry's speech, leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators' chants. The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012. Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the ""isolationism"" and ""weakness"" from the Obama's administration. Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism. ""A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn,"" Huckabee said. The issues . There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average. Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King's name — in all caps — was plastered across banners on the stage, as well as the podium. The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat, blasting Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else. Giving a shout out to the state's newly elected U.S. senator, Joni Ernst, was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their ""friend,"" and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state's other beloved senator, Chuck Grassley. Walker, who, like Cruz, paced the stage back and forth as he spoke, delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws, and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011. He also didn't forget to mention that he's been elected three times in the past four years. Shortly after his speech, two men, both from Council Bluffs, talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker's remarks. ""If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin, this country would be,"" one man, Michael Patomson, started to say, before his friend, Bill Hartzell, interjected: ""Transformed. The country would be transformed."" The reception . Many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit. ""There was just a pantheon of people to listen to,"" said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids. ""Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him — that's good. He needs it,"" said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County, Iowa. Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a ""Jersey guy"" reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa. ""That somehow I'm too loud, I'm too blunt and I'm too direct,"" Christie said, dismissing the criticism as ""conventional wisdom"" from Washington pundits. ""They're wrong."" Still, he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium, a stark contrast to his preferred off-the-cuff method. Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren't there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney. Trump put it simply: ""Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked."" As for Bush: ""We've had enough of the Bushes."" Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal, also skipped the event, but given that it's year ahead before Iowans start to caucus, it's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them. Saturday's event was more of a curtain raiser, giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary. Walker, as he closed his speech, offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: ""I'm going to come back many more times."" CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report.","Republicans gathered in Iowa to offer a first glimpse of the 2016 presidential campaign narratives .

"New Delhi (CNN)The leaders of India and the United States, testing the diplomatic extent of their personal friendship, said on Sunday they'd made progress on a deal allowing U.S. firms to cooperate on civilian nuclear power plants in India. U.S. companies are reluctant to construct nuclear plants in India if they aren't shielded from liability after accidents, an assurance Indian lawmakers have been unwilling to extend. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped short of announcing a full-fledged deal but did say they'd moved forward on the issue. ""This is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship,"" Obama said during a press conference that came after bilateral talks with Modi. Obama touched down in India on Sunday for a truncated state visit that has officials claiming a new era in U.S.-India relations is dawning. Obama hopes to capitalize on his young friendship with Modi to achieve diplomatic progress on climate, defense and trade -- progress that has eluded U.S. leaders in the past. In a surprise break in protocol, Modi greeted Obama on the tarmac on his arrival in New Delhi and wrapped him in a hug. After a two-leg, 16-hour journey, Air Force One landed in New Delhi under midmorning fog around 10 a.m. (11:30 p.m. Saturday ET). The overcast Indian capital was heavily fortified with extra security for the President's trip; police and military guards armed with machine guns patrolled roads and manned checkpoints throughout the city. Highways were shut well ahead of Obama's arrival. The normally chaotic traffic scene was unusually serene hours before Obama's landing. Even the city's stray dogs and monkeys were being herded away from the routes Obama's motorcade was scheduled to drive. A formal military presentation greeted Obama at the Indian President's residence, and Obama joined Modi to lay a wreath at a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi. On Monday, Obama will be the first U.S. leader to headline India's annual Republic Day parade, a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands, dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately Rajpath Boulevard. The White House says the invitation to act as the parade's honored guest came as a major shock and could open the way for new cooperation between New Delhi and Washington. Obama himself sees the invitation as a ""transformational"" moment for U.S.-India relations, according to his aides. ""I think it goes without saying that this is a seminal moment in the bilateral relationship, and that the extension of this invitation by the Prime Minister really continues to set a different tone for our reinvigorated partnership,"" said Phil Reiner, senior director for South Asia on Obama's National Security Council staff. But even the parade itself will act as a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between the two countries. A military demonstration at heart, the vehicles and equipment parading before Obama on Monday will be mostly Russian-made, a vestige of India's stance during the Cold War. Russia remains India's largest supplier of weapons, and while their share is steadily decreasing, Russian military imports still amount to three-quarters of India's stockpile. With U.S.-Russia relations worsening to Cold War levels, Obama hopes to balance Moscow's influence in India during his visit this week. Officials also hope to exact climate commitments in New Delhi, where air quality warnings remained in place even during Obama's visit. That's a contrast to Obama's trip late last year to Beijing, where roads were cleared and the air cleansed of its usual smog ahead of the President's arrival. In China, Obama was able to secure historic carbon reduction promises from the new Premier there, though expectations for similar achievements in India were more measured. Indians working in the capital city on Sunday said they regarded Obama's visit as a highly symbolic gesture from the United States -- one they said was well-received, despite the security headaches that his arrival caused. Local television networks profiled weavers preparing elaborate gold-threaded saris for first lady Michelle Obama, who is accompanying her husband for the three-day state visit. The pair had planned to visit the Taj Mahal in Agra, whose origins as a memorial to a Mughal emperor's wife have made it a romantic draw for couples. The side trip was nixed, however, so Obama and the first lady could fly to Riyadh to pay respects to the late Saudi King Abdullah.

"Denver, Colorado (CNN)A federal judge gave a four-year prison sentence Friday to a 19-year-old Colorado woman who admitted guilt in wanting to become an ISIS bride and participate in its jihad in the Mideast. Shannon Maureen Conley is one of the first Americans to be sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS and received a sentence that was also recommended by prosecutors seeking to send a message of deterrence. Though the judge initially cited how Conley needs psychiatric care, he sided with prosecutors in the end. ""What is it that will cause others to stop"" in the future, Judge Raymond P. Moore said during sentencing. Before sentencing, Conley wept as she read a statement saying, ""It was after arrest that I learned the truth about the ISIS that I was taught to respect."" She talked about her ongoing journey into Islam. ""Since my incarceration I have had a chance to read the entire Quran,"" she said. She concluded that ""the scholars"" she had been following in her online research about Islam had distorted the Quran, she said. ""Even though I was committed to the idea of jihad, I didn't want to hurt anyone. It was all about defending Muslims,"" she said. She called her situation a ""life-altering"" experience and said she now wants to be a ""catalyst of good"" going forward. ""I am deeply humbled by this opportunity to grow,"" she said. ""I do not believe I am a threat to society and I ask you to allow me to prove it,"" she pleaded to the judge. Conley's mother waved to her with tears in her eyes as Conley was led out of the courtroom. Later her parents released a statement online criticizing the U.S. legal system for making an example of their daughter in trying to discourage others from turning to extremism. If ""the government is willing to sacrifice the future of a 19-year-old American citizen to drive the point home ... then we feel the terrorists have won this particular battle in the war on terrorism."" Outside the courthouse after the proceeding, Conley's lawyer, Assistant Federal Defender Robert Pepin, told reporters he was disappointed with the sentence and noted that the plea agreement imposed limitations on any appeal, which the defense is considering. ""I think the judge gave a sentence he thought was appropriate. That's all I really have to say about the sentence,"" Pepin said. He said he wanted Americans to know that his client is a wonderful person. ""Her future will be bright. She will get past this,"" he said. But Moore said Conley's plea agreement gave him limited options on sentencing. Under the plea agreement, Conley faced ""up to five years in federal prison and a fine up to $250,000 for conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization,"" federal prosecutors said. She received credit for cooperating with federal authorities, according to the prosecutor and the judge. Her prison sentence will be followed by three years of supervised release and 100 hours of community service, in which she has to interact with ""ordinary people,"" Moore said. He also prohibited her possession of any black powder or explosive materials. ""I'm not taking any chances,"" Moore said. Conley's plea was made last year in exchange for a reduced charge with a lighter sentence. During Friday's sentencing hearing, U.S. Attorney Greg Holloway said Conley has been cooperative and willingly provided information to investigators. He argued that a four-year sentence would send a message that the U.S. government uses restraint, but consequences are serious in terror cases. Moore interrupted the prosecutor at one point saying, ""That woman is in need of psychiatric help."" ""I'm not saying that her decisions were all a product of mental illness. ... But she's a bit of a mess,"" Moore said. The judge referenced Conley's psychiatric report that stated ""she is not a terrorist."" The judge also alluded to a series of events from 2011 to her arrest in 2014. ""There is a history of events that would make for a bad movie,"" Moore said. Conley almost agreed to marry three different people in a matter of months, according to Moore. The prosecutor said Conley was ""pathologically naive."" Added the judge: ""She has no history in the criminal justice system. She is very young. ... Teenagers make dumb decisions a lot."" Conley looked relaxed in court. She smiled at times while talking with lawyers before the hearing. She wore a blue and white jail uniform, a head scarf and glasses. Pepin said while Conley has been in jail, she has been studying Spanish and macroeconomics, writing letters to her mother, sisters, friends, even ""Allah,"" talking about religion and her desire ""to understand."" Her lawyer said she has gone through a complete transformation in the past nine months. Pepin argued that ""the things that she believed at the time she was arrested she does not believe now."" He noted that Conley, a convert to Islam, changed her adopted Muslim name from Halima to Amatullah, because she is a different person now.  Amatullah means female ""servant of Allah."" Conley initially took the name Halima after converting to Islam. Opinion: When Americans leave for jihad . But Moore adamantly responded, ""She had another name before Halima."" ""Don't tell me that changing her name means she gets it. She changes her name like I change my socks,"" the judge told the defense. The judge said a belief, even if she was misled by ill-intentioned extremists asserting religion justifies violent jihad, does not excuse her actions. ""There is a string of defiance that rolls through her life that I have not seen change yet,"" Moore said. ""Defiance has been a part of the fabric for a long time and that is concerning."" The judge talked about how she showed up to a meeting with the FBI wearing a T-shirt that said, ""Sniper don't run, you'll die trying."" The judge also mentioned how investigators tried to stop Conley with multiple warnings that following through on her plans could lead to her arrest. She responded with, ""I'd rather go to prison than do nothing,"" according to Moore. The judge also expressed alarm about Conley's other preoccupations. ""What am I to do about this obsession with the military?"" Moore said. Opinion: Rise of the female jihadists . He said Conley planned to be a police officer and join the military and then went to training with U.S. Army Explorers to learn military skills. What if one reason she desired to go to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter wasn't just because she shared a belief in jihad, but ""because he was attractive to her because he was a soldier?"" the judge asked. The judge noted that Conley still signs letters ""behind enemy lines."" A female imam went to mentor Conley in jail and reported that Conley wanted to talk about violent jihad. The judge said it's surprising that Conley suddenly is disavowing jihad and that she has seemed to do a 180-degree turn in a very short period. The judge also brought up a letter Conley wrote to a friend that seemed to mock the American people's concern about terrorism. Moore also referenced comments that Conley made to CNN when it visited her a day before Friday's sentencing. Conley told CNN of her new adopted Muslim name, a new hairstyle for the sentencing date, and how ""I'm in a vulnerable place right now, and it would be stupid of me to talk to you when I'm vulnerable."" On Friday, Moore noted that ""she doesn't get it."" ""She's a look-at-me girl,"" Moore continued, and he referenced the CNN interview. Pipen said he was furious about the jailhouse visit and said he thought it was sneaky. The judge also cited the ISIS fighter whom she was to marry, Yousr Mouelhi, a 32-year-old Tunisian man . ""Why did she think Mouelhi was a good man?... Does she get this?"" the judge said. He indicated that Conley still calls her suitor ""a good man."" Conley attracted national attention last year after authorities arrested her at Denver International Airport. Investigators said she told them she was going to Turkey to await word from an ISIS member in Syria, a man she met on the Internet and planned to marry. According to court documents, she intended to become a nurse in an ISIS camp. She is a Colorado certified nurse's aide. Her parents, Ana Maria and John Conley, were aware of their daughter's conversion to Islam but didn't know about her interest in extreme Islam or jihad. John Conley reportedly caught his daughter talking to her ISIS ""suitor"" on Skype. The couple asked for the father's blessing, but he said no. On April 1, the father called the FBI to report that he had found her ticket for an April 8 flight to Turkey on his desk. Opinion: What lures Americans to Syria fight?

"(CNN)The passing of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz may not have come as a surprise -- his health had deteriorated in recent years -- but until the very end, the monarch was determined to leave an indelible imprint on the throne by articulating and implementing a clear vision for the country. Abdullah also seemed to possess the political acumen necessary to adjust to the changing needs and increased political awareness of the Saudi populace, as well as to the shifting political realities in the Middle East and elsewhere. Abdullah didn't officially ascend until 2005, but he had been the de facto king since 1995, when his predecessor and half-brother Fahd's health started failing. It was Abdullah who had to steady the ship during the tumultuous aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the United States and subsequent terrorist attacks inside the kingdom in 2003 and 2004. The specter of terrorism not only forced some to question the foundation of Saudi Arabia's ""special"" relationship with the US, but also posed a serious threat to the stability of the regime by challenging its Islamic bona fides on which its entire claim to legitimacy rests. Although it was the late Interior Minister Naif Bin Abdulaziz and his successor who devised the kingdom's multi-pronged counter-terrorism strategy -- part security operation, part public awareness campaign -- that largely contained the threat from al Qaeda, Abdullah's resoluteness and assurances to Saudis and the international community should not be underestimated. Many might remember Abdullah for his foreign policy initiatives, including his plan for comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors -- adopted first by the Arab League in 2002 and then again 2007 -- or his efforts to foster interfaith understanding by sponsoring international forums aimed at bringing together followers of various religions to stress their shared values, as his meeting with Pope Benedict in 2009 illustrated. But many Saudis are likely to think of him as the king who tried to dispel any lingering doubts about the validity of the narrative around which the state was founded: The idea of a Saudi ""nation"" and its concomitant notion of a unifying Saudi identity. Abdullah convinced many Saudis that they are not merely passive observers but rather stakeholders in a still-ongoing nation-building endeavor. Although he sometimes used the stern tenor of an avuncular patriarch -- as he did when he encouraged Saudis not to become their own worst enemy by questioning each other's loyalties -- the frank tone he often used in his speeches ushered in a new era, where Saudis of all walks of life felt more open to speak about not only what they considered to be the main impediments hindering the kingdom's development, but also some of the obstacles standing in the way of their own self-fulfilment. Many in the Saudi media and burgeoning Saudi civil society, following the king's lead, felt emboldened to write and speak about subjects that were once considered off-limits, including extremism among some clerics, government corruption, the role of women, child and spousal abuse, and the soundness of the educational curriculum. That is not to say that red lines do not remain and that some have not crossed them and paid a price. The imprisonment of some outspoken advocates of reform in 2014 brought Saudi Arabia intense scrutiny from human rights organizations and the Western media.  Those who apparently stepped over the red lines included long-time activists as well as two young women with large followings on social media who tried to cross the Saudi border while driving. The case of young blogger, Raif Badawi, who was accused of insulting the religious establishment garnered special attention, as his sentence included weekly public flogging. These cases prompted some to question whether the Saudi government was serious about reforms. Abdullah's establishment of periodic ""National Dialogs"" allowed some leading Saudis to have these important debates openly. While criticized by some as mere photo ops, these meetings brought together Saudis from different ends of the political and religious spectrum -- including some leading Sunni and Shia clerics -- who would not have had the opportunity to meet face to face in such a public fashion. Abdullah also expanded the membership of the consultative Shura Council, which now includes 30 women. Just as importantly, it was under his reign that thousands of Saudis experienced their first taste of democratic politics when they participated in nation-wide elections for municipal councils in 2005. The fact that many Saudis took their children and even grandchildren with them to the polling booths indicates the symbolic importance of this exercise. In 2011, Abdullah took a calculated risk by declaring that women will be eligible to participate and run in the next round of elections in 2015. Much like his pet project, the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology -- a coeducational graduate level institution aimed at preparing Saudis to compete in the global economy -- Abdullah's initiatives to empower Saudi women roiled conservative elements, who continue to view any change as inherently destructive. But one of the keys to the longevity of Al Saud has been their ability to balance the competing and conflicting interests of the various segments of Saudi society and to reach a general consensus. King Abdullah's reign however, was not controversy-free. The Saudi military's struggles against the vastly under-equipped Houthi rebels of northern Yemen in 2009 compelled some to question the preparedness of the army despite the billions of dollars spent on high tech weaponry and extensive training. The kingdom's dispatch of troops to neighboring Bahrain in 2011 to help quell months of unrest in the tiny monarchy was criticized by Bahrain's Shia majority -- not to mention Iran -- and also raised eyebrows in the international community. Intermittent clashes between Saudi security forces and the Shia majority in the kingdom's eastern province also created a sense of unease among some who considered the unrest a harbinger of the Arab Spring's arrival to the kingdom. Along the same lines, and although widely hailed in the West as a positive move, Saudi Arabia's participation in the U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS strongholds in Syria was not risk-free and seems to have only intensified the terror group's animosity for the Saudi government and leadership. The Saudis have apparently also agreed to train ""moderate"" Syrian fighters on Saudi soil -- an uncharacteristically forceful and public intensification of its involvement in the Syrian crisis. Despite what some considered his ""weak"" familial ties within the royal family, Abdullah's popularity among Saudis seemed to have been rooted in his realization that the monarch's most important base of support going forward must be the Saudi populace at large. It is noteworthy that even some of the Saudi government's harshest critics both inside and outside the kingdom seldom blamed Abdullah personally for what they considered to be the kingdom's shortcomings. Although some maintain that the persona of the wise yet humble patriarch was carefully constructed, Abdullah's affable demeanor and seemingly genuine concern for the well-being of average Saudis endeared him to many. Most Saudis will remember him fondly. As for the new king, Salman, it is instructive to remember that some in the international community also expressed trepidation about King Abdullah before he ascended the throne. He was perceived by some as more conservative and less pro-Western than his predecessor, Fahd. Some thought that these leanings would manifest themselves in a more ""pan-Arab"" stance and a less amenable posture towards the West, and especially the US. Those fears were largely unfounded. While there is little doubt that the Syrian crisis, the aftermath of the Arab Spring and nuclear negotiations with Iran have created what seemed at times to be a serious rift in Saudi-U.S. relations, it is highly debatable that it was King Abdullah alone whose views on these issues differed from those of the U.S. These still-unresolved crises and impasses will likely continue to be sticking points under King Salman. King Salman will likely shuffle some top government positions around, and his style might be a little different than Abdullah's. At some point, he will likely try to put his own stamp on the throne. That, however, is not likely to be by changing the nature of Saudi-U.S. relations in any fundamental way. Some have argued that the secret to the longevity of the Saudi royal family is its careful attention to three constants: Islam, oil and its relations with the U.S. Salman is not likely to lose sight of that. Under Salman, bilateral relations with the U.S. will likely continue to be ""special.""","Until his passing, King Abdullah remained committed to articulating and implementing a clear vision for Saudi Arabia .
Many remember the monarch for his foreign policy initiatives, including his plan for comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors .

"(CNN)As controversy continues over underinflated footballs used in Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick insisted Saturday that the Patriots organization had done nothing wrong. The coach of the Super Bowl-bound Patriots also described simulations the organization conducted that suggest cold weather may cause the air pressure in footballs to drop. ""We feel like we followed the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations, in our procedures and in the way we handle every game that we competitively play in as it relates to this matter,"" Belichick said at a news conference called on short notice. ""We try to do everything right. We err on the side of caution."" On Friday, the NFL said the footballs used by the Patriots on Sunday didn't meet league air pressure specifications in the first half of the  AFC title game, which the Patriots won 45-7. A ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage. The team conducted game-day simulations to find out what might have happened, Belichick told reporters. He said the balls' were inflated to 12.5 pounds per square inch in a controlled, indoor environment. Regulation pressure is 12.5-13.5 per square inch. ""We found out once the footballs were on the field for an extended period of time, in other words, they were adjusted to the climatic conditions ... they were down approximately 1.5 pounds per square inch,"" he said. The balls were remeasured in a controlled environment, and the air pressure rose about half a pound per square inch, he said. ""The net of one and a half, back to a half, is approximately one pound per square inch"" of lower air pressure, Belichick said. ""Once the balls reached its equilibrium state, it was down to 11.5,"" he said. Belichick compared the situation to starting a car on a cold morning and finding a dashboard light showing low tire pressure. When the car warms up after being driven a few minutes, the tire pressure light goes out, he said. Belichick also said losing a pound of air pressure in a football is hardly noticeable and that the feel of the ball is more important. ""When I feel a football, I can tell the difference between slippery and tacky,"" the coach said. ""I can tell you from handling all the footballs over the last week that I can't tell the difference if there's a one pound difference or a half a pound difference in any of the footballs,"" he said. Eleven of the 12 game balls the Patriots provided for the AFC title game were underinflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each, ESPN reported. Temperatures were in the 50s for the game played in Massachusetts. On Friday, the league confirmed that the Patriots used underinflated balls. ""While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were underinflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated,"" an NFL statement said. The statement said the NFL wants to know ""specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action. We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence."" Internet reacts to Brady's news conference . Forty interviews have been conducted, the NFL said, but it didn't say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback Tom Brady or Belichick. Brady, the central figure in the controversy, said Thursday that nobody from the NFL had talked to him. He and the coach said they don't know how the balls became underinflated. Brady and Belichick have taken fire from NFL icons. Speaking Thursday morning on CNN affiliate KTCK Sports Radio, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said, ""It's obvious Tom Brady had something to do with this. For the balls to have been deflated, that doesn't happen until the quarterback wants that to happen, I can assure you of that."" Hall of Fame coach John Madden told The Sports Xchange he believed Belichick was clueless about the ball pressure, but ""I can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but I can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy."" Some people are suspicious of the Patriots because of a 2007 cheating incident, called Spygate, in which the team stole defensive signals from the New York Jets. Belichick was fined $500,000, and the NFL took away a first-round draft pick. Roxanne Jones, a founder of ESPN The Magazine, wrote in a CNN opinion piece that the NFL should go ahead and disqualify the Patriots from the Super Bowl, strip the team of its AFC title and suspend and fine Belichick and perhaps Brady. At the end of the Saturday news conference, Belichick said he's tired of talking about the subject as he prepares to face the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl on February 1. ""I'm not a scientist, I'm not an expert on footballs, I'm not an expert in football measurements. I just telling you what I know,"" he said. ""This is the end of this subject for me for a long time."" What the heck is Deflategate? NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Pash and Ted Wells of the law firm Paul, Weiss are leading the NFL's investigation, the statement said. Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm, has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. The investigation started ""promptly on Sunday night,"" the statement said, "" and so far has included 40 interviews with ""Patriots personnel, game officials, and third parties with relevant information and expertise."" The inquiry started after Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson intercepted a Brady pass in the first half. The Patriots beat the Colts 45-7. According to Newsday, he took the ball to his team's equipment staff, who then informed head coach Chuck Pagano, who told general manager Ryan Grigson, who told NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who told the officials on the field. However, on Thursday at Pro Bowl practice, Jackson said he didn't say he thought the ball was flat. ""I made a great play on a great player, and I wanted to keep it as a souvenir,"" Jackson said in an interview with CNN affiliate KNXV. ""So I handed it off. ""The next thing I know I'm in the middle of Deflategate, so I don't know how that happened, and I was just doing my job, and I seem to be in the middle of everything. But I've got a ton of respect for that organization, New England. They outright beat us hands down, and that's pretty much all I can say about it.""

"(CNN)The scene is like something from a horror movie. Saturday, a known supporter of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria posted a video online of one of two Japanese hostages holding up what looks like a picture of his beheaded compatriot. The video follows one released earlier in the week featuring a militant threatening to kill the two Japanese citizens if a $200 million ransom wasn't paid within 72 hours. They are the kind of images many Japanese hoped they would not have to deal with. After all, Japan is currently barred by its ""peace constitution"" from engaging in offensive military action. Yet despite this, ISIS has apparently decided that Japan is an adversary. This is likely in part because Japan is a close ally of the United States, one that also has a strong interest in the stability of the Middle East. Moreover, during his recent visit to Israel, Jordan and Egypt, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged $200 million in non-military aid to nations dealing with ISIS. But whatever ISIS's intentions, Japan's non-combat role in world affairs hasn't stopped it from being a victim of terrorism in the post-September 11 era. In 2003, for example, two diplomats were killed in a terrorist ambush in Iraq, and several citizens were taken hostage in Iraq in 2004 and 2005. In 2012, a veteran journalist was killed in Syria, while in January 2013, nine Japanese citizens were killed in the Algerian hostage crisis. Still, this latest hostage crisis has been particularly attention-grabbing for many Japanese for two reasons. The first and most obvious is the fact that there was such vivid notice given -- the huge ransom demand with a 72-hour ultimatum -- followed by the disturbing images Saturday. But the hostage-taking has also prompted an interesting debate over the story behind why journalist Kenji Goto and self-styled military contractor Haruna Yukawa were in Syria. The Japanese public obviously hoped for the safe return of our two citizens, but most did not believe the government should pay the ransom. And there was also particular sympathy for Goto, who is not only recognized for his journalism, but who was apparently captured after going to the region to try to rescue Yukawa. But there have also been questions about why nothing was done sooner when the two had been missing for months, and also why they were in such a dangerous part of the world in the first place. Many Japanese believe the two bear some responsibility for traveling to the region despite public warnings by the Japanese government about the risks of citizens traveling there. Looking ahead, the hostage-taking has left many wondering what the impact will be on Japan's current efforts to upgrade its security policies and processes. The crisis will be seen as underscoring the impact of instability thousands of miles from its shores, and therefore the need for Japan to adopt a sharper, more proactive security posture even beyond East Asia. More specifically, one of the 15 scenarios presented by the Japanese government in its push toward a more proactive defense posture was allowing the use of weapons in overseas rescue missions of Japanese citizens. The development of this specific scenario reflects the lessons of the 2013 Algeria crisis, and the fact that under current laws, only aircraft, vehicles, and vessels are allowed for transportation. If these changes are introduced, the Japanese government would be able to dispatch its Japan Self-Defense Force for armed rescue operations (upon approval from the country involved). Certainly, given the security challenges that Japan faces, both within Asia -- in the form of territorial issues with China and with an unpredictable North Korea -- and further afield, it seems essential that Japan sharpens and strengthens its defense posture and plays a more proactive international role. To make this possible, Japan will have to do a number of things. First, the government will have to learn how to better execute its crisis management efforts using new assets such as the recently-formed National Security Council. Second, the government needs to get more creative in its efforts to enhance its international coordination and intelligence capabilities -- and ultimately defense assets -- to strengthen its security capacity. In addition, Japan needs to place greater priority on realigning its forces to meet the evolving challenges it faces. And finally, Tokyo must focus more on promoting greater awareness of terrorist groups such as ISIS, and the very real and direct threat they could pose to the country. Achieving all this will be challenging and will require investing significant political and bureaucratic capital. And while Prime Minister Abe's party has just won a resounding victory in a snap election, Japan is also dealing with an aging population and stagnant economy, so it is unclear how much in terms of energy and resources the government will have to spend on refocusing the country's security posture. But as much as anything, the debate over security -- and this week's tragic hostage situation -- are a reminder that Japan may increasingly find itself and its citizens in the firing line. A more assertive policy will expose Japan to more conflict and heighten its exposure to terrorism -- no small shift to handle in a remarkably safe country that for decades has turned its back on military conflict. How the government deals with this challenge -- and, more immediately, the aftermath of this week's tragedy -- will shape the direction of Japan's national security, and its ability to protect this country's citizens.​ .","An ISIS supporter's video suggests a Japanese hostage has been killed .

"Tokyo (CNN)Fighting back tears, Junko Ishido stood before dozens of television cameras, just hours before an apparent ISIS deadline to execute her son, Kenji Goto -- one of two Japanese hostages who appeared in a shocking propaganda video days before. One of the first statements she made, before making a direct plea to ISIS to spare her son's life, was an apology to the Japanese people. ""Thank you for your great kindness and I apologize for the tremendous inconvenience and trouble that my son has caused,"" she said. The plea came just before a 72-hour deadline for a $200 million ransom set in the video was due to expire. The Japanese government appears not to have given into the demand, and a day later, her son appeared again, this time holding a photo that purported to show the decapitated body of his compatriot, Haruna Yukawa. Now, the jihadist group is demanding the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a female terrorist being held in Jordan, in exchange for Goto's life. Ishido's public apology is understandable in the context of Japanese society, says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University's Tokyo campus. ""In Japan when you inconvenience people, it's important to respect them and ask for forgiveness,"" Kingston says. Ishido conveyed several times how badly she feels about her son's capture causing trouble for the Japanese government and alarm for its people. To her, it doesn't matter that her son was likely trying to rescue his friend and fellow hostage Haruna Yukawa. It doesn't matter than he has been praised by friends, colleagues, and strangers for reporting sensitively from war zones like Syria with strong, respectful determination. If she were to say such things publicly in Japan, she could be perceived as a selfish individual who touts the righteousness of her son. Because of this, Ishido -- a desperate mother, with a son in imminent danger of brutal murder at the hands of a militant jihadist group -- apologized to her country ""from the bottom of my heart."" And then begged for help. ""I plead to the Japanese government to save Kenji's life,"" Ishido said. ""To all members of ISIS, Kenji is not the enemy of ISIS. Please release him"" Kingston says public sympathy for the two hostages is mixed, partly because of their vastly different backgrounds. ""There's a distinction in the public between Goto and Yukawa,"" Kingston told CNN, ahead of the news of Yukawa's apparent murder. ""There is a great deal of respect for the journalist (Goto) and what he's done and his experience. Yukawa is looked at as a naïve adventurer who put himself in harm's way. So many are asking why should it be the government and the taxpayer's problem."" In 2004, three young Japanese hostages were released by militants in Iraq. Instead of being welcomed home, they were shunned for ""causing trouble"" for Japan. The former hostages, including one who was in Iraq helping children before her capture, were even billed by the government for their airfare. ""They got the frostiest unwelcome you can imagine. It was essentially government-encouraged bullying,"" Kingston says -- adding the trauma of their return was in some ways worse than their capture. In the previous hostage crisis, under Japan's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi during the Iraq war, language like ""self responsibility"" and ""go at your own risk"" was engraved into the Japanese psyche. For most Japanese citizens, areas of the Middle East ravaged by conflict are perceived as distant, dangerous places -- the opposite of the safety and calm that permeates Japanese society. Many in Japan don't understand why anyone would leave the island nation and travel to such hostile regions, where they face potential capture by terror groups like ISIS. Therefore, many find it difficult to sympathize with those who choose to go. Goto has received more sympathy because the Japanese media has widely reported on his commitment to telling the stories of suffering women and children. According to his own online posts, Yukawa was a troubled man, and as such he has received far less sympathy back home in Japan. He lost his wife to cancer, and then his home and business to bankruptcy. At one point, he attempted suicide and took a traditionally female name. ""On the outside I look normal,"" he wrote in one post. ""But inside I'm mentally ill."" It seems he went to the Middle East looking for a fresh start and wanted to be a private security contractor -- even though he had no experience. ""He's seen as irresponsible,"" Kingston says. Kingston adds this latest incident has the potential to change the way Japanese society feels about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's approach of ""proactive pacifism."" The ISIS video was released just two days after Abe was in the Middle East pledging $200 million in humanitarian aid to the coalition against ISIS -- a commitment the Japanese government insists it will honor, no matter what happens to the hostages. However the public might feel about the two men who they watched kneel in the desert on their computers and TV screens, there is no doubt that the sight of their countrymen enduring capture at the hands of ISIS has brought the situation in Iraq and Syria into sharp relief. ""Islamic extremism was something you watched on TV that happened to other people,"" Kingston says. ""And now it's happening to the Japanese.""","Hostage Kenji Goto's mother's decision to apologize for inconvenience caused by her son not unusual in Japan .

"(CNN)A picture and audio posted online Saturday purport to show that one of two Japanese hostages held by ISIS has been killed after a deadline for ransom passed. It also appears to relay the group's new demand for the other's freedom: a prisoner exchange. The static image, shown in a video file posted by a known ISIS supporter, shows surviving Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, alone, in handcuffs and dressed in orange, holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot Haruna Yukawa. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that the video is ""highly credible."" U.S. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity. Abe told Japanese broadcaster NHK that the killing was ""abominable"" and ""unforgivable,"" demanding the immediate release of Goto. NHK also reported comments from Yukawa's father. ""I still don't want to believe it,"" Shoichi Yukawa said, his face not shown in the report. ""If I can see him again, I'd like to hold him in my arms."" Saturday's posting came four days after an ISIS video demanded that the Japanese government pay $200 million within 72 hours for the two hostages' release. In the video released Saturday, the voice of a person claiming to be Goto says in English that Abe is to blame for Yukawa's death. ""You were given a deadline,"" he says. The voice then relays the apparent new demand from ISIS -- the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a woman arrested in Jordan in 2005 on suspicion of trying to take part in an attack in which others killed dozens at Jordanian hotels. ""They no longer want money, so you don't need to worry about funding terrorists,"" the voice says. ""They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi."" Jordan's King Abdullah II and Abe talked by phone on Saturday, according Jordanian state news agency Petra. The news agency did not detail what the two discussed beyond saying they ""reviewed the latest developments in the Middle East."" President Barack Obama condemned the purported murder of Yukawa by ISIS. In a White House statement, the President expressed condolences to the people of Japan and said the United States will work with its ally ""to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat"" ISIS. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron said Japan was right not to bow to the terrorists' demand for ransom. ""Britain strongly supports the firm stance Prime Minister Abe and his Government have taken and we will continue to work with Japan and other partners around the world to promote peace and to build a safer, more secure future for our citizens,"" Cameron said in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. is grieving with Yukawa's family. ""America has known this pain and horror ourselves, and we stand with Japan not just in sadness, but in solidarity and strength,"" he said in a statement. The U.S. National Security Council has seen Saturday's post, and the ""intelligence community is working to confirm its authenticity,"" NSC deputy spokesman Patrick Ventrell said. Opinion: Should nations pay ISIS ransom? Goto, 47, and Yukawa, 42, had gone to the Middle East for different reasons, the former an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in Iraq and Syria, and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war-torn region. They ended up in the hands of ISIS in recent months. On Tuesday, ISIS released a photo showing a black-clad masked man standing over Goto and Yukawa. The man made a demand: Either Japan pay $200 million -- the same amount that Abe has proposed to help those affected by the ISIS campaign, money his government says is for humanitarian rather than military purposes -- within 72 hours, or both men would die. Japanese officials estimated that ultimatum expired at 2:50 p.m. Friday, Tokyo time (12:50 a.m. ET Friday) with no immediate news on the hostages. Saturday's video is dissimilar in some ways to last year's ISIS videos announcing the executions of Western hostages. In five ISIS videos last year -- announcing the beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig -- a masked man is shown making a statement and sometimes putting a knife to the hostages' necks. The videos then transition to a still photo of the victims' severed heads. Al-Rishawi, the woman named in the allegedly proposed swap for Goto, was arrested by Jordanian authorities more than nine years ago. In November 2005, she said in a televised confession that she tried to take part in a string of terror attacks at Jordanian hotels that month that killed at least 57 people. She said her explosives failed to go off at a large wedding reception she was targeting, but that her husband's explosives did go off there. Japan isn't part of the international military coalition that, for months, has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Its post-World War II constitution forbids the use of Japanese military forces for any purpose besides self-defense. But Tokyo is allied with the United States and others leading this military campaign. And Japanese officials are offering help related to the ongoing unrest, though they insist those millions of dollars would go toward things like helping refugees, not killing ISIS militants. ISIS wasn't swayed. In Tuesday's video demanding ransom, a masked man holding a knife stood over the kneeling Goto and Yukawa, and said that Abe ""willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade"" against ISIS. A spokesman for the terror group, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK, wouldn't comment this week on whether his group has been in touch with the Japanese government, something that officials in Tokyo had said they were trying to arrange. He said he was aware that Japan said it wasn't involved militarily and called the Japanese infidels for fighting with the coalition. Japanese officials had said they would not yield to threats, but they would do everything they could to secure the hostages' safe release. Would that mean paying ransom? Officials weren't saying, at least directly, though Abe did call ISIS' demand ""unacceptable"" this week. Leading Japanese news organizations reported, citing unidentified government sources, that Goto's wife received an e-mail in December from someone demanding $8 million to $16 million for her husband's return. The government was trying to confirm if that e-mail came from ISIS, the reports said. If so, it could indicate the militant group was willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $200 million it had publicly demanded. Japanese citizens have been taken hostage before. Some have been released. But what Japan hasn't done is advertise whether it has ever paid ransom, lest it encourage more kidnappings in bad-guy fundraising schemes. It's not clear whether paying would have mattered. ISIS doesn't have representatives or go-betweens everywhere who could solicit such a deal. Nor does it have a reputation for morality and trustworthiness, so there's no telling if it would have taken the money and killed anyway. And the fact the group publicly asked for $200 million, a figure well above other ransom demands, raised the prospect that it was never serious about negotiating. While there are certainly geopolitical implications, this story is also about two men and the families they've left behind. As the apparent deadline approached, Goto's mother begged for her son's life. ""To all members of ISIS, Kenji is not the enemy of ISIS. Please release him,"" the mother, Junko Ishido, said Friday. ""... I have been just crying for the last three days, filled with sadness. Words fail to describe how I feel. Kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little. He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.'"" Her son had been a journalist for years, contributing to NHK and other Japanese news organizations. Goto covered big stories, hoping that by telling them, he could make a difference. That's what spurred him to go to ISIS-controlled territory in Syria, as he explained in an October video shot shortly before he ventured over the Turkish border. ""Syrian people suffering three years and a half. It's enough,"" said Goto, 47. ""So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."" Alaaeddin Al Zaim, who had worked with Goto in Syria previously, says he warned him not to enter the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. ""I tell him it's not safe for you,"" Al Zaim told CNN. But Goto went anyway. He said, according to Al Zaim, ""I am not American, I am not British. I'm Japanese. I can go."" The aims and activities of Yukawa, a 42-year-old unemployed widower, are murkier. He originally headed to the war-ravaged country early last year to gain combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company, said his friend Nobuo Kimoto. There, Yukawa met Goto, who gave him insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said. Goto also introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS, though both are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded. That plea spurred Yukawa to start raising money for this cause after returning to Japan, according to Kimoto. Kimoto said he advised his friend to focus on building up his private security company. Before he went back to Syria in July -- a month before his reported capture -- Yukawa told his friend about his clear sense of purpose when he was in that tumultuous Middle Eastern nation, despite all its violence and other travails. ""I felt a chill when he said, after returning home, (that) he felt in Syria he was really living a life,"" Kimoto said. ""He seems to have felt satisfaction being there and living together with the locals."" CNN's Ali Younes, Yoko Wakatsuki, Junko Ogura, Jethro Mullen and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","Japanese and U.S. authorities say the video seems authentic .

"(CNN)On Tuesday President Barack Obama will visit Saudi Arabia to pay his respects to the family of the now-deceased King Abdullah and to his successor, King Salman. This is a smart move by Obama and his foreign policy team. After all, the world's most absolute monarchy and the world's most powerful democracy have long been allies because they are bound together not, of course, by common values, but by common interests: The ready flow of reasonably priced oil and, more recently, the need to fight jihadist terrorist groups. However, a number of significant tensions have arisen in the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which a presidential visit likely will help to smooth over. The U.S.-Saudi marriage of convenience was first initiated on February 14, 1945, on a U.S. warship as it cruised in the Suez Canal. It was on the deck of the USS Quincy where President Franklin Delano Roosevelt first met with Saudi King Abdul Aziz to discuss areas of common interest. In the seven decades since that meeting, the relationship has largely worked well for both countries. During most of that time, Saudi Arabia provided economic support by ensuring a steady supply of oil and political backing for such American moves as the effort to repel Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and to seek a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The relationship took a nosedive after the revelation that 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudis. But oil has a wonderful way of soothing even the most troubled waters. Even though the United States is not as dependent on Saudi oil as many countries are, the Saudis can choose to raise or lower their oil production and those decisions have substantial effects on global oil prices. That's because Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil producer and it has around a fifth of the world's proven oil reserves. Today, as oil prices are tumbling to prices we haven't seen since the Great Recession of 2009, the Saudis have not lowered their production of oil, which is a great boon to the U.S. economy, even as the Saudis take a real hit resulting from their lower oil revenues. Many suspect that an equally important motive for the Saudi move is to weaken its arch-nemesis Iran, also a major oil producer. Despite Saudi oil policies that benefit American economic interests, the Saudi-American alliance--which was more like a melding of minds under the George W. Bush administration--has in recent years frayed. The Saudis remain irritated that Obama didn't follow through on his ""red line"" threat to take action against the Syrian regime of Bashar al Assad regime after it used chemical weapons on its population. Syria is an ally of Iran. The Saudis are also watching the continuing Iranian-American dialogue over Iran's nuclear program with great concern. They believe that the United States will get played by the Iranians and will allow them to retain some kind of nuclear capacity suitable for making a nuclear weapon. The Saudis are also still angry that the Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak was abandoned by the Obama administration during the ""Arab Spring"" of 2011. How would Washington react if the Saudi monarchy faced its own serious internal opposition: Would it too be thrown overboard? The Saudis have also long resented the largely uncritical embrace of Israel by both Republican and Democrat presidents. A common interest that overrides many of these differences is Syria, where both Washington and Riyadh are threatened by the rise of ISIS and also of al Qaeda's affiliate there, the Nusra (""Victory"") Front. As of early 2014 some 1,200 Saudis had traveled to Syria, of whom 220 had returned to the kingdom, according to a senior Saudi official. As a result, there was great concern in the kingdom about the potential ""blowback"" problem posed by these militants with battlefield experience acquired in Syria. That's why Saudi Arabia made it a crime in early 2014 for its citizens to travel to fight in overseas conflicts such as the Syrian war. That move coincided with the appointment of Prince Mohammed bin Nayef to head the powerful Saudi Ministry of the Interior. Nayef, who al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate tried to assassinate in 2009, has been an implacable foe of jihadist groups in the Arabian Peninsula, which has made him a vital ally of the United States. In many ways the real news about King Abdullah's death, which was long expected--as was the appointment of King Salman and his brother Muqrin as crown prince--was the appointment of the 55-year-old Nayef as deputy crown prince. This passes the torch of Saudi succession beyond the gerontocracy of King Abdullah's brothers to a new generation. It also strongly signals that the Saudi royal family values the firm stand on jihadist terrorist groups that is favored by Nayef and by Washington. That's why Saudi planes are now taking part in the U.S.-led coalition to bomb ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria. Saudi Arabia and the United States also have a strong interest in stabilizing the situation in Yemen. Houthi rebels have seized the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and the largely pro-American government of President Hadi stepped down last week. Both the Saudis and the Americans regard the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen as a real threat and they also are both watching with alarm as Houthi Shia rebels -- whom the Saudis view as stooges of Iran -- have taken over the Yemeni ministries that have played a key role in fighting al Qaeda. There will be much to discuss when the American President and his foreign policy team meet with the Saudi King and his advisers on Tuesday.","Obama to visit Riyadh to meet with King Salman, the new Saudi monarch .

""Unless you're Nicki/grab you by the wrist let's ski/so what's it gon be/put that s**t away Iggy/You don't wanna blow that rape whistle on me,"" Eminem raps. Those lyrics come on the heels of Em taking shots at singer Lana Del Rey in a freestyle, saying that he'd punch her ""right in the face twice"" like NFL player Ray Rice, who was suspended from the league after he was seen on video knocking his then-fiance unconscious. That kind of lyricism isn't surprising from Eminem, whose rhymes have been called homophobic in addition to misogynistic and violent. The rapper has explained in the past that the words he puts on wax are part of the ""personas that I create in my music."" To Iggy Azalea, that approach is not only offensive, but uninspired. ""I'm bored of the old men threatening young women as entertainment trend and much more interested in the young women getting $ trend,"" the Australian artist tweeted on Thursday. ""It's especially awkward because my 14 year old brother is the biggest eminem fan and now the artist he admired says he wants to rape me. nice!"" Besides, she adds, ""women in music have the bigger b***s anyhow."" Iggy is right that she's come up against a wave of criticism as her star power continues to rise. Last month, she went toe-to-toe with Snoop Dogg when the California rapper posted a series of mean-spirited photos and comments about the ""Fancy"" rapper, including calling her a ""f****ng c**t."" It wasn't until he had a chat with rapper T.I. that Snoop decided to fold on the feud, and offered Iggy an apology.","Eminem apparently tells Iggy Azalea to put away her ""rape whistle"" in a new song .

"Washington (CNN)Finally, something went right for the United States in the Middle East. Relief is palpable in Washington over the well-planned and seamlessly executed transfer of Saudi Arabia's throne to King Salman bin Abdulaziz, 79, following the death of his 90-year-old half brother King Abdullah. The kingdom, despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring, is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders, chaotic change and sectarian carnage. Never mind that the U.S. is the world's foremost democracy  and the transfer of power in Saudi Arabia was from one autocrat to the next. Saudi Arabia is crucial to U.S. goals on counter-terrorism, the campaign against ISIS and Al-Qaeda, the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy, as a counter-balance to Iran and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. In a sign of the kingdom's importance to the United States, President Barack Obama made hurried plans to call in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after his trip to India to pay his respects to Abdullah and his family and to meet with King Salman. Originally, Vice President Joe Biden was to have made the trip. The message from Washington is clearly : Long live the new king. The regal choreography in Riyadh is especially welcome to the White House as it contrasts with events just across the border in Yemen, another key ally where a US-backed government crucial to its anti-terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by Iran. James B. Smith, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 2009 and 2013, said there should be no concern in the administration that Salman's ascension will jeopardize U.S. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom. Lines of succession . ""We know Salman well, he was governor of Riyadh for the better part of 50 years, he is well known to the US government. I see no break in the U.S.-Saudi relationship,"" Smith said. Salman vowed just hours after the death of Abdullah, that the kingdom ""would continue adhering to the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the allies had a ""long history of cooperation. We don't have any indication that that cooperation will change."" Saudi watchers in Washington were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by Salman in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world. He named Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of scores of posssible candidates, as deputy crown prince, a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who have ruled the country since the 1950s, to a new generation. ""I think for the near term, continuity is going to be the centerpiece here,"" said Daniel Benjamin, a former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the State Department, now at Dartmouth College, told CNN. ""There is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line, he is a very close friend of the United States ... so I think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel."" Prince Mohammed, now behind the King's brother Prince Muqrin, 69,  in the line of succession, is a frequent visitor to the United States and has presided over Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism program. He narrowly escaped an assassination bid by Al-Qaeda in 2009. The succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that Salman has been in ill health himself, apparently having suffered a stroke. Tom Donilon, pointman for US relations with Saudi Arabia when he was Obama's National Security Advisor, praised Abdullah as a ""solid"" ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom. He also said that the late King's survivors had done a ""pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession, continuity of policy."" He told ""The Lead"" with CNN's Jake Tapper that Mohammad, known as MBN in the United States was ""a very, very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists."" Periods of tension . Though there is relief at the apparent stability in Riyadh, relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia in recent years have have often been troubled. There was a tense period a decade ago, after it emerged that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks originated from Saudi Arabia. Critics, including some in the U.S. government, faulted Saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons. The Saudi government has also balked at U.S. criticisms of its human rights record and political system. Questions about Iran . More recently, Saudi Arabia, the key Sunni power in the Middle East,  has not hesitated to make clear its concern about Obama's quest to improve relations with its mighty Shia foe Iran, with which it is fighting various proxy struggles. Saudi leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and Iran which built on the election of ""moderate"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 to launch an effort at rapprochment between Tehran and Washington. '""I think that the concern remains among the Saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense,"" said David Ottaway, an author on Saudi Arabia and senior scholar at the Wilson Center. Some analysts believe that the Saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and Iran -- which left the Islamic Republic with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium -- by looking to find its own nuclear capability -- perhaps with assistance from Pakistan. Saudi princes took to the op-ed pages of US newspapers in 2013 in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a ""dangerous gamble."" The Saudi government also made clear its deep anger with Obama's last-minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on Syria to punish the Bashar al-Assad regime's use of chemical weapons the same year. Saudi Arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the United States to begin training opposition fighters in Syria. Anger at Obama comments on the Arab Spring . The Saudi government also registered anger at the Obama administration's embrace of Arab Spring uprisings, which led to the ouster of allies like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Obama appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring Abdullah on Thursday as a ""steadfast and passionate"" believer in US-Saudi relations as a force for stability. ""As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions,"" Obama wrote. In recent years, the Obama administration has attempted to assuage Saudi fears. The US president made a visit to Riyadh last year, on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences. Saudi Arabian pilots, reportedly including one of Salman's sons, Prince Khaled, helped carry out the first air attacks on ISIS in Syria last year. Saudi Arabia also approved of Secretary of State John Kerry's exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep Israel and the Palestinians talking.  And White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that an underpinning of those efforts, an Arab Peace Plan framed by Abdullah would stand as his lasting memorial. Smith said that the relationship between Riyadh and Washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration. ""A key element of our relationship with the Saudis over the years has been transparency,  not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other,"" he said. ""When you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don't understand your negotiating position or don't understand how you are going to enforce an agreement. they are left to their own conclusions. ""I think we are doing a lot better at that.""","US relieved at succession plan roll-out after King Abdullah's death .

"(CNN)The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as ""Jimmy Mack,"" has settled a lawsuit with Walmart over the auto accident that killed him and injured fellow comedian Tracy Morgan, McNair's family says. McNair's sister, Pamela McNair, said the amount agreed upon is confidential, but was satisfactory to all parties. ""There is no value, no dollar amount, on my brother's life at all,"" she said. ""But in terms of finances, it will assist the family a great deal to continue living life."" McNair was the father to 26-year-old Jamel and 19-year-old Danita and was the oldest of seven siblings he ""cared for greatly,"" Pamela said. ""There's nothing we can do to change what happened,"" Walmart said. ""Walmart and the McNair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement. Walmart continues to work with others involved in the accident and we will continue to do what's right."" Last June, a limo bus carrying Morgan, McNair and their companions was rear-ended by a Walmart truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. The crash killed McNair and left Morgan with a severe brain injury and their colleagues with other injuries. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board said the Walmart truck was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit, and that its driver was almost at his drive-time limit. In July, four parties filed suit against Walmart, stating in a complaint that ""the defendants' negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries."" Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on James' legacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help. ""My brother has done a lot for the community. He mentored the youth for the community, he worked at the homeless shelter. Little things that he's done are truly missed,"" McNair said. ""He was a great comedian, but he was a good family person first and foremost. He loved life and wanted others to love life as well. He was a humanitarian."" The mayor of McNair's hometown, Peekskill, New York, has named June 12 in his honor, she said. Tracy Morgan's lawyer told CNN in November that he was still recovering from the car accident that left him with a ""severe brain injury"" and is fighting to return to the person he once was. McNair said her family has not been in contact with the Morgan family. ""It's kind of heartbreaking,"" McNair said. ""I understand he has his own medical situation, I want the best for him, I'm praying for his recovery, but I felt that someone could have reached out to the family. ... My brother and Tracy had a very long relationship as friends and it is heartbreaking we haven't heard from anyone.""

"The Sewol ferry disaster appears to have taken another life -- this time of the man whom some blamed for the sinking. Yoo Byung Eun, the subject of an intense, nationwide manhunt who went missing after the South Korean ferry sank in April, was declared dead, police said Tuesday. Yoo's body was found decomposing in a plum field by a farmer on June 12. Police used DNA and fingerprints to positively identify him. Prosecutors believe Yoo, 73, and his sons controlled the shipping company that operated the deadly ferry. The ferry that capsized, killed 294 people aboard, including hundreds of high school students who were on a field trip. More than three months after the incident, divers are still searching for bodies, with 10 people missing. Yoo, through his representatives, vehemently denied any connection to the Chonghaejin Marine Company in late April. His defenders, including members of his religious group, maintained that Yoo, a businessman and religious figure, was made into a scapegoat for the tragedy. Much of the blame has fallen on Sewol's operators who were accused of prioritizing profits over safety in an investigator's interim report this month. The report found that Sewol had carried double the amount of cargo allowed and that the heavy load had not been properly secured. They also found that the vessel had been licensed on falsified documents. Manhunt . For months following the sinking, Yoo defied summons to report to the prosecutor's office for questioning. Yoo was wanted for questioning with an investigation into alleged funds embezzlement, tax evasion and other irregularities that prosecutors say could have contributed to the sinking. Wanted posters including possible disguises for Yoo popped up. Even South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye weighed in, accusing Yoo's family of ""mocking the law and causing public rage."" South Korea's most wanted man . With nearly 8,000 police officers dispatched on the case, the inability to find the septuagenarian became another source of controversy. But the search ended Tuesday when police announced Yoo's death. His body, they said, was next to an empty bottle of squalene (a type of fish oil), three empty bottles of alcohol, reading glasses, and a handwritten book titled ""Dreamy Love."" The man appeared to be wearing a jacket and his shoes were set next to him. The cause of death is still under investigation, said Woo Hyung-Ho, the police chief of Suncheon, the city where Yoo's body had been found. Police could not determine when he had died. The body was decomposed. The location of the body was near his summer home in the southern end of Korea. Yoo's history . Little was known about Yoo, who was called the ""millionaire without a face"" because of his reluctance to appear in public. Yoo was a religious figure of Gu Won Pa (which translates to ""salvation group""), also known as the Evangelical Baptist Church, which had been founded by his father-in-law. The church had decried the investigation into Yoo and the group as religious persecution. Its spokesman could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Yoo also branched into an artistic career, known by an alter ego called, Ahae, a photographer who won international acclaim. The firm representing Ahae Press also did not have any comment Tuesday. Yoo had four sons and daughters; the whereabouts of three of the four are unknown. Yoo's wife, Kwon Yun-Ja is under arrest in South Korea, according to Yonhap.","Yoo Byung-eun has been missing for months .

"(CNN) -- At first glance, they could almost pass for masterpieces by Monet or Renoir. But these impressionist-style paintings -- which are changing hands for thousands of dollars -- were painted by a five-year-old girl who is unable to speak. Meet Iris Halmshaw, an autistic child from Leicestershire, UK, who has been producing these striking artworks since she was three. She has autism, a condition that has made her unable to communicate except through the medium of art. ""From the first painting, she filled the paper with color and it wasn't random -- it was considered and thought out,"" says her mother, Arabella Carter-Johnson. ""She was so excited and happy I knew that we had found a key into her world and a way of interacting with her."" Autism changed everything . The journey started when Iris was two. Carter-Johnson and her husband, Peter-Jon Halmshaw, realized that something was wrong: she had not picked up any words, and rarely made eye contact. ""We researched it ourselves,"" her mother recalls, ""but as parents, you are always hoping that there was some other explanation."" Iris was officially diagnosed as a child with autism. According to Carter-Johnson, the doctor was ""depressing"" because he told them that very few therapies worked. Not to be deterred, the couple embarked on ""long nights of research"", which led them to the idea of art therapy. The little girl picked up painting techniques astonishingly quickly, and before long was spending much time at work on her canvases. Remarkably for a child of her age, her sessions involved about two hours of consistent concentration. How one girl's talent captured the world . To begin with, Carter-Johnson, who is a photographer herself, started sharing her daughter's paintings on Facebook. The overwhelming response from her friends convinced her that she hadn't been blinded by mother's pride. Iris was special. Fast forward two years, and Iris' paintings are in high demand, and are starting to be worth a lot of money. Due to the high level of demand for Iris' art, her mother has set up a website to sell both originals and prints. It was a runaway success, quickly attracting over a million pageviews from more than 200 countries. ""All profits from the originals go into Iris's savings account,"" says Carter-Johnson. ""We also sell cards and prints, and the profits from those go towards her speech therapy, occupational therapy, music and yoga."" The money generated from sales of the prints has had profoundly beneficial effects on Iris' day-to-day life. According to Carter-Johnson, systems like Gemiini speech therapy, for instance, have made an immeasurable difference to her ability to communicate. ""She has a tendency to drift off into her own world, if you let her,"" says Carter-Johnson. ""So by using her interests, we manage to engage her, and she changes into a giggly little girl dancing around the house. ""Her speech isn't at a stage yet where we can have conversations, so it's hard to tell exactly how much she is understanding everything that has happened surrounding her art. ""We have shielded her from a lot of it. She hasn't been to TV studios or done interviews."" Extraordinary artworks . Many of Iris' paintings show an astonishingly mature interpretation of natural scenes, including waterfalls, fields and skies. Her abstracts often depict particular moods or experiences after which they are titled, like Patience, Separation, and Immersion. All are united by a distinctively contemplative and often lightly melancholy atmosphere, as well as a mysterious sense of depth. This growing body of work has led to Iris being widely accepted as a savant. According to Professor Allan Snyder from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University, people like Iris are able to unlock the hidden wells of potential that lie in all of us, but are rarely accessed. ""I think it's possible for a perfectly normal person to have access to these abilities,"" he says. ""[But] savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them.""

"The Koch brothers -- Charles and David -- have committed to spending $125 million to buy elections for the House and Senate this cycle. What are they hoping to get for that hefty sum? Likely, the same self-serving agenda items they have been after for more than 30 years: Tax cuts for the wealthy and big oil, eliminating the minimum wage, slashing Medicare and dismantling Social Security. You know, the usual agenda of the extreme, tea party candidates their money and organizations support. Recently, The New York Times reported on new documents we uncovered detailing the Kochs' early political pursuits, including David Koch's 1980 Libertarian Party campaign for vice president. It was a role he sought in an attempt to skirt campaign finance laws that prevented the Kochs from otherwise pouring unlimited amounts of their fortune into their attempt to defeat revered Republican icon Ronald Reagan. The David Koch/Ed Clark 1980 campaign platform was strikingly extreme. They ran to the far right of Reagan, attacking him for representing ""no change whatsoever from Jimmy Carter and the Democrats."" They called Social Security ""the most serious threat to the future stability of our society next to the threat of nuclear war."" They wanted to abolish all minimum wage laws, while giving tax breaks to the rich and big oil. All in a self-serving attempt to drive the policy discourse further toward their extreme ideals to benefit their own bottom line. Well, it's now more than 30 years later, and the Koch agenda hasn't budged. Only now, instead of running a fringe party, they're driving the Republican Party. The organizations the Koch brothers fund, such as Americans for Prosperity, and the radically conservative politicians they support frequently espouse the same positions as the 1980 Libertarian ticket. To understand their priorities, look no further than their body of work. AFP has repeatedly championed tax breaks for big oil companies, such as the Koch brothers' piggy bank -- Koch Industries -- and railed against standards to keep our air safe to breathe and our water safe to drink. They've played cheerleader for Rep. Paul Ryan's extreme budget plans that would turn Medicare into a voucher program and cut taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. They've poured money into statewide elections in Wisconsin and North Carolina to remake the statehouses in their mold -- then lauded their politicians as they gutted education and attacked women's rights. They worked to end a celebrated school integration program in Wake County, North Carolina, and fought to stop a fix aimed at helping Louisiana homeowners in high-risk flood zones avoid paying more for flood insurance. This is the Koch vision of America, and their influence on lawmakers is undeniable. AFP keeps a scorecard of what it considers ""key votes"" so Republicans in Congress can make sure not to upset these extreme, secretive billionaires and their war chest. As a result, the Republican establishment is becoming more and more extreme on key issues, cowering in the shadow of their power. AFP-backed candidates have supported slashing Medicare and giving more tax breaks to the richest Americans while opposing a raise for working families. Some have even called for eliminating the federal minimum wage altogether. Voters deserve to know the truth behind the Kochs' self-serving agenda and just what they stand for. So, at American Bridge, we've launched RealKochFacts.com, a new research and rapid response resource to highlight the truth about the Koch agenda and what it means for working families in states around the country. The Kochs may see their boundless political spending as free speech. But when you look at today's Republican candidates, their speech isn't free. It's bought and paid for by secretive billionaires Charles and David Koch in a longstanding effort to enrich themselves.

"(CNN)It's winter after all. For large swaths of the Northeast, Saturday arrived with a messy mix of sleet, snow and rain -- with parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey receiving as much as 8 inches of snow before the storm set its sights on New England. An estimated 40 million people got their first real glimpse of winter: Weather advisories or warnings were in place from the Appalachians of West Virginia to Maine. By Saturday afternoon, about 27 million people were still under a winter weather advisory or warning. Rain pelted the coast. Snow fell on inland areas. It wasn't your typical bucolic winter wonderland. Coming on a weekend, the sloshy weather will inconvenience many. But a major snowstorm on track to hit the Northeast region Monday night into Tuesday could wreak havoc during the workweek. The nation's capital was under a winter weather advisory, with snow expected in the western suburbs and brief snowfall downtown turning into a mix of rain and snow. In Philadelphia, a winter weather advisory was in effect, with 2 to 4 inches of snow in the city but as much as 8 inches farther west. The township of Coolbaugh, Pennsylvania, got 9 inches of snow; the village of Huffs Church  received 8 inches. Crews from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and other agencies spent two nights salting roads to avoid a repeat of last Sunday, when wet weather caused hundreds of accidents and parts of major highways and bridges were forced to close, CNN affiliate KYW reported. ""They've been out through the duration of this storm,"" spokesman Brad Rudolph told the station. ""We have 339 trucks in the five-county region and they'll be out for the duration."" The New York area also awoke to a winter weather advisory, with 2 to 5 inches of snow in the city followed by rain but a higher amount in interior New Jersey, the Lower Hudson Valley and Southern Connecticut. Sleet and freezing rain were mixed in at times. Highland Lakes, New Jersey, recorded 9 inches of snow. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged drivers in the Hudson Valley, New York City and Long Island to exercise caution. The state was dispatching some 870 plows and 1,800 operators from the transportation department throughout the region, Cuomo said in a statement. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey urged air and bus travelers to check with carriers before heading out. The authority, which operates the three major airports in the area, reported that it had more than 200 pieces of snow equipment at airports, including melter machines capable of liquifying 500 tons of snow an hour and plows to clear snow at 40 mph. In New England, Boston also was under winter weather warnings, with snowfall expected to reach as much as 7 inches. Between 6 and 12 inches of snow could fall in parts of Massachusetts up through Maine. A wintry mix on the freezing line separating the rain and snow bands could make driving conditions treacherous. Burlington, Connecticut, received 8 inches; Ludlow, Massachusetts, recorded 6 inches. But that's not all. By Sunday, a strong storm system originating in Alberta, Canada, will have moved down to the upper Midwest, leaving between 2 and 4 inches of snow across Minnesota and Wisconsin before heading east. That will mean new snowfall is likely Sunday night into Monday in Philadelphia and New York, with the nation's capital getting a mix of rain and snow. The start of the work week could get ugly. The major storm on track to hit the Northeast starting Monday night could heap the heaviest snowfall from coastal New Jersey and New York City, to Boston and coastal Maine. Blizzard conditions are possible in New England on Tuesday, with forecast models showing more than two feet of snow in Boston and as much as a foot in New York.","Messy mix of sleet, snow and rain hit much of the Northeast .

"(CNN)The new Greek government has plenty of challenges ahead of it: A towering debt, chronic unemployment and relations with the rest of Europe. But it also has an urgent security problem. Greece has become an unwitting crossroads -- both for jihadists trying to reach Iraq and Syria from Europe, and for fighters returning home from the Middle East. Greece's long land and maritime boundaries, its proximity to Turkey, the explosion of illegal migration from Syria and the country's dire financial situation make it an inviting hub for jihadist groups, according to multiple counterterrorism sources. One source close to the Greek intelligence services told CNN there may be some 200 people in the country with links to jihadist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the al Nusra Front -- the two groups that most Europeans join. Leftist leader plans his next move after elections in Greece . Among recent cases with a Greek connection: . -- Belgian officials believe that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a prominent Belgian jihadist within ISIS, may have traveled from Syria to Greece and then communicated by phone with the terrorist cell recently broken up by Belgian police. -- Earlier this month, three young Belgians were arrested at Charleroi airport as they prepared to fly to Greece. The Belgian Prosecutor's Office says they have been charged with participation in a terror group. -- On January 17, Greek police arrested a 33-year old Algerian man whose extradition was sought by Belgium in connection with last week's raids. The man, who has not been named, has protested his innocence. -- Last year, two French jihadists were arrested after using Greek soil to return home. One was arrested after passing through Italy.  One was Ibrahim Boudina, a 23-year-old French national born in Algiers. Greek border guards had found in his possession a USB stick with instructions for how to make homemade bombs. Europe faces 'greatest terror threat ever' They did not detain him, but tipped off French investigators, who later found bomb-making equipment and devices in his apartment near Cannes. Boudina has denied terror charges and awaits trial. What's unknown is how many jihadists are traveling individually -- in either direction -- and how many are using support networks. ""Greece is not a target, just a gateway into Europe and a stop on the fighters' return home,"" said the source close to Greek intelligence. ""The large immigrant communities is Greece, and particularly in Athens, are in a position to provide jihadists and others associated with such groups with housing and generally help them remain anonymous,"" the source said. In 2011, Greek authorities detained nearly 50,000 illegal migrants from Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to police figures. One analyst who has studied jihadist travel patterns says there are indications that militants are setting up logistical, recruitment and financial cells in Greece, in part to facilitate the travel of a growing number of would-be fighters traveling from Kosovo and Albania. ISIS has produced several propaganda videos featuring Kosovars appealing to their countrymen to join them, and the Kosovo authorities believe some 200 individuals have left to wage jihad in Iraq and Syria. But it's not just the Balkans that's providing the travelers. ""We estimate that about 2,000 people have used Greece in the last two years or so, mainly arriving by boat from Italy, as a stop to an onward journey,"" the source close to the intelligence services told CNN. ""Given the number of people who have left Europe for Syria and the Middle East we don't regard this number as very high. But there is a good chance that it is much greater than we know at this point,"" he added. Coming in the other direction, the number of migrants trying to reach Europe illegally has soared since Syria's implosion, especially by sea. Many head to Greece and Italy on rust-buckets that trawl the Turkish coast seeking out the desperate. John M. Nomikos, director of the Research Institute for European and American Studies in Athens, says many migrants have their documents taken by human traffickers and then seek political asylum when they get to Greece. Nomikos says a few of those who arrive in Greece subsequently marry Greek women and receive Greek ID cards or passports, allowing them to travel through much of the European Union. Figures from the European Union's border agency, Frontex, show that 270,000 people tried to enter Europe illegally in 2014 -- with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern Mediterranean. Whether ISIS or other groups are already exploiting this influx to infiltrate members into Europe is one of the worrying unknowns to European officials. The Greek Interior Ministry acknowledges it has little idea of the number of people living illegally in Greece. Nomikos and others say the Greek authorities' ability to track asylum-seekers and would-be jihadists has been hard hit by six years of recession -- a time in which budgets have been cut and senior members of the intelligence communities have lost their jobs or retired early. Combined with political appointments in the security services, and a lack of terrorism specialists, Nomikos says this has led to a damaging ""expertise deficit"" at a time when threats are multiplying. It doesn't help that Greek police are preoccupied with the remnants of the far-left November 17 group that occasionally launches sabotage attacks and carries out assassinations. Nomikos also says there is inadequate coordination between the National Intelligence Service, the police and other agencies -- and that Greece badly needs help from the U.S. or European government to reform its security services. ""The country urgently needs a Department of Homeland Security in order to coordinate the intelligence-sharing among the Greek intelligence service (NIS-EYP), anti-terrorism squad intelligence unit"" as well as police, coastguard and military intelligence, Nomikos says. The Balkan states to the north of Greece have become a major source of weapons to jihadist cells elsewhere in Europe, and some analysts believe that militant groups in the Middle East may also be tapping into this illicit arms bazaar. In November, Albanian police arrested eight people in the town of Shijak and seized guns and ammunition. Prosecutors were quoted in Albanian media as saying the weapons were destined for Syria or Iraq. In the wake of the Paris attacks this month, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, promised better intelligence sharing across the EU and with affected Arab states to tackle terrorism. An EU summit on February 12 will address the issue, to be followed by a similar gathering in Washington the following week. Whatever the Syriza government's disagreements with its partners on economic policy, it will likely welcome a more coordinated approach on a danger it is unable to confront alone.

"(CNN)The demands by terrorists for ransoms in return for kidnapped hostages continues and grows -- and it is a brave (some would say heartless) government that chooses non-payment over the lives of its citizens. This week's $200 million demand in return for the lives of two Japanese citizens perhaps represents a change of tactics from ISIS -- the group that now rules over large parts of Syria and Iraq -- as they realize that, with the notable exceptions of the U.S. and the UK, the willingness of Western nations to resist making some form of payment in the face of YouTube videos of their citizens begging for their lives is weak. Is an unwavering resistance towards ransom payments a constructive position to take? Is offering no hope of some form of negotiated settlement in the best interest of a nation's citizens? Or would it in fact make more sense to take a flexible approach that operates on a ""case-by-case"" basis, engages in negotiation, and considers all possible options including ransom? The arguments against payment are well-rehearsed and oft-repeated by those that attempt to hold the international line. Since 9/11 the attempt to starve terrorist organizations of financing has been a cornerstone of the global effort to counter these groups. Payment of ransoms to terrorist organizations for the safe return of citizens is thus entirely contrary to the blizzard of national and international laws and norms that have emerged. At a 2013 summit in Northern Ireland, world leaders noted that the ""international community has made significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations,"" but also drew attention to the substantial financial benefit being earned through ransom payments and the incentive this provided for further kidnappings.  Following the G8 Summit, and notwithstanding the fact that in 2009 the U.N. reminded Member States of their obligation to prevent the payment of ransoms to terrorists under Security Council Resolution 1904, the Security Council passed a further resolution in January 2014 calling upon Member States ""to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments."" Without doubt, paying ransoms encourages more kidnappings -- it is a self-perpetuating, self-reinforcing cycle. The U.S. administration argues that ""hostage-takers looking for ransoms distinguish between those governments that pay ransoms and those that do not ... and make a point of not taking hostages from those countries that refuse to make concessions."" Be that as it may (and proving a counter-factual is always highly subjective), the murder in 2009 of British citizen Edwin Dyer by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- whilst his fellow Swiss and German captives were freed following the reported payment of a substantial ransom -- shows that refusing to pay is risky. Furthermore, the procession of gruesome beheadings visited on American and British hostages by ISIS in 2014 suggests that, in the knowledge that the U.S. and UK will not pay ransoms, captured citizens from these two countries are far more likely to be murdered in the pursuit of propaganda. A willingness to negotiate . While paying ransoms increases the risk of further kidnappings, it also clearly increases the likelihood of a safe and successful outcome. Offering to consider ransom demands introduces a critical prerequisite for success -- namely, a willingness to negotiate. The secretive world of kidnap-for-ransom (KfR, in industry parlance) insurance provides a source of instructive insight. This industry bloomed following the kidnap, ransom, and death of the 20-month old baby son of U.S. aviator Charles Lindbergh. At the heart of the growth and success of this niche industry is its ability to respond to and engage with kidnappers, normally via intermediaries. Success is judged not only by the safe return of a captured individual but also by the ability to negotiate a price that is far removed from the opening ask. Knowing that ransom payments to designated terrorist groups are illegal, KfR specialists will quickly pass insured situations involving terrorist groups to government authorities -- and the outcomes are rarely as favorable as those that can be achieved via expert negotiation. Periodically the facts presented to policymakers change and policymakers must adapt. Such a moment for adaptation has arrived. Kidnap-for-ransom is an increasingly widely-used tool by terrorist groups. Nasser al-Wuhayshi, leader of Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is estimated to have earned $20 million from ransom between 2011 and 2013, asserts that ""kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil"" and ""a profitable trade and a precious treasure.""  In several recorded messages, al Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri has called for supporters worldwide to kidnap Westerners. Stomach-churning (and illegal, in most jurisdictions) as it may be to finance designated terrorists, in recent months, citizens of France, Germany, Denmark, and Italy have returned safely home. Citizens of the UK and the U.S. have not. The point blank refusal to pay ransoms is wrong-headed. A more nuanced approach that leaves all options, including payment, open for negotiation is much more likely to result in success.","ISIS has kidnapped more than a dozen Western citizens in recent years .

"(CNN)When a suicide bomber detonated his truck outside Forward Operating Base Marez in Iraq in 2009, it wasn't the first time that type of attack killing U.S. soldiers took place. But the bombing took a different and disturbing turn when investigators determined it was facilitated not by militants on the battlefields of Iraq but out of one man's home just north of the United States. According to the Department of Justice, this suicide operation, which killed five U.S. soldiers and several Iraqi citizens, was orchestrated from Edmonton, Canada, by Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, a 36-year-old accused of being member of a global terrorist recruiting cell that funneled foreign fighters into Iraq. Though 'Isa was arrested in Edmonton in 2011, where he has been detained ever since,  he was extradited to the United States on Friday. And on Saturday, in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, he entered a plea of not guilty to his alleged role in the gruesome attack. On April 10, 2009, a five-vehicle convoy of U.S. soldiers were exiting FOB Marez in Mosul. U.S. military personnel eyewitnesses described a dump truck coming under fire by Iraqi guards at on the road at the perimeter of the base. The truck managed to breach the checkpoint, passing four of the vehicles before detonating next to the fifth vehicle. The 60-foot-deep crater left at the blast site was about 50 yards outside of the base's entrance. The explosion killed five U.S. soldiers: Sgt. Edward Forrest Jr., PFC Bryce E. Gautier, Sgt. FC Bryan E. Hall, Cpl. Jason G. Pautsch and Staff Sgt. Gary L. Woods. Several Iraqi citizens were also killed. `Isa is charged not only with the murder of these five soldiers, but also with providing material support to terrorists, as well a conspiracy to commit murder of foreign nationals abroad. The last charge stems from a multiyear investigation by Canadian, Tunisian and U.S. law enforcement using wiretaps, email surveillance and other physical evidence that places 'Isa in an integral role in what is referred to as a ""facilitation network."" Law enforcement officials say 'Isa's role in the network included instructing prospective suicide bombers on leaving their homes without raising suspicion, figuring out the route they should take to enter Iraq and putting them in touch with Iraqi-based terrorists. In recorded phone and electronic communications with numerous co-conspirators, including would-be suicide bombers and facilitators based in Iraq, 'Isa often referred to carrying out terrorist attacks as getting ""married,"" as in marriage to 70 virgins or ""farming,"" because they ""plant metal and harvest metal and flesh,"" according to the Justice Department's criminal complaint. 'Isa is accused helping at least eight Tunisian foreign fighters cross into Libya, eventually making their way to Mosul, Iraq, via Syria to meet with his network of Iraqi-based facilitator contacts. The investigation, according to Justice officials, revealed that at least three of these foreign fighters carried out at least two suicide attacks. One of them was the FOB Marez attack. At least three other individuals listed as ""facilitators"" were arrested in Iraq by Department of Defense officials and subsequently debriefed by the FBI, but it is unclear whether they have or will face similar charges. Court documents show 'Isa regularly checking in with the foreign fighters to find out the status of their ""marriages"" -- and he even discussed his terrorist activities with his own family based in Iraq. They purport that he told his mother how effective that a sniper rife, or ""bride with a crown,"" would be in Baghdad against coalition forces. And that he urged his sister to ""learn about weapons and go attack the police and Americans."" In a news release announcing 'Isa's extradition from Canada, Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said, ""The families of these five Americans and all who have lost loved ones to act of terrorism should know that we will never cease seeking to hold terrorists accountable for their acts.""","Accused of orchestrating a deadly 2009 bombing in Iraq, Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa pleads not guilty in U.S. court .

"(CNN)Saturday's downhill at Kitzbühel is the jewel in the World Cup calendar, the winner meriting legendary status in the alpine annals. Like any budding skier, Daniel Albrecht had always dreamed of triumphing at the foot of Austria's Hahnenkamm mountain but instead, six years ago, he lay face down on the snow, out cold within meters of the finish line. Online footage of the crash -- memorable to everyone except Albrecht who cannot remember anything from the day before the incident to three weeks hence -- is not for the faint-hearted. At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined. On a training run with the finish line in sight, he approached the final jump. A minor error on his part -- exacerbated by the fact he was traveling at 140 kph (87 mph) -- saw his skis flap wildly out of control as he battled to regain his balance for 40 meters in the air before landing heavily on his back. Albrecht suffered a brain injury and a bruised lung, was airlifted to hospital and placed in a coma for three weeks to give both his brain and lung the best chance of recovery. ""It was a hard time,"" he recalls. ""You have to learn your name, your age, all this stuff."" His first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier. ""The last memory I have is from the day before. The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily. I knew that I was going to be fast in this race. Then, yeah, it was too fast!"" Albrecht is able to laugh as he retells the incident, in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the Kitzbühel course even after watching it back on a few occasions. To him, it is as though he is watching someone else's dramatic and sudden alpine downfall, and without emotion. ""If I watch myself in Kitzbühel then I feel like it wasn't me because I don't have any memory of him. I know that he was me, I see that it was me but, for me, it was not a person. I was out of my body."" In the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself. However, slowly but surely he got up to speed although he admits ""I have something [his brain] that doesn't work so good like before. So I'm always in recovery."" Today, he gets tired quicker and his temper frays more readily than prior to the accident. But remarkably, it did not end his career, rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at Lake Louise, Canada in November 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes. Amazingly, it was just a week after being released from the neurological unit that cared for him that he was back skiing despite the inherent dangers of the sport. ""The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup',"" he recalls. ""I got down okay [the first time] but it was not so easy because then when I see I have to make a turn and then the brain had to tell the knee what to do. Everything was in slow motion."" Slow as the process may have seemed initially, within two years, he was back on the World Cup circuit although not quite the same force he previously was. There were to be no further World Cup wins, not that he minded enormously. He still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back: ""It was a great feeling. I was a bit nervous. Then I told me, okay, it's the first race, just ski easily. Then it was so good, the feeling was so great and I was also fast."" On his return to the sport, the doctors had warned him he might suffer headaches at altitude. He never did. He was also warned about the perilous nature of another knock to the head. ""Skiing is dangerous and it's always going to be in a little way dangerous. But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."" Persuading his family, his wife in particular, of that fact was the harder part but, in the end, they knew they could not stand in the way of his desire and the thing that made him tick as a human being. The return was relatively short-lived, his knee putting pay to his ambitions to once more get to the very top of the sport. Having his career cut short was hard. ""My body told me that 'no, it's over now. You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."" Now, he runs his own clothes line, Albright, and also mentors young skiers giving the 30-year-old a new career in the sport. Part of him, the racer within, would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive. But he's just happy to have had a second chance at life.","It is six years since Daniel Albrecht suffered brain trauma on the Kitzbühel downhill .

"Athens, Greece (CNN)Alexis Tsipras is the man of the moment, the poster child of Greece's new left, the firebrand leader of anti-austerity party Syriza. In his fine suits, he cuts a dashing figure, and at 40, he's considered young to be a political leader. But for many on the streets of Athens it's his words that matter -- his promise of ""No more bailouts, no more submission, no more blackmailing."" It's a message of hope that resonates with those across this country, hardened by years of the EU's bitter medicine: Austerity. Greece was among the nations hardest-hit by the global financial crisis; a deeply-troubled economy, widespread unemployment and civil unrest meant that back in 2010 the country was teetering on the brink of exit from the euro, labeled the sick man of Europe. But the prescription handed down by the Troika -- the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank -- was always going to be difficult to swallow: tax hikes, a freeze on state pensions, bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries, in return for a €240 billion bailout. Five years on and the Greek economy is starting to recover. Last year, it came out of recession; this year the country's GDP is expected to grow 0.7%. But some fear the years spent locked in a straitjacket of debt and stagnation may have done more harm than good. There is widespread unemployment, with 27% of the population out of work, industrial production has shrunk 30% and three million people live on or below the poverty line. For many here, austerity has only led to hardship, and caused unbearable strains that are visible on faces across the city. Over instant coffee at his house on the outskirts of Athens, Nikos, 58, says his world has been turned upside down since losing his job in 2009. He has been unemployed ever since. ""I used to have money in my pocket, and now, I have nothing,"" he explains. ""I was supposed to get my pension next year and now that has been pushed back by two years. Just put yourself in my position."" The initial frustration he felt has turned to anger. His pride has also been battered; to get by, he has had to ask his mother to share her pension -- not easy for a man who had always been the breadwinner. Now, he and his four grown-up sons depend on his wife Valentina. But her wages, which have been slashed by 55%, are not enough to feed everyone, leaving her with a tough decision: help the family or pay taxes. ""Who to help first? They are four. I don't buy anything for myself so that I can help them. I had to pay €260 in taxes, and I only earn €800. So I haven't paid the taxes and gave the money to my son to help him with his rent,"" she explains. The family's desperation has only been exacerbated by their disenchantment with politicians and their policies: since 2005, Greece has had six Prime Ministers, each one vowing to bring an end to the crisis; each one promising jobs and growth. But nothing, Nikos says, has changed. So, he and his wife are gambling on Greece's left-wing Syriza party, their pledge to bring an end to austerity, and their message that ""hope is coming"". Angry and frustrated, Nikos insists: ""Things can't get any worse with a new government. And if they do, we'll vote again for someone else. ""Have politicians ever asked an unemployed citizen when he wakes up in the morning and who has a family, if this person has a single euro, or €5, in his pocket to buy a carton of milk to feed his children?"" he asks. ""I don't trust any of them."" For now, Nikos and Valentina are placing their trust in Syriza and its leader Alexis Tsipras, who has promised to raise the minimum wage, re-hire public sector workers, reduce taxes and tackle the country's ""silent humanitarian crisis"". But Tsipras's boldest pledge -- and the one that is making the rest of Europe nervous -- is his promise to renegotiate the terms of the Greek bailout deal. At Syriza's last rally before Sunday's general election, I asked the party's finance spokesman George Stathakis what they will do if they can't see eye-to-eye with Europe. ""What we are arguing [for] with our European partners is a new arrangement that will remove part of the public debt burden on the Greek economy and at the same time allow Greece to get back to work,"" he says. In other words, they want to stay in the single currency but with more fiscal leeway -- a breathing space of sorts, so the country can recover from its ""economic coma,"" and begin to grow again. Both working-class and middle-class voters -- and both public and private sector workers -- have voiced support for this call. Computer developer Stathis Papachristou says he has always voted for the conservatives, but having seen his wages slashed and his taxes increase -- and as the father of a newborn baby, he's voting for change this time around. ""Syriza doesn't express 100% my opinions and I'm not level with what they believe and what they want to do, but I believe its something new, a new party with fresh ideas that is going to change what is already rotten,"" he explains. There is no doubt that anger and austerity have fueled the rise of Syriza in a country whose citizens are calling for social and economic change. But -- if he is elected -- the question of whether Tsipras can make a difference to Greece will depend on what he does with his power, and how the EU and its leaders deal with him. Whatever the outcome of Sunday's polls, the hard work, it seems, is just beginning.","Greek voters went to the polls on Sunday in a snap election .

"(CNN)The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United Kingdom is heading home. London's Royal Free Hospital announced Saturday that ""Pauline Cafferkey has been discharged from the Royal Free following her recovery from Ebola."" On December 29, the 39-year-old Glasgow, Scotland, resident became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on UK soil shortly after returning from Sierra Leone. Five days later, the Royal Free Hospital announced her condition had deteriorated to critical. That meant all the more reason to celebrate Saturday's news. Prime Minister David Cameron was among those weighing in, tweeting, ""Great to hear Pauline Cafferkey has been discharged from hospital. Thank you to everyone @RoyalFreeNHS for the world class care."" Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, according to Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late last year, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. She was reportedly transferred to London in a military aircraft fitted with an isolation pod and brought to the Royal Free Hospital. That facility has a high-level isolation unit, with access restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, is set up over the patient's bed. As she got treatment there, Save the Children said that it was ""doing everything possible"" to establish how Cafferkey contracted Ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus. CNN's Susannah Cullinane and Max Foster contributed to this report.","London's Royal Free Hospital tweets that it's released Pauline Cafferkey .

"President Barack Obama said Wednesday he supports same-sex marriage, raising the political stakes on an issue over which Americans are evenly split. The announcement was the first by a sitting president and put Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who on Wednesday said during an appearance in Oklahoma, ""I believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman."" Obama said in an interview with ABC News, ""At a certain point I've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married."" Obama once opposed such marriages. He later indicated his views were ""evolving."" ""I had hesitated on gay marriage, in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient,"" the president said. ""I was sensitive to the fact that -- for a lot of people -- that the word marriage is something that provokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs."" But, Obama said, his thinking shifted as he witnessed committed same-sex marriages and thought about U.S. service personnel who were ""not able to commit themselves in a marriage."" It was not immediately clear how the development -- which same-sex marriage advocates had long sought -- might play out at the voting booth. A Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid, with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal. But a CNN/ORC poll, taken in late March, indicated policies towards gays and lesbians were tied for last in the most-important issues facing the country. Obama was ""disappointed"" by Tuesday's vote on the issue in North Carolina, which he described as discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said earlier Wednesday. North Carolina voted to implement a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, which was already prohibited by state law. Supporters of the measure pushed for the constitutional amendment, arguing that it was needed to ward off future legal challenges. The president said he supports the concept of states deciding the issue on their own, ABC News reported. Obama said his daughters, Malia and Sasha, have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. ""It wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. It doesn't make sense to them and frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective."" What's next for North Carolina? Obama spoke Wednesday with ABC's Robin Roberts. The interview will appear on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" Thursday. Excerpts aired Wednesday evening on ""World News With Diane Sawyer."" The president's stance will be among many key differences with Romney, but it is not expected to be a key talking point in his campaign. In comments Wednesday to CNN Denver affiliate KDVR, Romney reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage. ""And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,"" Romney said during a visit to Fort Lupton. ""My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights, and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not."" The Family Research Council criticized Obama, and its president said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the decision will aid Romney. ""The president, I think, has handed to Mitt Romney the one missing piece in his campaign,"" said Tony Perkins. ""That is the intensity and motivation that Mitt Romney needs among social conservatives to win this election."" An expert on religion and politics said the move will make ""an already close election even closer."" ""It cuts both ways -- it activates both Democratic and Republican base voters,"" said John Green of the University of Akron. Obama told ABC that some opinions on the issue are ""generational."" ""When I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same-sex equality or, you know, sexual orientation, that they believe in equality,"" he said. First lady Michelle Obama was involved in the president's decision. ""This is something that, you know, we've talked about over the years and she, you know, she feels the same way, she feels the same way that I do,"" Obama said. Reaction to Obama's same-sex marriage announcement . The new president of the Human Rights Campaign lauded the development. ""President Obama's words today will be celebrated by generations to come,"" Chad Griffin said in a statement. Griffin later told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that ""we will never have another president, Democrat or Republican, that opposes gay marriage."" Same-sex marriage foe Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Morgan that ""a child needs a mother and father."" Barney Frank, a gay Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, appearing on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront,"" said that ""no president could have done this 10 years ago."" Obama's interview followed recent comments by other key administration figures. Vice President Joe Biden said Sunday on NBC he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with couples of the same gender marrying, leading observers to wonder when Obama would again address the issue. Education Secretary Arne Duncan on Monday also made headlines when he openly backed same-sex marriage rights. Asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" if he supports allowing individuals of the same gender to legally wed, Duncan replied: ""Yes, I do."" Before Tuesday, 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina. Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. In 2011, the Pentagon stopped enforcement of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on homosexuals serving in the military. That change played a part in Obama's announced stance on same-sex marriage. ""When I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,"" he told ABC News. Legal challenges over same-sex marriage could reach the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months, but it seems unlikely justices would hear arguments before Election Day 2012. The issue is on two legal tracks. The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals will decide the constitutionality of California Proposition 8, a voter-approved measure that would recognize marriage only between one man and one woman. A federal judge earlier struck down the law as a violation of equal protection, prompting the current appeal. The Obama administration announced last year it believed the Defense of Marriage Act, often referred to as DOMA, to be unconstitutional. The law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman. A federal appeals court in Boston last month heard a DOMA lawsuit by a same-sex couple in Massachusetts. At issue is whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can marry. That federal law is being officially defended in court by House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who stepped in after the Justice Department refused to participate.","""I believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman,"" Mitt Romney says .

"(CNN)NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is closing in on Pluto and its five moons. Soon we will see what no one has ever seen before: Crisp, clear pictures of the tiny, icy world. ""The pictures are what we're all waiting for,"" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, told CNN. Up until now, the best images of Pluto have been a few pixels shot by the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, released in 2010, took four years and 20 computers operating continuously and simultaneously to produce, according to Marc Buie of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. They show what NASA called an ""icy and dark molasses-colored, mottled world that is undergoing seasonal changes in its surface color and brightness."" That's not a very glamorous description, but NASA said the images confirmed Pluto is a ""dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes, not simply a ball of ice and rock."" New Horizons is aiming its Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) telescope at Pluto to help navigate the final 135 million miles (220 kilometers) of its 3 billion mile journey. Besides LORRI, the space probe is packed with cameras and other instruments. By mid-May, we should get ""better than Hubble"" photos. We'll also see Pluto's five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. Stern expects new ""optical navigation images"" to arrive any day now. ""I think of Pluto as a kind of a Christmas present that's been sitting under the tree"" waiting to be unwrapped, Stern said. ""I just can't wait to see what's there."" New Horizons was launched on January 19, 2006. It will arrive at Pluto on July 14, 2015. The probe is 27 inches (0.7 meters) tall, 83 inches (2.1 meters) long and 108 inches (2.7 meters) wide. It weighed 1,054 pounds (478 kilograms) at launch. New Horizons was launched before the big debate started over whether it's a planet. For the scientists on the New Horizons team, Pluto is very much a planet -- just a new kind of planet. ""New Horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we've never seen, in a place we've never been before,"" says New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver of APL. ""For decades, we thought Pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts; now we know it's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the Kuiper Belt, and New Horizons is going to provide the first close-up look at them."" Some interesting tidbits about Pluto: . -- Pluto is classified by NASA as a dwarf planet. -- It has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. -- Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's moon. -- It probably has a rocky core surrounded by ice. -- It's one of a group of objects that orbit beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt. -- Pluto is about 20 times as massive than Ceres, the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter that will be explored by the Dawn spacecraft on March 6, 2015. -- Pluto has a 248-year-long elliptical orbit around the sun. -- From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was actually closer to the sun than Neptune. -- Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. -- It was named by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England.","Earth's first probe to Pluto is beginning its long approach with the icy world .

"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu isn't aiming to disrespect President Obama or muddy the waters of American politics when he speaks before Congress, the country's ambassador said Sunday.

To speak up when there is still time to make a difference,"" Ambassador Ron Dermer said at an event in Florida days after House Speaker John Boehner announced that Netanyahu would address Congress in March. Netanyahu is expected to lobby Congress to approve tough new sanctions on Iran. The scheduled appearance -- two weeks ahead of an Israeli election -- caught Obama's administration by surprise and has drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers. Dermer acknowledged the criticism Sunday night as he spoke at an Israel Bonds benefit event in Boca Raton, Florida. But he said speaking out on Iran is part of Netanyahu's ""sacred duty."" ""There may be some people who believe that the Prime Minister of Israel should have declined an invitation to speak before the most powerful parliament in the world on an issue that concerns the future and survival of Israel. But we have learned from our history that the world becomes a more dangerous place for the Jewish people when the Jewish people are silent,"" he said. ""That is why the Prime Minister feels the deepest moral obligation to appear before the Congress to speak about an existential issue facing the one and only Jewish state. That is not just the right of the Prime Minister of Israel. It is his most sacred duty -- to do whatever he can to prevent Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons that can be aimed at Israel."" It's a case Netanyahu has made before. In 2012, he famously held up a drawing of a bomb as he asked the United Nations General Assembly to draw ""a clear red line"" to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran, Dermer said, remains ""the world's most dangerous regime,"" and a nuclear deal could endanger Israel's future. ""Today, the international community stands at the precipice of forging an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program,"" Dormer said. ""The agreement that is being discussed today is not an agreement that would dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons capability, but rather one that could leave Iran as a nuclear threshold state."" Obama has opposed upping sanctions against Iran, saying he needs more time to hash out a deal to end Iran's nuclear program and that new sanctions would put those talks at risk. Iran has denied working toward a nuclear weapon, insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. Boehner told reporters last week that he did not consult with the White House about inviting Netanyahu, saying ""the Congress can make this decision on its own."" Some speculated it was another sign of tense relations between Obama and Netanyahu. But Dermer said Sunday that the Israeli Prime MInister's visit is ""not intended to wade into (the U.S.) political debate."" Israel is grateful for Obama's support, he said, and support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. ""The Prime Minister's visit here is not intended to show any disrespect for President Obama. Israel deeply appreciates the strong support we have received from President Obama in many areas: in enhanced security cooperation, heightened intelligence sharing, generous military assistance and Iron Dome funding, and opposition to anti-Israel initiatives at the United Nations,"" Dermer said. ""Now, I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will speak very forcefully about that strong support from President Obama when he appears before Congress."" CNN's Eric Bradner contributed to this report.","Ambassador: Netanyahu's March visit ""is not intended to show any disrespect for President Obama""

"New York (CNN)Shoppers crowded into a Manhattan Home Depot store to prepare for an anticipated snowstorm streamed into the streets Sunday afternoon after an employee shot a store manager and then himself, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt. Brendan Ryan. The 38-year-old manager, who was shot in an aisle of the store, was transported to Bellevue Hospital where he was later pronounced dead, Ryan said. The shooting happened in a store at 40 West 23rd Street, in the Flatiron section of Manhattan, police said. The shooter, a 31-year-old male worker at the store, was not scheduled to work when he came in, Ryan said. The shooter was pronounced dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the NYPD. Police recovered a .38-caliber revolver at the scene, Ryan said. Police did not speculate on a motive for the shooting, noting that the incident is still under investigation. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","The store was packed with shoppers preparing for the snowstorm about to hit New York .

"La Jolla, California (CNN)A black-and-white photo shows the 16-year-old ballerina at her prime, mere months before her world would be destroyed. She is dressed in a bathing suit, smiling radiantly while performing a gymnastic split. Edith Eva Eger says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush: a Jewish boy named Imre. He, like so many others, would not survive the Holocaust. ""I had my 17th birthday in Auschwitz,"" Eger says. Seventy years later, Eger appears frail at first glance, until she astounds a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder-high. The 87-year old says her fondest childhood memories still revolve around dancing and training to compete for the Hungarian Olympic team as a gymnast. ""But then I was told that I had to train somewhere else because I'm Jewish, and I do not qualify [for the Olympics],"" Eger recalls.  ""My dream was totally shattered."" Eger was a Hungarian Jew, the youngest of three daughters, living in a town called Kosice in what is modern-day Slovakia. Her father was a tailor; her mother, a civil servant. It wasn't until March 1944, late in World War II, that Eger says Hungarian Nazis came to her house and arrested her family. The Jews in Hungary were among the last of Europe's Jewish communities to be targeted by the Nazis. The family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, occupied by Nazi Germany. ""My mom held me in the cattle car,"" Eger recalls. ""And she said, 'We don't know where we're going. We don't know what's going to happen. Just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind.' "" Upon arrival at the camp, Eger said Dr. Joseph Mengele, one of the Auschwitz complex's top medical officers, stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks. ""He pointed to my mom to go to the left, and I followed my mom,"" Eger says.  ""And Dr. Mengele grabbed me -- I never forget that eye contact--  and he said 'You're going to see you mother soon, she's just going to take a shower.' "" It was the last time Eger saw her parents. They died in the gas chambers of Auschwitz along with more than a million other Jews. But that would not be the ballerina's final encounter with the infamous SS doctor who later became known the ""Angel of Death."" ""Dr. Mengele came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained,"" Eger says. Fellow inmates ""volunteered"" Eger to perform for the man who had ordered her parents' death. She asked her captors to play the Blue Danube Waltz as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the Holocaust. ""I was so scared,"" Eger says. ""I closed my eyes, and I pretended that the music was Tchaikovsky, and I was dancing 'Romeo and Juliet' in the Budapest opera house."" The German doctor rewarded the Jewish girl with an extra ration of bread, which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters. Eger says months later, those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through Austria. ""They formed a chair with their arms, and they carried me so I wouldn't die,"" she says, adding, ""Isn't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us?"" Decades after the horrors of the Holocaust, dance is still a passion. Eger's house on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean is decorated with statues of ballerinas.  Every Sunday, she says she goes swing-dancing to the music that American soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in Austria in 1945. ""I want to have a full life, not to be damaged goods,"" she says. Perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of World War II and later blossom as an emigre in the United States. Shortly after the war, Eger met and married a fellow Hungarian Jew who had been a partisan, anti-Nazi fighter.  The young family moved with their infant daughter to the United States to escape communist rule in Hungary. ""She was very shy when I was growing up,"" recalls Eger's eldest daughter, Marianne who says her mother transformed in the 1970s, after a visit to Auschwitz. ""After that, she changed dramatically,"" the daughter says. ""There had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes, and afterwards, it was gone. I think it did free her, and she became who she is now."" It was also in the 1970s that Eger began studying psychology.  Decades later, she still works as a clinical psychologist, running a practice out of her home in La Jolla.  Her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. ""She evolved at a time as a psychologist when PTSD wasn't even on the map,"" says Dr. Saul Levine, professor emeritus in psychiatry at the University of California at San Diego, who has known and worked with Eger for more than 20 years. ""She is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way, as well as in a deeply personal way,"" Levine said. Throughout her career in psychology, Eger has done extensive consulting work with the U.S. military, treating American veterans of wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. She has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse. ""Auschwitz gave me a tremendous gift in some ways, that I can guide people to have resilience and perseverance,"" Eger says. In time, Eger also become a motivational public speaker, performing a Ted Talk and giving speeches at schools and universities.  She litters her Hungarian-accented English with aphorisms aimed at mental healing. ""Self love is self care,"" she tells patients.  ""The biggest concentration camp is in our mind."" ""She blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy,"" Levine says, recalling the first time he saw Eger speaking to an audience.  ""She is a force of nature."" Seventy years after the liberation of Auschwitz, this Holocaust survivor's greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great-grandchildren. ""That's the best revenge to Hitler I can think of,"" says the dancer, pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great-grandchildren in her office.","Edith Eva Eger was taken to Auschwitz when she was 16 .

"(CNN)It was an innocent mistake, one that was easy to correct -- before the social media age. Miss Lebanon and Miss Israel were at an event in Los Angeles with fellow 2006 Miss Universe contestants as part of the whirlwind of photo opps leading up the annual beauty contest. It was in the middle of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, and a picture of the two women together landed on the Miss Universe press page, stirring panic among the women and their handlers. The incident came to mind last weekend when a photo on Instagram of the current Miss Israel and Miss Lebanon together stirred controversy online anew, Miss Universe Organization President Paula M. Shugart said. In 2006, the organization was able to remove the photo before anyone noticed, Shugart said. Now, thanks to social media, we're in a ""whole new ballgame."" Slips in decorum that previously might have gone unnoticed now have the potential to be amplified beyond anyone's control. In this case, the backlash prompted Miss Lebanon Saly Greige to issue a statement distancing herself from the photo. Many in the West dismissed the controversy as a trifling matter. Greige and Miss Israel Doron Matalon weathered the controversy and went on to represent their countries in the pageant, which aired Sunday night on NBC.  Miss Colombia Paulina Vega won the crown. But pageant observers say the incident is a reminder that beauty pageants embody global politics, with contestants expected to model the cultural sensibilities of their nations. ""They are cast with representing their country and as such they are expected to behave much like ambassadors,"" said Jessica Trisko Darden, an assistant professor with the School of International Service at American University and the 2007 Miss Earth pageant winner representing Canada. 'A delicate diplomatic dance' The Instagram controversy is the latest example showing that pageants occur ""in a broader international context,"" Trisko Darden said in a Guardian column last week. Russia came under fire as Miss Universe host country in 2013 for not granting visas to contestants from countries it did not recognize, including Kosovo, Shugart said. Contestants threatened to boycott the 2002 Miss World pageant scheduled in Nigeria after a mother was sentenced to death for having sex outside marriage. Organizers moved the pageant to London. ""With so many nations and so much politics, planners must choreograph a delicate diplomatic dance,"" said Louise Gourlaouen, creator of pageant-watch website MissUniversUsa.com, which shares information on international pageants and beauty queens. Geopolitical affairs affect various aspects of pageant planning, Shugart said. For example, geographic neighbors Russia and Ukraine are traditionally assigned as roommates -- but not this year. Behind the scenes, Miss Universe contestants tend to get along, or, at the very least, are civil and courteous, Shugart said. After all, each woman is representing her country on a global stage. For many, it's the first time they ever leave their country. ""As people, they genuinely like each other but they need to be cognizant that they are wearing a sash representing their country,"" she said. ""Obviously, certain countries have inherent hostilities, and I encourage contestants to talk to each other but I do not have them room together."" It's easy for Americans to brush aside the Instagram controversy, said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab-American Institute in Washington. But with regular cross-border hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, it's not surprising that the appearance of ""normalized relations"" between representatives of those countries might offend some in the region. ""Politics enters into things like this, unfortunately. It shouldn't be this way but when conditions are so bad and you have two countries at war with each other, everything becomes political,"" she said. If not for social media, however, the incident probably would not have made international headlines, she said. ""That's what happens with social media; it's the tendency of a hashtag to be more meaningful than substance of what actually took place,"" she said. ""It's significant burden to place on women in their 20s."" 'Everything is political' Miss Lebanon 2002 Christina Sawaya has experienced that burden firsthand. Her country decided to skip the Miss Universe 2002 after Israeli troops swept through a refugee camp in Jenin, leading to allegations from Palestinian officials of a massacre. A Human Rights Watch report found evidence of possible war crimes, but the group's investigators found no evidence that Israeli troops massacred Palestinian civilians. Meanwhile, Yamit Har-Noy, Israel's 2002 Miss Universe delegate, stoked controversy at the competition with a dress displaying the Israeli state that included the disputed territories of West Bank and Gaza, according to multiple news reports from the time. In an email to CNN on Friday through her publicist, Sawaya said she ""felt bad"" about missing the 2002 competition. But, as a representative of her country, she understood and respected the official decision. ""I think that beauty queens have a message of culture and peace to deliver and this is where real beauty is,"" she said. ""But, unfortunately, we live in a world full of atrocities, wars, injustice, and occupation and seen under that perspective, a beauty queen has to understand and respect her country's laws and political positions."" Sawaya represented her country in other pageants. They were different settings, but the expectations were the same: treat your competitors with respect, but always be on guard against situations ""that might put you in a difficult position."" ""While it is easy to say forget politics, it is just beauty, it is just a pageant; unfortunately we who live here know that everything is political when it comes to your country's sovereignty and borders.""","Miss Universe contestants from Lebanon and Israel appear in pageant after photo flap .

"(CNN)The firebrand leader of Greece's left-wing Syriza party appeared to be bracing for a bigger battle as he declared victory in Sunday's election. Now that his party has apparently won the support of his country's voters, Alexis Tsipras has another fight in front of him: making good on his campaign promise to renegotiate the terms of Greece's bailout. ""We are regaining our lost dignity ... Now that we are heard by all of Europe, we will fight with the same passion, the same confidence,"" Tsipras told cheering supporters. ""So let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight."" With more than 70% of votes counted, Syriza was officially projected to win at least 149 seats in the 300-seat Parliament. Exit polls also placed the party in the lead. But analysts cautioned that it was still too close to call whether Syriza would win a majority of seats -- a key step that would allow the party to govern without forming a coalition government. Tsipras, 40, who could become Greece's next prime minister, also vowed to end austerity measures. ""Greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it, leaves behind the fear, leaves behind five years of humiliation, and Greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity,"" he told the crowd. Syriza's pledges to try to get some of Greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize Greece's place in the eurozone. The election could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt-laden nation's lenders. ""That is a gamble that people in Greece seem to be prepared to take at this point, simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe,"" Greek journalist Elinda Labropoulou told CNN on Sunday. One of those people willing to take the risk is Eleni Antoniou, a former public sector employee. ""People went bankrupt since we entered the bailout, poverty is visible across society, and I believe that hope is coming with Syriza's program, not only for Greece, but for all of Europe,"" she said ahead of the election. The austerity imposed by Greece's international creditors has cut deep. Unemployment has soared to 28%, and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages, pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back. The governing New Democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs things were getting better. After conceding defeat Sunday, outgoing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said his conscience was clear. ""I got a country on the verge of ruin.  I was asked to try and save it, and I did it,"" he said. ""Most people did not believe we could stand strong, but we did."" Now, he said, Greece is secure and ""slowly walking away from the crisis."" ""And more than anything,"" he said, ""I give back a country that is a member of the European parliament and the euro."" In his victory speech Sunday, Tsipras noted that Greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders. ""Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future,"" he said. His message is one that has resonated in other southern European countries under the restrictions of international bailouts. Syriza's victory could boost other populist parties, like Beppe Grillo's anti-euro Five Star Movement in Italy and the Podemos Movement in Spain. But it's unclear how its plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out. Is Alexis Tsipras man of the moment?

"(CNN) -- A push for some social media love by the New York Police Department backfired badly, with Twitter users taking advantage of the invitation to mock the NYPD and other departments nationwide. The department on Tuesday asked folks to post photos of themselves with its officers, using the hashtag #myNYPD. The response was swift and overwhelmingly negative as tweeters hijacked the hashtag to post photos they said showed police brutality or misconduct. ""Free Massages from the #NYPD. What does YOUR Police Department offer?"" tweeted @OccupyWallStNYC, which posted an image of officers holding a man, seemingly screaming, with his arms behind his back, on top of a car. ""The #NYPD will also help you de-tangle your hair,"" tweeted @MoreAndAgain, posting a photo of an officer pulling the hair of a person who appears to be under arrest. Similar hashtags sprang up around the country, with #MyLAPD, #MyCPD and #MyAPD among those trending Wednesday morning. In a tweet that showed a Chicago police officer who appeared ready to punch someone with a camera, @70torinoman quipped, ""#myCPD extending his fist out to the community."" The tag #MyAPD referred to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where a Justice Department report recently blasted what it called a long history of police brutality and unnecessary deadly force. But a New York police spokeswoman defended the campaign despite the backlash. ""The NYPD is creating new ways to communicate effectively with the community. Twitter provides an open forum for an uncensored exchange and this is an open dialogue good for our city,"" said Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster. Indeed, the posts weren't all bad. ""(M)y photo from my ride along with the boys from the 90th pct,"" tweeted @poshwonderwoman, showing a woman posing alongside three smiling officers. One user even criticized the backlash.

"New Delhi (CNN)Taking militants out with drones isn't simple, but it's the best strategy available to eliminate the threat of terrorists in Yemen, U.S. President Barack Obama said Sunday. The administration's policy in the increasingly unstable country has come under scrutiny in recent days as the U.S.-backed government crumbled under pressure from Shiite Houthi rebels. ""Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,"" Obama said in New Delhi, where he's on a three-day state visit. He described the U.S. policy there -- ""partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government"" -- as the best approach in a bad situation. ""The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,"" Obama said. The unraveling security situation in Yemen -- the same country Obama cited as a model for his fight against ISIS terrorists -- has thrown the President's counterterror message into question. In the capital, Sanaa, last week, the presidential palace was overrun by Houthi rebels and President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi announced he was resigning. That's a problem for the United States, which has relied on the government in Yemen as an ally in battling the al Qaeda affiliate that's based there. A power vacuum could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist offshoot that U.S. officials consider the most dangerous branch of the global jihadi network. Amid the uncertainty in Yemen last week, it was reported the U.S. had suspended its counterterror efforts there. Obama said definitively on Sunday those reports were wrong. ""We continue to go after high-value targets inside Yemen,"" he said. Obama himself cited the U.S.-Yemen partnership when he announced in September he was going after ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS, Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists. ""This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,"" Obama said on September 10. ""It is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America's core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order."" What that strategy relied on, however, was a strong partnership between the United States and the existing government in Yemen, led by Hadi. Hadi reorganized Yemen's military to better go after AQAP, a strategy that worked for a time. But the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant Houthis, a group of Shiites who say they feel marginalized in the majority Sunni country. Obama was confident on Sunday that U.S. anti-terror efforts would continue in Yemen. ""What we have shown is that we can maintain the kind of pressure on these terrorist networks even in these kind of difficult environments,"" he said. Who's in charge in Yemen?","Obama says Sunday that U.S. continues to go after ""high-value targets inside Yemen"" despite unrest .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of another round of national protests against police killings of unarmed black men, many Republicans seem unable to identify with protesters or give credence to the goals of the #ICantBreathe movement. I empathize with the vast majority of cops who keep the peace on our streets and enjoy majority support from their communities across the country. These protests aren't about them. These protests are about citizens' rattled faith in the fair delivery of justice. In any civil society, there's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken. Republicans who are committed to the stability of our society must acknowledge that these protests reflect real doubts in the equity of our criminal justice system. We all have a moral obligation to constantly improve it to the benefit of everyone. Whether you agree that the decision not to indict former Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown was correct (as I do), or if you think the slogan ""hands up don't shoot"" has been discredited because of witness testimony from the grand jury (I do), Republicans ought to accept that there's a broader problem. Look at the case of Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, or Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and at least a half dozen others. As a reform Republican who works for the GOP to broaden its base and reach new constituencies, I see no contradiction between supporting law enforcement and the policy solutions highlighted by these protestors. More Republicans should champion the implementation of body-worn cameras on police officers, requested by Michael Brown's family and supported by Republican law enforcement proponent Rudy Giuliani. According to one study, body-worn cameras yielded a 50% reduction in use-of-force incidents, and complaints against police officers dropped precipitously. We should be advocating these technologies to help protect the innocent and convict the guilty. Consider that if Wilson had worn a camera, there could be remarkably less dispute over the details of that tragedy. Republicans should also champion ""community policing"" practices such as those employed by Camden, New Jersey, Police Chief Scott Thomson where creative engagement with community partners has reduced homicides by 50% and violent crime by 20%. Pragmatic and nonpartisan solutions will increase confidence in law enforcement and support good police while offering more transparency and accountability to citizens who have lost confidence in the justice system. Among the 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls, Sen. Rand Paul stands out on the issue of criminal justice reform because he's consistently reached out beyond the base to communities of color. More Republicans should follow his lead on policies ranging from reforming mandatory minimum sentencing and giving felons who have already served time the right to vote. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I co-hosted an opinion panel on CNN with my friends Sally Kohn, Sunny Hostin and Mel Robbins. While we usually represent contrasting perspectives on the week's top issues, we strive to disagree agreeably and forge common ground. That was the case this past weekend, when we jointly agreed to end the show with a salute to the ongoing #ICantBreathe protests. The photo of us four raising our hands was celebrated on social media by creative icons such as Shonda Rhimes, who tweeted, ""Inspired to see @CNN opinion voices speaking out on left and right,"" and Russell Simmons, ""Glad to see diverse and bold voices on @cnn. Beautiful statement of support for humanity."" It was also condemned by conservatives who wondered why I, as a Republican, was supporting a discredited narrative. First of all, facts matter. I've made my support for the grand jury's nonincitement in the Ferguson case clear. But right or wrong, ""hands up"" has now fused with a larger movement -- bigger than Darren Wilson and Michael Brown. I believe we all have an obligation, especially Republicans, to engage the debate and propose solutions for improving our criminal justice system. CNN is and always should be the place that breaks through left/right, black/white divides and forges common ground on contentious debates. That's what we aspire to in our opinion panel. Our common ground broke through the tired divisions that too often dominate cable TV debates -- it sparked attention for the right reasons. It should be the beginning of a refreshing conversation about how we can come together and improve our criminal justice system.","Margaret Hoover: In the protests against police killings, GOP seems disengaged .

"Thomas Eric Duncan left Liberia for the United States, by official accounts, a healthy man. Just over two weeks later, he passed away at a Dallas, Texas, hospital with Ebola. Duncan was admitted into isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 28 with common symptoms of Ebola: fever, vomiting and diarrhea. He later tested positive for the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa. He was started on the experimental drug brincidofovir on October 4 -- far too long after he arrived at the hospital, his family has said. On Tuesday, the hospital reported that Duncan was on a ventilator and his kidneys were failing. Duncan died on Wednesday at 7:51 a.m. ""His suffering is over,"" his partner Louise Troh said in a statement. ""My family is in deep sadness and grief, but we leave him in the hands of God. Our deepest sympathies go out to his father and family in Liberia and here in America. Eric was a wonderful man who showed compassion toward all."" Who was Duncan, besides the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States? When did he start to feel sick, and why couldn't the U.S. health care system save him? ""The past week has been an enormous test of our health system, but for one family it has been far more personal,"" Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a statement. ""The doctors, nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care, but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways. We'll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat."" Who was Thomas Eric Duncan? He was a 42-year-old Liberian citizen. Duncan's Facebook page indicates that he's from the Liberian capital of Monrovia, where he attended E. Jonathan Goodridge High School. Why did he come to the United States? To visit family and friends. Duncan was visiting his son and his son's mother in Dallas, according to Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, who noted this was Duncan's first trip to America. When did Duncan leave Liberia? He departed the West African nation on September 19, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden says. How did he get Ebola? Health authorities haven't said. Witnesses say Duncan had been helping Ebola patients in Liberia. Liberian community leader Tugbeh Chieh Tugbeh said Duncan was caring for an Ebola-infected patient at a residence in Paynesville City, just outside Monrovia. The New York Times reported that Duncan had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with Ebola on September 15, days before he left for the United States. Citing the woman's parents and Duncan's neighbors in Monrovia, Liberia, the newspaper said Duncan had helped carry the ailing woman home after a hospital turned her away because there wasn't enough space in its Ebola treatment ward. Was he screened for Ebola before getting on the plane? Yes, according to Binyah Kesselly, board chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority. ""The first screening was at the gate, before you get to the parking lot. The second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight. At every point your temperature is scanned."" His temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Thomas Frieden told reporters Thursday. Yet on a health screening questionnaire, Duncan answered ""no"" to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus and whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease, Kesselly said. Complete coverage on Ebola . When did his Ebola symptoms appear? ""Four or five days"" after his trip, according to the CDC's Frieden. This doesn't mean that Duncan actually got infected with Ebola in the United States. The incubation period for the virus is 2 to 21 days, meaning that a person could be infected with the disease for up to three weeks before showing any signs of it. When he did seek medical help? Duncan first walked into Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas after 10 p.m. on September 25. Smallwood reports Duncan had a fever and was vomiting during this first visit to the Dallas hospital. The hospital, in a statement, said he had a ""low grade fever and abdominal pain."" He underwent basic blood tests but wasn't screened for Ebola, said Dr. Edward Goodman from the Dallas hospital. Duncan left the medical facility after being given antibiotics and a pain reliever, his friend said. ""His condition did not warrant admission,"" the hospital said. ""He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola."" Were flags raised that Duncan might have Ebola? After being asked by a nurse, Duncan did say that he'd traveled from Africa, said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Presbyterian's parent company. But that detail -- which might have raised an alarm that Duncan might have Ebola, since Liberia is one of the countries hardest hit by the virus -- was not ""fully communicated"" to the medical team, according to Lester. When was he admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital? On September 28. By the time Duncan arrived via ambulance, ""EMS had already identified potential need for isolation,"" the hospital said. What treatment did he receive? Duncan was given supportive therapy -- meaning fluids and other therapies that would help support his immune system while it was trying to fight off the virus. He was also started on the experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir on October 4. Since the drugs being used to treat Ebola are still experimental, it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it. The hospital has declined to tell CNN when they filed for permission to the FDA to use brincidofovir. ""The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs,"" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement. Family questions wait on experimental drug . Duncan was not given a blood transfusion with blood donated by an Ebola survivor, as Ebola patients Dr. Rick Sacra and Ashoka Mukpo were given in Nebraska. Why did he die? The other Ebola patients brought to the United States for treatment are still alive. Three have been released from the hospital and one is reportedly in stable condition at The Nebraska Medical Center. So what's different about Duncan? As Lakey said, Ebola attacks the body in many ways. Experts estimate the current outbreak in West Africa has around a 71% fatality rate. Supportive therapy can help, but there are no proven cures for the disease. Duncan did not start receiving treatment until several days after he started experiencing symptoms, which may have contributed to his rapid decline. What will happen to his body? An Ebola patient's body is still highly infectious. Any contact with the bodily fluids could result in transmission of the virus. ""Only personnel trained in handling infected human remains, and wearing PPE (personal protective equipment), should touch, or move, any Ebola-infected remains,"" CDC guidelines state. ""Autopsies on patients who die of Ebola should be avoided."" Duncan's body will be enclosed in two bags and the bags will be disinfected for transportation, Texas health officials say. Then the body will be cremated.","Thomas Eric Duncan passed away on October 8 at 7:51 a.m.

"New Delhi (CNN)U.S. President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pals, if you haven't heard. The pair have ""chemistry,"" according to the White House and Indian officials. They've shared impromptu strolls on the National Mall and, on Sunday, a long meander through a New Delhi rose garden. Indian weavers are hurriedly piecing together saris as gifts for the first lady. The normally congested Indian capital has been rid of its stray monkeys -- at least in the places Obama might visit. And local television networks are running entire pieces speculating the two leaders might take a selfie. Here's a highlight reel of social media's favorite Obama and Modi broments so far: . In case anyone doubted the deep bond between Obama and Modi (and how could they?), Air Force One's arrival on Sunday put any questions to rest. Breaking with established protocol -- and surprising television commentators on the dozen or so local news broadcasters -- Modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet Obama in India. And it wasn't just with a handshake. Modi pulled the travel-weary commander in chief for the ""bear hug"" seen around the world -- though like most unplanned hugs in front of a billion-viewer television audience, it was a little awkward. The two leaders later followed it up with another warm embrace after a joint press conference, stoking rumors of a ""bromance."" When Modi visited Obama at the White House in September, the visit ended with Obama blowing up his set-in-stone schedule and taking the visiting Prime Minister for a stroll at the Martin Luther King memorial on the National Mall. The strolling continued in New Delhi. Obama and Modi, punctuating their bilateral talks, sauntered side by side through the formal gardens at Hyderabad House, a stately 1920s home that now acts as a ceremonial venue. Cameras caught them murmuring away to each other, but reporters could not hear what they said. After the stroll they sat down for a cup of tea. Modi's camp wasted no time posting a Facebook album of highlights. When Obama and Modi last sat down for dinner, at the White House in September, only one of them actually ate. Modi was midway through a religious fast that allowed only warm water. This time around, solid foods were consumed by all. A readout of lunch showed vegetarian and nonvegetarian menus, each with more than a dozen dishes. (Even so, Indian celebrity chef Saransh Goila criticized its lack of variety.) Dinner was an even bigger affair: Held at the presidential palace, the event featured Indian dancers, a receiving line and, of course, a pair of heartfelt toasts. India and the U.S. share the ""natural sense of kinship"" their leaders enjoy, Modi said. Obama went with a passage from Walt Whitman's ""Passage to India"": . ""The earth to be spann'd, connected by network, / The people to become brothers and sisters."" ""Here, in our time, these words have come to pass,"" Obama said. The leaders poked fun at each other throughout the day. During a press conference, Obama remarked that Modi was greeted like a ""Bollywood star"" when he visited New York's Madison Square Garden last year. Obama also said they compared how much sleep they're getting, prompting polite laughter from the press corps. ""And it turns out that Modi is getting even less sleep than me. But of course that's because he's still new. After you've been doing this for about six years, maybe he'll be able to get an extra hour."" Not everyone was impressed with his answer, however. And this is just the first day of Obama's historic visit. Stay tuned for highlights from Day Two, which has a parade on the itinerary. Modi and Obama's surprising rapport .

"Forget everything we know and love about physical magazines. Forget their length. Forget their size. Forget their weekly or monthly publishing schedule. Forget all these qualities except for one: What it's like to come to an end, and to take a deep breath. Like Newsweek, almost all magazines will eventually go purely electronic. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Already, nearly 40% of tablet owners read digital newspapers or magazines, with nearly 10% doing so daily. Still, as I watch this shift, I can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia. Not for the paper, but for the boundaries. I miss the edges -- physical and psychological. I miss the start of reading a print magazine, but mostly, I miss the finish. I miss the satisfaction of putting the bundle down, knowing I have gotten through it all. Nothing left. On to the next thing. Newsweek ending print edition, job cuts expected . It may seem strange to think about printed publications as having a ""user experience."" But they do, of course. Print is a technology as much as desktop computers and tablets are technology. One of the qualities most natural to the user experience of print is the sense of potential completion, defined by the physical edges. It is a quality that is wholly unnatural to digital formats. The digital reading experience makes one want to connect and expand outward. Print calls for limit and containment. Ted Nelson, who invented the term ""hypertext"" in 1963, also coined another word: Intertwingularity. Describing it, he said, ""In an important sense there are no 'subjects' at all; there is only all knowledge, since the cross-connections among the myriad topics of this world simply cannot be divided up neatly."" Later, he added, ""Hierarchical and sequential structures, especially popular since Gutenberg, are usually forced and artificial."" The digital landscape is the perfect playground for actualizing the intertwingular, since the same information can be referenced in an endless number of locations, can be remixed freely, and need not abide by any single hierarchy. It is this intertwingularity that can make navigating digital content so stressful. While a stack of printed back issues of National Geographic may seem intimidating, it is not unapproachable. The magazines may be dense, but you know where you stand as you read them. But what about staring at an empty search box leading into the deep archive of nationalgeographic.com? Petrifying. Boundless. Like standing on the edge of a giant reservoir in the dead of the night, looking down into its infinite blackness. Link after related link keeps pushing you along until, suddenly, you may end up reading about polar bears on an entirely different website, and maybe you haven't been up for air in hours. Magazine websites, like the World Wide Web itself, open one up to continuous exploration through links and related content. There's beauty in that, if one is up for total immersion. But it's easier to become overwhelmed, or lost. Linda Stone created the term ""e-mail apnea"" to describe holding your breath as you traverse the horrors of your inbox. I find myself experiencing digital apnea of all sorts. Google News apnea. Twitter apnea. Facebook newsfeed apnea. RSS reader apnea. In the face of endless content streams, it's hard to stop and take a breath. There is no print apnea. Perhaps, at worst, one may experience library apnea -- standing before the vast greatness of the reading room in the British Museum, for example. But even then, it's different. There's the cozy smell of old books and the softness of the aged pages. It's more akin to basking in grandeur than to suffocating under information overload. It's hard to feel the same reverence for our 24/7 Twitter feeds. The question ""How deep does it go?"" is one that that nobody had to ask the printed edition of Newsweek. Newsweek.com? It's not so clear. It's why we love ""Most Popular"" and ""Most E-mailed"" lists -- they bring some relief of edges to the digital page. As more of our content consumption shifts digital, the onus lies on tablet and smartphone applications to find a way to create cleaner and more bite-sized forms of boundaries in a medium that doesn't want to be contained. At the start of 2013, Newsweek joins the legions of other digital-only publishers. We're losing the paper, the touch and the romanticism of the printed object. But hopefully, we'll find a way to create new edges.","Craig Mod: Like Newsweek, almost all magazines will eventually go purely electronic .
Mod: Physical magazines have start and finish; they give a sense of completion .
He says digital formats lack edges and boundaries; it's harder for readers to focus .

"(CNN)An indignant letter written by a Titanic survivor to a friend in New York sold at auction this week for $11,875, according to RR Auction in Boston. The remarks were written on Lady Lucy Duff-Gordon's personal letterhead and dated May 27, 1912 -- six weeks after HMS Titanic struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage -- and seem to indicate that she and her husband, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, didn't receive such a warm welcome home after their rescue. ""According to the way we've been treated by England on our return we didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all!!!! Isn't it disgraceful?"" Lady Duff-Gordon wrote. The prominent London fashion designer and her husband, a Scottish baronet, escaped by boarding Lifeboat 1, which transported 12 passengers despite having capacity for 40. Fewer than one-third of the more than 2,200 people aboard Titanic survived, hundreds fewer than could have lived if all of the lifeboats had been deployed and filled. The couple were the only two passengers asked to testify during the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the  sinking. Their testimony, along with allegations that Cosmo had bribed the crew to row away faster rather than try to rescue others, made them popular fodder for tabloids. Lifeboat 1 became known as the ""Money Boat."" Rumors that the Duff-Gordons tried to deter the crew from making other rescues were never corroborated, but Lady Duff-Gordon later said her husband was ""brokenhearted over the negative coverage for the rest of his life,"" according to a news release from RR Auction. ""We remain fascinated by the Titanic tragedy and will for years to come,"" RR Auction's Bobby Livingston said. A cup and saucer from the Titanic sold for $13,750. Also auctioned was a letter Grateful Dead front man Jerry Garcia sent to a former Vogue cover model he met at a New York party in 1980. The undated letter was postmarked June 22, 1982. In the letter, which sold for $32,500, Garcia asks the woman, ""Pardon my handwriting, this is the first letter I've written in years."" He includes a sketch with the words, ""Grateful Dead just played our first outdoor show of the year at a place called the Greek Theatre."" The historic Berkeley, California, music venue would become a home base for the band. Garcia died in 1995.

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- An Australian author was sentenced Monday to three years in prison in Thailand after falling foul of a Thai law that makes it a crime to insult the country's royal family. Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell on Monday. Harry Nicolaides was arrested last August over a 2005 book called ""Verisimilitude,"" which includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that the authorities deemed a violation of the Lese Majeste law. Nicolaides, 41, was bombarded with questions from foreign journalists as he arrived at the court Monday, wearing shackles as he stepped from a prison bus. In tears, he said he would plead guilty. ""Truth is stranger than fiction,"" he said. ""It's been an ordeal for months. It feels like a bad dream.""  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court » . The Thai Criminal Court originally sentenced Nicolaides to six years in jail but cut the punishment in half because of the guilty plea. He listened calmly as the verdict was translated to him. After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said: ""I wish my family the best.""  Watch Nicolaides' brother's reaction » . One of his lawyers said no decision had been made about whether to appeal or seek a royal pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej has pardoned foreigners in other similar cases in the past. CNN has chosen not to repeat the allegations made by Nicolaides because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand. Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism. He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31 last year. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him. ""I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self-interest,"" he said. Only 50 copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold. The law Nicolaides was convicted of breaking is section 112, known as the Lese Majeste law. It says: ""Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years."" Thailand's king is highly revered in this Buddhist nation, but even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also told CNN he is concerned about the misuse of the Lese Majeste law. ""There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes, and I agree this has to stop,"" he said. Despite the rhetoric there's little sign the prime minister will change the law. Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais.

"(CNN) -- In a quiet ceremony Friday at Arlington National Cemetery, a Marine killed three years ago in Iraq was reburied to be next to his close friend, a Navy SEAL who was recently killed in Afghanistan and who will be laid to rest alongside the Marine on Monday. The two casualties, Lt. Travis Manion and Lt. Brendan Looney, met a decade ago while attending the United States Naval Academy. They became close friends and lived together from sophomore year until their graduation in 2004, Travis' sister, Ryan Manion-Borek, told CNN. Their friendship was cut short in April 2007, when Manion was killed in Iraq during an ambush on the final patrol of his second tour of duty, according to the Department of Defense. He was 27. According to the Defense Department's website, Manion's actions ""ultimately saved the lives of every member of his patrol,"" and he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and the Bronze Star with Valor. The Iraqis named their new headquarters ""Combat Outpost Manion."" Though Manion-Borek told CNN that her brother had ""hoped to be buried in Arlington if anything happened to him,"" his family -- grief-stricken by the sudden loss -- chose to lay him to rest at a cemetery near his Pennsylvania home. When Looney heard the news of his friend's death, he was in Navy SEAL training and unable to leave. The situation almost drove him to quit the program. However, Manion-Borek said that after a phone call with Manion's mother Looney chose to stay, telling her he was, ""finishing this for Travis."" Looney went on to finish first in his SEAL class, a position known as ""Honor Man."" Following Manion's death, his family founded the Travis Manion Foundation, which helps soldiers who are returning home after deployments and veterans. In the foundation's first appearance at the Marine Corps Marathon as ""Team Travis,"" Looney was a teary-eyed guest speaker. Even through training and deployment, Looney continued to stay close to the Manion family and the foundation. But last week the Looney family got word that Brendan had died on September 21 in a black hawk helicopter crash in Afghanistan. He was 29. ""Brendan had told his brother that he would want to be buried next to Travis,"" Manion-Borek said. When Looney's wife Amy first heard the news, ""the first thing that came out of her mouth was, 'well then he has to be buried next to Travis,' "" Manion-Borek said. The Manion family immediately set to work with Arlington National Cemetery to try to transfer Travis' body. His body was exhumed and transported to Arlington, where it was laid to rest Friday during a ceremony attended by both families. Looney's body will join him on Monday. Describing the Looney family's presence at Friday's burial ceremony, Manion-Borek said that ""every single one of them came up to me and said thank you."" ""If anything can bring them comfort at this time, it's knowing that Brendan and Travis can be next to each other,"" she said. Manion's sister said that the Looney family will be attending the Marine Corps Marathon this year, like usual. This year, however, ""Team Travis"" will be dedicated to Lt. Looney.","The body of a Marine killed 3 years ago in Iraq was exhumed to be buried next to a close friend .

"The failed referendum in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is the first known instance of the issue being addressed at a local level, but it might not be the last. ""I think we'll see this more and more,"" said Mallory Quigley, communications director for Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. ""We're constantly doing things on the local level in terms of outreach because those methods are very effective in bringing about social change in general,"" said Tara Shaver, who with her husband, Bud, is with the group Project Defending Life. Albuquerque voters reject late-term abortion ban . The Shavers call themselves ""full-time pro-life missionaries."" They moved to Albuquerque three years ago, after waging an anti-abortion battle in Kansas, because Albuquerque has one of the few abortion clinics in the country to perform abortions beyond 20 weeks. Tara Shaver said the state legislature has repeatedly refused to take up a parental notification measure, one of the most basic steps for abortion opponents. The legislature ""never gives our bill the time of day,"" she told CNN. After watching a successful local campaign to place a minimum wage increase on the Albuquerque ballot in 2012, Shaver became inspired. She thought something similar could be done with abortion. It worked. After collecting 27,000 signatures of support, the measure got its own special election. While this is the first time a city has voted on whether to restrict abortions, the idea is not new. Social movements often start at the grass-roots level as cities and localities often shift more quickly than the federal government. That's where the movement to legalize marijuana got its start. ""Reformers have always used local referenda and initiative,"" Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law, said. Built on principles from the anti-Vietnam War protests, activists seized on a Nixon-era report that criticized the criminalization of marijuana. The report went nowhere at the federal level as Nixon was adamantly opposed to its findings, but activists used the report to organize in cities and towns in all 50 states, St. Pierre said. University towns, especially in the Midwest, including Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Madison, Wisconsin, acted to decriminalize pot. It became a trend and is still happening today. In this past election, three cities in Michigan voted to legalize pot. Although the vote was largely symbolic, it shows that local can still lead the way. Smoke clears for attitudes on pot, voters respond . It's an effort ""to get around recalcitrant legislators who don't want to even introduce bills,"" St. Pierre said. Another Midwest town played a central role in the lesbian and gay movement as well. East Lansing, Michigan, was the first place in the country to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. That was in the early '70s. Forty years later, Congress has still been unable to pass an LGBT workplace anti-discrimination bill. Sarah Warbelow, state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign, said her group ""works with municipalities all the time"" to pass and implement LGBT rights measures. Pro-choice advocates, however, caution the anti-abortion activists from overstepping and trying to chip away at settled law. ""What we're actually seeing because of the groundswell of anti-abortion overreach, we're seeing the entire movement put into an offensive posture,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. She added that Roe v. Wade is settled law and any attempt to roll back abortion access will get caught up in litigation. But the tactic also appeals to anti-abortion activists who hope the courts roll back Roe v. Wade. ""We are more than happy,"" Shaver said, ""to assist... and encourage people in the cities who have problems with state legislatures."" And an activist has already begun the process to ban late-term abortions in Valencia, a county neighboring Albuquerque.","Voters in Albuquerque rejected a ballot initiative to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy .
It is the first known instance the issue of abortion has been addressed at such a local level.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey is doing his best to avoid reporters since word leaked that he is the president's top choice to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But there was no way he was going to duck questions from this group on Friday so he charged right into a roomful of children, all of whom have lost fathers, and mothers and other relatives in war-time military service. The general shucked off his uniform coat, tuned up his singing voice for a rendition of his signature song from Frank Sinatra, who was also known as the chairman of the board, and gave them a few lines. ""Start spreading the news,"" he sang. The Dempsey show was on. He had an aide come out and hold the microphone while he did hand motions and sang ""The Unicorn"" song -- ""Well there were green alligators, and long neck geese, some humped back camels and some chimpanzees ..."" The questions and answers were also a hit. ""I do have my own airplane and that's pretty cool,"" said Dempsey. ""Four stars is pretty cool man,"" he said. ""Second Lieutenant was good too."" ""What's it like controlling so many soldiers?"" one child asked. ""All we really have to do is give them the training ... and turn 'em loose,"" he answered. Easy-going laughs erupted, but not always. If he indeed gets the nomination for the Joint Chiefs chairman post, Dempsey would be the senior ranking member of the armed forces. He would be the one who takes the drive across the Potomac River to meet with the president, carrying the advice of everyone in uniform to the commander in chief. But in some ways, facing this room may have seemed tougher than the Oval Office. This was a crowd brought together for Memorial Day weekend just outside Washington by TAPS, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, an organization that helps military kids as young as 4 cope with loss and grief. ""That is such a good question, and the question was, how do you keep people from dying,"" Dempsey said, repeating what had been too soft to hear. ""Sometimes we can't, (keep them from dying),"" he told his young audience. ""Because when you grow up and you're going to have to fight someone -- I think they answer is we try to get them ready as best we can, because sometimes God actually has another plan,"" Dempsey said. Before saying goodbye to the children, he led a rendition of ""The Army Song."" Soldiers in the crowd, some wearing T-shirts that read ""Mentor,"" rose to their feet. The crowd belted out the lyrics. ""First to fight for the right, and to build the nation's might. The Army Goes Rolling Along,"" the group sung.","Gen. Martin Dempsey could be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .

"New Delhi (CNN)The military option is out, President Barack Obama said Sunday, but the U.S. will be looking at all other options to ""ratchet up the pressure on Russia"" on the issue of Ukraine. ""We have no interest in seeing Russia weakened or its economy in shambles. We have a profound interest, as I believe every country does, in promoting a core principle, which is: Large countries don't bully smaller countries,"" Obama told reporters. Speaking in New Delhi after a lengthy flight on Air Force One, Obama said Sunday he will ""look at all the additional options that are available to us short of military confrontation."" On Monday, Obama will be the first U.S. leader to headline India's annual Republic Day parade, a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands, dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately Rajpath Boulevard. The parade will be a reminder of the decades of sometimes-tense relations between India and the U.S. A military demonstration at heart, the vehicles and equipment parading before Obama will be mostly Russian-made, a vestige of India's stance during the Cold War. Russia remains India's largest supplier of weapons, and while their share is steadily decreasing, Russian military imports still amount to three-quarters of India's stockpile. With U.S.-Russia relations worsening to Cold War levels, Obama hopes to balance Moscow's influence in India during his visit this week. His visit comes a day after city officials in Mariupol, Ukraine, said shelling in southeastern Ukraine killed at least 30 people, including two children. Another 102 people were injured, at least 75 of whom needed hospital treatment, and many suffered shrapnel injuries, Mariupol City Council said. Pro-Russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city, Donetsk regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said on his Facebook page. Monitors with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of Grad and Uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro-Russian rebel group Donetsk People's Republic. The shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov discussed Ukraine and Syria during a phone call, the State Department said. ""On Ukraine, the Secretary reiterated our condemnation of the separatists' grad missile attack on civilians in Mariupol ... and other separatist attacks,"" a statement said. ""The Secretary reiterated the need for an immediate resumption of the ceasefire, a withdrawal of heavy weapons, and closing the border. ""He also underscored U.S. readiness to participate in serious settlement efforts, making clear that deescalation is in everyone's interests, that Russia will be judged by its actions, and that the costs to Russia will only increase if attacks continue."" Kerry has previously warned of increased international pressure on Russia. ""We call on Russia to end its support for separatists immediately, close the international border with Ukraine, and withdraw all weapons, fighters and financial backing,"" Kerry said in a statement Saturday. The White House says Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko on Saturday. They ""expressed grave concern over Russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the September Minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict,"" the White House said. Thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year. A ceasefire agreed to in September in Minsk, Belarus, crumbled long ago.

"(CNN)Prime Minister Tony Abbott has shirt-fronted the Australian public by awarding a Knighthood to a foreigner who already has a lot silverware in the pool room: Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. As the nation choked on its cornflakes, many took to social media to express shock and dismay and repeat the question, ""Is this a joke?"" At an Australia Day function in Canberra, Abbott was forced to defend his decision and dismissed the reaction on Twitter as ""electronic graffiti."" ""I think that in the media, you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media. You wouldn't report what's sprayed up on the walls of buildings,"" Abbott was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. Of Prince Philip, Abbott said: ""He's the patron of hundreds of organizations. He's the inspiration and wellspring of the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards which have provided leadership training for tens if not hundreds of thousands of Australians over the years."" The 93-year-old duke is the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece, whose ancestors hail from Danish royalty. He married in Queen Elizabeth II in 1947, who is head of the Commonwealth and is required to sign off on Abbott's decision, an irony not lost on Australia's comedians. Gift for Santa? More like a gift to Republicans, some said. Abbott reintroduced damehoods and knighthoods last year, 28 years after they were retired under the leadership of Bob Hawke's Labor government. At the time, Abbott said the honor of becoming a ""Knight and Dame of the Order of Australia"" would be extended to ""Australians of extraordinary and pre-eminent achievement and merit."" ""My intention is that this new award will go to those who have accepted public office rather than sought it and who can never, by virtue of that office, ever entirely return to private life,"" he said. So far, only one dame and three knights have been appointed, including Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston, who has most recently led operations to recover lost Malaysian flights MH370 and MH17. Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Australia had entered a timewarp to extend the honor to English royalty. ""It's not about him, but he's a British royal -- why would we give him our top Australian honor? He's already got a lot of them,"" he said. Some wondered how Prince Philip would react to the announcement. For others, it was an opportunity to revive some the Duke's famous quotes. Some thought it was sure sign Phil could take some of Australia's other top honors. And then there was the lone voice, calling for calm... sort of. At the time of writing, Buckingham Palace had yet to release an official statement. Though its Twitter account posted a link to learn more about ""the Australian Royal Family."" Abbott didn't take to Twitter to try to stifle the spray of e-graffiti. His contribution to the great wall of outrage was a simple. Not likely, 'Straya says.","Social media storm over Australian PM's decision to knight Prince Philip .

"Tokyo (CNN)ISIS appears to have beheaded one of its Japanese hostages and is demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in Jordan to spare the other. A video file posted online Saturday by a known ISIS supporter shows an image of one hostage, Kenji Goto, holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive, Haruna Yukawa. The voice of a person claiming to be Goto speaks over the image, saying in English that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to blame for Yukawa's death. ""You were given a deadline,"" he says, referring to ISIS' earlier demand that Japan pay $200 million by Friday to save the lives of the two hostages. The voice then announces a new ultimatum: the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman facing the death penalty in Jordan for her role in a series of bombings in 2005 that killed dozens of people at hotels in the Arab kingdom. Al-Bayan Radio, an ISIS-affiliated online station, reported the extremist group's killing of Yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for Goto in its newscast Sunday. It didn't identify Goto by name. Abe condemned the apparent killing of Yukawa and called for Goto to be released immediately. ""Such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible, which causes me nothing but strong indignation,"" he said. Experts are analyzing the video, which seems ""highly credible,"" Abe said, an assessment shared by U.S. authorities, who said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity. But Goto's stepfather, Yukio Ishido, raised doubts about whether it was his stepson's voice in the video. ""I get the sense it's not his voice,"" he told reporters. ""I've heard his English a couple times. I felt it was a bit different."" Abe declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand, which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline. ""I would be surprised if the Jordanian government or Japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as ISIS has requested,"" said CNN global affairs analyst David Rohde, referring to al-Rishawi, whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated. After ISIS released the first video of the hostages Tuesday, Japan set up a crisis center in Jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties, such as governments in the region and tribal leaders. Japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism. They stressed that an aid package Abe had pledged to countries affected by ISIS, cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand, was only for humanitarian purposes. But the Japanese efforts appear to have failed to save Yukawa, 42, whose father was struggling to come to terms with the news. ""I still don't want to believe it,"" Shoichi Yukawa told Japanese broadcaster NHK, his face not shown in the report. ""If I can see him again, I'd like to hold him in my arms."" Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, had made an emotional plea Friday for the release of her son, saying he isn't an enemy of ISIS. ""Kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little,"" she said. ""He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.'"" Goto, 47, is an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones. He met Yukawa, who had dreams of setting up a private security firm, while they were both in Syria last year, according to friends. After Yukawa was reported to have been captured in August, Goto apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in Japan to go into ISIS territory to try to extricate him. ""I asked my son's wife why he had made this decision, and the response was that my son felt he had to do everything in his power to help and rescue his friend,"" Ishido said. But rather than save Yukawa, Goto ended up becoming another captive in the hands of a brutal militant group that has slaughtered countless Iraqis and Syrians, as well as three Americans and two Britons. U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Abe by phone Sunday from New Delhi, the White House said. Obama offered ""condolences for the murder"" of Yukawa by ISIS and conveyed ""solidarity with the Japanese people,"" according to a statement. Obama had condemned the killing in an earlier statement Saturday, saying the United States will work with its ally ""to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat"" ISIS. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the apparent beheading of Yukawa and ISIS' threats are ""yet another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists."" He suggested Japan was right not to bow to the terrorists' demand for ransom, saying that ""Britain strongly supports the firm stance Prime Minister Abe and his Government have taken."" The United States and Britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists. But other countries, notably France, have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by Islamic militants in recent years, despite denying it publicly. Japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past, according to The New York Times. In 1999, Tokyo handed over $3 million for the release of four mining experts held in Kyrgyzstan, the newspaper reported. Opinion: What hostage crisis means for Japan .

"Warsaw, Ohio (CNN) -- Seth Rice is a 2-year-old boy full of energy, curiosity and emotions. Watching him play with his toys, you don't notice any of the emotional toll that having a parent deploy can take on a little boy. Let alone having both parents deploy, for nearly seven months simultaneously. But that's what Seth's parents did, choosing to deploy to Afghanistan together, rather than have one stay home with Seth while the other deployed. That decision may be hard for some parents to fathom, but for the Rices it was the best option. ""It was very difficult,"" Marine Staff Sgt. Jeff Rice said in an interview from Camp Leatherneck, where he and his wife are based. ""It took a lot of back-and-forth discussions,"" Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Chat Rice said. Part of what made the decision less difficult was Seth's age. ""We were thinking that a 2-year-old wouldn't remember too much of us being gone than if we had to do it when he was 7, when he'd remember the whole thing,"" Jeff explained. Still, the day they left was hard for them. ""It was a very difficult day. Just wanted to hold him, told him we loved him, and that we'd be home soon, even though he didn't understand that,"" Jeff said. Chat couldn't put it into words: ""I don't think a mother could ever describe that feeling, leaving your son."" The genesis of the idea came from previous deployments, when Chat would came back from the war zone and Jeff had to leave a few weeks later. ""She deployed to Iraq in 2004 and then as soon as she came back I deployed to Iraq in 2005 shortly after. It was about two weeks that we got to hang out together. It was very hard, because you try to catch up in those two weeks."" So when new orders came, they decided they wanted more time together as a couple, and that that meant leaving their 2-year-old in the States. But that difficult decision was made much easier by Jeff's parents. ""They asked us if we would be willing to keep Seth and of course that was a no-brainer, we said yes,"" said Jamie Rice, Seth's grandfather. ""I'm just thankful that we've been able to be there, and spend time with him and see him a lot more than what we would have before,"" Pam Rice, Jeff's mother, said. ""It's just been a blessing."" Seth and his parents live in Southern California, and most of his relatives on his father's side live in Ohio. So for the last seven months he's gotten to know that side of his family. But perhaps the true saving grace for Jeff and Chat is a software application that wasn't even around when the war started in Afghanistan, the video chatting program Skype. The first time Jeff deployed to war, he wrote home only a few times. Now, with high-speed internet connections, he and Chat can call home and see Seth and he can see them. But since he's just 2, Seth is not the ideal video chatter yet. Instead of talking to his parents on the computer, he'll play with balloons or his basketball. He even puts the basketball in front of the computer screen with his mother and father on it and ask them to shoot. Jeff said these video chats are important to helping them cope. ""It's huge, because no matter how rough your day goes, we get to see our little son ... takes all the worries and everything away,"" Jeff said. ""It really boosts your morale ... being able to see him grow day by day, and hearing the new words he learned to say and showing you everything he learned."" Having the ability to communicate so easily with the home front can be a double-edged sword for deployed troops, said Kelly Hruska of the National Military Family Association. Hruska cites her own experience, as the wife of a soldier who deployed to Iraq but was frustrated when their daughter refused to Skype with him, avoiding the sessions. ""'Why doesn't she want to talk with me?'"" Kelly recalls her husband asking. ""It was after a few months that we finally realized that her way of coping with the deployment was out-of-sight, out-of-mind. And that by talking to him on the phone, by Skyping with him -- it was just a reminder that he wasn't there and it was hard on her."" Technology also means troops can't immerse themselves in war, like they used to. For some, it means dealing with problems at home that previously would be out of sight, out of mind. Jeff and Chat are expected to return to Southern California on Thursday, and that's when this difficult choice pays off. Instead of just a couple of weeks together, the Rice family will have months and months without much concern that either parent or both will have to head off to war again. Perhaps the only regrets on that day will be from Seth's grandparents. ""We're already dreading letting him go back because we're gonna miss him, so I can't imagine how his parents feel,"" Jamie said. ""It would just be devastating, I think.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria postponed its parliamentary election Saturday due to a ""terrible unfortunate emergency"" caused by the late arrival of voting materials, the head of the election commission said. Nigerians will instead go to the polls Monday, said Attahiru Jega, chairman of the Independent National Election Commission. ""We cannot proceed with these elections if we want them to be free, fair and credible if there are no result sheets,"" Jega said. ""We cannot bury our heads and say there are no problems. It is regrettable. It is unfortunate. It should not have happened."" Jega said he takes full responsibility for the fiasco but he said a vendor that was supplying results sheets and ballots was unable to deliver them on time. The vendor, said Jega, cited the diversion of planes to carry relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Japan as the reason for the delay. Citizens of Africa's most populous nation were supposed to vote Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. They are scheduled to vote next Saturday in a presidential election and for state governors the following week. Before the logistical problems, the election, the most expensive in Nigeria's history, had already been marred by riots, bombings and assassinations. ""The unprecedented levels of violence that have seen several people either killed, maimed, kidnapped or intimidated for political reasons pose the single most significant threat to the conduct of general elections,"" warned the Nigeria Elections Situation Room -- a forum of groups focusing on the upcoming elections. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 70 people have been killed in political violence in the run-up to the voting. The European Union described Nigeria's 2007 elections as the worst they had ever seen anywhere in the world, with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria had hoped to gain a cleaner image this year. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","The election commission chairman apologizes for the delay .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two suspected drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region Wednesday killed eight suspected militants, intelligence officials said. In the first incident, one missile was fired on a militant hideout in the area of Mir Ali of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, the two intelligence officials said. Five were killed. Later, a second suspected U.S. drone strike killed three individuals believed to be militants, the officials said. The drone fired two missiles at a vehicle in the Data Khel area of North Waziristan. According to a CNN count, Wednesdays strikes were the 81st and 82nd this year, compared with 52 in 2009. The officials asked to not be named because they were not authorized to talk to the media. While the United States is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials usually do not comment on suspected drone strikes.","NEW: Second strike kills three suspect militants, officials say .

""We are aware of 10 deaths,"" said Gen. Manuel Garcia Ruiz, public security secretary in Michoacan. In a separate shootout in La Piedad, another person was killed while an officer was wounded, he said. Finally, authorities confirmed three men had died in the community of Santo Domingo. Their bodies were found Friday morning in a vehicle riddled by bullets, according to police. It was not immediately clear what, or who, was behind the violence, though Michoacan has long been a hotbed of drug-related activity. Various cartels, including the Knights Templar, La Familia Michoacana and Los Zetas, are known to operate in the area. Nearly 43,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.","The dead include 10 people killed in a shootout with soldiers .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- On the same day it ratcheted up its rhetoric against North Korea, South Korea on Monday decided to put off an artillery drill on the island central to the latest conflagration between the two nations, state-run media reported. South Korean military officials ""delayed"" the drill on Yeonpyeong Island that had been scheduled for Tuesday, according to the official Yonhap News Agency. Earlier, island residents had been told to move to bomb shelters for the drill. The announcement came as North Korea stepped up its threats recently on its southern rival, as well as the United States, if any military activities infringe on what the communist nation considers its territory. South Korea earlier deployed more long-range artillery and rocket launchers to the border island in the Yellow Sea, which was struck by North Korean shelling last week, according to military officials quoted by Yonhap. Also Monday, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned that North Korea will face severe consequences if it launches another military attack across its southern border. ""If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail,"" Lee said in a nationally televised address. ""We are aware of the historic lesson that a disgraceful peace achieved through intimidation only brings about greater harm in the end."" Lee said Monday that South Korea ""cannot remain patient"" in the face of continued hostility from Pyongyang. ""Fellow citizens, at this point, actions are more important than words,"" Lee said in a televised address. ""Please have trust in the government and the military and support us."" The divided peninsula -- tense at the best of times -- has been near the boiling point since Tuesday, when four people died in a North Korean artillery barrage that targeted Yeonpyeong Island. Lee called the attack an ""inhuman crime"" that followed decades of attacks by North Korea, including the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March. North Korea has consistently denied responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. ""It is difficult at this point to expect North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons or military adventurism,"" Lee said. ""We are now clearly aware that we cannot stay patient and be generous. That will only give rise to bigger provocations."" Lee's address came a day after South Korean and U.S. forces started joint military exercises, prompting a furious response from North Korea. The aircraft carrier USS George Washington joined South Korea's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea for the four-day drill, which the North called ""no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost,"" according to the official Korean Central News Agency. China, North Korea's closest ally, called Sunday for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the Korean peninsula. Top diplomats from the six nations -- which also include Japan, the United States and Russia -- need to meet soon to ""maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and ease the tension"" in the region, Beijing's special representative for the region, Wu Dawei, said Sunday. A top Chinese envoy met with Lee on Sunday, and a high-ranking North Korean official will visit Beijing on Tuesday, China's Xinhua news agency said. South Korea said Sunday that it did not think the time was right for a resumption of the six-party talks but said it would ""bear in mind"" the Chinese proposal. In Washington, a State Department official said that the United States is consulting with its allies but that resumed six-party talks ""cannot substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations."" ""Clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. And U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the flare-up exposed the failure of ""continued appeasement"" of North Korea by Republican and Democratic administrations. He said the United States has given North Korea more than $1 billion in aid over the past 15 years with the goal of getting them to the negotiating table. ""It seems the purpose of everything is to get the North Koreans to the table,"" said McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""The North Koreans' only claim to their position on the world stage is their nuclear capability. And they have a terrible, most repressive, oppressive regime in the world. They have hundreds of thousands of people in slave labor camps. And all of that seems to be sacrificed in the altar of, quote, 'negotiations.' "" Meanwhile, the Washington-based ANSWER Coalition called for ""an end to the U.S.-South Korean provocations"" and announced rallies in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, on Monday. ""The United States and South Korean governments have been pursuing a policy of deliberate provocation over the past several months,"" targeting North Korea and China, ANSWER's website states. ""While hypocritically calling for 'calm' in words, Washington is escalating the crisis by its actions,"" it said, referring to the U.S.-South Korea military exercises and the USS George Washington. In his Monday speech, South Korea's Lee said efforts to resolve the international standoff through negotiations and humanitarian assistance to the North were met with ""nuclear development and the sinking of the Cheonan."" He said the attack on Yeonpyeong Island would have been unlawful even in wartime, adding, ""I cannot but be angered at their cruelty."" North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from a South Korean millitary drill landed in the North's waters. The North called reports of civilian casualties part of South Korea's ""propaganda campaign"" and accused the ""enemy"" of creating ""a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation."" The violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in South Korea. The country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young, resigned after the exchange of fire. Veterans of the South Korean military protested over the weekend on the streets of Seoul, saying they were angry that their country's government had not done enough to respond to the North's shelling. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flashpoint on the Korean peninsula in recent years. The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. North and South Korea are still technically at war.

"(CNN) -- A Libyan government spokesman said Thursday that forces loyal to embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi did not fire a missile at NATO warships, as he had told reporters a day earlier. The Italian frigate Bersagliere reported spotting a suspected missile about 19 kilometers (12 miles) off the port city of Zlitan on Wednesday. The weapon had fallen harmlessly into the sea, according to Italy's defense ministry and NATO. Government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim told reporters that government forces were responsible for the attack, but said Thursday that his comment was ""a misunderstanding."" Ibrahim told CNN that military officials later told him they hadn't launched a missile at the NATO fleet currently off Libya. ""We did not fire any missiles into the sea against the ship,"" Ibrahim told CNN. Gadhafi's forces have been battling a nearly six-month-long revolt that has split Libya roughly in half. NATO planes and warships joined the fight in March, pounding government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from reprisals by Gadhafi loyalists. Though most of the allied campaign has been conducted from the air, NATO warships reported fighting at least two brief sea engagements with pro-Gadhafi forces off the port city of Misrata in May.

"(CNN)This is no ordinary snow storm, weather experts say. The National Weather Service is using terms such as ""life-threatening"" and ""historic"" to describe the system ready to spread across the Northeast. The storm could dump up to 3 feet of snow in Boston and New York before it ends Tuesday, along with freezing rain and strong wind gusts possibly reaching hurricane level. Blizzard and winter storm warnings are up from New Jersey through Maine and into Canada. Airlines began canceling flights by the hundreds.  FlightAware, a travel website, put the total at more than 1,800 early Monday . ""We plan to cancel all flights Tuesday at Newark, LaGuardia and JFK, as well as Boston and Philadelphia,"" said United Airlines Spokeswoman Mary Ryan. Other airlines were implementing similar measures. Check first if you're flying into or out of the region. ""I want everyone to understand that we are facing -- most likely -- one of the largest snowstorms in the history of this city,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. He repeated throughout a Sunday afternoon news conference that people should expect delays, very slow or stalled commutes Monday evening. Whatever people do to be cautious, he said, do more. ""My message to all New Yorkers is prepare for something worse than we have seen before. Prepare to be safe. Take every precaution. Now is the time to get ready for this extreme weather,"" he said. ""Don't underestimate this storm."" The Weather Service says whiteout conditions will make travel extremely dangerous in the entire affected area.  Wind gusts in the New York City area could hit 65 mph. The blizzard warning is in effect from 1 p.m. Monday through Tuesday, with the worst conditions expected from late Monday evening through midday Tuesday. In Massachusetts, emergency management officials warned that the winter storm will be potentially ""historic and destructive."" Snow in the southeastern part of Massachusetts could morph into a period of freezing rain. And a major nor'easter is likely to develop on Monday and move up the northeast coast, forecasters said. Travel across Massachusetts during the storm could be impossible and life-threatening, according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. It's unclear just how much snow might be on the way, but the National Weather Service is saying 1 to 2 feet is possible. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency tweeted Sunday that the state would be under a blizzard watch Monday. That area's storm conditions aren't predicted to let up until Wednesday morning. Christine Carew, a sales associate in Boston, said customers have been coming into the hardware store  to grab last-minute snow supplies. Parents and their children have popped in to buy sleds and others are picking up shovels, ice melt and snow brushes. ""This is kind of typical,"" she said about Boston getting a lot of snow. ""We're more prepared for it. We know it's going to happen."" There's little chance the store will be closed Monday, no matter how hard it snows. The manager, she said, lives above the store. Eight counties in Massachusetts are already under a winter storm watch: Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, Worcester, Barnstable, Nantucket and Dukes. A blizzard watch is in effect for Essex, Middlesex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth counties.  Barnstable, Nantucket and Dukes counties also face a high wind watch. Derek and Jim Missert have lived in the Boston area for years. On Sunday they prepared to ride out the storm by being as prepared as they usually are, with plenty of food and water on hand. Jim Missert lives outside the city, so he expects to lose power and has a generator. Derek Missert expects that he'll not lose electricity as he works from home in the city. There could be coastal flooding in the state starting early Tuesday with pockets of major flooding on east-facing coastlines, the state emergency agency said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged New Yorkers to prepare immediately for the storm, saying they should plan for ""major disruptions"" during Monday and Tuesday morning commutes. Roads could be closed and power could go out, he said in a news release Sunday, and New Yorkers need to look out for downed power lines and tree limbs. Cuomo directed all state agencies to prepare. New York has at least 1,806 plows and more than 126,000 tons of salt to spray on roads across the region. The National Guard will also have six dozen personnel and 20 vehicles stationed throughout the state starting on Monday morning. The mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, Mark Boughton, recently made the news for creating the popular Twitter hashtag ""#Icezilla"" when a major storm hit his area.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- The son of the iconic founder of modern Kenya and two other powerful figures in the East African nation -- all accused of crimes against humanity -- made their first appearances before the International Criminal Court at The Hague on Friday. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura and former national police Chief Hussein Ali are suspected of a range of crimes after the country's disputed 2007 election. Kenyatta is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president. It comes a day after three others -- Former Agriculture Minister William Ruto, opposition leader Henry Kosgey and radio journalist Joshua Arap Sang -- had their first appearances before the court. All six are accused of organizing post-election violence that left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands more. Their presence at The Hague has reverberated across Kenya and is a ""big statement"" for the democratic society and the rule of law, said Martin Oloo, a Kenyan political scientist and a high court advocate. ""It is an indication that yes, responsibility and public action is possible where it is deemed that crimes have happened; where it is deemed that some people need to be taken to account for their actions,"" he said. ""I think that is a good statement in a political scene such as Kenya's, and perhaps Africa generally, because we have known impunity to thrive, we have known leadership to be unaccountable, and this is a statement that says, 'wait, you better be ready to account for your actions.' "" The two groups of three come from opposite sides in the country's disputed presidential election. The chaos and violence after the 2007 election escalated into ethnic violence pitting supporters of incumbent President Mwai Kibaki against those of challenger Raila Odinga, who was later named prime minister in a power-sharing agreement. Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali are accused of committing or contributing to the killing, rape and other acts of violence against supporters of Odinga's opposition Orange Democratic Movement. The judge set a September 21 date to hear arguments as to whether they should go to trial. Ruto, Sang and Kosgey are accused of being perpetrators in the murder, deportation and commission of other offenses against supporters of Kenya's Party of National Unity. The judge set a September 1 date for their arguments. Ekaterina Trendafilova, the presiding judge, said if more crimes are committed, the court could replace summonses with arrest warrants. ""It came to the knowledge of the chamber through following some articles in the Kenyan newspapers that there are movements toward retriggering the violence in Kenya, by way of delivering dangerous speeches,"" the judge said. Kenya has challenged the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on Kenyan soil. Oloo said the case is ""most important"" because it draws a line for Kenya. ""It says that 'wait a minute, you cannot go about your business and commit all crimes, and do whatever you want to do all in the name of acquiring power, and get away with it,' "" he said. The Netherlands-based court calls itself, on its website, ""an independent international organization ... established to help end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.""

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Protesters taking to the streets in Egypt on Wednesday felt the wrath of security forces, a day after an unparalleled display of public rage at the government and full-throated cries for the ouster of the longtime president. Police turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters in the early hours of Wednesday morning to try to break up anti-government demonstrations as the Interior Ministry warned it ""will not allow any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations."" In the heart of Cairo, people were being beaten with sticks and fists and demonstrators were being dragged away amid tear gas. Witnesses saw security forces harassing journalists and photographers. Demonstrations continued into the nighttime hours. Egypt's official MENA news agency reported that at least 90 people were detained Wednesday while trying to demonstrate in downtown Cairo's Tahrir Square. The country's main opposition party, the Muslim Brotherhood, said Wednesday that 149 of its members were arrested during the protests. The state-run Nile News TV reported violent clashes Wednesday night between security forces and protesters in Suez, a port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez. At least 27 people were wounded, Nile News said, most of them police officers. Quoting provincial officials, the station said most of the clashes took place in the Alarbeen neighborhood and that looters attacked some shops. The Muslim Brotherhood said 35 people were injured in Suez and that security forces in the city had implemented a curfew there Wednesday night. Egypt's Interior Ministry denied claims of curfews in parts of the country, MENA reported. Dozens of Bedouins, meanwhile, gathered Wednesday in the Sheikh Zwayd area near Rafah -- close to Egypt's border with Gaza -- and tried to stop traffic on the international road by setting tires on fire and throwing rocks at cars, MENA reported. The Interior Ministry urged ""citizens to renounce attempts to bid and trade their problems and not lose sight of the consequences of provocation for those who attempt to try to open the door to a state of chaos or portray the situation in the country this way."" At least 10 journalists have been beaten by Egyptian security personnel during the demonstrations, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday. Lina Attalah, the managing editor of the English-language edition of the newspaper Al-Masry al-Youm, was attacked in downtown Cairo, CPJ reported. ""I started running, but four policemen pulled me by my hair and kicked me in my face and back,"" Attalah told CPJ by phone. ""I tried telling them that I'm a journalist but they were too busy kicking me."" Her glasses were broken and police confiscated two cell phones, the journalists group said in a Wednesday statement. The Committee to Protect Journalists also said Wednesday that Egyptian authorities have shut down the websites of two popular independent newspapers, Al-Dustour and El-Badil. The clampdown comes after thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on Tuesday in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in another North African nation, Tunisia. At least four people died in the Tuesday clashes, the Interior Ministry reported -- three protesters in Suez and one police officer in Cairo. It also said at least 102 security personnel were injured. The Interior Ministry put the size of the Tuesday demonstration in Cairo's Tahrir Square at 10,000 at its peak, falling to 5,000. CNN estimated that demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000. But Wednesday is a work day in Egypt, so the numbers on the streets of Cairo were lower than they were on Tuesday, a holiday known as Police Day. Protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living, failed economic policies and corruption, but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand -- the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, a reliable American ally who has been in power for three decades. Egyptian authorities have been aware of complaints, but protesters widely believe the government has simply paid lip service to their grievances. There is talk among protesters about staging a big demonstration on Friday, after Muslim prayers. Twitter said it was blocked for the second day on Wednesday but added that ""some users are using apps/proxies to successfully tweet."" Magdi Radi, spokesman for Egypt's prime minister, told CNN that the government ""didn't block Facebook, Twitter or any other website. He said that ""the websites may have been slow because of the heavy usage."" The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, a human rights group, on Wednesday underscored a ""national demand"" -- the dismissal of Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli. ""Yesterday, disengagement of peaceful gatherings by using excessive force was added to his crimes as well as arbitrary arrests of hundreds of citizens and detaining them in illegal locations, such as security camps of Darrasa in Cairo and Madinet el Salam at the outskirts of Cairo, two locations completely controlled by the Interior Ministry."" The group said police ""turned into monsters attacking demonstrators, especially small clusters in side streets, without distinction between an elderly man or a woman or youth."" Organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians, who forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule. But Mubarak, unlike Ben Ali, remains in his country. Stories that Mubarak or any other member of his family left Egypt are ""categorically false,"" said Karim Haggag, Egyptian Embassy spokesman in Washington. Calling its relationship with Egypt ""strong and friendly,"" the U.S. State Department regards Mubarak's help in maintaining security in the Mideast as critical. The government, which has diplomatic relations with Israel, has helped forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians and has helped in efforts to stabilize Iraq, the State Department said. It contributes to U.N. peacekeeping missions, ""played a key role during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis,"" and is a ""key supporter of U.S. efforts against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, the department said in a background note about Egypt. U.S. military aid to Egypt totals over $1.3 billion annually, and the U.S. Agency for International Development has passed along more than $28 billion in economic and development assistance to the country since 1975. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday that the Obama administration continues to monitor the situation. He called on all parties to refrain from violence and said authorities should lift bans on protests. Asked at Wednesday's briefing whether the U.S. continues to back Mubarak, Gibbs said that ""Egypt is a strong ally."" On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh spoke to reporters about the ferment in the Arab world. Clinton urged freedom for people and called on Egyptian authorities not to block social media. She urged the countries in the region to enact reforms and expressed optimism that the leaders there can do so. ""It is something that everyone knows must be on the agenda of the government as they -- not just respond to the protests -- but as they look beyond to what needs to be done economically, socially, politically. And there are a lot of very well-informed, active, civil society leaders in Egypt who have put forward specific ideas for reform and we are encouraging and urging the Egyptian government to be responsive to that."" Jordan has experienced demonstrations over economic issues, and the foreign minister was asked whether the protests that raged in Tunisia and Egypt will spread. Judeh said Jordan doesn't exist in an economic bubble and faces hardships that other lands endure. But he said the country is tackling a political and economic reform agenda and its system promotes freedom of expression.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Leaders of two tribal groups in Yemen say they will join protests demanding President Ali Abdullah Saleh's resignation following violent crackdowns on demonstrators in Aden. ""The Yemeni people will not stay quiet on the blood that was spilled in Aden and we will avenge for them,"" said Hussein Ahmar, president of the Yemen Solidarity Council, on Saturday. ""We call on all those loyal to Yemen to stand with the revolution until this regime falls."" The Yemen Solidarity Council is comprised largely of member of Saleh's own Hashid tribe. Members of the Baqil tribe will also join in protests, according to Ahmar. But Saleh appeared to be standing firm, saying Saturday during a meeting with military leaders there was a plot against Yemeni unity, according to the official Saba news agency. The agency also said Saleh received pledges of support from sheikhs and local officials from Abyan Province during a meeting Saturday. Medical officials said Saturday that four people died and 26 were wounded -- some critically -- following clashes that erupted Friday night between anti-government protesters and security forces in southern Yemen. Amnesty International said at least 11 people had died in Friday's protests, bringing the overall death toll since protests began to 27. The international human rights group said that it has received reports that Yemeni security officials have prevented people from taking wounded people to the hospital. ""Events in Yemen are taking a serious turn for the worse and the Yemeni security forces are showing reckless disregard for human life,"" said Philip Luther, the group's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. Witnesses said the victims of Friday's violence were anti-government demonstrators hit by gunfire when security forces shot into crowds of protesters in the city's Mualla district after 10 p.m. Friday. Yemeni government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. On Friday, authorities insisted no one had been killed in clashes in another part of Aden, but witnesses said one protester died of gunshot wounds and 11 demonstrators were wounded. The violence occurred after protesters gathered Friday across Yemen to demand Saleh's resignation. Thousands of anti-government demonstrators -- mostly students -- lined the streets outside Sanaa University in the nation's capital. They were countered by a pro-government demonstration on Tahrir Square, where thousands waved flags and held up pictures of Saleh, who has ruled Yemen since 1978. The country has been wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment has fueled much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. Demonstrators in recent anti-government protests have also cited government corruption and a lack of political freedom. Saleh has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections, and he has said he supports the creation of a national unity government to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections. Baqil tribal leader Faisal Dhalee said Saleh is making a mistake in trying to hang on. ""If the ruling party had some wisdom left, than it would quickly leave power,"" he said. Saleh he has refused to step aside immediately. On Monday, he compared the anti-government protests to an illness sweeping through the region. ""This is a virus and is not part of our heritage or the culture of the Yemeni people,"" he told reporters. ""It's a virus that came from Tunisia to Egypt. And to some regions, the scent of the fever is like influenza. As soon as you sit with someone who is infected, you'll be infected.""

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Announcing Debbie Reynolds as this year's recipient of the SAG Life Achievement Award, SAG-AFTRA president Ken Howard saluted her as ""a tremendously talented performer with a diverse body of screen and stage work, live performances and several hit records."" But that's something of an understatement. Reynolds, 82, has been performing since age 16, when she won the title of Miss Burbank. That led to a contract at Warner Bros., where she spent two years before she was scooped up by MGM, the mecca of musicals. Read more SAG Awards: Debbie Reynolds to Receive Lifetime Achievement Honor . What was your reaction when you learned you'd been chosen to receive SAG's Life Achievement Award? Ken Howard called and told me I was picked for the award. It was a surprise to me — I was amazed and am delighted to receive it. The last recipient was Rita Moreno, who's an old friend of mine from our MGM days — we were under contract at the same time. It's special because it's from my peers — people who have talent and know what you do — so I'm looking forward to it! I've asked my daughter, Carrie [Fisher], to present it to me, and we're bringing the whole family, so it will be a family affair! Looking back, what was your big break? I loved Betty Hutton and Judy Garland and all the musicals, and I came into the business after entering the Miss Burbank contest, doing a Betty Hutton imitation and winning the prize, which led to a studio contract and the beginning of my career. Which of your films do you feel proudest of? ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" was my favorite role and the best part that I had to play, as was ""Mother,"" a wonderful Albert Brooks movie that he wrote a great screenplay for. I also loved ""How the West Was Won,"" ""The Tender Trap"" with Frank Sinatra, ""The Mating Game"" with Tony Randall — and I had great fun working on ""Goodbye Charlie"" with Walter Matthau, who I thought was a wonderful man. But the greatest movie that I was a part of was ""Singin' in the Rain."" I was very fortunate that [producer] Arthur Freed took a young girl who had no training at all — didn't dance, didn't sing, didn't do anything — and gave her a chance to be in that film. And then I had to prove myself! I owe a lot to him and [MGM executives] L.B. Mayer — Mr. Mayer — and Benny Thau and Irving Thalberg. It was the era when they would take an unknown girl and make a star of her overnight. I was lucky. God was very good to me. Read more Carrie Fisher to Present Mother Debbie Reynolds With SAG Lifetime Achievement Award . What was it like to work at MGM in its heyday? They ran it like a university might be run. They had one floor of producers, one floor of directors, one floor of writers. And another building were all the editors. And everybody had students under them, learning the business. So there were always the top writers, and then there were the younger writers, and they were being taught by the older writers, and everybody kind of shared ideas. You had your drama teacher, then you had your voice teacher; you learned how to interpret classical and regular lyrics, then you had your music department — Johnny Green, Andre Previn, Connie Salinger, all these great musicians and writers and lyricists and arrangers. Is it true that, while working with Gene Kelly on ""Singin' in the Rain,"" you were being tutored by Fred Astaire? Yes, it's true. He was working on the soundstage next door to us, and he kept encouraging me not to be discouraged, not to cry, to keep practicing and to believe that I could do it. He would let me watch him rehearse — he never let anyone watch him rehearse — so I could see how hard it was, no matter how great your natural talent. You were, until recently, a great collector of movie memorabilia. What do you think of the Academy's plan for its own Museum of Motion Pictures? The biggest fan of all time is me. Anyone who's a fan wants to touch an object held by their favorite star. We should have had a museum many, many years ago. It's much too late. We're behind on it. But I'm excited and looking forward to it. Read more Debbie Reynolds 'Hurt' by Academy for Refusing Her Memorabilia Collection [4] . How did you feel about your daughter following you into the business? And now returning to the Star Wars franchise? George Lucas is a great producer, and I'm very grateful to him for giving my daughter an opportunity to play a great part. My first [big] role was ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and my daughter's first [big] role was ""Star Wars."" I had one bun for a hairdo, and Carrie had two buns! She just finished the new ""Star Wars"" — and my granddaughter, Billie Lourd, is playing a role in it, too! It's very exciting to see my granddaughter jumping into the fray also. If director J.J. Abrams had asked you to play a cameo in the new ""Star Wars"" with your daughter and granddaughter, what would you have said? I would have said yes! It would have been great fun. I'm not sure they would have agreed; in fact, they must not have, because they didn't invite me in. Otherwise I would have been there. Are you still traveling and performing a lot? I was until just this last February, when I closed in Las Vegas. I'm going to cut way back now. I have never taken any time off — no vacation ever in 66 years — so I'm going to take off. I haven't been feeling really well the last two years, so I've decided that God is giving me a sign: ""Take it easy, kid!"" And I'm going to do just that.

And I like new movies — I liked ""Into the Woods."" The parts are so different. I was in musicals and comedies, mostly; the young actors today have more dramatic films, fuller roles to play than I had the opportunity to do. I enjoy watching all of them.

"(CNN) -- The death of an Air Force technical sergeant in Iraq last week quietly brought a somber milestone: One hundred American female service members have died in Iraq, according to a CNN count of Pentagon figures. A U.S. Army bugler plays taps during burial services for a female soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in 2005. The latest death was Tech. Sgt. Jackie L. Larsen, 37, of Tacoma, Washington, who died of natural causes July 17 at Balad Air Base, Iraq. She was assigned to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, Beale Air Force Base, California, according to the Pentagon. The death comes during what may be the lowest monthly toll in the war. Pentagon records show that at least nine U.S. troops have died in July. The lowest number in the war was in May, with 19. The total of U.S. service member deaths in the Iraq war now stands at 4,124. Of the 100 female service members who died: . Meanwhile, a female suicide bomber detonated explosives at an Awakening Council checkpoint just outside Baquba, killing eight people and wounding 24 Thursday night, police said. The checkpoint is two kilometers (1.4 miles) from Baquba, the capital of Diyala province. Those killed and wounded were mostly members of an anti-al Qaeda group, the police said. An Awakening Council leader was among the dead, police said. An Interior Ministry official identified the leader as Naim al-Dulaimi, a high-ranking local leader of the 1920 Revolution Brigades. The brigades are a former nationalist insurgent group turned into an Awakening group, fighting al Qaeda in Iraq. There have been about two dozen female suicide bombings in Iraq. The bulk of them have been in Diyala. The ethnically mixed province that stretches north and east of Baghdad and borders Iran. Last month, a female suicide bomber attacked a crowded area in Baquba's center, killing at least 16 people and wounding 40. Police, women and children were among the casualties, authorities said at the time. Many Awakening Councils, whose members are predominantly Sunni, have been recruited by the U.S. military to work against al Qaeda in Iraq and other militias. Elsewhere, attackers in Iraq's capital over the past 24 hours killed three members of an anti-insurgent group and wounded a senior member of the prime minister's political party, officials said. Three members of an Awakening Council who were manning checkpoints in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya were gunned down by attackers in a car Thursday morning, according to a local leader of the Awakening Council. Adhamiya, in Baghdad's northeastern area, used to be controlled by al Qaeda in Iraq fighters. The area had once been rife with attacks against U.S. and Iraqi targets. But as the Awakening movement took hold in the neighborhood over the past year, violence declined. An Interior Ministry official said Abdul Rahman Dawood, a senior member of the Dawa party, was wounded in a bombing at his house in southeastern Baghdad late Wednesday. Dawa, a Shiite movement that is part of the United Iraqi Alliance bloc, is the party of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The prime minister is in Europe this week. He traveled to Germany, where he met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, and is to meet with leaders in Italy and the Vatican. In another development, Turkish warplanes late Wednesday bombed three villages in northern Iraq where Kurdish rebels were thought to be based, a border security officer said Thursday. The strikes -- the latest by the Turkish military against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants -- occurred in the Zab region of Duhuk province in Iraq's Kurdish region. The officer said the bombing lasted for an hour, and there were no reports of casualties. Duhuk is one of three provinces that make up the Kurdish region in Iraq. Turkey has been fighting PKK separatists for years in the southeastern part of Turkey. Turkey has been going after PKK bases just over its border with northern Iraq, where the group has been staging cross-border attacks.

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and another injured in a chemical plant explosion late Thursday near Charleston, West Virginia. Sterling Lewis Jr., West Virginia's fire marshal, told reporters Friday morning that a helicopter took the injured person to a burn unit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Several thousand people were ordered to stay indoors for safety early Friday after the 10:30 p.m. Thursday blast at the Bayer CropScience plant raised fears about air quality. The plant produces crop-protection chemicals in Institute, an unincorporated community in Kanawha County, West Virginia. Jeannie Young, 38, turned off air conditioners, closed vents and taped windows shut at her St. Albans home after the nearby explosion. ""My daughter and I have headaches,"" Young said.

Authorities lifted the order about 2:15 a.m. after the Bayer CropScience plant told the county that the explosion did not send contaminants into the air, said Carolyn Charnoch, director of the 911 system in Kanawha County. The blast sent flames leaping into the night sky, casting an orange glow on industrial towers, but firefighters had extinguished the blaze by about 2 a.m., she said. A few people complained of a foul odor, she said, but authorities had not heard from anyone complaining of health problems related to air quality, Charnoch said. Mike Dorsey of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection sought to reassure people that the air was safe to breath.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Seven U.S. troops were killed near Baghdad early Monday in a vehicle rollover accident, U.S. officials said. U.S. troops question a man who was out after a curfew Sunday night in Baghdad. Officials do not believe any hostile fire was involved. The location and name of the unit were not available as officials attempted to notify next of kin. The U.S. military also said that a Task Force Lightning soldier died Sunday from injuries caused by rocket fire during a patrol in the northern Tameem province. The number of U.S. military deaths in the Iraq war stands at 3,770, including seven civilian employees of the Defense Department. Also Monday, 12 militants were killed in fighting between troops and insurgents just outside the northern city of Samarra, the U.S. military said. The military said Iraqi and U.S. troops conducting a helicopter assault raid were confronted by militants from al Qaeda in Iraq. Insurgents fired at troops and wounded three U.S. soldiers, a statement said. Backed up by helicopters, Iraqi and U.S. ground forces fired back, the statement said, killing 12 people described as ""enemy extremists."" Three people were detained and a fourth ""was positively identified as a hostage being held for ransom by the insurgents."" Samarra has been the scene of much fighting in recent months. The city in Salaheddin province  is the site of Al-Askariya Mosque, the Shiite shrine that was attacked twice, apparently by Sunni militants.  Watch U.S. soldiers give a tour of life in Iraq » . The U.S. military also claimed success against militants in volatile Diyala province. The military said Monday that nine insurgents were killed and 10 detained during an Iraqi and U.S. operation called Operation Lightning Hammer II, which began last week. Soldiers were operating in the Baquba, Muqdadiya and Balad Ruz areas. ""The value of these operations is vital as we continue to pressure and target al Qaeda elements who feel they have a power base in Diyala province,"" said Lt. Col. James George. Meanwhile, an official announced a slight easing of security measures in Baghdad during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a religious observation that begins this week. Brig. Gen. Qassim Atta, an Iraqi military spokesman, said on Iraqia TV that the nightly curfew will go into effect at midnight instead of 11 p.m. during Ramadan.  It will last until 5 a.m. The Friday vehicle curfew from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. will be dropped during the month. But vehicles won't be permitted over many of the Tigris River bridges linking eastern and western Baghdad. It is unclear what other security measures will be enforced. Muslims fast during daylight hours during Ramadan. In the evening, they eat small meals and visit with friends and family. Iraq's prime minister on Monday touted his government's efforts in thwarting ""sectarian war"" but acknowledged Iraqi troops are not yet ready to take over security duties from the U.S.-led coalition. ""We have succeeded in preventing Iraq from going into sectarian war -- which threatened our dear Iraq -- and I am fully confident that national reconciliation is our only way that takes Iraq into safety in spite of all the destabilizing actions by local and international groups,"" said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who addressed the country's parliament, the Council of Representatives. ""Despite the security improvement, we still need more efforts and time in order for our armed forces to be able to take over security control in all Iraqi provinces from the multinational forces that helped us in a great way in fighting terrorism and outlaws"" he said. Al-Maliki's comments came hours before U.S. Gen.

"Apparently working under the impression that they understand the science of sexuality better than the World Health Organization  or the American Medical  or Psychological or Psychiatric associations, Texas Republicans made a bold statement last weekend. With zero debate, they adopted a party platform that includes support for a widely discredited form of mental health ""treatment"" known as ""reparative therapy."" Also called ""conversion therapy,"" this dangerous pseudo-medical practice aimed at transforming homosexuals into heterosexuals has been widely demonstrated to be both ineffective and harmful, not to mention offensive. The clearly misguided assumption underlying such therapy is the belief (often reinforced by self-serving interpretations of any number of religious texts) that homosexuality is a disease. However, much like drapetomania (the pseudo-scientific ""disease"" an enterprising white man conveniently identified in the mid-19th century was described as the condition that led black slaves to attempt escape), homosexuality is in fact not an illness, but rather a fact of human nature. And rejecting human nature can have devastating effects on the psyche, demonstrating that if there is a real disease that needs fixing here, it's homophobia, not homosexuality. Lesbian, gay and bisexual youth experience significantly increased risk  for suicide than their heterosexual peers. In fact, as cited by the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that provides LGBT youth with crisis intervention and suicide prevention services, LGB youth are four times more likely than their heterosexual peers to attempt suicide, and their attempts are four to six times more likely to result in injuries that require medical attention. Moreover, LGB youth from highly unsupportive families (like the kinds that would be drawn to conversion therapy) are more than eight times more likely to have attempted suicide as those from more accepting and supportive households. Recognizing this, both New Jersey and California have banned conversion therapy for minors, and other states are considering similar initiatives. By explicitly supporting such pseudo-therapy, the Texas Republican party has done more than simply turn a blind eye to science and the potentially deadly consequences of the negative attitudes and self-hatred that such ""treatments"" reinforce. It has reminded us just how out of touch the Texas GOP can be—not only regarding modern medicine, but also with respect to the future of their own party. According to the Pew Research Center, 61% of Republicans under 30 support same-sex marriage. That's only 1 percentage point less than that of Democrats over the age of 65 who support it. In short, the dinosaurs behind embarrassing and discriminatory platforms like this are guaranteeing their own extinction by clinging onto closed-minded convictions that are clearly on the way out. But there is hope. As it turns out, some of the most seemingly anti-gay individuals are in fact responding to an internalized homophobia in conflict with their own homosexuality. Keeping this and the aforementioned statistics in mind, I propose that Texas Republicans step into the 21st century by adopting a different kind of conversion therapy—namely, one that replaces fear and bigotry with knowledge, acceptance and respect.","Texas GOP endorsed ""reparative therapy"" to convert gays to straight orientation .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Bonuses for Wall Street fat cats are easy political fodder in uncertain economic times, but former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Friday cutting corporate bonuses means slashing jobs in the Big Apple. Rudy Giuliani says that when he was mayor, he gauged the New York City budget by Wall Street bonuses. ""If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy, it really will create unemployment,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It means less spending in restaurants, less spending in department stores, so everything has an impact."" President Obama admonished corporate America on Thursday after the New York comptroller reported that Wall Street bankers received $18.4 billion in bonuses in 2008. ""This is the height of irresponsibility. It is shameful,"" the president said.  Watch Obama blast Wall Street » . These are the same institutions ""teetering on collapse"" and asking taxpayers to bail them out while taxpayers are dealing with their own tumultuous finances, he said. Last year, Congress passed a $700 billion bailout for financial institutions, and an $819 billion economic stimulus package is presently making its way through the Senate after garnering House approval Wednesday. ""There will be time for [bankers] to make profits, and there will be time for them to get bonuses -- now is not that time,"" Obama said of the bonuses, which were about equal to those of 2004. When Giuliani ran for the GOP presidential nomination, pundits said his stances on issues like abortion rights separated him from self-proclaimed Reagan Republicans in the field. Not up for debate is Giuliani's alignment with the 40th president on ""trickle-down economics,"" the theory that keeping the rich wealthy creates jobs and solvency for the lower classes. ""Those bonuses, if they are reversed, are going to cause unemployment in New York,"" the self-described fiscal conservative said. ""I remember when I was mayor, one of the ways in which you determine New York City's budget, tax revenue is Wall Street bonuses. ""Wall Street has $1 billion, $2 billion in bonuses, the city had a deficit. Wall Street has $15 billion to $20 billion, New York City had a $2 billion, $3 billion surplus, and it's because that money gets spent. That money goes directly into the economy. First of all, it gets taxed as income. Secondly, it gets taxes again when somebody buys something with it."" In announcing the Wall Street bonuses Wednesday, State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the $18.4 billion represented a stark dip from 2007's bonuses, which totaled $32.9 billion . ""A 44 percent decline in the bonus pool will ripple through the regional economy and the state and the city will lose major tax revenues,"" DiNapoli said in a statement. ""The securities industry has already lost tens of thousands of jobs and the industry is still continuing to write off toxic assets. It's painfully obvious that 2009 will probably be another difficult year for the industry."" While city incomes taxes are common in Iowa, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, they are an anomaly in most parts of the country, according to a 2008 report by Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. New York City and Yonkers are the only cities levying income taxes in New York state, the foundation said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday the city needs to close a projected $4 billion budget gap in fiscal year 2010. Skyrocketing unemployment is partially to blame, he said, projecting that 300,000 jobs will be lost in the city by the second quarter of 2010. Of those, 46,000 job losses are expected to have come from Wall Street, a particularly devastating blow to the economy because those in the financial community tend to pay double or triple the taxes paid by employees in other industries, he said. ""When Wall Street catches a cold, it's a very serious illness to us,"" Bloomberg said. In 2008, New York had $41.2 billion in expenses and $42.8 billion in revenue, he said. Projections suggest that in 2010 the city will have $43.4 billion in expenses but only $37.1 billion in revenue. Bloomberg proposed several measures, including an increase in the sales tax from 8.375 percent to 8.75 percent, in an effort to balance the budget. Bloomberg has already slashed $3.7 billion in spending since last year, an administration official said. In recent months, the mayor has tried to shore up city finances by raising hotel taxes and pulling back a property tax cut set to expire this summer, the official said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Central London fell silent save for the tolling of Big Ben as the United Kingdom honored the dead of wars past and present on Remembrance Sunday. Queen Elizabeth II then laid a wreath at the Cenotaph, the war memorial on Whitehall near Parliament, after a military band played the ""Last Post."" Other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip, and grandchildren Princes Harry and William, followed suit under steel-gray skies as Britain marked a tradition going back to the end of World War I. Harry was representing his father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, who is in Canada. Hours before the ceremony began, the Ministry of Defence announced the 200th British soldier had been killed in hostile action in Afghanistan. The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, was killed in an explosion in Helmand province, the main British area of operations, in southern Afghanistan. That was then followed by the news that another soldier from 4th Battalion, The Rifles, died from injuries sustained in an explosion that happened in the same region near Sangin. Both soldier's families have been informed, the Ministry of Defence said. An American soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in western Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. The event was not related to an ongoing search for two U.S. Army paratroopers, who went missing Wednesday near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, ISAF said. The service member's name was not released. British troops also marked Remembrance Sunday in Afghanistan. The country honors war dead each year on the Sunday closest to November 11, the day World War I ended in 1918. The memorials this year come as many Britons question the country's military mission in Afghanistan. The UK has about 9,000 troops there, the second-largest contingent after the United States. Prime Minister Gordon Brown attempted to shore up support for the eight-year-old mission Friday. ""Our mission must not fail,"" Brown said. ""It is not easy, the choices are not simple, there is no strategy that is without danger and risk, but that is the responsibility of leadership of government and of our armed forces -- to do what is necessary, however difficult, to keep the British people safe. ""We cannot, must not, and will not walk away,"" Brown said. Sunday marked the first Remembrance Sunday since the death of the last two British World War I veterans living in the U.K., Harry Patch and Henry Allingham. Patch, 111, and Allingham, 113, died within a week of each other in July. Brown and other political leaders laid wreaths after the royal family at the Cenotaph, a memorial designed by the eminent early 20th-century architect Edward Lutyens. Diplomats from countries that used to be part of the British Empire followed, as did uniformed and civilian leaders of the British military. Rows of uniformed veterans stood on Whitehall for the service, wearing red paper poppies in their lapels. The Royal British Legion sells the paper poppies every year to raise money for veterans' causes. They are ubiquitous across the country in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday. The ceremony lasted about 20 minutes from the moment of silence at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) through the singing of ""God Save the Queen"" after a short service led by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres. After the royal family left the memorial, military veterans and members of the public also walked past the Cenotaph.","Queen Elizabeth II and Royal family lay wreaths at the Cenotaph, the war memorial near Parliament in London .

"(CNN) -- The mother of one of the American service members killed in a military stress clinic shooting in Baghdad said Wednesday she harbors ""mixed emotions"" toward the attacker who killed her son. Pfc. Michael E. Yates Jr. was one of five service members shot to death at a stress clinic in Baghdad, Iraq. ""I feel for him, but at the same time I am very angry at him,"" said Shawna Machlinski, mother of slain 19-year-old Pfc. Michael E. Yates Jr. Sgt. John M. Russell has been charged with five counts of murder in the killing. Yates of Federalsburg, Maryland, was one of the five service members slain Monday. ""I think he [Russell] needed help and couldn't get it fast enough because you have to wait on everything with the Army,"" said Machlinski, referring to the alleged shooter and the problems the stress clinic addresses. She and Yates' stepfather, Richard Van Blargan Jr., spoke with reporters Wednesday in Maryland. ""As much as I have a lot of anger towards him, I also have some sympathy because I know he must have been going through a lot, as well,"" Machlinski said of Russell. While she said that ""doesn't excuse"" the shooter's actions, ""I believe that if he would've gotten the help that he was there to get, maybe sooner, or got more help and other people recognized the signs, because there are signs, and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure those signs out."" ""We're not sure as to what happened over there,"" Van Blargan said. Speaking about Yates, he said, ""We do know that he was at the stress clinic. Like quite a few other military people, they've all dealt with the stress the best way they could. He was due to go back to his unit today, until this unfortunate event."" Van Blargan said he didn't know much about the shooting suspect. ""He was probably under a lot of stress as well. Quite a bit more from my understanding,"" Van Blargan said of the shooting suspect. ""He has friends and family, extended families that will miss him dearly."" Van Blargan said Yates told Machlinski in a phone call on Mother's Day that Yates had met the suspected shooter, saying he was a ""very nice guy"" and ""could deal with him"" but that the man had ""some major issues."" ""He was out there on the branch hoping for somebody to help him,"" Van Blargan said. Van Blargan said Yates -- who was a father himself -- is going to be missed. ""He was a good man, a good father. He took care of his responsibilities. He was very honorable. He was a good son. He treated everyone with respect and he just wanted respect back,"" Van Blargan said. Machlinski said her son told her in the Mother's Day phone call that the clinic program he attended ""was kind of stupid because he had to color and do arts and crafts and cut and paste."" But Machlinski said her son knew he had to complete the program so he could go back to his base. ""He was one of the lucky ones that understood that he needed help,"" Van Blargan said.","Mother of slain soldier says she understands suspect was under stress .

"(CNN) -- Demonstrators protested in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province on Friday to demand the release of Shiite prisoners they feel are being held unjustly. An outspoken Shiite prayer leader who demonstrators say was arrested last Friday was a focal point of the ""day of rage"" protest, said Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, president of the Human Rights First Society. Sheikh Tawfeeq Al-Amer was arrested Friday after a sermon stating that Saudi Arabia should become a constitutional monarchy, al-Mugaiteeb said. Saudi Arabian authorities could not be immediately reached for comment. The protest comes on the heels of two similar demonstrations held in the province Thursday, al-Mugaiteeb said, when about 200 protesters in the city of Qatif and 100 protesters in the city of Awamiyya called for the release of Shiite prisoners. Al-Mugaiteeb said authorities arrested 22 people who participated in Thursday's protest in Qatif. ""We deplore this action by the Saudi security forces,"" he said. Another protest took place in Riyadh after Friday prayer, according to two Saudi activists. The sources asked not to be identified because of concerns for their safety. According to the activists, as many as 40 anti-government demonstrators gathered outside Al-Rajhi Mosque for a short protest. At least one man involved in organizing the protest was arrested by Saudi police, the activists said. The activists said the protesters attracted a crowd of worshipers leaving the mosque. Some of the protesters carried signs showing a map of Saudi Arabia that did not contain the words ""Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" a clear affront to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Arabia has cracked down on protests in the past. Shiites are a minority in Saudi Arabia. They live primarily in the Eastern Province -- where many major oil companies operate. The protests come as sectarian violence between Shiites and Sunnis flares in neighboring Bahrain. Analysts believe protests in Bahrain could spill over into Saudi Arabia's oil fields, located mostly in Shiite provinces. After three months abroad for medical treatment, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah returned home late last month to a Middle East shaken by unrest, and announced a series of sweeping measures aimed at relieving economic hardship and meeting with Bahrain's beleaguered monarch. The Saudi government released three Shiite political prisoners ahead of the king's return.","The focus of Friday's protest is a Shiite prayer leader arrested last week .

"Washington (CNN) -- Five Transportation Security Administration employees have been placed on administrative leave after a sensitive airport security manual was posted on the Internet, the agency announced Wednesday. The TSA said the version of the manual that ended up online was several editions old and did not expose the agency's current airport screening protocols. And Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told a Senate committee Wednesday that ""The security of the traveling public has never been put at risk."" The manual outlined screening procedures for law enforcement officers, diplomats, prisoners, federal air marshals and others. Napolitano told the Senate Judiciary Committee that action had been taken against a contractor and some TSA supervisors. The agency has instituted an internal review of the incident ""to see what else needs to be done so that the incident never recurs,"" she said, and the Department of Homeland Security has asked its inspector general to conduct an independent review ""to make sure that we are being rigorous and very disciplined on what is posted and what is not."" Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, suggested to Napolitano that a ""red team"" damage assessment be done -- a review by someone outside the agency to determine what advantage a potential enemy could have gained from the information and recommend what procedures or actions are necessary to minimize the damage. Napolitano said the agency is considering it. ""I think one of my first questions has been, well, what exactly was put out there that wasn't available either by observation of airport checkpoints or the like,"" she said. ""But indeed, we may, if it is ascertained that there was some information not otherwise available that was put out, I think the red teaming issue is something that I would consider, absolutely."" Kyl replied that ""just from public reports, there are clearly some things you don't want out there, spelling out the settings on the X-ray machines and explosive detectors, passenger and luggage screening details, pictures of credentials that are authorized, those kind of things. Clearly, somebody could take advantage of those things."" The 93-page instruction manual was written for airport screeners, providing details on how screening is conducted and the limitations of X-ray machines. It was posted on a Web site for government contractors, with sensitive parts redacted -- but the redacted information was not properly protected, and the information was restored by people familiar with the computer program. The manual was dated May 2008, but the TSA said it was never implemented and has been revised six times, although it did not elaborate on the extent of the revisions. It said the report was removed as soon as it learned of the problem, but the full, unredacted version of the report appeared on at least one Web site Sunday and was distributed more widely Tuesday. Two TSA officials told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that the practice of posting sensitive documents has been suspended for the time being. Rand Beers, under secretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, and David Heyman, the agency's assistant secretary for policy, appeared before the committee and faced tough questions from its ranking Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. Beers pointed out to Collins that the manual was for supervisors, not front-line screeners. ""The actual screening procedures that a TSO, a transportation security officer, would actually use at a screening point are not in that document,"" he said. Collins, however, noted that the manual has a whole section on credentials, including those used by members of the CIA, the U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""I would say to my colleagues that there's a page with a picture of what an ID for a U.S. senator looks like, and ironically, in the airport this weekend, I had the screener look at my ID and check the manual,"" Collins said. ""So this is important, if we're talking about making sure that the people who would do us harm don't have the ability to falsify documents, we've given them a textbook on how to do so in this manual because we've showed them exactly what documents look like for individuals who are likely to receive less screening because they have these documents, because they are law enforcement officials, for example."" She asked if the TSA had notified those agencies that such information was included in the manual. Heyman told her that such notifications had been made. Collins told the committee that she did not believe she was revealing anything ""that isn't already out."" And Collins aide Jeannine Guttman said the senator believed Napolitano was trying to play down the seriousness of the breach and that her examples would drive home that point.

"(Mental Floss) -- Remember that goofy uncle of yours who always tried to impress you by ""stealing your nose"" or pulling the ol' separating-his-thumb-from-his-hand move? Well, those parlor tricks are nothing compared to the appendage stunts pulled by these 10 famous people. John Wilkes Booth's neck bones . A painting of Napoleon in His Study by Jacques-Louis-David doesn't give a hint at what body part went missing. John Wilkes Booth might have been a successful assassin, but he was a largely ineffectual escape artist. Just 12 days after murdering President Abraham Lincoln, Booth was shot in the back of the neck and killed. His body was (eventually) buried in an unmarked grave at Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery. His third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae, however, were removed during the autopsy so investigators could access the bullet. For a peek at those bits of Booth's spinal column, just check out the display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Einstein's brain . Before he died, über-genius Albert Einstein considered donating his body to science. Unfortunately, he never put his wishes in writing. When he passed away in 1955, Einstein's family and friends made plans to cremate him, but the pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Thomas Harvey, had a different idea. Instead, he opted to remove the math man's brain and then tell the family about it. For 30-some years, Harvey had Al's gray matter tucked away in his Wichita home in two Mason jars. Naturally, Einstein's loved ones weren't thrilled when they found out, but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination. Today, many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions, with the bulk held at Princeton Hospital. As for Einstein's body, that was cremated and scattered in a secret location. ""Stonewall"" Jackson's arm . Confederate General Thomas Jackson got his nickname by sitting astride his horse ""like a stone wall"" while bullets whizzed around him during the Civil War. But that kind of bravery (or foolhardiness) didn't serve him well. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson was accidentally shot in the arm by one of his own men. Said arm had to be amputated, and afterward, it was buried in the nearby Virginia town of Ellwood. Only eight days later, Stonewall was stone-cold dead of pneumonia. The rest of his body is resting in peace in Lexington, Virginia. Saint Francis Xavier's hand . Francis Xavier was a saint with a few too many fans. In the early 16th century, the Spanish missionary was sent to Asia by the king of Portugal to convert as many souls to Christianity as possible. Turns out, he was pretty good at the job. Francis Xavier became wildly popular, and after his death in 1552, so did his relics. In fact, demand out-fueled supply. Throughout several years and multiple exhumations, his body was whittled away. Today, half his left hand is in Cochin, India, while the other half is in Malacca, Malaysia. One of his arms resides in Rome, and various other cities lay claim to his internal organs. The leftovers? They went to Goa, India. Napoleon's bits and pieces . Exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5, 1821. The following day, doctors conducted an autopsy, which was reportedly witnessed by many people, including a priest named Ange Vignali. Though the body was said to be largely intact at the time of the undertaking, it seems the priest took home a souvenir. In 1916, Vignali's heirs sold a collection of Napoleonic artifacts, including what they claim to be the emperor's penis. While no one knows for sure if it really is Napoleon's, uh, manhood, people have paid good money for the penis. Currently, it's in the possession of an American urologist. Oliver Cromwell's head . Oliver Cromwell, the straight-laced Puritan who usurped the English throne, wasn't exactly a wild man. His head, however, was sometimes the life of the party. Cromwell died in 1658, but two years later, the reinstated English monarchy exhumed, tried, and hanged his body, then dumped it in an unmarked grave. In addition, as a warning to would-be killers, his head was placed on a pike in Westminster Hall, where it remained for 20 years. After a subsequent stint in a small museum, it was sold in 1814 to a man named Josiah Henry Wilkinson (perhaps looking to parade it around as an exceptionally gruesome ice-breaker at parties). Such was the ironic afterlife of the Puritan until 1960, when his head was finally laid to rest in a chapel in Cambridge. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Clashes between Hamas militants and Israeli soldiers raged to the north and east of densely populated Gaza City early Sunday, the 16th day of an Israeli offensive, witnesses and medical sources said. A photo provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows troops in Gaza on Saturday. Heavy gunfire could be heard to the east of Gaza City -- home to about 400,000 of Gaza's 1.5 million people -- as fighting moved closer, according to a CNN stringer in the area. Israeli shelling north of the city killed two people, sources at Shifa hospital told CNN. Sunday's fighting came after one girl was killed and 49 other people were severely burned by fires caused by Israeli shelling in southern Gaza on Saturday, local hospital sources said. The shelling ignited several buildings, including a U.N. school, near the city of Khan Younes, sources said. The girl died of burns she suffered in one of the fires, the sources said. Also Saturday, a family of nine was killed when a shell hit their home in the village of Jebalya in northern Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. The Israeli military was ""not operating in the area of this house, and no fire was directed in that direction,"" a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said. Later Saturday, the IDF said that two rocket-launching squads near Jebalya were hit. Meanwhile, Hamas militants fired 20 Grad long-range rockets into Israel on Saturday, injuring four civilians, according to an IDF spokesman. And the Hamas commander in charge of launching rockets into Israel from the Gaza City area was killed Saturday by Israeli ground fire, the IDF said. Amir Mansi was spotted firing a rocket Saturday from the Jabel Rise area, east of Gaza City, during a ground force operation, the IDF said. Israeli forces opened fire, killing Mansi and wounding two other Hamas operatives, who were captured, the Israelis said.  Watch what overnight air attacks did » . Mansi was the leading Hamas authority on the Grad long-range missile-launching system, the IDF said. Grad rockets have allowed Hamas to reach farther into Israel than in previous attacks. Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is aimed at stopping Hamas militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. The operation began with airstrikes; a week later, the Israeli military launched a ground assault. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded, according to Palestinian medical sources. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began.   See images from the offensive » . On Saturday evening, two pair of Israeli F-16 fighter jets that were on bombing runs in southern Gaza violated Egyptian airspace, a CNN team observed. ""We can tell they're coming through Egyptian airspace because they're over the far side of the building where we're standing,"" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Rafah, Egypt. He was atop a building about 500 meters (547 yards) from the Gaza border. The Israelis have been bombing tunnels that run under the border of southern Gaza and Egypt. Israel says Hamas smuggles weapons and munitions through them into Gaza. A spokesman for the Egyptian prime minister's office said the Israeli aircraft did not have permission to use the airspace. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said no airspace violation had occurred. Before strafing the area in and around Rafah, the Israeli air force dropped leaflets warning residents to leave their homes because more Israeli attacks were imminent, Palestinian security sources said. According to an IDF spokesman, the leaflets say: ""Two days ago, the IDF distributed leaflets in Rafah in which the residents were warned to evacuate their homes for their own safety. As they heeded the IDF instructions, the harming of residents in combat was avoided. ""Over the coming period, the IDF will continue to target tunnels, weapon caches and terrorist operatives with growing intensity. For your safety and that of your family, stay away from terrorist elements or places where weapons are stored or places where terrorist elements operate."" In Gaza City on Saturday afternoon, heavy black smoke rose during a three-hour period during which Israel was to halt its attacks on militants so Palestinians could stock up on supplies. CNN's Ben Wedeman said the lulls, which have been tried before, aren't ""rock solid."" Limited military activity continues during that period, he said. A United Nations spokesman said Saturday's pause was not long enough to resume the transport of humanitarian supplies from Israel into Gaza. iReport.com: Share thoughts, reactions to crisis in the Middle East . Meanwhile, in Cairo, Egypt, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss a possible cease-fire. Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal said during a televised news conference Saturday night that his followers will consider any proposals to stop the violence if conditions are met: the Israelis stop their ""aggression"" and all crossings between Israel and Gaza are opened. ""These are our just demands, and with an open mind we will interact with any initiative,"" Mashaal said.","NEW: Fighting nears densely populated Gaza City, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- The discovery of a ""sophisticated"" tunnel between a Mexican eat-in kitchen and two Southern California warehouses led authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to arrest at least nine suspects and seize between 20 and 30 tons of marijuana. The Thanksgiving Day find followed an eight-month investigation and came about three weeks after authorities discovered a similar drug tunnel in another warehouse in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego. Between the two incidents, agents in the United States and Mexico seized roughly the equivalent of one marijuana cigarette for each of California's nearly 37 million residents, Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Ralph Partridge said Friday. ""This is obviously not a Mom and Pop operation,"" Miguel Unzueta, a San Diego-based agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Friday. ""This is a major, significant drug cartel working."" Unzueta described the nearly half-mile-long and, in spots, 90-foot-deep passageway as ""very sophisticated,"" even more so than the one found earlier this month. Its southern entry was in the kitchen of a stucco Tijuana, Mexico, home, which had a garage attached big enough for tractor-trailer trucks. After removing a 2-foot by 4-foot piece of flooring in that house, smugglers could head 80 feet down a cinder-block-lined stretch into the tunnel. The passageway had lighting, ventilation, wood and cinder-block supports, wood floors and rail carts, U.S. law enforcement agents said. The tunnel split to lead into two separate warehouses in San Diego. ""Having been in several of these tunnels, this is one of the most sophisticated ... I've ever seen,"" Partridge said. ""This is a tunnel where a lot of drugs were being pushed through."" The discovery came after San Diego Tunnel Task Force agents, on Thursday morning, spotted a tractor-trailer arriving at one of the warehouses, said Unzueta. After getting its load, the truck headed to a border patrol checkpoint in Temecula, California, about 60 miles north of San Diego. There, authorities who had been tracking the shipment found the truck filled ""top to bottom, front to back"" with 27,000 600-pound packages of marijuana, Unzueta said. Authorities initially could not get through the tunnel from the California side because it was blocked by huge packages of marijuana. Much of the drug was in a 10- by 20-foot room about 60 feet below the surface. U.S. agents and Mexican military personnel formed a human chain to lug out what amounted to 3 to 4 tons of marijuana, according to Unzueta. In addition, U.S. law enforcement agencies tipped Mexican authorities about a ranch on that side of the border, where 3 to 4 more tons of the drug was captured. Unzueta estimated that all the marijuana seized Thursday could have sold wholesale for $17 million to $20 million or -- as Partridge estimated -- been equal to 16 million to 17 million individual 1-gram joints. The driver of the tractor-trailer truck was arrested and, if convicted on federal drug smuggling charges, could face between 10 years to life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Alana Robinson. The driver of a box truck who accompanied the tractor-trailer to the San Diego warehouse also was arrested, Unzueta said. Although that truck didn't carry any drugs, the residence it went to had $13,500 in cash. Both trucks' drivers are U.S. citizens and are now in federal custody. Mexican authorities have arrested at least another seven people, Unzueta said. Earlier this month, agents made several arrests after seizing about 30 tons of marijuana related to the other San Diego tunnel discovery. John Morton, the head of the U.S. immigration and customs agency, said authorities ""caught them in the act."" And in October, Mexican authorities seized 105 tons of marijuana in Tijuana. Law enforcement agents on both sides of the border have found at least 75 cross-border tunnels in the past four years, most of them in California and Arizona, according to Unzueta. ""Internal drug traffickers are using transborder tunnels to import tons of marijuana into the United States,"" Robinson said. ""Clearly, these transborder tunnels pose a significant threat to our national security as well.""","NEW: Authorities describe a ""very sophisticated"" drug smuggling tunnel .

"New York (CNN) -- Robert ""Joe"" Halderman, the former CBS News producer accused of trying to blackmail comedian David Letterman, agreed Tuesday to plead guilty to attempted second-degree grand larceny in exchange for six months in jail, five years probation and 1,000 hours of community service. ""This is a serious sentence that properly reflects the crimes that Mr. Halderman has now admitted that he committed, and it is a fitting end to the case,"" said Letterman lawyer Daniel J. Horwitz. During Tuesday's taping of his ""Late Night"" show, Letterman expressed gratitude and relief that the matter is over. ""Now, I'd never been involved in anything like this in my life, and I was concerned and full of anxiety and nervous and worried,"" he said. ""And the people in the district attorney's office said, 'This will be handled professionally, this will be handled skillfully, and appropriately.' Well, the matter was resolved today, and they were exactly right -- it was handled professionally, skillfully and appropriately."" The 62-year-old singled out District Attorney of Manhattan Cyrus Vance Jr., former District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, the Special Prosecutions Bureau in the district attorney's office and the New York City Police Department. Formal sentencing is slated for May 4. In a separate statement, the former ""48 Hours"" producer admitted that he tried to extort $2 million from Letterman to keep quiet about the ""Late Show"" host's sexual affairs. ""On the morning of September 9, 2009, I gave a sealed envelope to Mr. Letterman's driver as he waited outside of Mr. Letterman's Manhattan home,"" Halderman said in the statement, called an allocution. ""I asked the driver to give the envelope marked 'Privileged and Confidential' to Mr. Letterman. ""The envelope contained a number of documents, including a document I created entitled 'Treatment for a Screenplay.' This so-called treatment was just a thinly veiled threat to ruin Mr. Letterman if he did not pay me a lot of money. ""Later that month, on three different occasions I met with Mr. Letterman's lawyer, Jim Jackoway, to work out the details of the extortion. On October 1, 2009, I deposited a check for $2 million that Mr. Jackoway gave me. ""I knew throughout this time that I was not engaged in a legitimate business transaction with Mr. Letterman and that what I was doing was against New York law. I understand that my attempt to extort $2 million from Mr. Letterman violated his and his family's privacy. I promise to respect their privacy in the future."" Then-District Attorney Morgenthau said Letterman gave Halderman a $2 million check in October and Halderman deposited the money into a Connecticut bank account the day before he was arrested. Halderman was released from jail on $200,000 bail in October. Letterman announced the extortion plot on his CBS show in October and admitted to affairs with female staffers. Halderman closed his statement by expressing ""great remorse"" and apologizing to Letterman and his family and to the family of Stephanie Birkitt, one of the women Halderman said had engaged in a sexual relationship with Letterman. Birkitt was an assistant to the talk show host and a former live-in girlfriend of Halderman. The 27-year CBS veteran had initially been charged with first-degree attempted grand larceny, to which he pleaded not guilty in October. He could have faced 15 years in prison if convicted on the charge. CNN's Julian Cummings contributed to this story.","David Letterman says police, prosecutors were professional, skillful .

"A day after Rafael Nadal exited the Madrid Masters and vowed never to return while the clay is still blue, a similarly disgruntled Novak Djokovic suffered a shock 7-6 (2), 6-3 loss to fellow Serb Janko Tipsarevic. The world No. 1 said he would join Nadal in boycotting the Madrid tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts. ""I want to forget this week as soon as possible and move on to the real clay courts,"" Djokovic said. ""It took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis. ""There is no discussion in my eyes, it's very simple. No blue clay for me."" Nadal lost to fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Thursday for his earliest exit in a clay-court tournament in eight years. Verdasco was routed 6-1, 6-2 by Tomas Berdych in Friday's quarterfinals. The blue clay is the brainchild of tournament owner Ion Tiriac, who claims it helps fans see the ball and creates a better viewing experience. And while Djokovic and Nadal have crashed out, Roger Federer has thrived at the tournament, beating David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4 on Friday to advance to the semifinals. The 16-time Grand Slam champion, president of the ATP Players' Council, said he sympathized with Nadal and Djokovic. ""Yes of course, I said it from the start. It's not something we actually wanted,"" he said. ""I understand their frustrations. It's a bit tricky for everyone and we definitely have to look into things for next year."" Federer will replace Nadal at No. 2 in the rankings if he wins the tournament, thereby increasing his chances of being seeded second for the French Open. Federer, who didn't face a single break point against Ferrer, will play Tipsarevic in the semifinals, while Juan Martin del Potro meets Berdych in the other after a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Alexandr Dolgopolov. Serena Williams, too, has been in blistering form in Madrid and won a battle of former No. 1s in typically ruthless style, thrashing Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-3 . Both players were unbeaten on clay coming into the match, but Williams extended her winning streak over the Russian to seven while winning her 10th straight match. Williams said the clay was ""extremely slippery"" but she wouldn't join the top men's stars in skipping Madrid next year. ""If I'm not here next year, it won't be because of the clay,"" said the 13-time Grand Slam champion. ""I don't think there's been any improvement in the courts over the week, but every clay court is different. ""This is not the best court -- definitely not  what they play like at Roland Garros -- but it's what they use at Madrid."" Williams will face Lucie Hradecka for a place in the final after the Czech qualifier upset  fifth-seeded Sam Stosur 7-6 (8), 7-6 (6). World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka avoided another upset when she recovered to beat French Open champion Li Na 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. She will play Agnieszka Radwanska for the sixth time this year in Saturday's semifinals, and said any complaints about the courts would have to wait. ""I'm not a fan of this court, that's for sure,"" she added. ""But I don't want to sit here and complain about it. ""Nothing is going to change this year. We can talk after the tournament about possible changes.""","Novak Djokovic loses 7-6 (2), 6-3 to Janko Tipsarevic in Madrid .

"MADRID, Spain  -- Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta has died after collapsing during a Primera Liga match on Saturday, Spanish media reported on Tuesday. Sevilla midfielder Puerta was able to walk from the pitch but collapsed again in the dressing room. He died on Tuesday. The 22-year-old Spanish international collapsed after jogging back towards his own goal 35 minutes into the Primera Liga match against Getafe. Team-mates and medical staff rushed to his side and were seen preventing him from swallowing his tongue as he lost consciousness. He was able to walk from the pitch but doctors said that he collapsed again in the changing rooms and had to be given cardiac resuscitation before being taken to hospital where he remained on a life support system. Earlier on Tuesday, a statement from Seville's Virgen del Rocio hospital had indicated that Puerta's condition was worsening. Puerta is the third high-profile footballer to die after collapsing on the field in recent years. In January 2004 Benfica's Hungarian international striker Miklos Feher died during a Portuguese league match from a heart attack just seven months after Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died while playing in the Confederations Cup tournament in France.

"(CNN) -- Days before a key meeting with Western leaders, Iran test-fired two types of long-range missiles Monday in part of what the Islamic republic called routine military exercises, its state-run media reported. A short-range missile is test-launched during war games in Qom, Iran, south of Tehran, on Sunday. The tests drew condemnation from France, which noted through its Foreign Ministry that the action comes only a week after Iran revealed the existence of a covert uranium enrichment site. ""These tests can only reinforce the worries of countries in the surrounding region and the international community, especially as Iran is, in parallel, developing a nuclear program, with the existence of a clandestine uranium enrichment site having just been revealed,"" the ministry said. ""We ask Iran to choose cooperation and not confrontation, immediately putting an end to its profoundly destabilizing activities and responding without delay to the demands of the international community in order to find a solution in this affair."" Iran's nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili is scheduled Thursday to meet with representatives of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, plus Germany. European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana will also attend the talks Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland. In the United States, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs called the missile test provocative and said the Western powers taking part in Thursday's meeting want Iran to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with ""immediate unfettered access"" to the newly discovered uranium enrichment site and people working there, as well as documents related to its planning. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began a series of missile exercises Saturday to promote the armed forces' defense capabilities, Fars News Agency reported.  Watch the missile tests » . After a series of short-range missile tests, Iran concluded Monday with the testing of the long range Shahab-3 and the two-stage Sajil missiles, according to reports from state-run media. Both hit their targets, and Iran's air force commander hailed the exercise as a show that Iran is ""fully prepared and determined to stand against all threats."" ""We will give a fully decisive, crushing and destructive response to anyone who poses a threat to the existence, independence and freedom of the ruling system and our values,"" Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami said, according to Fars News Agency.  Watch an analyst's view of missile tests, nuclear tensions » . The Shahab-3 missile can strike targets between 800 and 1,250 miles (1,300 and 2,000 kilometers), according to the reports. The Sajil-2 missile is a solid-fuel rocket with a similar range and has been launched twice before, in November 2008 and May 2009. If Iran's claims are true, the missile brings Moscow, Russia; Athens, Greece; and southern Italy within striking distance.  See where the missiles could strike » . Last Monday, Iran wrote a letter to the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealing the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility. The IAEA acknowledged the admission Friday, prompting President Obama and the leaders of Britain and France to publicly chide the Islamic republic and threaten further sanctions. The United States and France had been aware of the unfinished nuclear site for several years, according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations.  Watch how the tests draw a comparison to a 1960s U.S. crisis » . The facility is on a military base near the city of Qom, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Tehran, and is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, according to the officials and the IAEA. That is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor, but sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter. Iran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said. Iran's revelation of the site could actually ""strengthen their hand"" as Tehran heads into Thursday's Geneva talks, according to Paul Ingram, an analyst who studies Iran and nuclear nonproliferation. He said the timing of Iran's revelation -- in between the U.N. General Assembly sessions and the Thursday meeting -- is deliberate on Iran's part. ""This will make it more difficult to persuade them to abandon enrichment,"" said Ingram, the executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London.  Watch bloggers debate what should be done about Iran's nuclear ambitions » . Iran says its nuclear enrichment program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons. Iran conducts research for its nuclear program in sites around the country. Until the new letter, it had acknowledged only a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, which nuclear inspectors visited recently. Iran also has an unfinished nuclear research reactor in Arak, and U.N. nuclear inspectors were allowed access to that facility earlier this month. Other important nuclear sites in Iran include its Bushehr nuclear power plant and the Isfahan uranium conversion plant.","NEW: White House calls tests provocative, seeks IAEA access to enrichment site .

"Italian motorsport maestros Ferrari want to get back to being ""bellissimo"" in Barcelona next month after two team errors saw their No. 1 driver Fernando Alonso fall behind in the race for the Formula One title. Alonso dropped to fourth in the drivers' championship -- and 30 points behind the leader, Red Bull's reigning champion Sebastian Vettel -- after his race in Bahrain was compromised by problems with his car's rear-wing overtaking aid. The Spaniard also crashed out of the Malaysian Grand Prix when the team failed to call him back to the pits to repair a damaged front wing that had slipped dangerously underneath his car. The mistakes mean Ferrari -- who have not won the team title since 2008 -- are now third in the constructor standings behind Red Bull and Lotus. After the first four long-haul destination races of 2013, the team have returned to their Maranello headquarters in northern Italy where team principal Stefano Domencali has issued a rallying call to the famous racing marque. ""We have to be perfect in every area,"" he said. ""Responsibility lies with reliability, from the smallest to the biggest components, to ensure the level of perfection that has to be the standard for Ferrari. We must work with renewed attention on this front."" That extra attention to detail has already begun at the Ferrari factory as the team's engineers solved the problem with Alonso's faulty drag reduction system (DRS) -- an overtaking aid which increases the car's straight-line speed by flipping open the top flap of the rear wing -- the day after the Bahrain Grand Prix. Analysis revealed the problem was caused by a broken mechanical component. Ferrari say it was the first of its kind in the three years since DRS was introduced to F1. But the team say there is still work to be done, especially as Ferrari's Brazilian driver Felipe Massa also had a torrid race in Bahrain, finishing 15th because of tire problems. Alonso had started the race in third place but battled his way to eighth after stopping twice so mechanics could mend his car's faulty rear wing. ""It's hard to recall a race where so many things went wrong,"" commented Domenicali. ""The DRS failure prevented Fernando, who yet again produced a great performance, from fighting Vettel for the win. ""Then for Felipe, there were the two tire-related problems that pushed him out of the points and prevented him from getting the top-five finish that was within his grasp. ""In these first four races of the season we have not managed, for various reasons, to bring home the points that were within our grasp. That's why the gap to the top in both classifications seems quite large."" Strong performances in Australia and China, where Alonso raced to a dominant victory for Ferrari, continue to give Ferrari hope that they can still challenge their main rivals Red Bull, Lotus and Mercedes in the title hunt when racing resumes in the Spanish city of Barcelona on May 12. ""We believe in our ability to be in the fight for the titles right to the end and this time, we have been in that fight since the start, which has not been the case for a while,"" said Domenicali. ""We must not be discouraged, quite the contrary, because we have seen so often, both in our favor and against, how things can change in a hurry.""","Ferrari aiming for perfection after errors in Malaysian and Bahrain grands prix .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- It broadcasts only three hours a day. Its on-air reporters use fake names. And its operators don't know for sure whether their target audience is listening. Kim Seong Min, the founder of Free North Korea Radio, broadcasting from Seoul. Free North Korea Radio, based in Seoul, South Korea, broadcasts news of the outside world across the border. It's illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than state-run radio, and all legal radios are fixed so they can play only channels approved by the government. But the founder of Free North Korea Radio, Kim Seong Min, believes that more and more North Koreans are secretly tuning in. Kim is also a defector. A former propagandist for the North Korean army, Kim says he collected an illegal radio on one of his patrols. He was curious, so he tuned in to a South Korean broadcast. The program centered on the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il. He says it was meant to dispel the myths surrounding the leader, including the story of Kim Jong Il's birth. North Koreans were taught to believe that Kim Jong Il was born on Mount Paekdu, considered sacred in Korean history. But the radio program Kim heard that day said Kim Jong Il was born in the Soviet Union. Kim started to doubt everything he was taught to believe, and the more he listened, the more he was convinced that he had to leave the country. In 1996, Kim says he made a perilous escape by crossing the North Korean-Chinese border, only to be caught by North Korean soldiers while trying to board a ship to South Korea. He was sent back to North Korea but escaped once again by jumping off a train. For days, Kim says, he hid in the Chinese countryside, eating roots and grass to survive before finally settling in a nearby town. Three years later, he says he made his way to South Korea, where he started Free North Korea Radio in 2004. ""North Koreans need food, but they also need food for their minds, otherwise they will continue to have deformed children, and they will be people with deformed minds,"" Kim said. The radio program is three hours, but Kim hopes to expand to five hours daily, broadcasting during the evenings and late at night, when he believes that most North Koreans are able to tune in. But running a radio station is expensive, and FNK Radio relies on donations from South Korean citizens as well as an annual grant indirectly from Washington, through the National Endowment for Democracy. Though funding is sometimes a struggle, they believe that the broadcast is vital to North Korea because the South Korean government stopped its own radio broadcasts into the country under the ""Sunshine Policy"" instituted by former President Kim Dae Jung in 1988. Kim Seong Min is the only North Korean on staff at the radio station who uses his real name. Three of the 15 staffers at FNK Radio are South Korean; the rest are defectors. They use pseudonyms to protect their families who are still living in the North. One defector who calls himself Kim Dae Sung says he bought a radio on the black market and listened under the covers at night. He didn't want to risk being heard by his family or any neighbors, because they would be required by law to report him to the police. Kim Dae Sung says that although he was nervous about listening to the radio illegally, he also looked forward every night to being able to hear news of the outside world. He also says he began to realize that everything he was taught was a lie and decided to escape. He believes that the work he does at FNK radio is helping other North Koreans hear the truth about the world. ""My family is important, but what I'm doing here at the radio station is even more important,"" he said. There's no way to determine how many North Koreans are actually listening to FNK Radio, but Kim Seong Min says he receives letters and phone calls almost daily from defectors who say they were able to hear his program through radios bought on the black market. ""When we started, I thought, if just one person, just one North Korean was listening, that would be good enough,"" Kim said. ""But it's not just one person."" Kim believes the North Koreans try to jam their radio signal into North Korea, and says the North Koreans have called him a traitor. If he were ever to go back to his homeland, Kim says, he would receive ""the highest punishment"" for his work. But he and the other staffers at FNK Radio all believe that it is worth the risk. That's why, when they receive the messages from defectors, Kim says, they often grab each other and cry.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Clashes between Shiite militias left dozens of people dead and hundreds wounded in Karbala and Baghdad, prompting Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday to call for calm, his spokesman said. Iraqi special forces patrol Karbala on Monday as thousands of Shiite pilgrims stream into the holy city. A curfew and weapons ban were in effect and Shiite pilgrims were evacuated from the southern Iraqi city of Karbala, where fighting has killed up to 50 people and wounded 247 others, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. The Iraqi Army had taken control of the city by early Wednesday, Iraq's national security adviser said. ""The situation is quiet now, but nervous and tense,"" Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said in a phone call from Karbala. Referring to the clashes in Karbala and Baghdad, he said, ""They are potentially dangerous and can develop into something more serious."" The violence erupted Monday night in Karbala, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were attending a Shiite religious festival. The fighting spread to Baghdad on Tuesday.  Watch how the fighting began » . Five people were killed in Baghdad, where al-Sadr's followers torched six offices belonging to the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, authorities said. Al-Sadr has called for calm, banned further fighting and urged members of the Mehdi Army militia to guard the Islamic Council offices and officials, according to Sheikh Ahmed al-Shibani, a senior al-Sadr aide in Najaf.  Al-Sadr also called for an investigation into the clashes and for those behind the attacks to be punished, his spokesman said. The attacks were accompanied by fighting between the Badr Organization and the Mehdi Army. The Badr Organization, part of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, has been incorporated into Iraqi security forces throughout the country. The Mehdi Army is the militia of al-Sadr. In Sadr City, where two of the political offices were burned, the Iraqi army called in reinforcements and air support while battling the Mehdi Army, an Interior Ministry official said. The Mehdi Army also set fire to the Dawa Party's office in Kadhimiya, an Interior Ministry official said. Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki is a member of the Dawa Party. Shiite pilgrims in Karbala were celebrating Sha'abaniya, the birthday of Imam al-Mehdi, the 12th Imam, whom Shiites revere. The celebrations were to peak Tuesday and Wednesday. The pilgrims in Karbala were evacuated from the city center, and a full curfew was imposed, said Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf, an Interior Ministry spokesman. There is also a ban on bicycles, motorbikes and pushcarts. A curfew also was in effect in nearby Najaf, a Shiite holy city to which many pilgrims fled after the Karbala fighting began, Najaf police said. The fighting was apparently spurred by a security measure that banned people from carrying weapons into Karbala, an Interior Ministry official said. The al-Sadr loyalists refused to give up their guns, leading to clashes between the Sadrist fighters and security forces protecting the shrines, an Interior Ministry official said. The Mehdi fighters have accused the security forces of being members of the Badr Organization. Pilgrims and members of the security forces are among the casualties. Local officials convened Tuesday to discuss how to defuse the situation. Tensions have been high between the armed wings of the major Shiite political movements. Targeted assassinations and battles between the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army have been prevalent in recent months. Other developments: . • A deputy oil minister and four other kidnapped employees of the Iraqi Oil Ministry were freed Tuesday after two weeks in captivity, the oil ministry said. The deputy oil minister, Abdul Jabber al-Wagga, and the four general managers are in good health and have returned home, the ministry said. • Several hundred U.S. and Iraqi troops converged on Iraq's Diyala province, killing 33 insurgents and restoring a city's water service, the U.S. military said. The troops carried out an air assault Monday in the Gobia community to restore water in nearby Khalis. The military said ""water is currently flowing unimpeded."" • A suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest Monday in the courtyard of a mosque in Falluja, killing 12 people, including an imam known for speaking out against Iraqi militants, an Interior Ministry official said. Two of his sons also were killed in the blast, according to the official. • Coalition forces ""killed eight terrorists and detained 11 suspected terrorists"" during raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, the military said Tuesday. The raids, spanning two provinces northeast of Tikrit, targeted a senior-level adviser with links to international terrorist Khalid al-Turki, the military said. Al-Turki was killed during a June 23 operation. • A ""highly sought weapons facilitator"" was arrested Tuesday in Baghdad, the military said. The individual is suspected of distributing bombs and smuggling weapons from Iran to Iraq, the military said.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- Thousands of people took to the streets of Puerto Rico on Thursday, paralyzing commercial activity in downtown San Juan to protest government budget cuts that are expected to result in at least 13,000 layoffs. Gov. Luis Fortuño's office says that Puerto Rico's economic downturn started four years ago. ""More employees, zero fired,"" a sign held by one demonstrator read. The one-day general strike started at dawn and culminated at noon with a rally at the Plaza las Americas mall. Organizers said at least 100,000 people took part in the rally and thousands more stayed home from work. Federico Torres Montalvo, a union leader, said 200,000 people attended the rally. Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock estimated the number at no more than 15,000. ""There's no way you had 20- or 25- or 50,000 people there,"" he said. There was no independent verification of the turnout. Confrontations between police and students blocking a highway in Puerto Rico eased late Thursday afternoon after the rally, which ended at 2:30 p.m. But some students refused to leave a highway where they had blocked traffic, the news outlet primerahora.com said. When police stepped up their presence, the students confronted them and burned a tire, but there were no reports of violence or arrests. ""If things like this had happened in Washington, the capital of the free world, there would be prisoners now,"" said Gov. Luis Fortuño, whose money-saving efforts were the focus of the demonstrators' ire. ""Instead of looking behind, we have to look ahead."" Victor Villalba, president of the Puerto Rican Federation of Workers, lauded the turnout and criticized government efforts at privatization. ""They will have to pass over the bodies of thousands and thousands of Puerto Ricans before turning the government over to private businesses,"" Villalba told the crowd. Aida Diaz, president of the teacher's union, also praised the turnout. ""Today we said, 'Present,'"" she said. ""Tomorrow we will say, 'Present,' because teaching is by the public, for the public."" University students, teachers and clergy leaders were among those who joined the strike. Negotiations between police and protesting students continued late into the afternoon. Methodist Bishop Juan Vera, a strike leader who had spoken at the rally, was one of the lead negotiators. ""We can feel how the soul of a whole people vibrates,"" Vera said. At least six demonstrators required medical attention for dehydration and high blood pressure as a result of the heat and sun, the primerahora Web site reported. One woman was taken away in an ambulance. ""Everyone has the right to express themselves and we will guarantee that right,"" Fortuño told CNN affiliate WAPA TV in a morning interview. ""The important thing is that we do it with respect, that we do it with order and that we understand that each of our rights ends where the other person's begins."" News media reported no major incidents at the protest sites. Some University of Puerto Rico students got into shoving matches with police at the mall before the noon rally but no arrests were reported, said primerahora.com. The mall's windows and doors had been covered with plywood and it was closed for the day. Its 3,000 employees and 300 stores, restaurants and banks make it the Caribbean's largest. The demonstrators oppose Fortuño's demand that nearly 17,000 workers be laid off to help close a $3.2 billion budget gap. McClintock said Thursday that the true number of public-sector job cuts, slated to take effect next month, will likely be closer to 13,000. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Puerto Rico's unemployment rate exceeds 15 percent. Some analysts expect the layoffs to propel that rate to at least 17 percent. In a statement issued Thursday, the governor's office pointed out that the island's economic downturn started in 2005, three years before the recession hit the U.S. mainland. According to the statement, about 70 percent of Puerto Rico's budget is dedicated to salaries and benefits for government employees. The U.S. protectorate, the statement said, has more government employees in proportion to population than any state. Its efforts are not unusual. Forty-three of the nation's 50 states have implemented some form of payroll reduction, hiring freeze or layoffs, the release said. The government already has cut 10 percent in operating expenses by cutting back on official vehicles, cell phones and credit cards, and has instituted 10 percent pay cuts for the governor and agency heads through next year, the announcement said.","Confrontations between police, students blocking highway lessen after rally .

"Editor's note: In 1994, the American Psychiatric Association published the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-IV. The DSM is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States. For the several years doctors around the country have been working to update the manual. The DSM-5 is expected to be published in May 2013, and the proposed changes to the definition of autism have caused some controversy. Dr. Bryan H. King is one of the doctors working on revising that chapter. My e-mail invitation to be a part of the DSM-5 revision process came on January 4, 2007. At the time, I was told that the work would be completed in 2011 and that participation would not be too burdensome. The process could be accomplished primarily through e-mails and conference calls, with in-person meetings held sparingly. It's interesting to reflect on the fact that when the ink was drying on the last version of the DSM in 1994, e-mail and the Internet as we know it were still evolving. In the nearly two decades since DSM-IV -- such Roman numerals suggest a chiseling in stone, don't they? -- there have been significant advances in technology and medicine, significant advances in our understanding of neuroscience and even changes in the significance of the DSM itself. There are good reasons to change the DSM and perhaps some good reasons to leave it alone. The manual has evolved over time from a relatively small guide for the collection of diagnostic prevalence data to the standard text for every course on psychiatric illness throughout the world. It has also become the dominant coding guide for insurance companies, schools and other agencies responsible for covering or creating special provisions for individuals with developmental or mental disorders.  Whether someone receives the death penalty or a lesser sentence can rise or fall on whether he met criteria for a disorder as defined in the DSM. Every psychiatrist has an opinion about the DSM, and it typically includes both love and hate. In child psychiatry in particular, it is often said that children must not have read the DSM, because their symptoms so rarely seem to fit neatly into one of the diagnoses, often straddling several. Our advances in knowledge over the years clearly support efforts to improve the process, but we need to be particularly careful that we do no harm. Now five years in to this ""nonburdensome"" process, our work group has spent nearly 2,500 person-hours in meetings and another 3,500 hours on teleconferences discussing refinements to the diagnostic criteria for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. And ours is just one of the smaller chapters in this manual.  Work groups focused on mood disorders, personality disorders, anxiety disorders and so on are equally invested in this process. As a group of clinician scientists who have devoted our professional lives to the problem of autism and related disorders, we've been given an extraordinary opportunity to update and improve how autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is diagnosed. Every decision has been considered from multiple perspectives to determine the potential impact on individuals with the disorder.  We've even taken the step of posting iterations of the possible changes online for professional and public comment.  The goal here is not to settle or vote on what is most popular, but to be sure to leverage the collective experience and wisdom of professionals, patients and everyone in between to minimize unanticipated consequences from potential change -- to ensure that we do no harm. We are also directly testing, in trials, how the new criteria will perform. We are specifically looking at whether or not people who currently have appropriate ASD diagnoses might be affected by this change. Our preliminary look at the field trial data suggests that the lines around the autism spectrum disorders will not be significantly redrawn with DSM-5. As we get closer to finalizing this revision of the DSM, there is understandable concern about whether some individuals will ""lose"" their diagnoses. There is no question that some diagnoses will change. For example, Asperger's disorder will become autism spectrum disorder.  But the goal here is finding the best way to capture the symptoms and problems that an individual has, to map those symptoms onto disorders that are valid, and which then inform prognosis and treatment and further study. We have a ways to go before the love-hate relationship we clinicians have with the DSM changes much. I am certain that children will continue to challenge our diagnostic constructs with their complexity, and I know that we will want to resist chiseling DSM-5 criteria into stone. But I also believe that by refining the diagnostic criteria to reflect current science, we're that much closer to getting it right.  Perhaps that will make the next revision less burdensome.  In any case, when the invitation comes for working on the next DSM, it would be wise -- as for any significant remodeling project -- to double the estimate for time to completion. Dr. Bryan H. King is the director at the Seattle Children's Autism Center and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital. On The Autism Blog, King and other medical experts at the Seattle Children's Autism Center share information and perspectives for those raising a child with autism.","Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) helps decide coverage benefits for developmental disorders .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Army tanks and armored personnel carriers patrolled the streets of Tunis Saturday, a day after the prime minister announced that he is the interim president -- the latest development in a story of unrest and public outrage in a tiny but significant corner of the Arab world. Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced Friday on Tunisian state TV that he has taken over the responsibilities of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- who ruled the nation since 1987 and fled in a plane Friday with his relatives. He left a country reeling. Before he stepped down, Ben Ali had dissolved the government and declared a state of emergency.  Under the emergency declaration, people are not allowed on the street between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Groups of three or more people are subject to arrest and, if they try to flee, can be fired on. His departure followed weeks of widespread outrage over poor living conditions and repression of rights. In daily demonstrations, thousands of protesters had denounced corruption in the Ben Ali government and had urged that he step down. He apparently got the message. Ghannouchi moved quickly to fill the vacuum. ""Considering the fact that at the current time he (Ben Ali) cannot fulfill his duties, I take over today, the powers of the president of the republic,"" he told his countrymen. He appealed for calm and pledged to respect the constitution and to carry out the political, economic and social reforms announced this week by Ben Ali. Ghannouchi asked residents to cooperate with the army, which was ordered to take charge of the streets following a state-of-emergency declaration. Moving to calm widespread disillusionment with Ben Ali's government, Ghannouchi told Arabic-language Al Jazeera Television that ""certain measures"" had already been taken against ""corrupt families."" He was referring to those business owners who were close to Ben Ali. Ben Ali's return to Tunisia ""is impossible,"" Ghannouchi said, adding that he would set a date for new elections after conferring Saturday ""with all political powers."" And he extended a welcoming hand to government critics, saying that ""oppositions groups who reside overseas can return to the country."" Meanwhile, the army appeared to be wielding the most power, staking out positions on major streets. ""We hope that the army will match its reputation for being more professional and less trigger-happy than the security forces that have been responsible for much of the violence over the last several weeks,"" said Amnesty International spokesman Claudio Cordone from London. In a telephone interview with CNNI, he said 55 people were killed in Tunisia over the last several weeks of demonstrations. Prior to his departure, Ben Ali had put the number at 21. But the Army's power had limits: Tunisia TV reported looting in different parts of the country on Friday. Ben Ali's plane went on to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the Saudi official news agency reports said he was welcomed by the king. Back in Tunis, the airport was under a lockdown Friday night, with the facility closed and ringed by soldiers. Reporters driving from the airport into the city were stopped several times at military checkpoints.  A few gunshots could be heard at the airport, but otherwise the streets were quiet. Tunisia under Ben Ali has been a pro-Western state supportive of U.S. policy in the Middle East and in its efforts against terrorism. It has been a relatively stable and more prosperous country in what diplomats call ""a rough neighborhood."" The education level in Tunisia is high for the Arab world, and the country is close to France and French culture. Events in Tunisia were being watched closely elsewhere. In Cairo, Egypt, about 45 protesters stood outside the Tunisian Embassy and chanted, ""Revolution in Tunisia is revolution in Egypt!"" They promised to hold a larger demonstration Saturday evening. In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was monitoring the events. ""We condemn the violence and urge restraint on all sides,"" she said in a statement. She urged the Tunisian government to ""respect the right of its people to peacefully assemble and express their views"" and called for ""free and fair elections in the near future that reflect the true will and aspirations of the Tunisian people."" The United States, France, and Britain have issued travel advisories, warning against nonessential visits, and a tourism company announced the evacuation of 2,000 German vacationers. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for restraint, respect for freedom of expression and dialogue to resolve problems peacefully. Recent diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia obtained by WikiLeaks revealed growing disquiet with the government -- especially over nepotism within the government. WikiLeaks published a 2009 cable recounting a lavish dinner for the U.S. ambassador given by Ben Ali's son-in-law, Mohamed Sakher El Materi, a prominent businessman. The ambassador wrote in the cable: ""After dinner, he served ice cream and frozen yogurt he brought in by plane from Saint Tropez (a high-end French resort), along with blueberries and raspberries and fresh fruit and chocolate cake."" The wave of demonstrations in Tunisia -- in which thousands of people protested high unemployment, alleged corruption, rising prices and limitations on rights -- was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate, a man who fatally torched himself in December after police confiscated his fruit cart, cutting off his source of income. CNN's Rima Makatabi, Ben Wedeman and Mary Rogers in Tunis, Caroline Faraj in Dubai, Niki Cook in Paris, Amir Ahmed and Bobby Afshar in Atlanta and Journalist Ian Lee in Cairo contributed to this report.","NEW: Ghannouchi calls Ben Ali's return ""impossible""

"More than half of all teens and young adults say they have been bullied or harassed online, according to the results of a new poll on Internet behavior. In an Associated Press/MTV poll, 56 percent of respondents, who were between 14 and 24 years old, said they had ""experienced abuse"" through digital media. That's up from 50 percent in a similar 2009 survey. Some of the most common forms of harassment include posting something online that's not true, writing things online that are ""mean"" and sharing texts or other messages that were meant to stay private, according to the results. And while the ability to stay anonymous online is often cited as a reason why digital bullying can get so bad, survey respondents said that, more often than not, that's not the case. ""Most say the perpetrators of the bad behavior are people they know very well,"" the survey reads. One out of three resopndents also said they've taken part in so-called ""sexting,"" which includes sending and receiving nude photos or video or sexually charged text. Seventy-one percent of them said that ""sexting"" is a problem for Web users their age. Ten percent of respondents who said they'd exchanged sexual messages said they'd done so with people they only know online -- a steep drop from the 29 percent who said they'd done so in 2009. If there's a bright spot, it's that more respondents this year said they recognize online bullying as a problem than did two years ago and more said they'd intervene if they saw it happening. Fifty-six percent said they would likely intervene if they saw someone being harassed online, compared with 47 percent in 2009. The survey is part of MTV's ""A Thin LIne,"" campaign, a multiyear effort to stamp out digital abuse. ""The campaign is built on the understanding that there's a 'thin line' between what may begin as a harmless joke and something that could end up having a serious impact on you or someone else,"" MTV writes on the campaign's website. ""We know no generation has ever had to deal with this, so we want to partner with you to help figure it out."" The survey results were based on interviews of 1,355 teens and young adults conducted between August 18-31. It has a margin of error of 3.8 percent.","Survey: More than half of teens, young adults have experienced online harassment .

"The news that Yahoo knowingly chose a pregnant woman as its new CEO has rightly been heralded by working women and their allies as another hole in the glass ceiling. Marissa Mayer, until now a top executive at Google, reports that when she told Yahoo's board of directors that she and her husband are expecting their first child in October, no one expressed any second thoughts about hiring her. The lack of reaction ""showed their evolved thinking,"" she said. But Mayer's next sentence immediately squashed any illusions that her presence at Yahoo foreshadows any change in corporate America's 24/7 work culture. ""My maternity leave,"" she told reporters, ""will be a few weeks long, and I'll work throughout it."" Mayer's assurance that having a child will require so little adjustment in her work schedule has led many women to worry that she is naive about the physical and emotional price she will pay for taking so little time to recuperate and bond with her new baby. Others express concern that her child will suffer for her decision. Tech: 11 fun facts about Mayer . These worries are mostly groundless. The real problem with Mayer's pledge to take only a few weeks off and work right through it has little to do with her own welfare or her child's. It is the message this sends to her employees about the expected work culture at Yahoo. Mayer will probably do just fine returning to work so early. Top executives have much more flexibility than the lower-level employees they rely on to be at the office bright and early, set things up for the day, reschedule appointments when necessary, run errands and deliver needed papers if they are working off-site. They can also afford to hire live-in nannies so that they never need to scramble to cover gaps or breakdowns in child care coverage. Mayer's husband, a tech investor, has similar flexibility. Mayer's son is also likely to turn out fine, assuming that she and her husband are even moderately competent parents. On average, while very short maternity leaves do increase the risk of insecure attachment between mother and child, most mothers bond successfully, even with short leaves. Psychologists Philip and Carolyn Cowan, authors of ""When Partners Become Parents"" and leading experts in what makes for effective child outcomes, note that  kids of working mothers do well when women are happy with their jobs, have good child care arrangements, and fathers actively participate in making these work-family choices. Tech: Six life lessons from Yahoo CEO . In fact, a major predictor of whether a woman will be warm and responsive to her child,  avoiding the bouts of depression that are one of the most serious threats to effective parenting, is whether she is happy about the work choices she makes. A woman with Mayer's work ethic would probably be a less effective parent if she felt compelled to stay home when she wanted to work. But Mayer's insistence that she will get back to work so quickly sets a bad precedent for Yahoo's lower-level employees, mothers and fathers, who do not have the job flexibility and cannot afford the extensive social support and backup systems that Mayer and her husband will be able to construct. Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, argues that the personal work-life choices of top leaders in a workplace are as important as their formal work-life programs and policies in shaping expectations about what is and is not acceptable. Leaders who take little time off for family create a work culture that inhibits lower-level employees from asking for any work-family rearrangements they may need. Tech: The internet just wants Mayer to fix Flickr . It's great that corporate leaders no longer assume a high-powered female employee will lose her brain, drive and work commitment when she gets pregnant. And I admire Mayer for feeling free to set a high priority upon her work commitments without succumbing to the guilt that weighs down so many working moms. But it might be better for the rest of us working parents, who don't have the same resources and support systems, if she would take a longer leave and maintain a dignified silence about just how many work hours she puts in during it. How do you balance career and family? Let us know on CNN iReport.","Yahoo has chosen Marissa Mayer, who is pregnant, as its new CEO .

"(CNN) -- Daniil Kvyat shivers at the memory of a childhood visit to Sochi, the Black Sea resort which is preparing to stage the first Russian Grand Prix this week. ""There was snow and rain, and it was three degrees, really cold,"" the Russian Formula One racer tells CNN. ""I had to use double gloves to drive! ""I was 10-years-old and it was my first ever karting race. I was very nervous -- but still I managed to win."" That maiden competitive victory on the snowy streets of Sochi a decade ago was a landmark event for the ambitious youngster. It may just have planted the icy streak of competitiveness which has earned Kvyat the coveted job of replacing Sebastian Vettel at Red Bull next season. The 20-year-old will follow in the four-time world champion's footsteps by graduating from junior team Toro Rosso after just a single full season learning the ropes. ""They know what kind of driver I am,"" Kvyat told the media in Japan, where he was named as Vettel's successor. ""I will do my best to prove them right."" With his aura of cool confidence, it's easy to forget that Kvyat is still a rookie racer in the realms of F1. Those within the sport's inner circles -- as well as his new boss Christian Horner - have been impressed with his ability to adapt to circuit conditions and his baseline speed. The young Russian qualified eighth on his debut in Australia and crossed the line ninth, a career-best finish he also claimed in Britain and Belgium. ""I didn't have any problems adapting myself to any of the special conditions, let's say,"" Kvyat explains. ""I managed to find my pace straight away without losing time. It's true that when I am comfortable with a car I can take the maximum out of it."" When asked in the summer if he wanted Vettel's job leading the senior Red Bull team, Kvyat laughed before adding, ""I don't know. ""We do know Red Bull Racing is a top team for the world championship..."" Kvyat's future pairing with Daniel Ricciardo -- the man he replaced at Toro Rosso this season -- will be an intriguing partnership. From the outside the duo look like chalk and cheese. Ricciardo is the smiley, practical joker with Kvyat the stick-thin straight man. The Russian is said to be so focused on his ambitions in F1 that he doesn't even have time for a girlfriend, surely a rarity among F1's leading men. Kvyat definitely has a cool head on his young shoulders and refuses to believe any of the hype bubbling around him. ""Obviously you shouldn't let emotions drive you too much,"" he says. ""I think being calm always helps. ""You still have to be happy with what you've done and always keep pushing for whatever it is (you want). ""If it will come it will come, or it will not come."" Coming round the corner very soon is another lifetime landmark for the boy who grew up in Ufa, a city he describes as ""industrial but nice."" On Sunday, Kyvat will become the first homegrown racer to contest a Russian GP, the newest addition to the sport's peripatetic calendar. ""I'm really happy to be going back,"" says Kvyat, who moved to Italy when he was 12 to fuel his racing ambitions. ""The place means so much to me and obviously I hope to give the crowd something to cheer about. ""It's important to have a flag on your heart and in your soul and for me that's the Russian flag."" Russia has had to wait a long time for motorsport to come in from the cold -- 100 years in fact. The last Russian Grand Prix was held in St Petersburg in 1914 before the outbreak of WW1 and the Russian civil war pushed motorsport off the national agenda. There have been attempts to add Russia to the world championship calendar since the late 1970s but it was the 2014 Winter Olympics -- the most expensive in history -- that was to prove the catalyst for a Russian race. ""We got help from the Olympics,"" Russian F1 television presenter and commentator Alexey Popov explains to CNN. ""It was decided a race track would be would be part of the Olympic Park. ""Without that the circuit in Sochi would never have been built. President Putin himself signed with Bernie [Ecclestone, the sport's commercial rights holder] four years ago."" The 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the 2018 soccer World Cup are headline events for Russia but F1 is still a relatively small sport in a country with a population of 146 million citizens. Popov, who is the face of motorsport on Russian state broadcaster VGTRK, says this season each grand prix reaches an average of around two million viewers. ""It is not immensely popular,"" he says. ""It's not ice hockey or the Olympics. It's not such a big story for the government as the World Cup. ""I hope that changes. I've sacrificed 23 years of my life trying to change the perception. Every bloody Sunday I work on it! ""But the national grand prix is a national grand prix and there is a little bit of pride. ""If one guy begins to win everything, like Michael Schumacher or Fernando Alonso did, he really can change the perception."" Kvyat isn't a household name yet in Russia. The most famous driver is, as in most countries around the world, seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. With a future as a Red Bull driver secured, the 20-year-old surely must believe he has a chance of becoming Russia's first title winner? ""I don't get caught thinking about it too much,"" says Kvyat with his poker-face in place. ""I do my job, I do my best and if my best is enough for it... Of course, it would be nice."" He pauses and then, letting his guard down a little, he confides: ""I am living for this.""","Daniil Kvyat will drive at Sunday's inaugural Russian Grand Prix in Sochi .

"(CNN)Olajumoke Adenowo's life is one of numbers. She enrolled at the University of Ife at just 14. Five years later, she had her first degree in architecture, and by 23 she was employed and designing her first building. Three years later, she set up shop solo, and two decades on she is one of Nigeria's most accomplished architects. Always an overachiever, the ambitious builder -- once described as the ""face of architecture in the Nigeria"" -- has dedicated her illustrious career to reimagining her homeland's landscape. Involved in the design and construction of over 70 buildings, she has brought institutional facilities, epic 2,500-seat auditoriums, residences, estates and cutting edge corporate offices to life. Adenowo's hugely successful career is no doubt a reflection of the dreamer's passion for her craft, and her success has been confirmed by  numerous architectural accolades awarded to the 46-year-old. Besides these business-based achievements, her work with women pushing for gender equality -- Adenowo hosts her own radio show mentoring women -- has seen her receive several commendations from the likes of the United Nations Information Center over the years. Here she reveals to CNN how she designs both functional and beautiful structures across the continent, her top tips for success and why she wants to inspire the next generation. Mentorship is vital. Upon graduating at an early age, Adenowo quickly found work at Femi Majekodunmi Associates architectural firm where she impressed her boss -- then the President of the International Union of Architectects -- with her passion and enthusiasm. The work ethic she displayed opened up great opportunities for the rising designer who was soon asked to create the Federal Ministry of Lands in Abuja. ""I was always ready. I would be at the office at 11pm on Sunday when other girls are dancing or something. I think my boss saw my passion and he gave me a chance,"" she says. ""If we had more mentors like that in Africa, I believe the younger generation would blossom faster."" It's OK to work things out as you go. At 25, Adenowo decided to go it alone and start her own company, AD Consulting. It was a big risk to undertake but her reputation as one of Nigeria's most prominent architects proves that sometimes you have jump into the unknown. ""The office was a little bigger than three chairs. It was myself and a young boy who sat in the corridor but I started anyway because I believe that you do what you can with what you have, where you are."" Great architecture isn't just a building. Adenowo explains that to build a great building, you have to have an omniscient outlook. ""You have to know history, you have to understand culture, sociology, anthropology. You need to know physics, you have to understand chemistry to a point. You have to understand art and the history of art to be a really good architect,"" she says. ""Good architecture is about the spirit of the age. If you look at a pyramid, it talks about one man's quest to be immortal ... It's 4,500 years old and we still see them. We can no longer forget those pharaohs because of architecture."" Go a step further than 3D. ""My buildings all have a fourth dimension and the fourth dimension is time. Each space I design changes in time. I design lighting schemes in such a way that by night the building is a totally different entity from what it was in the morning. I design buildings in such a way that as you move through the space, you experience something new at every step."" Passion doesn't just come from within. ""The passion comes from my clients. I feed off their energy... I would do anything for my clients to make sure that their buildings come out the way they should."" Take ownership and inspire. Despite juggling a prosperous career and a family at home, Adenowo still finds time to mentor women through her weekly radio show. She also founded the Awesome Treasures Foundation in 1999, which helps mentor women and young girls. ""We believe the greatest need of Africa is leadership, vision. Strong people who are ready to give their all to say, 'this is the way', and Awesome Treasures is here to address that need, to raise transformational leaders."" The sky's the limit. Adenowo may have achieved great success but that doesn't mean she's resting on her laurels. ""In the next five years, it would be a dream come true if I have the opportunity to design a building that would define Nigeria's identity. The way you see the Tour d'Eiffel and you think Paris, the Empire State Building and you think New York.""","Olajumoke Adenowo is one of Nigeria's leading architects .

"The Senate Finance Committee is launching an investigation to determine whether a charity intended to help disabled veterans deserves its tax-exempt status after doling out millions of dollars to a direct-mail company. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chairman of the committee, announced the investigation into the Disabled Veterans National Foundation on Wednesday. He said the committee will seek to determine whether the foundation, the subject of a two-year CNN investigation, should keep its status as a 501(c)3 charity under Internal Revenue Service guidelines. ""Our veterans should never be used as pawns in a scheme to exploit the taxpayers,"" Baucus said in a Wednesday news release announcing the investigation.  ""The tax exemption for charities exists to promote worthwhile causes like assistance to veterans, not to provide tax loopholes to abuse.  DVNF has a responsibility to show it's genuinely helping veterans and playing by the rules."" CNN's investigation into the foundation, part of ""AC360's"" ""Keeping Them Honest"" series, played a major role in prompting the committee's investigation, according to a committee staff member who did not want to be identified. CNN found that the charity's tax records and other documents showed that little of the nearly $56 million raised by the Disabled Veterans National Foundation over the past three years has gone to direct aid to veterans. The group has paid nearly $61 million to Quadriga Art and its subsidiaries, one of the world's largest direct-mail providers to charities and nonprofits, and its subsidiaries over the past three years, according to publicly available IRS 990 tax forms. The Disabled Veterans National Foundation still has a business relationship with Quadriga Art through 2013, with Quadriga Art saying the foundation has acquired nearly 2 million donors through its direct-mail program. CharityWatch, the nation's largest charity watchdog group, has given the Disabled Veterans National Foundation an ""F"" grade since 2010 because of the miniscule amount the charity actually spent on veterans -- which CharityWatch estimates to be 2%. In addition to its questionable finances, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation has provided massive amounts of unnecessary items to veterans aid groups, including candy, hand sanitizer and dress shoes -- all surplus items that the charity receives at no cost. In one instance, St. Benedict's, a small veterans shelter in Birmingham, Alabama, received an unsolicited shipment of goods that included 2,300 emergency blankets that were ""heavily used"" after last year's devastating tornado, according to the shelter's director. But the charity also sent St. Benedict's more than 11,000 bags of coconut M&M's candy and more than 700 pairs of surplus Navy dress shoes, which the shelter's president said he could not use. The Disabled Veterans National Foundation also claimed in its tax filings more than $838,000 in fair market value donations to another charity, although the bill of lading obtained by CNN showed that the donations -- which included chefs' coats and aprons -- was valued at about $234,000. CNN attempted to get a comment from the Disabled Veterans National Foundation for more than a year but received no replies to specific questions, even after submitting several questions in writing. When approached by a CNN crew at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Disabled Veterans National Foundation President Precilla Wilkewitz rebuffed questions. Later, after being approached at a public event, Vice President Valerie Conley responded that ""not all the funds"" raised by the Disabled Veterans National Foundation go to fundraising. '""The cost of fundraising is high, as you know,"" she said. ""And it has been for many veteran service organizations who use this kind of direct paying approach."" On Wednesday, Wilkewitz released a statement saying the foundation ""will happily answer the questions posed by the United States Senate Finance Committee and provide it with information that others have sadly, chosen to ignore."" The Disabled Veterans National Foundation ""has helped tens out thousands of veterans with direct financial aid and supplies that have made a difference in their lives. Media reports about our activities have been plain wrong and we welcome the opportunity to set the record straight,"" Wilkewitz said in the statement. Two-thirds of the more than 30 veterans charities rated by CharityWatch were given a ""D"" or ""F"" grade based on the amount they spend on fundraising compared with actual donations, according to CharityWatch President Daniel Borochoff. A small charity called the National Veterans Foundation, also connected to Quadriga Art, gets an ""F"" grade as well. Its officers say they have been trying to cancel a contract with Quadriga Art since August. ""It's as if you're looking at these ratios through a funhouse mirror,"" Borochoff said of the National Veterans Foundation. ""It really ought to be reversed. It ought to be flipped.  They ought to be giving 80 or 90% to helping veterans, not 12%. It's pathetic.""","Senate Finance Committee says it will investigate Disabled Veterans National Foundation .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican authorities were searching Wednesday for two politicians accused of belonging to the Familia Michoacana drug cartel, which is blamed for killing more than 30 federal police officers in a series of attacks since Saturday. Drug violence is up in Michoacan state, shown by recent attacks on police in at least a half-dozen cities. Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress, is accused of being in charge of protection for the cartel, said Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, head of the National Public Security Council. Godoy Toscano is half-brother to Michoacan's governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel, who Wednesday urged his relative to surrender. Authorities also said they are searching for Saul Solis Solis, alias ""El Lince,"" who lost his bid for a congressional seat this month. He is accused of being in charge of the cartel's activities in the Huacana area. Solis is a cousin of Enrique Plancarte Solis, a Familia Michoacana leader, Rubido said. Both suspects report to Servando Gomez Martinez, known as ""La Tuta,"" Rubido said. Godoy Toscano was elected as a member of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, known as the PRD. The party said Wednesday it would not protect Godoy Toscano or any member who has broken the law. Godoy Rangel, the Michoacan governor, told a radio station there's nothing he could do to help his fugitive brother. ""I cannot protect anyone, not even my children,"" the government-run news agency Notimex quoted him as saying. He said Wednesday that he has no intention of resigning, because he has done nothing wrong, Notimex said. Solis sought election as a member of the Green Ecological Party of Mexico. The party, commonly called the PVEM, announced Wednesday it had broken relations with Solis. In recent days, Michoacan, the home state of President Felipe Calderon, has become a flash point for the country's war against the drug cartels. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, whom authorities described as a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana. Cartel members first attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda, authorities said. When that failed, drug gangs attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. The Michoacan cartel also is accused in the slaying of 12 federal police officers whose bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway. Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: ""So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here."" Rubido announced the arrest Tuesday of Francisco Javier Frias Lara, known as ""El Chivo,"" in connection with the killings. Frias also is an alleged member of La Familia Michoacana. Reprisals from drug cartels after major arrests have been reported before, but the intensity of the attacks in Michoacan are unprecedented. This week's violence solidifies the cartel as a major and violent player in Mexico's drug wars, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami and an expert on drug trafficking. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in 2006. More than 10,000 people have died in that time span, about 1,000 of them police. This weekend, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, the toll of drug-related deaths for the year topped 1,000, a level the Mexican city did not reach last year until September. At this point last year, the violence-plagued city, across the border from El Paso, Texas, had tallied 596 killings, El Universal newspaper said Tuesday, citing figures from the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Also in Chihuahua state, a mayor was shot and killed Tuesday morning while on his way to work. Ariel Meixequeiro had twice temporarily left his post because he had been threatened by crime gangs, El Universal said. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, Saul Solis Solis alleged to belong to cartel .

"A day after confirming it had lost the ability to display Instagram images, Twitter has rolled out its own library of retro filters for its Android and iPhone apps. The eight filters are the usual suspects we've come to expect from mobile photo apps, including desaturated, black and white and high contrast. There are auto-adjust and cropping options, as well as a helpful grid view that lets you see what each filter will look like at once. ""The latest versions of Twitter for iPhone and Twitter for Android introduce a few new ways to enhance the images you tweet,"" said Twitter senior designer Coleen Baik in a blog post announcing the new features. She emphasized that images are important to Twitter users, and called photos ""one of the most compelling forms of self-expression."" The new filters were designed especially for Twitter by photo-editing service Aviary, which also handles edits for various partners such as Flickr and Twitpic. What the effects lack in originality, they will no doubt make up for in popularity. Filters are an easy alternative to tinkering with an image in a photo editor, and their retro aesthetic has helped Instagram get more than 150 million users. Instagram also released an app update Monday, giving its iOS app a fresh new look and adding a new black and white filter. There's a new grid overlay, better tilt-shift effects and a bigger shutter button among other tweaks. Twitter is in direct competition for users and ad dollars with Facebook, which owns Instagram. Until this week, if you shared an Instagram photo on Twitter, it would appear in the expanded tweet. But on Sunday, the companies confirmed that feature was no more, the image replaced with a link to the photo on Instagram's site. The addition of in-app filters is great for Twitter users who didn't like the extra step of launching Instagram or another photo editing app to spruce up images. Twitter first added the ability to include images in tweets a year and a half ago. Slight improvements on the individual social networks might not make up for the larger loss of cross-service functionality, but the split between competitors was inevitable. If you have an Android device, the updated Twitter app is available now in the Google Play store. It is coming soon to Apple's App Store.","Twitter has added photo filters to its Android and iOS mobile apps .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Sarah Palin has awesome power. We already knew that she had the power to drive liberal Democrats crazy. They don't respect her, but they sure do fear her. And this week we learned that Palin also has the power to make those same liberal Democrats forget all the preaching they've shared with the rest of us over the years about the importance of tolerance and defending those with special needs. Like, say, a little boy with Down syndrome who will be two years old in April but who has already been the butt of a national joke by the brainless and heartless creator and producers of the Fox animated comedy, ""Family Guy."" In a recent episode, the character Chris is dating a teenage girl with Down syndrome, and when he asks her what her parents do, she says, ""My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" Get it? If you don't get it, you're trying awfully hard not to get it. All week, the Palin haters have made feeble attempts to excuse away the offense. It's a teenage girl, not a 2-year-old boy. Palin isn't even mentioned. How is this scene an attack on anyone, let alone a child with Down syndrome? Yada, yada. Please. The whole reason the gag was inserted into that scene in the first place is because it was assumed that the audience would know exactly who the dig was aimed it. Otherwise the joke doesn't work. When the bit is taken literally, the target is Palin's son Trig. But clearly, the intended target was Palin. With the former GOP vice presidential candidate, bestselling author, television commentator and high-priced speaker riding high, this was about trying to take her down a peg. As someone who is paid to do the same thing with politicians, I'd normally have a hard time criticizing a jab at a public figure -- even if I like the person, as is the case with Palin. But here, liberal Hollywood made it easy. This gag was unfunny, unkind and unnecessary. Unfunny because I doubt liberals would have found the humor in a bit showing President Clinton, one of their icons, having a heart attack. Unkind because at the center of all this is a toddler with Down syndrome who, as Palin's daughter Bristol wrote on her mom's Facebook page, already has a hard life in store -- filled with intolerance, prejudice and limitations imposed by others. David Tolleson, head of the Atlanta-based National Down Syndrome Congress, called parts of the gag ""hurtful and stereotypical."" And unnecessary because there are a million different ways to have written that scene that wouldn't have been so cruel. Wanna take Palin down a peg? Fine. But don't use her child to do it -- especially this child. Again, it's disappointing that none of this seems to bother those on the left who are, it turns out, much more willing to put up with intolerance when it's aimed at one of their nemeses. But liberals aren't the only ones veering off their script. Conservatives are, too. After years of telling women, minorities, gays and lesbians, and others to lighten up and not be so overly sensitive to flashes of intolerance and bigotry, now folks on the right are singing a different tune. They're outraged -- and circling the wagons around Palin. Good. Glad to hear it. They should be outraged. But does this mean I can count on their support the next time there's an insensitive or offensive comment, cartoon, caricature or other item that goes beyond the pale and offends someone they don't care about? And what of Hollywood? How much consistency do we find there? Not much. ""Family Guy"" creator Seth McFarlane told the Los Angeles Times in a statement that he's ""an equal opportunity offender"" and that ""from its inception, 'Family Guy' has used biting satire as the foundation of its humor."" This is the same show that, during the presidential election, compared Palin and running mate John McCain to Nazis. In an episode that aired in October 2008, some of the characters are transported back in time to Nazi Germany where they try to blend in by pilfering uniforms of the Third Reich, one of which had a McCain/Palin button on the lapel. This is the same Seth McFarlane who, that same month, spoke at an Obama-Biden rally at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, where he took shots at Republicans and urged students to support the Democratic ticket. Equal opportunity offender? I've seen the show. It's not that funny. But the guy behind it is a riot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","""Family Guy"" show alluded to Sarah Palin's disabled child .
Ruben Navarrette says the jab was unfunny and hurtful .
He says liberals who normally denounce such offensive references are silent on this one ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Investigators so far have failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in the September 3 crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai, a U.S. government official told CNN Tuesday. White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan told CNN Sunday that the United States was ""looking very carefully"" at that crash -- in which the two pilots were killed -- to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft. The Boeing 747 -- operated by UPS -- went down in Dubai, where one of two toner cartridge bombs was recovered just seven weeks later. The other was recovered on a plane in the U.K. But as investigators in the United States and the United Arab Emirates continue to explore the cause of the crash, they say that at this time, there is no evidence of terrorism. Government investigators have reviewed the cargo plane's manifest, a U.S. government source said. The official said that there were ""a few -- not many, but a few -- packages (on the UPS plane) that originated in Yemen."" ""However, they (investigators) have a basic idea of what part of the plane the fire started and these were nowhere near there,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation. Also, officials in the United Arab Emirates have said -- and a U.S. official confirmed -- that the plane's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion. Explosions have distinctive sound signatures, and that would have been recorded on the device, the official said. The UAE said it has ""eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion, following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage."" U.S. authorities aren't going that far, saying only that the investigation is continuing. The official noted that a fire caused by an incendiary device, rather than an explosive device, would not have been recorded by the plane's cockpit voice recorder. About 45 minutes after UPS Flight 6 departed Dubai International Airport for Cologne, Germany, the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit. They requested a return to Dubai, but shortly before the plane got to the airport, it crashed. The cause of the fire is unknown, one official said. One thing investigators are looking at is lithium batteries, which are known to have been on the flight. Even if the lithium batteries were not the source of the fire, they could have made it worse if they were burned.","The U.S. had been looking carefully at the UPS crash for terror links .

"(OPRAH.com) -- ""But I don't want to join Twitter,"" my friend Leda says, fighting off my entreaties to start tweeting so we can stay in touch throughout the day. ""I already feel like I spend too much time online. Don't you feel like it just distracts you from actually connecting with people?"" Leda had a point. I'd been on Twitter for over a year, but it was only in the past few months that I'd gotten into it as a daily part of my routine. And while I loved its chattiness, I was mostly chatting with people I barely knew. A normal human being might have solved the problem by spending less time on Twitter and more time on the phone. But many of my closest friends are on the East Coast or in Europe, so by the time I get my kids in bed, it's too late to call. That's how I fell into tweeting: it lets me have a (pseudo) social life during the hours of the day when I'm actually available to chat. But that was no reason to connect with casual acquaintances more than dear friends. Inspired by my conversation with Leda, I sorted my Twitter buddies so that the people I loved most were in a special group. Then I set up my Twitter client to give special prominence to the updates from people I love -- or people I could love if we had more contact. Overnight, Twitter stopped being a way to keep up with colleagues and became a way of keeping in touch with friends. Oprah.com: Could Twitter help you lose weight? Whether your online interactions happen on Facebook, Twitter or some other platform, you can bring the same quality of intention to your online relationships. Online conversation can be a great boon to your friendships, but only if you organize your online socializing around the kinds of relationships -- and that specific people -- that matter to you. Go where your friends are . As soon as I reorganized Twitter to focus my attention on my most valued relationships, I noticed how many of my dearest pals weren't on Twitter at all: They were on Facebook. In my enthusiasm for the shiny novelty of Twitter, I'd forgotten all about Facebook -- but went back to checking Facebook regularly when I realized that's where my closest pals hung out. You wouldn't hang out at the latest trendy bar if your friends were still gathering at the neighborhood pub; don't get caught up in the race to join the latest hip network if it takes you away from the online communities that engage your dearest friends. Oprah.com: How one woman's finding miracles on Facebook . Prioritize your BFF . Before I had kids, I spent hours on the phone every week and stayed in regular contact with half a dozen good friends. But the after-work hours that I used to spend yakking with my girlfriends are now filled with feeding, bathing and reading to my kids; I'm lucky if I can find an hour a week to talk with a friend. That's enough time to talk with each of my close friends once every three months -- or to talk with one good friend every 10 days. Focusing my phone time on my oldest and dearest friend means that when we talk, we can actually have a meaningful conversation about the latest chapter in our lives, rather than using an hour to catch up on news highlights. Social networks can make staying in touch a lot easier, but they can't actually cram more hours into the day. If you focus your online and phone time on a couple of close friendships, you'll have more meaningful conversations than you can sustain with a large circle. Don't confuse ""friends"" with friends . ""You know S., don't you?"" a colleague asked. The name was familiar, but I couldn't place it. ""You're friends on Facebook,"" my husband reminded me. Make that ""friends,"" not friends. The fastest way to erode your commitment to the relationships that matter to you is to confuse that long list of buddies you have on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn with actual people you know and love. Oprah.com: A newcomer's guide to Facebook . Take the move test . A year after our daughter was born, my husband and I interviewed for a number of jobs in another city. As we contemplated moving towns, we found ourselves pulling back from our extended circle of friends. We decided to turn this instinctive withdrawal into a conscious choice and stopped making plans with anyone we didn't expect to stay in touch with after moving. Ironically, this contributed to our decision to stay put: Once we focused our time and attention on the people we saw as lifelong friends, our social life became much more meaningful and satisfying. Whether you move every year or plan on living in one place your whole life, an imaginary move is a great way of focusing your email, chat and Facebook time on the people who you love most. Balance your social life . We were at a local restaurant for dinner with our closest couple friends, enjoying a rare evening of adult conversation while the kids stayed home. As we compared notes on our jobs, kids and sex lives (like I said, close friends), I found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours, where four women made up a ""Sex and the City"" quartet huddled in an intimate conversation. How long had it been since I went out with a gang of women myself? Friendship isn't one thing. Even if you have satisfying one-on-one visits with your BFF, or a few great couples with whom you and your sweetie socialize, you may be missing group friendships. Or you may have friends who are great for a wild night out but miss that trusted confidante. Know the balance of friendship types and friendship time that makes you happy, and you'll be better able to create that social life by cultivating current or new relationships online. Accept compromise . It's Saturday night, and as my husband and I banter across Twitter, we're joined online by friends who weigh in on our latest debate and tease us for our geekiness. If we had found a sitter, we'd be at a party across town, but once again we're confined to quarters, where socializing via Twitter serves as the next best thing. For those times when you know what kind of social life you want, but budget, time or logistics make it impossible, the Web can be a great pinch hitter. Maybe your ideal night out is a hockey game and a trip to a bar -- but you know you'll still have to wake up at 6 with your toddler. Watch the game at home on HD while you commiserate over that rotten play via chat or Skype""!. Maybe you'd like to spend more time with your BFF, but your husband finds her husband dead boring. Invite them over for a night of Wii gaming, and let the guys play Guitar Hero while you and your pal catch up. If these tips sound like they're more about emotional intelligence than tech know-how, you're catching on. The secret to a satisfying social life online doesn't lie in which network you join or how cool your profile page looks -- it's about using social networks to reflect and amplify the way you connect with your friends. And as your BFF can already tell you, you've got that down cold. Oprah.com: Are we hurting ourselves with all this communication?

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The imam behind the controversial mosque and Islamic center near New York City's ground zero said Sunday that he hopes the project will develop ""an Islamic approach that allows for harmony and understanding among all religions and other ideas."" The remarks from Abdul Rauf, who has rarely spoken to the media since his proposal for an Islamic center set off a firestorm of controversy this summer, came while the imam is on a State Department-sponsored trip to the Middle East. Rauf spoke with the newspaper Bahraini Al Wasat before he was scheduled to appear at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Bahrain, the newspaper's editor said. In the interview, to be published Monday, Rauf praised freedoms that Muslims and others enjoy in the United States. ""If we look at the American Declaration of Independence, we see that it speaks of principles that comply with Islam,"" Rauf said, according to Bahraini Al Wasat editor-in-chief Mansoor Al-Jamri. ""The U.S. Constitution protects our rights and what exists in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution is much better than what is found in many Islamic countries."" Rauf is on his third trip to discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said earlier this month. ""We have a long-term relationship with him,"" Crowley said. ""His work on tolerance and religious diversity is well known, and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what it's like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States."" Crowley said the imam's trip would take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to Bahrain, an island nation off the coast of Saudi Arabia. His previous trips under the government program were in 2007 to Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar and Morocco, and earlier this year to Egypt. The trip is one of about 1,200 similar programs of sending experts overseas, Crowley said. Some lawmakers have urged the State Department to rethink plans to sponsor Rauf on trips abroad. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, and Peter King, R-New York, the ranking members of the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees, called the State Department's funding of Rauf's current trip ""unacceptable,"" and said American taxpayers should not have to subsidize his tour. In New York on Sunday, opponents of the planned Islamic community center faced off with demonstrators in favor of the facility. Hundreds of critics and supporters of the proposed center in New York showed up despite an overcast and drizzly sky to express their views amid the national debate over the facility. Police estimated that supporters of the center numbered up to 250, and critics numbered about 450 during the demonstration. A banner on the anti-center side said, ""Land of the free. Stop sharia before it stops you,"" referring to Islamic law. Another sign read, ""No mosque here. Preserve the dignity of our loved ones killed on 9/11."" Others said Americans need to set an example of tolerance to the rest of the world. ""It would be giving in to bigotry and intolerance to demand that it be moved and I think in the end, it makes us less safe because we need to show the world that we are a tolerant, open society,"" supporter Ruth Massie said.","Abdul Rauf said he wants to promote ""harmony and understanding""

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba on Thursday denounced the U.S. decision to again include the island nation on its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Earlier in the day, the U.S. State Department in its annual report on terrorism named four countries on its 2009 list: Iran, Sudan, Syria and Cuba. ""We categorically reject the decision,"" said Josefina Vidal, the head of the North America Department at Cuba's Foreign Ministry. ""Yet again, the United States questions the seriousness of our commitment to the fight against international terrorism and maintains one of the most irrational aspects that constitute its hostile policy on Cuba,"" she said in a statement. The State Department accused Cuba of assisting members of Colombian rebel groups and Spain's ETA, who live on the island.","The U.S. names four countries on its list of state sponsors of terrorism .

"Time's almost up. Monday is the deadline tor residents of most states to sign up for Obamacare if they want coverage starting January 1. And that's a big deal -- for two reasons: . Most Americans will be required to have some kind of health insurance in 2014 or face a fine. There's also a lot riding on this politically. Monday will be a key test of President Barack Obama's attempt to overhaul the country's health insurance system. Here's what you need to know about the Affordable Health Care Act coverage and Monday's deadline. 1) I'm confused. Haven't the enrollment deadlines moved around? There's been a lot of confusion about the deadlines, and for good reason. Federal and state governments, as well as insurers, keep changing the dates, mainly to accommodate those blocked from completing enrollment due to technical problems. Each consumer faces two deadlines: one by which to choose a plan, and another for making a payment. If you live in one of the 36 states serviced by the federal enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, your best bet for getting hassle-free coverage in 2014 is to select a policy by end of the day Monday and pay your first month's premium by January 10. 2) Do I have to have coverage beginning January 1? Not really. The deadline to enroll in coverage to avoid a fine is March 31. That's the date that the program's open enrollment period officially ends. It won't reopen until October 15. 3) So why should I worry about the January 1 date? If you're without health coverage now, or your plan ends December 31, you may want to get covered as soon as possible. You want to leave enough time for insurance companies to process your application. And given all the shifting dates, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says consumers will have to be extra diligent. ""We advise consumers to call their insurance company to make sure that their payment has been received and that they are indeed enrolled,"" she said in mid-December. 4) Are the technical problems that plagued the site fixed? The HealthCare.gov enrollment website got off to a chaotic start, with many users unable to enroll for days due to technical problems. ""We screwed it up,"" Obama conceded Friday. But the Obama administration said the issues should be resolved. Americans are enrolling on HealthCare.gov at a pace of around 25,000 per day so far in December. And with few major website outages, it appears the website's worst technical problems may be in the past. 5) Will HealthCare.gov be able to handle a wave of new customers Monday? HealthCare.gov was down for several hours before the president's remarks. So it remains to be seen if a last-minute surge in enrollments will have an impact. Federal officials recently said that anyone who tries to sign up but encounters a problem with the website can qualify for a special enrollment period and gain coverage as soon as possible. 6) Who doesn't have to get health insurance? Some Americans, such as those who can't afford it, will be exempt from the health insurance mandate, according to the Congressional Budget Office. For example, people who make so little they don't have to file a tax return are exempt. People who are in this country without authorization are exempted, as are members of a federally recognized American Indian tribe who are eligible for services through an American Indian health care provider. People with certain religious beliefs that conflict with acceptance of the benefits of private or public insurance are also exempt. 7) Are the rules different in state-based exchanges? If you are applying in one of the 14 states running its own exchange, you may have a different set of deadlines. Rhode Islanders, for example, have until December 31 to pick a plan with coverage starting the next day. But they have to pay their first premium by January 6 and won't receive an ID card until they do. In Washington, residents who try to apply by Monday but run into problems have until January 15 to pick and pay for a plan. Coverage will be retroactive to January 1. California is giving residents until January 6 to pay, and Connecticut until January 10. In other words, if you're looking at a state-based exchange, it's best to check with the exchange directly. 8) Are state-based exchanges seeing a similar surge? Enrollments there have been mixed. Covered California, one of the country's largest exchanges, has seen the highest numbers by far, with more than 100,000 people enrolled in private plans as of November 30. At his Friday news conference, Obama pointed to the state as a success story. Yet in neighboring Oregon, the enrollment total at the end of November was just 44 people -- despite aggressive ad campaigns. While some states are reporting increased interest in advance of Monday's enrollment deadline, the full effects of the increase won't be understood until after January 1. 9) What will Washington be looking at? The more people enroll, the easier it will be to help Senate Democrats keep seats in 2014. And, of course, a booming enrollment would also improve Obama's legacy overall. 10) What do Americans think about Obamacare now? Support for the Affordable Care Act has dropped to a record low, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. Only 35% of those questioned said they support Obamacare -- a 5-point drop in less than a month. And 62% percent say they oppose the law, up 4 points from November. The poll also suggests most Americans predict the health care law will actually result in higher prices for their own medical care. But while 43% said they oppose Obamacare because it is too liberal, another 15% said they oppose the law because it is not liberal enough. 11) When will we know whether the enrollment campaign has been a success? We won't know how many people enrolled in December until HHS releases its enrollment report sometime in mid-January. At that point, the numbers will reflect three full months of enrollment -- the midpoint of the open enrollment period.","CNN/ORC poll: Support for Obamacare has dropped to a record low .

"Do you see your little business idea growing into ""the next Facebook?"" Every startup owner does, and there are thousands of them out there, competing for attention. So how do you make sure your enterprise stands out? Here are the top tips from investors, venture capitalists and successful startup owners at Dublin's Web Summit. 1. Pick the right investor . If you are hoping to get funding for your e-commerce company, there is no point in pitching to investors interested only in educational apps. Yet wannabe entrepreneurs do it all the time. Look for the right people. ""If you look at my Twitter, find me on LinkedIn and read my blog, you will immediately know what makes me excited,"" says Ciaran O'Leary, a partner in international venture capital firm Early Bird. 2. Tell a story . ""Too many people come to us to speak about themselves or their little piece of technology,"" says Ekaterina Gianelli from venture capital company Inventure. ""We like to hear about a problem and your solution to it. Tell us a story to remember."" 3. Keep it short . You don't need hundreds of pages or PowerPoint slides to pitch your idea. Keep it brief and simple. ""Some of the best ideas in the world can be described in one or two sentences,"" O'Leary says. 4. Present the whole package . Many startup owners think they can simply present their idea and big name investors will give them money. But the real world doesn't work like TV's ""Shark Tank."" Have an early prototype to hand and show the investors its potential. Make sure you have a clear vision and a realistic business plan. ""What investors want is a half-inflated balloon, which will inflate into something amazing if they invest their bucks in it,"" says Byron Smith, the owner of a startup Blue. 5. Be open . If something is not quite right in your books or the details of your product are a bit fishy, potential investors will find out, so don't try to hide stuff from them. ""It's important to build openness and trust from the beginning,"" Gianelli says. 6. Learn from your mistakes . Knowing why an investor rejected you is crucial -- because it leads to success. ""Every time someone says no, ask why,"" Smith says. He spoke to over 100 investors during the process that eventually led to his startup securing close to $1 million in funding. 7. Don't fool yourself . ""It's nice to say that you have 50,000 users, but if only a handful are really using your product on daily basis, it's not great,"" Ekaterina said. 8. Go crazy . Don't be afraid to be passionate about your product. O'Leary says many top startup owners are ""crazy, passionate maniacs."" Determination to succeed is key, because starting a business is high-risk. ""You can sense a real entrepreneur. They are quite stubborn, nothing will stop them,"" he says. 9. Nobody likes arrogance . But don't overdo the self-confidence. If a potential investor points out a weakness in your plan, don't get defensive. ""Too many people come to us with 'we know how to do it' attitude,"" says Timo Tirkkonen, a partner in Inventure. The first step to improvement is accepting there is a problem to work on. 10. Be yourself . For many investors, chemistry is one of the key factors -- if they like you as a person, they are more likely to invest. But that doesn't mean you should pretend to be someone you are not to impress an investor -- ""Because you will find someone who will like you at some point,"" Tirkkonen says. 11. Hire people who are smarter than you . Many entrepreneurs think they are the smartest people in the world -- a red flag for the investors. ""Those who succeed understand that there are people out there who are smarter than them and hire them to do the job,"" Tirkkonen says. 12. Trust your team . A disagreement between co-owners or partners is one of the most common reasons for complete failure. ""Flying to the moon is a dangerous mission, so you need to be able to build a good team,"" O'Leary says. 13. Think ahead . Have a vision of how you can grow from a small enterprise to a global game-changer and show the investor you have a plan. ""We shouldn't be discussing what your product is now, but what it could be in the future,"" O'Leary says. 14. Make them want to know more . ""Don't overload your audience with information, you want to leave some questions unanswered,"" Ekaterina Gianelli says.","Dublin Web Summit is where tech entrepreneurs try to secure funding .
But many wannabe business people make rookie mistakes .

"More than 100,000 people are eager to make themselves at home on another planet. They've applied for a one-way trip to Mars, hoping to be chosen to spend the rest of their lives on uncharted territory, according to an organization planning the manned missions. The Mars One project wants to colonize the red planet, beginning in 2022. There are financial and practical questions about this venture that haven't been clarified. Will there be enough money? Will people really be able to survive on Mars? But these haven't stopped some 30,000 Americans from signing up. You can see some of the candidates on the project's website, but they're not the only ones who have applied, said Bas Lansdorp, Mars One CEO and co-founder. ""There is also a very large number of people who are still working on their profile, so either they have decided not to pay the application fee, or they are still making their video or they're still filling out the questionnaire or their resume. So the people that you can see online are only the ones that have finished and who have set their profiles as public,"" Lansdorp said. The entrepreneur did not specify how many have paid the fees, completed their profiles and configured them as private. The application process . Anyone 18 or older may apply, but the fee depends on a user's nationality. For Americans, it's $38; if you're in Mexico, however, it's a mere $15. The company said it sets the price based on the gross domestic product per capita of each nation. ""We wanted it to be high enough for people to have to really think about it and low enough for anyone to be able to afford it,"" Lansdorp said. For the first crew, the Mars One mission will cost $6 billion, Lansdorp said. The idea is for it to be funded by sponsors and media that will pay for broadcasting rights of shows and movies documenting everything from the astronauts' training on Earth to their deployment and colonization of Mars. Out of the applicants, Mars One said it will select a multicontinental group of 40 astronauts this year. Four of them -- two men and two women -- are set to leave for Mars in September 2022, landing in April 2023. A one-way ticket to Mars -- apply now . Another multicontinental group of four will be deployed two years later, according to the Mars One plan. None of them will return to Earth. The astronauts will undergo a required eight-year training in a secluded location. According to the project site, they will learn how to repair habitat structures, grow vegetables in confined spaces and address ""both routine and serious medical issues such as dental upkeep, muscle tears and bone fractures."" ""What we want to do is tell the story to the world,"" Lansdorp said, ""when humans go to Mars, when they settle on Mars and build a new Earth, a new planet. This is one of the most exciting things that ever happened, and we want to share the story with the entire world."" How will Mars be colonized? Each lander that Mars One sends will be able to carry about 5,511 pounds of ""useful load"" to Mars, he said. After eight missions, more than 44,000 pounds of supplies and people are expected to have arrived. The capsules themselves, whose weight is not included in that number, will become part of the habitat. Food and solar panels will go in the capsules. Earth won't be sending much water or oxygen though -- those will be manufactured on Mars, Lansdorp said. Astronauts will filter Martian water from the Martian soil. ""We will evaporate it and condense it back into its liquid state,"" he said. ""From the water we can make hydrogen and oxygen, and we will use the oxygen for a breathing atmosphere inside the habitat. This will be prepared by the rovers autonomously before the humans arrive."" It sounds like terraforming, a process in which the conditions of a planet are modified to make it habitable, but Lansdorp said it isn't. ""We will create an atmosphere that looks like the atmosphere on Earth, so you could say that we are terraforming the habitat. But to terraform the entire planet, that's a project that will take hundreds and hundreds of years,"" he added. A dangerous mission . In spite of the risks of space travel, the Mars One founder said he is convinced of the viability of the project. However, some space travel experts have said the risks are far too high to carry out these manned missions to Mars, a distance that humans have never traveled. Radiation is a big concern. NASA does not allow their astronauts to expose themselves to radiation levels that could increase their risk of developing cancer by more than 3%. To maintain the radiation exposure standards that NASA requires, the maximum time an astronaut can spend in space ""is anywhere from about 300 days to about 360 days for the solar minimum activity. For solar maximum, in ranges anywhere from about 275 days to 500 days,"" said Eddie Semones, NASA spaceflight radiation officer. A round-trip journey to Mars could expose astronauts to the maximum amount of radiation allowed in a career under current NASA standards, according to a recent study by scientists at the space agency. Mars One is planning a one-way journey, which doesn't negate the problem, and being on Mars could expose astronauts to even more radiation, depending on how long they stay and what the shielding conditions are like. Radiation damages cells' DNA, which can lead to cell death or permanent changes that may result in cancer. However, ""there's no convincing human evidence for excess abnormalities in offspring of radiation-exposed adults,"" Semones said. While orbiting the Earth, astronauts get exposed to greater concentrations of cosmic background radiation than here on Earth in addition to charged particles trapped in the upper atmosphere and from the sun, said Robert J. Reynolds, epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center. As a spacecraft moves into deep space, the people on board would be exposed to even more cosmic radiation and solar particles, which is ""fairly dangerous,"" Reynolds said. Interestingly, according to Reynolds, astronauts' risk of dying of cancer is lower than that of the general public because they tend to be in shape, eat well, don't smoke and receive careful monitoring from doctors. Of course, none of them have been to Mars. Semones emphasized that NASA does not study the health effects of Mars colonization and that it's focusing on shorter recognition missions of the surface of Mars. ""We're not looking at colonization of Mars or anything. We're not focusing our research on those kinds of questions."" Can it be done? Mars One isn't the only group hoping to make history by sending people to the red planet. The Inspiration Mars Foundation wants to launch two people -- a man and a woman -- on a 501-day, round-trip journey to Mars and back in 2018 without ever touching down. 501 days in space with your spouse: Could you handle it? At this time there is no technology that can protect astronauts from an excess of space radiation. ""The maximum number of days to stay with our standards is on the order of 500 days. So any mission that would exceed 500 days would not be doable,"" Semones said. Reynolds agreed: ""At this point it's completely infeasible to try to send someone to Mars unless we can get there faster or we develop better shielding for a spacecraft."" NASA is working on engines intended to cut the travel time to Mars by the 2030s, but those systems won't be ready for many years, Chris Moore, NASA's deputy director of advanced exploration systems, told CNN this year. In the meantime, Moore said engineers could try to limit travelers' exposures by designing a spacecraft in such a way that it provides more protection. But Mars One founder Lansdorp insisted his group will get people landing on Mars by 2023. ""The risks of space travel in general are already very high, so radiation is really not our biggest concern,"" he said. If that all sounds good, you can still sign up. But remember: You can never go home again.","Anyone 18 or older may apply for a one-way trip to Mars .
For first crew, the Mars One mission reportedly will cost $6 billion .
No technology is available now that can protect astronauts from an excess of space radiation ."
"Washington (CNN) -- The head of the Transportation Security Administration defended his agency's security procedures Wednesday, telling lawmakers it is ""using technology and protocols to stay ahead of the [terrorist] threat and keep you safe."" John Pistole's testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation follows a controversy that broke out over the past week about the agency's full body scans and pat-downs. ""We've adjusted our pat-down policy that is informed by the latest intelligence,"" Pistole told lawmakers, acknowledging that the procedures ""may challenge our social norms."" ""Security is a shared responsibility,"" the TSA chief said. ""We are trying to detect the next generation of non-metallic devices"" used in explosives, he added. Transportation Security Administration officials are permitted to use ""professional discretion"" in determining whether individuals should be subject to further screening, according to a TSA statement. But critics have called the procedures invasive. The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization aligned with the Christian right, has filed suit against Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Pistole on behalf of two pilots who refused both a full body scan and the pat-down. ""TSA is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants,"" said Rutherford Institute President John Whitehead. On Tuesday, a public interest research group announced it was also suing DHS in a freedom of information lawsuit intended to obtain medical records and studies that it says the agency has used to evaluate its body scanners. The Electronic Privacy Information Center called on transport authorities to suspend the use of advanced imaging technology and called for public hearings into its use, center spokesman Marc Rotenberg said. Consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader joined the group's request for more information, calling the agency secretive and unresponsive. Scanners ""present hazards when they malfunction or when they function routinely,"" he said. Nader said radiation emitted by the machines was potentially hazardous to passengers, but acknowledged that most passengers in 2009 had actually favored the new measures. Transport authorities say advanced imaging technology meets national health and safety standards. ""These things ... have been examined six ways to Sunday,"" said Napolitano. ""The [Food and Drug Administration], Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. Science and Standards Association, have all measured the radiation involved,"" she said. ""It's almost immeasurable, it is so small."" In a report posted on the FDA website, scientists say full-body X-ray scanners pose ""very low health risks."" The FDA evaluates radiation-emitting products as well as foods and medications. But a representative for Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory said the group did not evaluate the advanced imaging machines for passenger safety. ""That was not our role,"" spokeswoman Helen Worth said. ""We measured the level of radiation, which was then evaluated by TSA."" CNN could not independently confirm whether scanners pose any risk to passenger health. It is also unclear how comprehensively they screen. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in March that ""it remains unclear whether the AIT [scanners] would have detected the weapon used in the December 2009 incident,"" referring to a man suspected of trying to set off a bomb with explosives hidden in his underwear aboard Northwest flight 253. ""What for example GAO and the inspector general and our own office of TSA inspection has ...found over the years is the need to be more thorough in our screening technology,"" Pistole told CNN. Currently there are 385 AIT scanners in 70 airports across the country, he said during Wednesday's hearing. Pistole said he expects to expand that number to one thousand by the end of 2011. The TSA chief said that passengers concerned about the technology can decline the full body scan and instead opt for hand-searches performed by security officials. But some passengers and pilots have expressed objections to TSA's too-close-for-comfort pat-downs. Over the weekend, a 31-year-old man refused a pat-down at a San Diego, California, airport. After arguing with a TSA agent, John Tyner left the airport facing a possible $11,000 fine, according to Michael Aguilar, the TSA's federal security director in San Diego. A Texas man also told CNN affiliate  KTRK that he ""felt violated"" at a Florida airport.  Thomas Mollman, 54, said he was headed home to Houston when a TSA officer stopped him at the Fort Lauderdale airport security checkpoint. Mollman, who was patted down, claims a TSA officer inappropriately touched him. ""I was wearing shorts at the time -- between the underwear, right on the skin, all the way around the back, all the way around my front, 360 degrees, touched inappropriately,"" he told the affiliate. Anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties, according to a TSA statement, citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule. The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals says ""requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post-9/11 world. Such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by 'electing not to fly' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found."" Tyner called the incident ridiculous and said he will not fly ""until these machines go away."" But the mood among security officials is ""anger over the way the media is playing this story,"" according to a senior Homeland Security official. ""You had a dutiful [transportation security officer], someone who works on the front lines to protect this country from a terrorist attack, someone who did everything by the book and according to his training, and he was accosted and verbally abused by a member of the traveling public,"" the official said. ""The fact that some in the media would hail the traveler as a kind of folk hero is shameful."" The incident sparked a debate over passenger safety and personal privacy that has remained headline news just ahead of the holiday travel season. Pistole, who addressed a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on air cargo safety on Tuesday, veered off topic to plead with the American public to see airport security ""as a partnership."" ""Those security officers there are there to work with you, to ensure that everybody on that flight has been properly screened,"" he said. ""Everybody wants that assurance, so just try to be patient, work with our folks. They are there to protect you and your loved ones, and let's make it a partnership."" Pistole also sent a memo to TSA staff praising the work of officers -- including those who met with Tyner in San Diego. ""Everyone involved with these latest incidents put into practice their training and experience, as you all do every day on the front lines to protect our country from terrorist attack,"" he wrote. ""They did their work with calm professionalism even as they were faced with a confrontational situation."" In a letter to aviation authorities, Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, raised the idea of privatization at transport hubs, which he said could improve efficiency and enable airports to opt out of TSA safety regulations. ""It is both inappropriate and inefficient for the TSA to serve as the administrator, quality assurance regulator, operator and auditor of its own activities,"" Mica, currently the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in the letter. ""My aviation subcommittee staff would be pleased to assist you should you move forward with your decision to opt to have a certified private screening program at your airport,"" he said. It is not clear whether private screening is more efficient than TSA procedures or whether such screenings would meet federal safety standards. On Tuesday, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger -- the hero pilot who safely landed a crippled US Airways jet on the Hudson River last year -- joined, in part, an increasingly vocal opposition to heightened airport security procedures. Sullenberger said the use of full-body pat-downs and advanced imaging scanners -- at least for airline personnel -- ""just isn't an efficient use of our resources."" Federal transport authorities say the machines are a safe and necessary security precaution, especially following recent airline terrorism attempts.","NEW: GAO March report says it is unclear if scanners would have stopped attempted Christmas day attack .

"When President Barack Obama decided to take questions directly over social media he didn't turn to his 28 million Facebook fans, or his 19 million Twitter followers. Instead, he turned to a website called Reddit where popularity is measured, fittingly, in votes. ""Hi I'm Barack Obama, President of the United States,"" Obama posted on the site by way of introduction. User Druken_Economist posted ""moderators and admins have confirmed this thread; this is actually President Obama."" Several other verification items also confirmed it, including a tweet from the official Barack Obama Twitter account and a photo on Reddit of the president seated at a plain wooden desk, staring into an Apple laptop in front of a single lamp. In roughly 30 minutes, Obama waded through hundreds of questions, answering only 10 on a wide range of topics including balancing life and family, and protecting Internet freedom. His unexpected online appearance caused a traffic surge that temporarily locked users out of the Reddit site, said general manager Erik Martin in a G-chat interview with The Verge. At one point, more than 30,000 users were on the page with more than 200,000 concurrent visitors, Reddit posted on Twitter. Martin said it was its highest traffic day ever. High profile people have been interviewed before, including Larry King, Jimmy Kimmel, Ron Paul and Stephen Colbert. The two most popular Ask Me Anythings before Wednesday were astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson and ""Jeopardy!"" champion Ken Jennings. Redditors, as they are known in the online community, seemed mostly welcoming. ""9 minutes and already 200+ comments,"" wrote user KoreanTerran. ""Good luck, Obama. You're going to need it."" User DirectCharge posted ""ONE OF US. ONE OF US."" Others wondered how he came to the decision to participate in an Ask Me Anything or AMA. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian told AllThingsD in an e-mail that it wasn't complicated. ""There are quite a few redditors at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave and at the campaign HQ â€” given the prominence of reddit, it's an easy sell."" Read the exact transcript of the Reddit AMA here . User mimicthefrench posted how funny it is to imagine ""President Obama sitting in the oval office giggling and looking at photos of cats."" Redditors post lots of photos of cats. And dogs. And people doing silly things. But they also discuss serious topics and wasted no time getting on the record with tough questions including ""Why are we still in Afghanistan?"" and ""What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?"" And while they may have allowed the president to get away with not answering a few hundred questions, they did not allow him to get away with incorrect grammar -- he used ""their"" instead of ""there"" in one post. CoCo26 responded to the error with, ""I just corrected the President of the United States' grammar."" Then later she posted, ""EDIT: I'm ashamed of myself. I failed you all trying to be a smart ass..."" When another user tried to correct the president's use of ""a"" instead of ""an"" before the word asteroid, he received this reply from user Whoa_Chill_Bro: ""don't correct the President, neckbeard."" In his last update, Obama thanked everyone for participating while also urging them to vote in November. ""By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole Reddit experience,"" he concluded, ""- NOT BAD!"" a possible referencing the popular visual meme by the same name that features a drawing of the president.","Obama took questions Wednesday over social media site Reddit .

"Two men behind bars for more than half their lives over a triple murder walked free this week after DNA evidence tore holes in their convictions. Antonio Yarbough and Sharrif Wilson were teenagers when prison doors clanked shut behind them. Now, in their late 30s, they can hardly believe they're out. What does freedom feel like? ""I'm still going through it right now,"" Yarbough said Friday. ""I haven't slept yet. I've been up for two days now. I have no words for it right now."" Nearly 22 years of hard time . Imagine more than two decades in a maximum security prison. Add to that the fact that you're accused of killing your mother, your sister and your cousin. As if that's not enough,  you were the one who discovered their lifeless, bloodied bodies when you opened the door to your home one night. If it's hard to imagine what that's like, Yarbough will tell you. After years in Attica's maximum security prison among New York's toughest criminals, he left its high, gray walls behind him Thursday. ""It was a nightmare,"" Yarbough told CNN's Piers Morgan in an exclusive interview. ""Twenty-one years and seven months was more like 42 years and seven months, when you know you're in prison for something you didn't do."" After reviewing DNA evidence, District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said the previous convictions for the 1992 murders in Brooklyn would most likely not stand up in court again and agreed the two men should be freed. ""Anybody looking at this evidence with an open mind would see that there is no chance in the world that Tony murdered his mother and these two little girls,"" his lawyer Zachary Margulis-Ohuma said. And that goes beyond the DNA evidence alone. Margulis-Ohuma was convinced Yarbough was innocent years before. At least one false confession detectives coerced out of a scared teenage boy over 20 years ago led to the convictions. A night out . After a night of partying, Yarbough, 18 at the time, and Wilson, 15, went home to Coney Island. Wilson was staying with friends, they said. When Yarbough got home, he opened the door to find his mother, sister and a close family friend lying stabbed and strangled to death. The two girls were partially undressed. Police came. ""I was asked to come down to the precinct,"" he said. Officers said they wanted him to tell them who might have killed his family, he said. ""Before you know it, I had this photograph shoved in my face, and I was being threatened and slapped around, and they wanted me to sign a false confession. And I wouldn't,"" Yarbough said. Police also took in Wilson and questioned him separately from Yarbough. But he got similar treatment, he said. ""I was scared, afraid; I was lied to, manipulated into believing that I was going to go home, if I do tell ... what they said happened."" Wilson said. Faced with a life behind bars, the young boy cooperated for the promise of lighter treatment. Life in prison . The two were convicted in separate trials. Yarbough was sentenced to 75 years to life.  Wilson got a lower sentence of nine years to life. They sat behind bars for about 12 years, then something important arrived by mail. ""Out of the blue, I got a letter from his (Yarbough's) aunt,"" Wilson said. ""And she asked me, did we really do it. And I had to tell the truth."" He wrote back to her: ""I was wrong for turning on him, but I was scared and pressured into it."" We're innocent, he told her. ""For many years I felt horrible that I had to do that and that I actually did it knowing that we weren't guilty for a crime we didn't commit,"" Wilson said. ""I still feel horrible now,"" he said, sitting next to Yarbough. Wilson's letter led lawyer Margulis-Ohuma and the district attorney Thompson to review their cases in 2010 -- five years after he sent it. Wrongful convictions . Thompson came into office in January with promises to restore justice to the wrongfully convicted. This case is part of a review of Brooklyn killings from the 1980s and early 1990s. Then, last year, the right shred of evidence came along in the form of a DNA sample from a rape-murder committed in 1999. It matched DNA found under the fingernails of Yarbough's mother, indicating that the same killer probably committed both crimes. In 1999, Yarbough and Wilson were in prison and couldn't have committed the second murder. Margulis-Ohuma called Yarbough in prison to tell him that he was going to be free. ""When I heard about it, I was extremely overwhelmed,"" Yarbough said. ""I was happy."" And the DNA was not the only thing that matched. The m.o. was the same, Yarbough said. The victim was stabbed and strangled. ""Hope had finally started to sink in,"" he said. Free at last . Wilson and Yarbough had not seen each other for more than two decades, when they met in court Thursday. Wilson approached the man he had testified against. ""I just wanted to apologize to him for all I put him through, all I went through."" Yarbough is still in pain over it, but he faults someone other than Wilson. ""I know what they did to him, because I know what they did to me,"" he said. As to finding his relatives' killer decades later, Yarbough said, ""It's in God's hand's now."" He teared up. Both men celebrated freedom by fulfilling some longings they had for two decades. Wilson filled his mouth with a hot slice of New York pizza. Yarbough filled his lungs with New York air.","It starts with a coerced confession .

"An impressive collection of hotels built more than a century ago in Southeast Asia -- catering to a sudden wave of well-heeled globetrotters that cruised in when the Suez Canal opened in 1869 -- still stands proudly today. Incredibly popular among modern travelers in search of a side of history to go with their luxury digs, we've featured some of the top historic hotels here. But in recent years, savvy hotel developers have been capitalizing on tourists' craving for the classics by converting century-old buildings once used for other purposes into luxury accommodations, as well. Staying in luxury hotels that have seen two world wars certainly adds to the fascination of a trip through the region, especially when you uncover some of the stories absorbed by their enduring walls. Capella Singapore . Built: 1880s (colonial manors) Formerly: British Royal Artillery . Capella Singapore has four heritage-listed buildings set alongside its newer construction. Two colonial manors, dating to the 1880s, were once used to house officers in the British Royal Artillery based on Sentosa Island. One of the Lord Norman Foster-restored buildings is allocated as part of the 111-room hotel; another forms part of the long-stay The Club at Capella. The other two conservation buildings give the hotel its colonial white facade. Built in the late 1930s as the Royal Artillery Officers' Mess, they remain perched on the grassy knolls. The library lounge above the lobby displays nostalgic photos of Christmas dances and New Year's balls with revelers in all their 1950s glam. Legend has it that before the British surrendered to the Japanese in 1942 during the Battle of Singapore, officers buried regimental silver in the grounds, where to this day it may still remain.

Four teak structures on the premises of Bangkok's incredible The Siam hotel date back at least 150 years. Three of them make up the hotel's Thai restaurant Chon; the other is the signature suite, Connie's Cottage. All four houses once belonged to Connie Mingskau, Thai silk legend Jim Thompson's confidante and one of the last people to see him alive at the Cameron Highlands before his disappearance in 1967. Each house, at least a century old when bought, had to be dismantled, transported down the Chaopraya River and reassembled in its original location on Sukhumvit Road, where the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy and William Holden attended the socialite's fabled soirees. ""Jim wrote a number and a letter in chalk on each piece of wall,"" recalls Mary Anne Stanislaw, Connie's granddaughter.

Formerly: Luang Prabang provincial hospital . The 32 original buildings that now house this all-suite hotel once formed Luang Prabang's old provincial hospital, whose first phase is estimated to have been constructed between 1901 and 1910. The hospital moved to new facilities in 2005, after which Aman Resorts took over. With 10 of the buildings protected under UNESCO World Heritage regulations, under strict stipulations they were meticulously restored and turned into 24 luxury suites. The hotel's high ceilings, shady verandas and louvered doors reflect the town's French colonial influences. In addition to the luxuries expected of an Aman property -- spa, fitness facilities, fine dining -- there's an onsite gallery showcasing the history of Luang Prabang.

A colonial-style teak mansion built in the 1920s, it was once home to the British governors who ruled Myanmar's southern states. Located in Yangon's Embassy Quarter and set in a gorgeous lotus pool-filled garden, the hotel has rooms of varying sizes, the largest being a two-bedroom suite. For those with Orwellian ""Burmese Days"" visions, the fan-cooled verandas and teak armchairs of this heritage property don't disappoint. Unlike the fabled Strand, this Yangon luxury hotel has a swimming pool -- a huge relief after a day of sightseeing in the dusty former Myanmar capital.

"When Shenan Chuang started out in the advertising industry in the 1980s, Chinese adverts were often dismissed as mere propaganda, unable to compete with powerful Western agencies. Now in 2014, the country's advertising market is the world's second largest, perhaps thanks in part  to Taiwan-born Shenan Chuang, CEO of Ogilvy and Mather Greater China. Meeting in the luxurious Waldorf Astoria in Bejing, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout spoke to the woman leading an industry tipped to exceed $50 billion in revenues by 2015. Kristie Lu Stout: What are some of your most creative campaigns? SC: In 2012 we created a poster campaign for Coke, it was called ""Coke Hands"" and won the Grand Prix at Cannes -- it was recognized as a cultural icon for the people. Recently in Taiwan we did a campaign for a local bank. The TV campaign featured a group of six senior citizens who were not in good shape, but had a dream. In honor of  their dead friends they decided to ride motorcycles around the island. The campaign was very successful on Youtube and on social media. KLS: What's your daily work schedule like? SC: I wake up at 5am and exercise before I do anything else, and I finish work around 9pm or 10pm. When I first started out I worked seven days a week. But that was terrible and gave me some spine problems. In recent years I've been very disciplined. I work during the week and at the weekend I spend time with my friends. It's important to take a break, breathe and see the world. At the beginning of your career you have to learn a lot. You have to invest yourself, and you need to work hard. You have to go the extra mile when you are in the early stages of your career. KLS: In every career, there is always at least one colossal failure. What has been your biggest mistake? SC: My biggest mistake was in 1995, when I was leading Ogilvy Taiwan. WPP had just bought Ogilvy and enforced a lot of financial discipline. My executive creative director decided to leave. He thought our culture had changed and there was too much focus on finance and numbers. So he left, and so did a group of senior people. But I was able to bounce back with a new team, and it took us one and a half years to bounce back, but we worked together and gained a good creative reputation in Taiwan. I would say that was my biggest hurdle. KLS: Who shaped you and influenced you the most growing up? SC: My family has a lot of strong women. My aunts are very, very strong, and they take care of everyone. So I think I learned a lot from them, and then also I read a lot. In terms of advertising I would have to say David Ogilvy, our founder. I translated one of his books, and I learned a lot about how to lead the company and the company culture. And then our current global CEO, Miles Young, the reason I name him is because I think he's probably one of very few leaders that is very business focused, but also very people oriented. KLS: Will there ever be a Chinese female president? SC: I think in Taiwan it's very likely. KLS: What is your advice to young women starting out in marketing communications, PR or advertising, what do you want to tell them? SC: I want to tell them you have to be brave. You have to stand up for yourself, you have to show that we have what it takes to be in charge. Learn: How DVF conquered fashion world .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities are using words uttered by the co-founder of a radical Islamic group to charge him with threats against the creators of ""South Park."" A criminal complaint alleging the communication of threats was filed in Virginia late last week against Jesse Curtis Morton, also known as Younus Abdullah Mohammad. A senior law enforcement source Thursday told CNN, which interviewed Morton in 2009, that the suspect is believed to be in Morocco, where he maintains Islampolicy.com, an English-language website propagating pro al Qaeda views. That website is a successor to Revolutionmuslim.com. Morton, a former resident of Brooklyn, New York, is the second person charged in the ""South Park"" case. In February, Zachary Adam Chesser, 21, who admitted to posting online threats, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Chesser, a Muslim convert, encouraged violent jihadists to attack ""South Park"" writers for an episode that depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit, court documents said. Chesser posted online messages that included the writers' home addresses and urged online readers to ""pay them a visit,"" the documents said. In an affidavit accompanying the recent complaint against Morton, FBI special agent Paula R. Menges said Morton, co-founder of the group called Revolution Muslim, worked with Chesser on a ""clarification statement"" after Chesser's postings. The pair made website postings that were -- despite their claims -- threats, Menges said. The agent also contends the statement contained pages of justification under Islamic law for the death of those who insult Islam or defame its prophet. Revolution Muslim's 2008 co-founders, Yousef al-Khattab and Morton, were both interviewed by CNN's Drew Griffin in October 2009. In the interview Morton, a convert to Islam and one-time follower of the Grateful Dead, defended the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and argued that further attacks on Americans were justified. He told Griffin he did not encourage violence on U.S. soil. The government affidavit cites the CNN interview. ""We're commanded to terrorize the disbelievers,"" Morton told Griffin. ""The Quran says very clearly in the Arabic language ... this means 'terrorize them.' It's a command from Allah."" Morton said he did not define terrorism as killing innocent civilians. ""I define terrorism as making them fearful, so that they think twice before they go rape your mother or kill your brother or go into your land and try to steal your resources."" Efforts by CNN Thursday to reach Morton were unsuccessful.

Morocco and the United States do not have a bilateral extradition treaty, according to the Congressional Research Service.

In April 2010, Revolutionmuslim.com posted an entry that included a warning to ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone that they risked violent retribution after the 200th episode of the cartoon series included a satirical discussion about whether an image of the prophet could be shown. In the end, he was portrayed disguised in a bear suit. ""We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid,"" the posting on Revolutionmuslim.com says, ""and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show.

"(Health.com) -- Teenage boys who are even slightly overweight face an increased risk of heart disease later in life, even if they slim down as adults, according to a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Regardless of their adult weight, men who were obese as teenagers were nearly seven times more likely than their slimmest peers to get heart disease in their mid-30s, the study found. Heavier-than-average teens whose body mass index was in the normal range were at increased risk as well. (Body mass index, or BMI, is a ratio of height to weight that provides a rough estimate of body fat.) The good news is that the same was not true of diabetes. A man's BMI as an adult, but not as a teen, was linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, so slimming down by eating right and exercising appears to go a long way toward preventing the onset of the disease, the researchers say. Health.com: 10 signs of type 2 diabetes . ""For those who don't become obese as adults, the risk of diabetes goes down, but for heart disease this is not the case,"" says the lead author of the study, Amir Tirosh, M.D., an endocrinologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, Massachusetts. ""You don't get rid of the risk just by reducing the weight. The body remembers when we were running around with a higher BMI."" Current weight and recent weight changes strongly influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. By contrast, the findings suggest, the narrowing and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that characterizes heart disease and often goes hand in hand with obesity -- both are aggravated by a poor diet and sedentary lifestyle -- is gradual and difficult to reverse, even with weight loss. Health.com: 10 heart-healthy rules to live by . It's important to keep in mind that being overweight is not solely responsible for heart disease or diabetes, says Daniel Marks, M.D., a pediatric endocrinologist at Oregon Health and Sciences University, in Portland. Nutrition, exercise, and other lifestyle choices, he says, have a ""much greater impact"" on risk than body size alone. Two people with the same BMI can have very different risks for diabetes and heart disease if one of them exercises regularly and the other does not, says Marks, who was not involved in the new study. ""BMI is a proxy marker for poor lifestyle choices,"" he explains. ""But it's the lifestyle choices that will get you in the end. We all need to have healthier lifestyles."" Health.com: 15 exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes . Indeed, even some boys in the study whose BMIs were considered ""normal"" were at increased risk of heart disease as adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines kids and teens with a BMI between the 5th and 85th percentile for their age as normal, but Tirosh and his colleagues found that boys with BMIs as low as the 50th percentile -- which equates to a BMI of about 20 -- were at increased risk. ""For patients at the higher end of the normal range, doctors should be addressing risk factors such as family history of heart disease and smoking,"" Tirosh says. The study drew on data from the medical records of more than 37,000 Israeli soldiers who were drafted at age 17 and chose to pursue careers in the military. The participants were followed for about 17 years, during which they gained an average of 33 pounds. In order to isolate the effect of teenage BMI, the researchers controlled for cholesterol levels, blood pressure, physical activity, smoking, and family history of heart disease, in addition to changes in weight. Health.com: The 10 best foods for your heart . By the end of the study, when most of the men were in their mid-30s, 0.9 percent of them had been diagnosed with heart disease and just over 3 percent had been diagnosed with diabetes. The heart disease rate was substantially higher (1.8 percent) among the men who had been obese as teenagers. (Heart disease was diagnosed with a type of X-ray known as an angiogram; men qualified if they had at least one coronary artery that had narrowed by 50 percent or more.) It's not clear how well these findings apply to women or to nonmilitary populations, although the authors point out that the men in the study are comparable, health wise, to similarly aged groups of civilian men in other industrialized countries. And though the military may conjure images of rifles and rucksacks, 90 percent of the men in the study worked office jobs, Tirosh says.

"Paris (CNN) -- A French television network said Thursday it has filed a complaint with the Paris public prosecutor alleging identity theft and impersonation related to an interview it broadcast Tuesday with a woman the network identified as Ambassador Lamia Shakkour, Syria's ambassador to France. During the telephone interview, the woman said she was resigning her post because of the ongoing violence in Syria. ""I cannot support the cycle of extreme violence ... ignore the young men, women and children who have died,"" she said. Shortly afterward, Shakkour denied to CNN affiliate BFM-TV that she had made any such statement, alleging in an on-camera interview that she had been impersonated. In its statement Thursday, France 24 said it had invited Shakkour to participate in its debate program. ""This invitation was made via the embassy, which, when contacted by telephone and e-mail, provided a telephone number said to be that of the ambassador, together with a photograph of the ambassador,"" the network said in a statement. ""It was using this number that the exchange took place, in which the declaration of the ambassador's resignation was made. That resignation was then confirmed in a wire published by the Reuters press agency, quoting the Syrian Embassy as its source."" But France 24 said it ""has no option but to take Ms. Shakkour's denials seriously."" It said it had commissioned comparative analyses that show the voice on France 24 differs from the voice that later issued the denial broadcast on BFM TV. ""France 24 has no doubt that Ambassador Shakkour and the Embassy of the Syrian Arab Republic in France, who were swift to report the manipulation of which they, like France 24, appear to have been the victims, will give their total support to this complaint and collaborate fully in the ensuing investigations,"" the network said. In her interview Tuesday night with BFM, Shakkour had threatened to sue the network. ""I am filing a complaint to the French tribunal and also to the international tribunal, and there will probably be some measures against France 24,"" she said. Shakkour accused the network of following an agenda. ""It's part of a campaign of misinformation by France 24, since the beginning of March, in which it gives voice only to dissidents of Syria and it falsifies videos."" In an interview with CNN carried out Tuesday night, after the two dueling telephone interviews but before the BFM on-camera interview, France 24's deputy editorial director, Renee Kaplan, called the situation ""very puzzling."" ""She has been a guest on our network before,"" said Kaplan, who added that station personnel reached Shakkour on a cell phone number that she had answered in the past. Kaplan added, ""We are confident that the person we addressed on air was she. There is no other reason to believe that anyone else would have answered on the number.""","Syria's ambassador denies having made call to France 24 saying she was resigning .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland-based home health services company has agreed pay a record $150 million in civil and criminal damages to settle charges that it engaged in a nationwide scheme to defraud Medicaid and other federal programs, according to federal prosecutors. The details of the settlement with Maxim Healthcare Services were announced Monday in a press conference at the U.S. attorney's office in the District of New Jersey, in Newark. Maxim Healthcare Services is a leading provider of home health services throughout the United States, and bills federal health care programs for care it provides to patients. ""This is the largest civil recovery in a home health care services suit ever,"" Tony West, assistant U.S. attorney general of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, told reporters on Monday. The criminal complaint in the case accuses Maxim of submitting more than $61 million in fraudulent billings over a six-year period to Medicaid and the Veterans Administration for services it either did not perform, or that were not reimbursable under the programs' guidelines. ""Money that should have gone to benefit medical patients went instead to Maxim's bottom line,"" said Gil Childers, the acting U.S. attorney in the case. The case came to the attention of authorities when Richard West, a Medicaid beneficiary in New Jersey, called the Department of Health and Human Services to complain about billing irregularities in his Medicaid statements, according to Tom O'Donnell, the special agent in charge at the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General that covers the New York and New Jersey region. That one phone call helped launch the government's investigation and led to a whistleblower's complaint later filed by West, O'Donnell said. According to the settlement arrangements released by the U.S. attorney's office, Maxim has entered into a ""deferred Prosecution agreement"" that allows the company to avoid a health care fraud conviction if the company takes a series of steps within the next two years to reform its corporate practices and strengthen compliance monitoring. In addition, Maxim will pay out approximately $70 million in civil damages to the federal government and another $60 million in civil penalties that will be divided between 42 states. Maxim will also pay a $20 million criminal penalty, according to prosecutors. Nine former Maxim employees, including three former regional managers, have been convicted to date on fraud charges related to the case, according the U.S. attorney's office. More prosecutions may be in the pipeline, Childers told reporters. Maxim released a statement on Monday stating that the settlement was reached in large part because of reforms and remedial actions instituted at the company over the past two years. The company says it fired senior executives responsible for misconduct and established a new corporate officer charged with maintaining compliance controls. Childers agreed with that assessment on Monday, telling reporters, ""Maxim has demonstrated a commitment to reform."" Maxim said in Monday's statement that its conduct ""did not adversely affect patient health or patient care."" While the government agreed with that assessment in its complaint against the company, Childers told reporters, ""Individuals facing monthly caps were facing situations in which they were unable to get their benefits."" ""There has been an uptick in fraud cases that we've been able to investigate,"" said Special Agent O'Donnell. He estimated that between 3% and 10% of health care costs in federal programs are lost to fraud. ""Some of our best cases come from whistleblowers and beneficiaries... It is critical that beneficiaries report anything that looks suspicious; some of our best cases start with that phone call,"" he said. The Justice Department has stepped up its pursuit of fraud cases under the Obama administration, according to West. ""Since January 2009, more than $8 billion have been recovered in lost funds -- a record,"" he said.","Maxim Healthcare Services is a leading provider of home health services in the U.S.

"The most chilling place I've ever visited is the former Nazi death camp of Dachau, not far from Munich, Germany. Nobody enters Dachau. It enters you. First as a series of surface impressions: the gate with the infamous sign and heinous lie, ""Arbeit Mach Frei"" (Work Will Set You Free), the crematorium and gas chambers, the gallery of black and white photos. On our visit in the middle of winter, the atmosphere felt so charged with particles of memories and electrons of history floating around that it was like being in the middle of an electrical storm, but everyone was too horror struck to say anything. Until then, all our knowledge of World War II had come from secondhand sources, like memoirs and movies. Now we were seeing it all as if for the first time, while feeling a part of history instead of apart from it. And that gave the holocaust a whole new authority and authenticity. This is one of the purposes of ""dark tourism,"" a type of travel that's been gaining ground and winning proponents as more wanderers search out ""authentic experiences,"" preferring hard-bitten realism to Photoshopped fantasies, and home truths over tourist-board propaganda. The genre has also gained a newfound respectability in academic circles after the establishment of the Institute for Dark Tourism Research (iDTR) at the University of Lancashire in England in 2012, which defines it as: ""the act of travel to sites, attractions and exhibitions of death, disaster or the seemingly macabre. Dark tourism is a broad ranging and often contentious consumer activity that can provoke debate about how death and the dead are packaged up and consumed within the modern visitor economy."" These attractions, which include both the 9/11 Memorial in New York and Dracula's Castle in Romania, are surging in popularity among visitors to Southeast Asia, where sights that chronicle the Vietnam War and the 2004 Asian tsunami, the rise of colonialism and the fallout of World War II, supply insights and shivers in equal doses. Hanoi Hilton . History is full of Orwellian ironies, like the oppressed turning into the oppressors. Hoa Lo Prison, constructed by the French in 1896 to house Vietnamese revolutionaries, is one such paradox -- it eventually became a jail for the communists to hold American fighter pilots grounded by gunfire over North Vietnam. When ""dark tourism"" destinations are presented with artistic panache the results go far beyond partisan politics and propaganda purposes. The ""Hanoi Hilton,"" as it was sarcastically dubbed by its American inmates, uses a multimedia approach to conjure the reality of death row. Dungeon-dim lighting and effigies of shackled prisoners are combined with expressionistic etchings of inmates on the courtyard walls, grainy film footage of aerial combat scenes and an actual French guillotine used to behead Vietnamese prisoners, to provide a level of physical and psychological immersion that feels like incarceration. Hoa Lo Prison, 1 Hoa Lo St., Phu Khanh village, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam; +84 (0)4 824 6358 . Bangkok Forensic Medicine Museum . Students who come to bone up on anatomy at the Songkran Niyomsane Forensic Medicine Museum in the Thai capital bow to thank the skeletons in the glass cases whom they address as ""ajarn yai"" (headmaster). For them, this is a classroom not a crypt. Having spent a lot of time here while researching a true crime and Asian horror novella about the country's most prolific serial killer, See Ouey, whose preserved corpse is housed in a glass case, I've been astonished by how many adolescents visit the museum to gawk at the graphic autopsy photos and Exhibits A to Z of murder weapons. But these are instructional, too. The images show neither the glamorized violence found in Hollywood films (the slow motion ballet of bullets flying and bodies falling), nor the cartoonish violence of computer games. What they depict are slices of death served raw and real. But there's a brighter side to dark tourism. In front of the glass jars holding the tiny fetuses of infants and stillborn babies, locals have left candy, dolls and toys to appease their spirits, make Buddhist merit and ward off hauntings. Songkran Niyomsane Forensic Medicine Museum, Siriraj Hospital, 2 Prannok Road, Siriraj, Bangkok Noi, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 (0)2 419 7000 6363 . The Killing Fields, Cambodia . The first time I visited the Choeung Ek Killing Fields outside Phnom Penh in 2003, I was transfixed by a tree with a sign on it that read in Khmer and English: ""Chankiri tree against which executioners beat children."" This was done to save bullets. My driver pointed at the nails sticking out of the tree that had been used to drive home the regime's barbarity and speed up the executions. Just then, a little girl appeared, right beside the tree, her face peeking over an urn stacked with bones that went up to her neck. It was as if an apparition of the deceased had appeared before us, when in fact it was one of the many children who used to beg here. The tree is still there, but the kids are not. When local authorities renovated the so-called Killing Fields in 2011, this series of mass graves, where the Khmer Rouge executed and buried the inmates of Tuol Sleng, a high school turned torture chamber, they turned it into a full-fledged tourism spectacle, complete with audio tours, benches, refreshment stalls and souvenir stands. It's certainly a much more audio-visual experience than it used to be. Now you can listen to the Khmer Rouge songs that once blasted from speakers to drown out the cries of the condemned men and women being beaten to death with the axles of oxcarts, or having their throats slit with the serrated edges of a palm frond. Still, I was of those who had to wonder, as the top ""tourism attraction"" in Phnom Penh, when does big business become blasphemy? Choeung Ek Killing Fields are located about a 30-minute drive from the center of Phnom Penh. Penang War Museum, Malaysia . It takes a gruesome pedigree to make it onto National Geographic Channel's Top 10 List of most haunted places in Asia, as named in its series, ""I Wouldn't Go In There."" Sitting atop ""Ghost Hill,"" beside Chinese graveyards and tower blocks, the Penang War Museum in Malaysia has just such a pedigree. ""This was one of places that was most fascinating for me,"" the show's host, Robert Joe, told CNN. But it may be more haunted by history than otherworldly forces. ""People might think it's a ghost show, but it's actually a history show,"" said Joe. ""We investigate places that have ghost stories, but these places are actually haunted by history. A lot of terrible things happened."" The museum in Penang is no exception. Much of its history revolves around World War II atrocities. As the legend of ""Vlad the Impaler,"" a despotic ruler from Romania, birthed the Dracula legend, so the bloodthirsty reputation of a Japanese police colonel named Tadashi Suzuki, whose constant companion was a samurai sword he used to behead locals, created a phantom said to still haunt ""Ghost Hill."" A few other ghouls whose effigies adorn the trails twisting around the museum are said to roam free -- ghouls that the workers claim they saw when clearing the property some 10 years ago.

The towering waves triggered by the underwater earthquake off the coast of Indonesia on December 26, 2004, claimed victims as far away as Somalia and triggered aftershocks in Alaska. The worst natural catastrophe of the century thus far, the tsunami left a trail of havoc along Thailand's Andaman Coast. The most prominent memorial is a police boat on Khao Lak -- the beach community north of Phuket that bore the brunt of the waves' wrath in Thailand. Some 20 meters long and 50 tons huge, the vessel was swept about one kilometer inland, where it's remained immobile at the bottom of a foothill. It's a few minutes walk from the International Tsunami Museum, heavy on photos and videos but light on science and artifacts. Farther down the coast, in the coastal village of Ban Nam Khem, which was almost completely annihilated after being slammed by three successive waves, two fishing trawlers, known locally as the ""Blue Angel"" and ""Red Devil,"" have been left in an empty lot a kilometer inland to commemorate the 6,000 victims in Thailand. Also in the village, the Tsunami Memorial Park features a wave-shaped tunnel leading past plaques, photos, flowers and other offerings for the dead. The images in the nearby museum chronicle the collaborations between volunteers and locals, travelers and expats, monks and medical professionals and manual laborers, who formed an hoc team of altruists in action. When grasping for superlatives to describe the extremities of that tumultuous situation for the final novella, ""Tsunami,"" in my new collection, I recalled a line from Malcolm Lowry's novel ""Under the Volcano,"" set on the Day of the Dead in Mexico, one of the most important events on the dark tourism calendar: ""But it's amazing when you come to think of it how the human spirit seems to blossom in the shadow of the abattoir."" Perhaps that could also serve as a guideline for those who dare to travel on the dark side of the road. The International Tsunami Museum and police boat is at 39/8 Moo 6, Bang Niang, in Khao Lak; +66 81 442 5660. The Ban Nam Khem Tsunami Memorial Park is located in the village of Nam Khem, about 30 kilometers north of Khao Lak.","Dark tourism is gaining ground as more travelers seek out authentic experiences .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- It began when Shelley Boyle's veterinarian recommended she stop feeding meat and dairy to her beloved mutt, Cleo, to determine whether a food allergy was to blame for the dog's chronic ear infection. Boyle's interest was immediately piqued. She had been a vegan for nearly two years, after deciding to cut meat, eggs and dairy from her diet for health and ethical reasons. But she never considered the possibility that she could align her dog's diet with hers. ""I've had animals all my life and when I did look into a vegan diet for my cat, I read that cats can't be vegan ... so I went to the conclusion that we can't do this for Cleo,"" says Boyle, an environmental consultant and part-time vegan baker from Studio City, California. With her doctor's guidance, she began whipping up batches of pinto beans, brown rice and sweet potatoes each week. She fed them to 4-year-old Cleo, a German shepherd/pit bull mix, twice daily with a dose of probiotics at lunch to help her digest. Five months later, Cleo's ear infection is gone, Boyle says. Her coat has taken on a healthy shine and she no longer has bad breath, dandruff or excessive shedding, she says. Her vet at the Animal Dermatology Clinic in Pasadena, California, suggested incorporating calcium and iron supplements through a diet of leafy greens or a vegan nutritional capsule. ""Her health and well-being is the main thing for us, but that fact we have a vegan option is a double-benefit because it means our dog can live with the same ideology,"" she says. With the vegan diet enjoying a period of (mostly) positive widespread exposure, it should come as little surprise that vegetarian or vegan pet owners might want to project those ideals onto their canine companions. Celebrities such as Woody Harrelson, Ellen Degeneres, Russell Simmons and Alicia Silverstone (who discusses her dogs' vegan diet in her book, ""The Kind Diet"") have long been touting the health benefits of a vegan diet, along with Colin Campbell and Caldwell Esselstyn, two doctors who are the subjects of an upcoming documentary extolling the benefits of the plant-based diet. A steady stream in recent years of publications, from Jonathan Safran Foer's 2009 book ""Eating Animals"" to this year's New York Times bestseller, ""Veganist,"" also have lent the movement some credibility. Read ""Vegan on the silver screen"" It's even caught the attention of talk show host and professional trendsetter Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey recently challenged her staff to go vegan for a week, with the help of ""Veganist"" author and nutritionist Kathy Freston. The experiment led to a collective weight loss of 440 pounds and a pledge from Winfrey to go ""vegan-ish"" and institute meatless Mondays at Harpo Studios. The notion of a holistic approach that gives pet owners more control over their pets' diet has been gaining ground since 2007, when a melamine contamination of commercial pet food caused people to take a closer look at what they were feeding their pets, says Donna Spector, a veterinary internal medicine specialist who runs SpectorDVM, an animal nutrition consultancy. ""That was a turning point that led to more home-cooked meals and raw food diets. Vegetarianism is another subset of that backlash,"" she says. Spector and six other pet experts who spoke with CNN conceded -- some more reluctantly than others -- that most dogs could biologically live on a vegan diet. But doing so requires substantial attention to creating a balanced diet that makes up for the loss of animal protein with substitutions of beans, soy and, to a lesser extent, vegetables and grains. Dogs are classified in the order Carnivora, but, unlike cats (a topic for another day) they have evolved biologically as omnivores, meaning their systems can derive nutrients from a wide variety of sources, including fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes and animal products. ""The important thing is that you use a diet that has been shown to be nutritionally adequate for whatever stage of life you're feeding, and it is absolutely possible to find a good quality commercial pet food that doesn't have animal products in it,"" says veterinarian Kathryn E. Michel, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine. She recommended using only commercial pet food that has gone through Association of American Feed Control Officials feeding trials. Or, if you prefer to cook meals from scratch, consult a credentialed expert in dog nutrition to ensure a proper balance of essential nutrients. Whether dogs can thrive on a vegan diet elicits different shades of responses. ""If you go to India you can see dogs living on the scraps. They can survive on almost nothing once they've evolved to living on the streets, but is that what's best?"" says pet expert and author Tracie Hotchner, host of the radio show ""Dog Talk."" ""If a dog has a choice he's not picking a pile of beans over chicken or meat, and he's not going to be lapping up soy,"" she says. ""If you're going to be harmonious in your choices, be harmonious. I say respect each species for what it was meant to be, and if you feel that strongly about being vegan, get a vegetarian animal. Bunnies make wonderful pets."" Dogs have a significantly higher daily protein requirement than humans. Finding protein sources that provide adequate amounts of nutrients such as amino acids in the sufficient ratio can be difficult under the vegan approach, which relies on plant protein sources that have less biologic value than meat protein, Spector says. ""Vegetarian pet foods require the addition of synthetic amino acids to fill nutritional gaps or a much higher overall protein level to supply all of the essential amino acids. Overall, it is much easier and more reliable to supply a dog's essential nutrients in a food containing both plants and meat,"" she says. The vegan diet also lacks some essential fatty acids that are only available in animal products like butter and fish oils, says veterinarian Michael Fox, former president of the U.S. Humane Society and author of ""Dog Mind, Dog Body."" Fox, a lacto-ovo vegetarian who feeds his dogs an omnivorous diet prepared at home, says the best approach for dogs -- and humans -- is a varied diet from organic ingredients. He says some adult dogs do adapt and even thrive on well-balanced vegan diets, but contends that dogs do best with a variety of foods that include some animals fats and protein. ""Dogs have evolved to a degree, but they've been with us 45,000 years as camp followers, scavengers, village dogs in the third-world countries and they'll eat just about anything,"" he says, adding that dogs could benefit from a vegan meal at least once a week to detox. ""But then again, we don't have the real science to back up whether it's safe enough, so, for dogs' sake, we need to adopt the cautionary principle."" The first thing doctors tend to ask is why someone is considering a vegan diet, Fox says. In most cases, personal ethics are the primary motivator, followed by food allergies. In the latter category, a vegan diet can bring relief, veterinarian Armaiti May says. ""I've seen many dogs with food allergies, and often switching to a vegan diet can help them,"" says May, who is vegan. ""They also avoid taking in animal by-products from commercially produced dog food, including slaughterhouse waste products and rejects that wouldn't be fit for human consumption. We've seen a lot of cancer and other degenerative diseases in dogs in recent years so it's easy to suspect that pet food could be a contributor."" For those who have embraced a vegan diet for their dogs, they say they have living and breathing proof that it works. Heather Kennedy, an editor for a scientific nonprofit society in Atlanta, has raised her two dogs vegan since she they came to live with her, two and a half years ago. She feeds them a prepared blend of dried vegetables, fruits and herbs that she mixes with water and either tofu, beans or textured vegetable protein. ""I get the occasional weird look, but any doubters seem to feel much better once they meet Moliere and Tillie and see that they're normal, healthy, energetic and rambunctious little dogs,"" she says. CNN's Brett Roegiers contributed to this report.","Shelley Boyle's vet suggested cutting meat, dairy from dog's diet to diagnose ear infection .

"A provocative bake sale designed to satirize affirmative action resulted in no fisticuffs Tuesday, but it did prompt a sellout of 300 cupcakes and some heated debate at the University of California at Berkeley, the bake sale organizer said. ""The biggest thing is that no violence broke out. There was no physical situation, which is really great,"" Berkeley College Republicans President Shawn Lewis said Tuesday afternoon, as the bake sale was nearing an end. ""We sold out of cupcakes, and I think we have some (of the 200) cookies left,"" Lewis told CNN. ""Beside from selling cupcakes, there was a lot of conversations between people,"" Lewis said. ""There were some aggressive people who came up with angry things to say, but there was no violence."" In light of recent threats made against supporters of the group, college Republicans from several other California universities showed up by the carloads and volunteered to help staff the event, held on a campus plaza, Lewis said. The flagship campus of the University of California system was the state epicenter Tuesday in the debate over affirmative action and college admissions. On one side, the Berkeley College Republicans hosted their ""Increase Diversity Bake Sale"" -- a satirical event that charged customers different prices based on race and gender. Yards away, Berkeley's student government -- the Associated Students of the University of California -- hosted a phone bank in support of SB 185, state legislation that would allow California universities to consider race, gender, ethnicity and national origin during the admissions process. Neither side backed down. During the sale, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., baked goods were sold to white men for $2, Asian men for $1.50, Latino men for $1, black men for 75 cents and Native American men for 25 cents. All women received 25 cents off those prices. ""We agree that the event is inherently racist, but that is the point,"" Lewis wrote in response to upheaval over the bake sale. ""It is no more racist than giving an individual an advantage in college admissions based solely on their race (or) gender."" ASUC President Vishalli Loomba said many students who attended a community meeting Monday night expressed disgust that the bake sale would take place. ""As a woman of color, when I first saw the event, I was appalled someone would post something like this on the Internet -- not only a different pay structure, but also to rank the races,"" she said. ""It trivializes the struggles that people have been through and their histories."" Lewis said he agreed a ranking system for races isn't fair -- not for bake sales, and not in other aspects of life. ""The purpose of the pricing structure ... is to cause people to disagree with this kind of preferential treatment,"" Lewis said. ""We want people to say no race is above another race, or no race is below another one. Why put one over the other? Why rank them that way?"" Before the sale, Lewis said his group wouldn't enforce the price list. ""If a white guy comes up and says, 'I want the price from an African-American female,' we absolutely give him that price,"" he said. There can be complications with self-identifying a race -- especially if a person is multiracial, Lewis said. Events similar to the Berkeley bake sale have taken place at other colleges across the country, generally organized by college Republican groups. In some cases -- such as at Berkeley -- the plan sparked controversy and protests. Other times, university officials stepped in. At Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, officials shut down a similar bake sale on campus. Officials at The College of William and Mary in Virginia cut off a cookie sale, saying they were ""shocked and appalled."" The University of California, Irvine, shut down a bake sale on campus, saying it was discriminatory. And a bake sale at Southern Methodist University in Texas was shut down after 45 minutes because of what officials called an ""unsafe environment,"" according to local reports. Loomba, Berkeley's student government president, said she is concerned about students potentially feeling ostracized due to the bake sale. ""I have heard that from numerous students who have said this makes students feel unwelcome on campus,"" she said. ""For that reason alone, we should think about what events we have on campus."" Lewis said the bake sale at Berkeley was unanimously agreed upon by the club, whose leadership includes Asian and Hispanic students and whose membership represents a ""wide variety of ethnic backgrounds."" ""More than half of the voices were female,"" he added. Berkeley's student government held an emergency senate meeting Sunday to discuss the issue and passed a resolution that, in part, ""condemns the use of discrimination whether it is in satire or in seriousness by any student group."" ""I completely support the idea of BCR -- or any students on campus -- (having) political discussion,"" Loomba said. ""I think student members of BCR have a full right to express their feelings, but I don't necessarily think this tactic is constructive."" As for where the bake sale proceeds will go, Lewis said the College Republicans are considering several charities. But ""because of all this controversy, we don't want to advertise the organization,"" he said. ""We don't want to cause them problems.""","No problems occur at satirical bake sale -- just hot debate, organizer says .

"Tuesday is Election Day in the United States, and although the mostly state and local races won't stir the same passions as next year's presidential contest, millions of people will cast ballots. They'll do it in much the same way that Americans have for centuries: by showing up at a polling place and ticking off boxes for their candidates of choice. All of which raises the question: In an era when virtually every daily task can be done on the Internet, why can't we vote online, too? The answer depends on whom you ask. Advocates say the time is right to seriously consider letting voters cast a ballot from the comfort of their homes or even on the screens of their mobile phones. ""We've voted the way we have for the past 200 years because we couldn't do any better than that,"" said Rob Weber, a former IT professional at IBM who runs the blog Cyber the Vote. ""Now, we have this technology that has revolutionized the rest of our lives ... (and) can revolutionize our voting system and could revolutionize our political system."" A recipe for chaos? But critics, many of them in the cybersecurity world, argue that letting people cast votes from their home computers is a recipe for chaos. ""My position hasn't changed over the years,"" said Avi Rubin, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in computer security. ""Which is that online voting is a very unsafe idea and a very bad idea and something I think no technological breakthrough I can foresee can ever change."" Rubin said that, in addition to politically motivated reasons for attempting to corrupt online votes, many hackers with no real political agenda could still see the challenge of tinkering with an election too attractive to pass up. ""People's computers are not getting more secure,"" Rubin said. ""They're getting more infected with viruses. They're getting more under the control of malware."" Canada and Estonia . Other countries, though, have gone further down the road toward online voting than U.S. election officials have. Canada has been near the forefront. In all, 80 Canadian cities and towns have experimented with Internet voting in municipal elections. The town of Markham, in Ontario, has offered online ballots in local elections since 2003. An independent report by digital-strategy firm Delvinia showed that early voting increased 300% the first year Internet voting was allowed. Twenty-five percent of the people who voted online in 2003 said they didn't vote in the prior local election, and overall turnout rose nearly 10% from 2006 to 2010, according to the report. ""Not only is Markham a perfect example of how internet voting is being successfully implemented in a binding election; with other municipalities following suit, Canada is becoming a global leader in the implementation of Internet voting,"" the report read. Sweden, Latvia and Switzerland are among the countries that have tested Internet voting. But when it comes to national elections, Estonia is the clear leader. The tiny Baltic nation (its population of 1.3 million is roughly the size of San Diego) has allowed online voting for all of its citizens since 2007. In this year's election, nearly one in four votes was cast online, according to its elections commission. Risks and rewards . Priit Vinkel, an adviser to Estonia's National Electoral Committee, said security is of the utmost concern. ""Internet voting relies basically on a single factor: trust,"" Vinkel said. ""Building and stabilizing this trust is the most important but also the most difficult task of the state."" In Estonia, that security includes a national ID card that can be used remotely and a voting system built to recognize unusual activity, Vrinkel said. He said security officials have detected no serious attempts to tamper with the votes. But, in Rubin's mind, that's not enough. He says the Internet's known security risks alone could be enough to call an election's results into question. ""In any election, it's important that the public perceive that the election is held fairly,"" Rubin said. ""If you allow online voting and you're unable to detect any fraud, but it turns out later that many computers were compromised ... there's no way to audit or backtrack or recount or do anything to figure out what actually happened. ""The real question is whether you're interested in providing more questions about the outcome of an election or less."" Weber, who writes his blog from New York, acknowledges the difficulties but says they shouldn't be enough to stop progress on Internet voting -- which he and others believe will increase participation, particularly among younger voters. ""If there are concerns about any of this, the answer is to further work on those concerns, not declare that the Internet is entirely dangerous and will always be entirely dangerous, and you can never trust it,"" he said. He notes that trillions of dollars have been moved around via online banking and that functions as sensitive as air-traffic control take place on the Internet. He also said that for critics to hold up the current U.S. voting system as a model of safety is laughable. ""Machines, memory cards, even things on paper"" can be manipulated, he said. ""How many times in our history have we found a box of ballots in someone's garage a couple of weeks after an election?"" Experimental efforts . Experts don't expect widespread voting by Internet to take hold in the U.S. anytime soon. But there have been some fledgling efforts at testing it. In the early 2000s, the U.S. military began testing the Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment, which would have let service members stationed overseas vote online. But it was scrapped by the Pentagon after its studies suggested security risks. As recently as last year, West Virginia experimented with allowing a small number of military members from five counties to vote online, although that pilot program was criticized by some security experts. West Virginia's Secretary of State Natalie Tennant has appeared to back away from pushing to make it statewide.","Online voting has been tested worldwide but not much in the United States .
Security analysts say too many risks exist on the Internet to make voting practical .
Advocates argue banking, bill-paying are already common online .
In Estonia, people have voted online since 2007 with no known security breaches ."
"The good news is that news of the sign was shocking. Because there was a time, not so very long ago -- a time remembered vividly by many living Americans -- when the sign would not have raised eyebrows, much less warranted national headlines. You may have seen the story earlier this month. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission upheld a ruling that a landlord in Cincinnati who had posted a ""White Only"" sign on the gate to her swimming pool had violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act. The landlord, Jamie Hein, who is white, said the sign was an antique, intended to be a decoration; one of her tenants, Michael Gunn, filed the complaint because he believed the sign was placed to dissuade his daughter, who is African-American, from using the pool. Each side has its own version of the story. But it received widespread coverage because the idea of such a sign, in 2012, was so startling, and was so abhorrent to many people. Such signs, though, well into the 20th century, were an accepted part of the American scene. If you're not 50 years old yet, chances are pretty good that you never saw one in a public place. Yet as late as the 1960s, they were there; Elizabeth Abel, author of ""Signs of the Times: The Visual Politics of Jim Crow,"" told me that some in fact were in place through the 1970s. This nation had been around for more than 175 years; more than a century had passed since the abolition of slavery; and the signs still hung. The popular assumption has come to be that the signs, and what they represented, were limited to the South, but that wasn't the case. In the 1930s and 1940s, photographers for the Farm Security Administration Historical Section, which later became part of the Office of War Information, documented the American landscape. Among the photographs, which are on file at the Library of Congress, were shots of signs in small towns and large. The South is certainly abundantly represented in those photos: a ""Colored Waiting Room"" sign at the bus station in Durham, North Carolina, a ""Colored"" sign at one entrance of a movie theater in Belzoni, Mississippi, a ""Colored"" designation on a sign by a drinking fountain on the lawn of the county courthouse in Halifax, North Carolina, a ""White Waiting Room"" sign at the bus terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. But there is also a photo taken in Lancaster, Ohio, of a ""We Cater to White Trade Only"" sign in a restaurant window; one of a man drinking from a ""Reserved for Colored"" water cooler at a street car stop in Oklahoma City; a ""White"" sign at a fountain in Baltimore, Maryland. Because the signs were so commonplace, and because they went largely unchallenged, to see them for the first time, if you were a child just learning to read, was confusing, difficult to process.  As a boy growing up in the 1950s, on a vacation trip to Florida with my parents, I saw the signs in neighborhood after neighborhood. Restrooms for ""Whites,"" restrooms for ""Colored,"" drinking fountains on opposite ends of a wall, labeled according to the races that were supposed to partake of them. Words, when you are for the first time able to read them yourself, contain great power, convey absolute authority. Words on signs, to young eyes just becoming accustomed to deciphering them, represent official positions. And for so many years, the official position on so many signs in so many towns was: whites and blacks should not share public facilities. Which is why it is meaningful that the swimming pool sign in Cincinnati was considered prominent news this year. As the ubiquity of the ""White"" and ""Colored"" signs fades into history, it is helpful to occasionally remind ourselves that this country may lose its way more often than we'd like, and may make its share of mistakes, but we tend to try to get things right over the long haul. It would be difficult to make the argument that Americans live in a racial paradise today.  The signs are long gone, though. It may have taken far too much time before the country figured out how wrong the signs, and what they signified, were, but the figuring out got done.  When customs accepted for generations are harmful to the nation and to what it stands for, the customs eventually are tossed out. Drunken driving used to be winked at; cigarette companies once mocked claims that the product was bad for people; Jewish families were routinely turned away from ""restricted"" hotels. The American road is very long, and we're all still on it.  Sometimes it's a good idea to look at the signs by the side of the road -- particularly the ones that are no longer there.

"For many millions of years, the oceans have been filled with the sounds of a geologically and biologically active planet: waves, rain, earthquakes and the songs of life from snapping shrimp to great whales.  Before the age of engine-driven ships, the resounding voices of the great whales could be heard across an ocean. Today, in much of the Northern Hemisphere, commercial shipping clouds the marine acoustic environment with fog banks of noise, and the near continuous pounding of seismic airguns in search of fossil fuels beneath the seafloor thunder throughout the waters. In the ocean's very quietest moments, blue whales singing off the Grand Banks of Canada can sometimes be heard more than 1,500 miles away off the coast of Puerto Rico. But on most days, that distance is a mere 50 to 100 miles. So why should we care? Over the past decade, scientists who study noise in the ocean have tried to understand how loud, man-made sounds disturb or injure whales and other marine mammals, even driving some to strand on beaches and die. It is time for us to focus on the more pernicious influence of chronic, large-scale noise on marine life. Whales, dolphins and seals use sounds to communicate, navigate, find food and detect predators. The rising level of cumulative noise from energy exploration, offshore development and commercial shipping is a constant disruption on their social networks. For life in today's ocean, the basic activities that we depend on for our lives on land are being eroded by the increasing amount of human noise beneath the waves. These stark realities are worrying. But emerging technologies for quantifying and visualizing the effects of noise pollution can help drive a paradigm shift in how we perceive, monitor, manage and mitigate human sounds in the ocean.  Ocean noise is a global problem, but the U.S. should step up and lead the way. First, we must extend fledgling efforts to fully comprehend the acoustic footprint of our offshore and coastal activities. As a nation, we are failing the oceans by lacking a sufficiently effective program for listening to them. The U.S. should develop and maintain dedicated undersea acoustic monitoring networks as integral parts of ocean observing systems.  This would be lead by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and enabled through private and academic partnerships.  Such a plan has been developed; now it should be implemented. Second, we should encourage and accelerate the development of noise-reduction technologies.  Thanks to proactive collaborations among industries, scientists, environmentalists and government officials, efforts are underway within the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization to develop quieting technologies for the most pervasive global noise source: large commercial ships.  These and related technologies for reducing noise in oil exploration and marine construction should be standardized. Finally, federal regulation on ocean noise must be changed.  For decades, regulators have focused entirely on the short-term effects of one action at a time.  A more holistic and biologically relevant risk assessment system, centered on the concepts of ocean acoustic habitats and ecosystems, is sorely needed.  Emerging trends in marine spatial planning are encouraging signs, as is NOAA's support of two groups that are developing geospatial tools for mapping underwater noise and marine mammal distributions in U.S. waters. The loss of acoustic habitats for marine species that rely on sound to live and prosper is increasing. Solutions are available.  The question is whether we humans value and will invest in a healthy ocean ecosystem that supports life, and in doing so, sustain our own health and future.

"Very little in life is truly inevitable. When briefing policy makers, I would try to point out that a lot of it wasn't even predictable (at least in any scientific sense). But surely what is happening in Iraq, the increasingly darkening clouds of sectarian division, can hardly be described as unexpected. In late 2006, as the Bush administration was debating the so-called surge, there were few doubts that five brigades worth of professional combat power could buy down the hellish level of violence then inflicting that country.  There was less certainty that even with a reduced level of violence the Iraqi government could leverage that reality to make meaningful political progress. At one meeting I pointed out that to do so Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki would have to ""govern beyond his life experience."" Having lived for an extensive period in exile, fearing for his life and seeing Baathists bent on his murder at every turn, he was far from a sure bet to be the kind of visionary, inclusive leader that we all thought Iraq needed. The Shiite-dominated Iraqi military and police services were also problematic, as strengthening them without the necessary political development threatened to make what Sunnis and Kurds saw as a predatory force simply more effective in their predations. Aware of these dangers, along with the surge, the Bush administration spared no energy in working to coax, coach and mentor al-Maliki into a broader approach toward governance. In addition to the tireless efforts of two talented ambassadors -- Zalmay Khalilzad and Ryan Crocker -- private, secure video conferences between the U.S. president and Iraqi prime minister were routine. 60 killed in Iraq bombings . The substantial U.S. military presence and its large training mission were also used to prod the Iraqi military along the path of nonsectarian professionalism. So important was this presence that sustaining it  by concluding a Status of Forces Agreement (the rules governing how foreign troops may operate in a nation) became a near obsession of the administration. Even with that effort, the most that the traffic would bear was an extension through the end of 2011 although both parties knew that it could be subject to renewal. That was always going to be difficult; we knew it would be impossible without a president willing to invest significant political capital -- domestically and internationally -- to achieve it. With that agreement unextended and now expired, al-Maliki appears to be acting out the darkest shadows of his own past. Over the last months, he has reneged on a power-sharing agreement with Sunnis in several key ministries, arrested hundreds of suspected Baathists (read Sunni oppositionists) and -- as the last American troops were leaving Iraq and fresh from an audience in the Oval Office -- he has now ordered the arrest of his own Sunni vice president, Tariq al-Hashimi, for alleged ""terrorism."" Along with all of this, al Qaeda in Iraq greeted the U.S. withdrawal with a series of deadly bombings against largely Shiite targets. Al Qaeda was always expected to take advantage of the ""seam"" created by the handoff of counterterrorism operations from American to Iraqi control, but now even a badly weakened al Qaeda can exploit the sense of Sunni vulnerability that al-Maliki's actions have created. The situation may yet be salvaged. America is not without tools. Ambassador Jim Jeffrey cut short his holiday home leave to return to Iraq and, as he has in the past, he will no doubt use his considerable skills in an attempt to defuse the situation. But the ambassador will have fewer tools at his disposal. President Barack Obama has consistently characterized the withdrawal as a ""promise kept,"" adding that ""it's time to turn the page."" For nearly a year, we witnessed the oddity of a president sticking to his campaign promise while parts of his government, particularly in the Defense Department, worked to extend the American presence. At Fort Bragg, North Carolina, however, the president brought down the curtain, telling the assembled soldiers that Iraq's future now was ""in the hands of its people. America's war in Iraq will be over."" But in other, similar circumstances we have found a continued military presence to be invaluable, not for continued war making but to foster local progress and regional stability. Whatever the withdrawal means in purely physical terms in Iraq, the psychic impact there and in the region is that America is less interested.  In Iraq that means that each of the factions are going to their sectarian corners and are preparing to come out fighting. Stephen Biddle of the Council on Foreign Relations points to Kosovo (itself a controversial intervention) as a model where a continued U.S. presence helps deter old protagonists from resuming shooting at one another. In Korea, history may judge that -- beyond the obvious defense value of U.S. forces -- they also nurtured the development of Korean democracy by retarding what would have been an even greater militarization of Korean society had they been absent. And in Europe, a U.S. footprint there says that the continent's importance to us is beyond rhetoric. Clearly American military deployments cannot be governed by a principle of ""once in, in forever."" To put it bluntly, training wheels have to come off sometime. But in this case they may have come off based on something other than the needs or talents of the cyclist. The White House has made efforts to downplay recent events in Iraq: certainly bad, but things we have seen before, and we expect that the Iraqis will muddle through. White House spokesman Jay Carney summarized it this way: ""This kind of political turmoil has been occurring in Iraq periodically, as they have taken steps forward and, occasionally, steps backward, but generally made progress. ... That will continue."" That is not inevitable. I would hesitate to predict it. I certainly would not casually base my policy on that expectation.","Ex-CIA director Michael V.

"This week, New York's Mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted his intent to learn computer code by the end of the year.  He joined about 300,000 other people who have signed up at CodeYear to receive free interactive programming lessons each week from the Codecademy, a web-based tutorial. I am greatly relieved. It's time Americans begin treating computer code the way we do the alphabet or arithmetic. Code is the stuff that makes computer programs work -- the list of commands that tells a word processor, a website, a video game, or an airplane navigation system what to do. That's all software is: lines of code, written by people. We are socializing, working, consuming, and living in a world increasingly defined by programs. Learning to code is the best way to understand what all those programs do, or even to recognize that they are there in the first place. Just a couple of years ago, I was getting blank stares or worse when I would suggest to colleagues and audiences that they learn code, or else. ""Program or be programmed,"" became my mantra: If you are not a true user of digital technology, then you are likely being used by digital technology. My suggestion that people learn to program was meant more as a starting point in a bigger argument. No, I did not expect American adults to take the two or three weeks required to get their heads around programming, much less the months of effort they'd need to become proficient.  But I wanted people to at least become aware of the digital systems on which we are conducting so much of our activity -- and the sorts of thinking and behaviors those systems have been programmed to encourage. Class of 2011 scores higher-paying jobs . Most adults realize that, say, Facebook is engineered to increase the value of our ""social graphs"" to its customers, the corporations and research firms that buy this data. We understand that we're not the customers, but the product. The more critically we engage with all of the iPhones and Google searches in our lives, the better we can tell what they want from us. But I no longer think that's enough. It took a few centuries after the invention of text for regular people to learn how to read and write. The printing press, which democratized print by reducing the cost of manuscripts, certainly helped. Now that we live in a world with newspapers, road signs, package labels and drug inserts, almost no one still questions the idea that teaching kids to read is a good thing, or that basic literacy makes us more likely to create value for ourselves or our employers. Well, we now live in a world with apps, networks, and stock market trading algorithms that we use, even though desperately few of us understand how they work. And while learning to code may have once been an arduous or expensive process, the college dropouts who developed Codecademy have democratized coding as surely as Gutenberg democratized text. Anyone can go to Codecademy and start learning and creating code through their simple, fun, interactive window, for free. How can it be free? Is this a charity? No. It's big business. As my friend, Jason Calacanis -- CEO of Mahalo and founder of the startup showcase LAUNCH conference -- explained it to me, ""The HR cost of landing an individual programmer might be $50-100k for a large company. That's taking into account advertising, headhunter fees, interviewing time and internal staff."" Still, competition for the few programmers out there looking for work is very steep. So few Americans know how to program that firms like Google and Facebook are actually buying whole companies just for their code-literate employees, in what are known as ""talent acquisitions."" According to Calacanis, each employee who understands how to code is valued at about $500,000 to $1 million toward the total acquisition price. One million dollars just to get someone who learns code. Firms' other strategy, of course, is to import Chinese and Indian programmers, through a costly and often only temporary visa. (That's because, unlike those countries, we don't teach programming to students in the United States. At best we teach kids how to use programs that are already on the shelves. But that's another article.) All Codecademy needs to do to make bank is connect those of us who complete its courses and are looking for work with the companies paying good money to find us. It's a model that takes the cumbersome costs of education off the students, and puts them onto the companies benefiting from the skills we have learned. And it's a model that could be applied to many other fields. So to anyone out there who says you can't get a job: You can have one. A fun one. Learning code is not about numbers and mathematics. It's more like architecture, where you are presented with a puzzle problem such as ""How do we get all these cars from this highway to that one without having to build a bridge across this river or putting an overpass next to the hospital?"" Learning to code means being able to imagine a new way of using the camera in your iPhone, or a new way for people to connect to each other, and then being able to bring that vision to reality. If you know how to code, you can get a high-paying job right now, or make valuable stuff right now. You will understand more about how the world works, and become a participating member in the digital society unfolding before us. You will be enabling America to compete effectively on both the economic and military frontiers, where we are rapidly losing our competitive advantage due to our failure to teach ourselves code. We should not have to wait for the NYSE to be hacked by kids from Asia to learn this lesson.

"To become Google's first female engineer in 1999 -- and, eventually, one of the most powerful women in tech -- Marissa Mayer had to get comfortable with risk. ""I always did something I was a little not ready to do,"" she said last year while speaking on her best decisions in a talk with NPR Correspondent Laura Sydell. ""That feeling at the end of the day, where you're like, 'what have I gotten myself into?' I realized that sometimes when you have that feeling and you push through it, something really great happens."" If the 37-year-old still makes career moves by her tried-and-true process, then she's likely anticipating something great to occur in her new role as Yahoo's CEO. Mayer's hiring last summer, which accordng to Fortune made her the youngest head of a Fortune 500 company, came as a surprise, and her high-wire decisions since have spread far wider than Yahoo's campus. First, there was her brief maternity leave after she gave birth to her son in September. When the Silicon Valley star first announced that she was pregnant, on the very same day Yahoo revealed she was the company's new CEO, some saw it as a progressive move and hoped Mayer would set a new standard for mothers trying to balance the competing demands of their corporate and familial roles. What they saw instead was a businesswoman eager to get back in the office and who said that having a new baby in her life wasn't as difficult as she'd been told. But the real critiques came last month when Yahoo's HR department issued an e-mail telling staff that they will no longer be able to work from home, prompting an angry backlash and leading some to question Mayer's judgment. While some found her position just, others hoping the new mom would create a more reasonable corporate culture interpreted the move as unfair, noting that Mayer approved the edict while building a nursery next to her office -- not an option for most working parents. But over her nearly 14-year career in the tech world, Mayer has consistently shaken up expectations.  If we've learned anything about this influential computer engineer-turned-corporate executive, it's that she plays the game of business by her own rules. 1. She doesn't do stereotypes . Part of the legend of Marissa Mayer is that she doesn't fit into our assumptions of what it means to be a tech geek. Much has been made of her looks, which defy popular culture's assertion that the best computer scientists are ""people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night,"" Mayer told Glamour magazine jokingly in 2009. ""I do code all night! I am the stereotype, but I also break the stereotype."" She also didn't grow up immersed in technology. Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, Mayer had a childhood filled with piano lessons, ice skating and ballet, plus debate and math club in high school, Vogue magazine reported in 2009. The future tech leader told Newsweek the following year that she didn't even learn how to use a mouse until her freshman year at Stanford. She's said that she had a natural interest in the brain and how it worked, and at first wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. When she happened to take a computer science class for non-majors and discovered a major called symbolic systems, she was hooked, she told NPR's Sydell last year. Soon she was climbing Google's ranks, from programmer to vice president of local, maps and location services. But the press and public focused more on her posing for Vogue and reportedly shelling out $60,000 at a charity auction for lunch with Oscar de la Renta.  A geek who loves fashion? Who would've thought? But as Mayer told The New York Times in 2009, ""I refuse to be stereotyped. I think it's very comforting for people to put me in a box. 'Oh, she's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes. Oh, but wait, she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics.' "" 2. Passion can trump gender . With two degrees from Stanford, including a master's degree in computer science, and a successful career in a male-dominated industry, Mayer is often held up as a woman to emulate. During her tenure at Google, Mayer's been described as being a key influencer on products such as Gmail, Google Maps and Google's minimalist search page. As a result, Mayer is frequently asked how she made it in an environment that's seen as a boy's club. ""People will say, how can we get more girls into computer science? And I think that's a hard question, because just asking the question, I worry sometimes can handicap progress,"" she noted during a 2012 talk at New York City's 92nd Street Y. ""I was really good at chemistry, biology, physics, calculus in high school, and my teachers were genuinely really supportive of that and they never said anything like, 'wow, you're really good at this, and that's unusual for a girl.' They never really brought up the gender issue ... And I think I've just always been very gender-unaware."" Her advice to other women seeking to follow in her footsteps is to find something that drives them and push past their preconceptions about gender roles. ""I'm not a woman at Google, I'm a geek at Google,"" Mayer told CNN in 2012. ""If you can find something that you're really passionate about, whether you're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play. Passion is a gender-neutralizing force."" And when it comes to feminism, Mayer shies away from the phrase. ""I don't think that I would consider myself a feminist. I certainly believe in equal rights, I believe that women are just as capable, if not more so, in a lot of different dimensions. But I don't I think have sort of the militant drive, and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that,"" she said in PBS and AOL's ""Makers"" documentary, launching a debate about her remarks. ""I think it's too bad, but I do think that feminism has become in many ways a more negative word,"" she added. ""There are amazing opportunities all over the world for women, and I think that there's more good that comes out of positive energy around that than negative energy."" 3. Burnout? She's not really buying it . Mayer has long been seen as the employee who can outwork you on your most caffeinated day. But she's said that she doesn't believe in burnout in the typical sense. ""I actually have a very different philosophy about burnout,"" she told BuzzFeed last year. ""I don't think that burnout comes from not getting enough sleep or not eating enough square meals. I think that burnout comes from resentment. ... It is possible to work 'too hard,' but you need to figure out what things it really is you need to stay fueled up, to stay energized, to not get resentful."" Mayer's intensity at the office appears to have held up even as she's become a mom. Her maternity leave was just a few weeks long, and she worked through it. Some critics wondered about the standard this might set in the corporate world, considering Mayer has resources that many other working parents don't. Yet the Yahoo CEO isn't thinking about anyone else's standards of parenthood, as she told ""Today's"" Savannah Guthrie when asked for her thoughts on being seen as a role model. ""I've really been focused on the products, what we need to do,"" Mayer said last month. ""There are so many great people at Yahoo, and so many great users that we want to serve well, that I really put my energy there."" 4. She welcomes challenges . One of Mayer's mantras for making decisions in life is to a) work with the smartest people she can find, and b) go for a challenge that makes her feel like she's in over her head. Say, for example, taking over struggling Web giant Yahoo. Yahoo's undoubtedly hoping for a turnaround in both its finances and its products, one worth that $1.1 million bonus that Mayer was given. Optimistic observers are waiting to see Mayer apply some of the smarts and aesthetic sense she showed at Google. ""If Mayer were just another savvy Silicon Valley executive who'd spent most of her career at one outfit and never run a company, she might feel like a quixotic choice for a big, troubled public company like Yahoo,""  Time magazine's Harry McCracken wrote last July. ""But she's Marissa Mayer. She played a key role in making Google into ... Google. She's famous for her obsessive focus on pleasing experiences, and the lengths to which she'll go to measure whether something's working for users or not."" 5. If she needs to test 41 different shades of blue, she will . Mayer told San Francisco magazine in 2008 that she's ""a businesswoman first and foremost,"" but her passion for perfection and focus on data hasn't left everyone starstruck. Former staffer Douglas Edwards, who wrote ""I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59,"" recalled feeling perturbed by Mayer's emphasis on testing and data. He remembered one occurrence when he said she changed the results Google provided so they'd appear in a sans-serif font, because she'd seen research that those were easier to read. The Times similarly picked up on Mayer's data-driven habits and perfectionism, such as when she wanted to test out 41 shades of blue for the toolbar on Google pages to see which one appealed the most to the user. Her managerial style was said to be so meticulous that Wired magazine put her on its 2012 list of ""brilliant"" but tough tech bosses. Time will tell if this obsessive attention to detail pays off for Yahoo, and Mayer -- or whether her company's problems are too big.","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer: My best decisions involve risk .

"The United States has pitched in for the first time to clean up part of the toxic legacy left by the millions of gallons of the chemical compound codenamed Agent Orange that it dumped on Vietnam during the war there in the 1960s and '70s. The U.S. military used Agent Orange to kill trees and plants that blocked visibility from the air during the Vietnam War. But the chemical was contaminated with dioxin, which can cause cancer and birth defects. It harmed humans and left areas of Vietnam contaminated. In an effort to start addressing this noxious remnant of the war, the U.S. and Vietnamese governments, along with partnering organizations, are treating a contaminated zone at the airport of the central Vietnamese city of Danang. Workers will dig up soil, stockpile it, and treat it using high temperatures that break down the dioxin. ""We are both moving earth and taking the first steps to bury the legacies of our past,"" David Shear, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, said Thursday at a ceremony opening the project at the airport. He described the effort as ""a historic milestone"" for the relationship between the two countries. Led by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, the cleanup in Danang aims to reclaim an area of 29 hectares. It will cost an estimated $43 million, and is expected to finish in 2015, according to the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. U.S. officials had no immediate comment on the cost and timetable of the project. Agent Orange is ""one of the most toxic compounds known to humans,"" according to the United Nations. The use of the chemical by the U.S. military in Southeast Asia between 1961 and 1971 devastated large swathes of the Vietnamese countryside and affected millions of people. As many as one million people in Vietnam have disabilities or other health problems associated with Agent Orange, the Vietnamese Red Cross has estimated, citing local studies. About 2.6 million U.S. military personnel are believed to have been exposed to the chemical, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs. Hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans are estimated to be alive and eligible for treatment for Agent Orange-related illnesses, the department says. It has compiled a list of health problems believed to be associated with exposure to Agent Orange, including cancer, Parkinson's and a type of heart disease. The Vietnamese government has underscored the need to ""pursue efforts to overcome the aftermath of toxic substances left by the war"" in other areas around the country, according to the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. The U.S. government is planning to carry out an environmental assessment of another contaminated area -- in Bien Hoa, southern Vietnam -- in coordination with the Vietnamese government , the United Nations and others, Shear said Thursday.

"(CNN) -- The diminutive Derartu Tulu -- she stands only 1.56 meters (5 feet 2 inches) tall -- is one of, if not the greatest-ever female runners, the only woman ever to have won a long-distance gold at two separate Olympics. Two Olympic 10,000-meter victories have made Tulu an Ethiopian icon. Born, like so many great athletes, in the highlands of Ethiopia, a member of the Oromo tribe, she grew up tending cattle on the family farm, and was not even aware that she was an especially fast runner until she started taking part in athletics competitions in her teens. She won the World Junior 10,000 meters title in 1990, and at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, won her semifinal heat in an Ethiopian national record of 31 minutes 45.95 seconds. In the final, however, she came a disappointing eighth, leading many pundits to dismiss her chances of success at the following year's Barcelona Olympics. They couldn't have been more wrong. In one of the most thrilling 10,000-meter races of all time Tulu overtook South Africa's Elana Meyer just before the bell, running the final lap in 64 seconds to win by 30 meters, in the process becoming the first ever black African woman to win Olympic gold. The race over, she waited at the line for Meyer, a white south African, the two women embracing before joining hands and setting off on an emotional lap of honor together draped in their respective national flags, a gesture that seemed to symbolize hope for a new Africa. Defending her title four years later in Atlanta she could only manage fourth place. Triumphant return . At the 2000 Sydney Games, however, she made a triumphant return, overtaking her compatriot Gete Wami at the bell and sprinting the final 400 meters in an astounding 60 seconds to win in 30 minutes 17.49 seconds, a new African and Olympic record. Her victory made her the first woman ever to win two Olympic long-distance gold medals, and cemented her place as an Ethiopian national icon alongside fellow running legend Haile Gebreselassie (Addis Ababa city council subsequently named a school in her honor). In addition to her two Olympic titles Tulu has won a World Championship gold medal (2001), three World Cross Country titles and the London Marathon (2000). Although her mantle has, in recent years, passed to Britain's Paul Radcliffe, her place in the pantheon of athletic greats remains assured. She has a six year-old daughter, Tsion.","Olympic record: 2 gold medals .

"The death of Don Cornelius, the founder of the ""Soul Train"" television show, has been ruled a suicide, officials said Tuesday. Cornelius, 75, died last week of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. His autopsy was conducted Friday. Toxicology testing has been ordered and the final report will be issued once results are analyzed, the office said. Cornelius was found February 1 at a house on Mulholland Drive, said Los Angeles police Officer Tenesha Dodine. In an interview last week with CNN, singer Gladys Knight said Cornelius appeared in ill health when she saw him recently. ""Last time I saw him, he was pretty sick,"" Knight said.  ""He had lost a lot of weight, but he still had that thing about him."" Cornelius created a pilot for ""Soul Train"" using $400 of his own money, according to the website biography.com. The show was named after a promotional event he put together in 1969. ""Soul Train"" is the longest running, first-run, nationally syndicated program in television history, according to the website of Soul Train Holdings. ""During its 37-year run, the show featured such staples as the Soul Train line and performers as important and diverse as Al Green, Ike & Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Whitney Houston, David Bowie, Justin Timberlake, Janet Jackson and Beyonce,"" according to the website.

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee man is facing charges of aggravated sexual exploitation of a minor for what authorities say are three pictures -- none of them featuring an actual child's body. Instead, according to testimony presented at Michael Wayne Campbell's preliminary hearing in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Wednesday, the photos feature the faces of three young girls placed on the nude bodies of adult females, CNN affiliate WDEF reported. Hamilton County Det. Michael Cox said Campbell told authorities ""he wanted to see what they would look like as adults,"" according to WDEF. Two of the faces were of local girls -- a 10-year-old and 12-year-old, the station reported. The third face appears to be Miley Cyrus, 16, star of Disney's popular television series ""Hannah Montana"" and its big-screen adaptation, ""Hanna Montana: The Movie,"" according to WDEF. Investigators do not believe Campbell had any contact with the three girls, but ""when you have the face of a small child affixed to a nude body of a mature woman, it's going to be the state's position that this is for sexual gratification and that this is simulated sexual activity,"" Assistant District Attorney Dave Denny said during Wednesday's hearing. Attempts to contact Denny by CNN Wednesday were unsuccessful. Cases like Campbell's present a unique legal issue. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 ruled that ""virtual child pornography,"" in which no children were actually harmed, is protected speech and does not constitute a crime. Since then, ""more and more of these guys are using morphed images, image manipulations"" in an attempt to circumvent prosecution, Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Wednesday. Such attempts are not always successful, Allen said, as charges can still be filed under obscenity laws or other statutes. Also, other avenues can be pursued when the faces used are those of real, identifiable people, he said. ""We see it all the time,"" Allen said. ""It makes it harder for law enforcement. It makes it tougher for prosecutors."" ""It's definitely on the increase,"" said Justin Fitzsimmons, a former prosecutor and senior attorney with the National Center for the Prosecution of Child Abuse, part of the National District Attorneys' Association. ""People are trying to come up with creative ways to continue to sexually exploit children using digital evidence."" Generally, what is seen is the ""Photoshop effect,"" in which people use the face of a child on an adult body or vice versa in an effort to get around the law, he said. Nearly every state, however, has adopted a law in response to the Supreme Court decision in the case, Fitzsimmons said. For instance, Tennessee's laws state that in prosecuting the offense of sexual exploitation of a minor, ""the state is not required to prove the actual identity or age of the minor."" As to the success of such prosecutions, ""there have not been a huge number of them,"" Allen said. While some have been successful and won convictions, many such cases are still in the appellate process. Fitzsimmons said he believes it is too soon to gauge the success or failure of prosecutorial efforts, as the cases ""are just being challenged now."" ""It really is sort of a blending of technology and the law,"" he said, and predicted such issues would become more common as society becomes more and more high-tech and technology is increasingly used in the commission of crimes. Campbell was bound over to a grand jury, according to Hamilton County online court records.","Pictures of girls' faces on photos of adult nude bodies lead to charges .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Turkey launched another round of airstrikes against Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq on Sunday, an Iraqi official said. File photo from 2007 of Kurdistan Workers Party fighters at the Mahsun Korkmaz Academy in Northern Iraq. Turkish warplanes and artillery units bombed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) positions in villages near Amadi in Iraq's Duhuk Province, a provincial security official told CNN. The official said the Turkish military operation started at 5:30 p.m. and lasted an hour and a half. There were no reports of casualties. Turkey said it was the sixth time in the past week it attacked the PKK in response to clashes that left at least 15 Turkish troops dead in the Turkey-Iraq border region last weekend. The central Iraqi government has labeled the PKK a terrorist organization, banning its activities and closing its offices in the country two years ago. The United States and the European Union also consider the PKK a terrorist group. It was the second round of Turkish strikes on northern Iraq this weekend. Late Friday and early Saturday, Turkish warplanes hit 31 targets in the Hakurk region of northern Iraq before returning. They ""successfully completed the operation [and] safely returned to their bases,"" the Turkish military said. A spokesman for the Iraqi Kurdish Regional Security Forces said Turkish warplanes and artillery units bombed the region from around 11 p.m. Friday until 1 a.m. Saturday. The spokesman, Jabbar Yawer, said there were no reports of casualties. Turkish artillery shells also hit border villages in the Zakho area, targeting PKK positions for about an hour on Saturday afternoon, Yawer said. Though the Iraqi government opposes the PKK, the organization continues to operate in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq bordering Turkey and Iran. The separatist faction has been fighting for self-rule in southeastern Turkey. The Iraqi Kurdish Regional Security Forces provide security for Iraq's Kurdish regional government. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Turkish military bombs Kurdistan Workers Party positions in Iraq's Duhuk Province .

"A Los Angeles jury decided Wednesday that AEG Live hired Dr. Conrad Murray, but also concluded that the concert promoter was not liable for Michael Jackson's drug overdose death. The jury decided that Murray was competent, so even though AEG Live hired him, it was not liable for Jackson's death and didn't owe the Jackson family millions of dollars in compensation. ""I counted Michael Jackson a creative partner and a friend,"" the company's CEO Randy Phillips said.  ""We lost one of the world's greatest musical geniuses, but I am relieved and deeply grateful that the jury recognized that neither I, nor anyone else at AEG Live, played any part in Michael's tragic death."" The verdict brings the five-month-long trial to a close. ""We have said from the beginning that this case was a search for the truth.  We found the truth. AEG hired Dr. Conrad Murray, the man who is in jail for killing Michael Jackson,"" according to a statement from family matriarch Katherine Jackson and her lawyers. ""All options regarding the balance of the jury verdict are being considered."" The jury accepted AEG Live lawyers' arguments that the company was not negligent because its executives had no way of knowing that Murray -- licensed to practice in four states and never sued for malpractice -- was a risk to Jackson.  The singer was a secretive drug addict who kept even his closest relatives in the dark about his use of propofol to sleep, they contended. Jackson's mother and the singer's three children sued AEG Live in 2010, arguing that the company's negligence in hiring, retaining or supervising Murray was a factor in the singer's June 25, 2009, death. Jackson died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told investigators he was using to treat the singer's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals. Murray is set to be released from jail later this month after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter. Jackson died just days before his comeback tour -- promoted and produced by AEG Live -- was set to debut in London in the summer of 2009. ""We felt (Murray) was competent"" to be Jackson's general practitioner, said juror Greg Barden. ""That doesn't mean we felt he was ethical."" Barden said jurors thought the second question -- which said, ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" -- was confusing and took some time, and several votes, to work out. In the end, they voted 10-2 to answer ""No."" He said one of the key pieces of evidence was the contract between Murray and AEG. ""The jury's decision completely vindicates AEG Live, confirming what we have known from the start -- that although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of AEG Live's making,"" attorney Marvin Putnam said in a written statement. Murray's lawyer, Valerie Wass, let out a gasp when she heard the decision and was visibly shaken. Because jurors concluded that AEG Live was not liable, they did not consider other questions on the verdict form that would have determined how much in damages the promoter would have paid Katherine, Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. Jackson lead lawyer Brian Panish suggested a range between $1 billion and $2 billion to replace the earnings lost by Jackson's death at age 50 and the non-economic -- or personal -- damages from the loss of a father and son. The damage award, however, would have been reduced by the percentage of blame jurors decided Michael Jackson shared in his death.  The Jacksons lawyer suggested in closing arguments that they assign 20% of the liability to Jackson. AEG's lawyers had contended Jackson chose Murray, who had treated him for three years as a family physician, but Jackson lawyers had argued the promoters chose to negotiate their own contract with the doctor so they could control him. The case is unlikely to end with the jury's verdict because Jackson lawyers have said they have grounds for an appeal, which could take years to decide. Jurors appeared engaged and entertained during the 21-week trial that included dramatic testimony by Jackson's mother, son and former wife.","Jackson family says the truth was found, it is considering legal options .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Workers in Southeast Asia's shrimp industry suffer regular abuse and sometimes live in what amounts to virtual slavery, a human-rights organization said Wednesday. The Solidarity Center report says the global shrimp industry is worth about $13 billion annually. Sexual and physical abuse, debt bondage, child labor and unsafe working conditions are common in Thailand and Bangladesh's shrimp processing factories, the Solidarity Center said in a 40-page report. The Solidarity Center describes itself as ""an international nonprofit allied organization of the AFL-CIO established to provide assistance to workers around the world."" Workers told Thai police who raided one factory in September 2006 ""that if they made a mistake on the shrimp peeling line, asked for sick leave, or tried to escape, they could expect to be beaten, sexually molested, or publicly tortured,"" according to the report. The plant, Ranya Paew, ""was more like a fortress than a factory, with 16-foot-high barbed-wire capped walls, an armed guard force, and an extensive internal closed-circuit television system,"" the Solidarity Center alleged, citing Thai police reports. ""Behind the walls, the police found a scene that one report described as 'little short of medieval,' with hundreds of workers literally trapped inside the compound, living in squalid conditions, forced to work long hours, and subjected to physical, emotional, and sexual intimidation and abuse. Workers who angered the employer were often 'put to shame' in front of others by having their hair cut or shaved in patches. Women and girls were stripped naked and publicly beaten as a form of discipline."" The report says the owner of the factory, who was charged with some offenses, received little in the way of punishment. ""Despite widespread worker rights abuses, including child labor and human trafficking, the owner was charged only with employing children under 15 and failing to provide holidays and time off. Though these charges are serious, they were treated as first-time labor code violations. The owner initially only paid a fine of about $2,100 and has returned to work."" The report, ""The Degradation of Work: The True Cost of Shrimp,"" also contains information from interviews with workers in Thailand and Bangladesh. The labor rights organization did not name the workers, saying they could suffer retaliation from employers if their identities were not protected. ""In April 2007, workers at a factory owned by a major Thai shrimp processing company spoke with Solidarity Center partners, alleging hazardous working conditions as well as an intimidating and discriminatory work environment. Workers complained of forced overtime and nonpayment of wages if production quotas were missed. They also claimed regular exposure to harsh chemicals, lack of access to first aid or health care, and poor air and drinking water quality. ""They additionally alleged that they had unexplained deductions from their pay, that they worked without a written contract, and that native Thais and migrant workers were segregated by the use of colorcoded uniforms."" U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, said she was ""deeply disturbed by the findings of this report"" at a news conference announcing the study. ""Simply put, this is outrageous. It is unacceptable to treat ... people this way."" Much of the shrimp processed in Thailand is destined for the United States, the report said. ""On average, Americans eat more than three pounds of shrimp each year; about 80 percent of that shrimp is imported. In 2006 alone, U.S. shrimp imports were valued at over $4 billion, making shrimp the most valuable seafood import into the United States. Roughly one-third of that shrimp came from Thailand. ... In 2002, shrimp overtook tuna as the most popular seafood in American homes and restaurants."" The Solidarity Center tracked shrimp from factories it criticized directly to some of America's best-known retailers and restaurants, though it did not allege wrongdoing on the part of the U.S. companies. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, was among the companies mentioned. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said the company was not aware of the allegations until contacted by CNN but that it adhered to industry standards. ""We hold our shrimp suppliers to the highest safety and quality standards -- including maintaining processing plants and packaging facilities that meet or exceed best aquaculture practices (BAP) standards set by the Global Aquaculture Alliance. Although we have not seen the Solidarity Center's report, we are working with our suppliers to investigate the allegations shared by CNN,"" Deisha Galberth of Promote Communications said in a statement on behalf of Wal-Mart. The global shrimp industry is worth about $13 billion annually, the report said, making shrimp ""the most popular and widely traded seafood in the world.""

"(CNN) -- Around the world, media reaction to the Democrats' victory has poured in, as newspapers and broadcasters reflect on the Barack Obama campaign and the global impact his win will have. A woman picks up a copy of a newspaper in Sydney, Australia . The International Herald Tribune said that America had ""leaped"" across the color line, calling Obama ""a 47-year-old black man who made history both because of his race and in spite of it."" The Times of London said Obama had revitalized U.S. politics. ""The immense turnout in yesterday's election was testament to the energy, excitement and expectations of a rejuvenated American democracy, as well as the fears of a nation standing at a crossroads of history,"" the paper said. It added that Obama's inheritance would be challenging. ""The new president faces economic and social convulsions at home, conflict abroad."" Also in London, The Guardian focused on the historic nature of the Democrats' win, saying: ""Victory in the end came as easily as the polls had predicted,"" and comparing Obama's achievement with Roosevelt's of 1932 and Reagan's of 1980. In Germany, Der Spiegel's Gregor Peter Schmitz, writing from Chicago, called Obama's rise ""astonishing,"" adding that his ""curious ability to remain untouched by all the razzmatazz around him is likely to prove a source of strength."" Al Jazeera said Obama had ""surfed to power on a wave of voter discontent generated by the failures of President George Bush and the Republican Party"" and added that he faces ""unique challenges."" It continued that he must ""act quickly"" to restore confidence in the economy and with his country ""sick of war"" is ""unlikely to make any additional major overseas military commitments."" The Jerusalem Post said that the transition in Middle Eastern policy from the Bush administration to Obama's would be ""'evolutionary, not revolutionary,' according to diplomatic assessments in Jerusalem."" Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz called the U.S. election an ""example of democracy at its best,"" citing Americans' ""plethora of opportunities"" to learn about the candidates' policies and stance on key issues. It also paid tribute to Obama's unifying influence, saying, ""Whites and blacks, Jews and Muslims, all decided to give their votes to a candidate who is young, black and lacking in governmental experience,"" and expressed its hope that the President-elect would ""rehabilitate the status of a superpower that remains unrivaled in its influence over the peace and welfare of all humanity."" Jordan's English daily, The Jordan Times, wrote an article entitled: ""The American leader we need,"" in which the writer said: ""Around the world, America's presidential election campaign has attracted as much attention as domestic political controversies in each of our own countries. The interest the world has taken in America's vote is the best example of America's soft power, and a lesson in democracy from the world's only superpower. If only we could all vote as well as watch and listen, because the outcome is vital for everyone around the world."" UAE Arabic daily, Al Khaleej considered in its editorial that ""whoever is the winner, Israel had guaranteed that the White House will be biased to her."" In Tunisia, the Arabic daily Al Chourouk said: ""Today America elects ""The President of the World."" China Daily wished Obama well, saying that although it was elated at his landslide win, he faced ""daunting challenges."" It cited the economic crisis and the Iraq war as the driving factors behind the Democrats' victory, adding: ""We have every reason to anticipate a more cooperative and talk-savvy new America."" And The Asia Times heralded the ""End of a subprime era,"" calling the Bush administration ""classic American salesmen"" for whom ""selling was their passion."" The Times of India called Obama an ""advocate of strong partnership with India,"" saying the President-elect had ""made it clear India poses no threat to Pakistan."" But it also expressed concern about Obama's references to discouraging outsourcing, a policy it says would have an adverse effect on India. The Kenya Times said Kenyans were ""exuberant"" and called Obama ""the foremost blaze-trailing son of this land,"" adding that ""[he] has convincingly shown that the world could be better through diplomacy than intimidation and arm-twisting tactics."" Japanese news agency Kyodo said Obama's task to repair the economy was ""daunting,"" saying the American sub-prime meltdown had ""sent global financial markets into a tailspin."" In Russia, Pravda was ecstatic, announcing that ""Eight years of hell are over."" It proceeded to catalog George W. Bush's perceived failures and slights against Russia and criticized the cost of the ""grand American soap opera"" during a time of economic crisis. Over in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald paid tribute to the Obama campaign, calling it a ""stunning grassroots political movement, powered by massive multi-million dollar fundraising."" It said his ""stunning ascent"" to the leadership of a nation ""still riven by racial divides"" would close an ""eight-year era of turbulence under Bush.""","Global media heralds the end of the Bush administration and the dawn of a new age .

"A 29-year-old who admitted leaking details of a secret U.S. government program that collects massive phone and Internet data now says he doesn't want attention. Too late, Edward Snowden. You're getting it -- on every scale, good and bad, across the Internet on social media and on every news broadcast. People of every age and range of experience, including national security experts, are weighing in on what you've done. Some love you, others despise you. You're now a lightning rod for spirited debate surrounding government transparency versus public protection against the threat of terrorism. Like WikiLeaks' source Bradley Manning, now on trial for leaking secrets, Snowden said he independently decided that the program was counter to American principles and should be revealed. ""There is no public oversight,"" he told the Guardian newspaper. Like Manning, he went outside the system, and critics are blasting the computer expert for not airing concerns internally. Snowden's actions have united some strange bedfellows. Left-leaning filmmaker Michael Moore and right-leaning commentator Glenn Beck tweeted that they think he's a ""hero."" Democratic senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky say they're worried the government could be overreaching with the program. Opensecrets.org lists Snowden as contributing to the 2012 presidential campaign of Rand Paul's father, libertarian Ron Paul. Dozens of Facebook pages supporting Snowden have popped up in the past day. There are at least 2 million mentions of the North Carolina native on Twitter. Comments are so wide-ranging it's hard to put a finger on one theme, but social media aggregator BuzzFeed says that the word ""hero"" pops up more on Twitter than ""traitor."" Snowden's strongest critics are using terrorism and incidents like the Boston bombings and 9/11 to explain why government monitoring is necessary to head off attacks. They say he should have kept what he was working on quiet to protect the public. Some added that they don't mind being watched. If they are doing nothing wrong, they argue, then they have nothing to fear from a monitoring program. For all anyone knows, Snowden might have been taking all this in Monday through his laptop in his hotel room in Hong Kong. On Sunday, he outted himself a Guardian video interview. He must have known the stakes; after the first reports in the Guardian, the U.S. Justice Department said it was beginning a criminal investigation into the leak. On Sunday, Snowden told the newspaper, ""I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong."" Snowden told the newspaper that while he admires Manning and Daniel Ellsberg, famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam war, he considers himself different from Manning because he ""carefully evaluated every single document"" to ""ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest."" ""There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn't turn over, because harming people isn't my goal,"" he said. ""Transparency is."" But no matter his intention, he says he's paying a price. The newspaper gave details of his comfortable life before he became a leaker, saying that he walked away from a $200,000 job for Booz Allen Hamilton, which let him work from his Hawaii home. Booz Allen Hamilton is a private consulting firm the government contracted to work on the program. Afraid the government would come after him, the paper said, he told his girlfriend he had to go away for a bit and has been living in a hotel room and stuffing pillows under his door to thwart eavesdroppers. Staying at the hotel is expensive enough, the Guardian said, but room service is killing him. Snowden is hoping a country will offer him political asylum -- a wish reminiscent of notorious WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Like Assange, Snowden may be already on a path to cult status. ""Yeah, man, going to try and get this page big and then get donations for his lawyers,"" wrote Rob Williams on one of many Facebook pages supporting Snowden. ""Very courageous what this man has done,"" Williams wrote, on a site with more than 1,000 ""likes."" The focus shouldn't be on Snowden, another page argued. ""It's not about the government seeing who I call or what you Google,"" Facebook poster Brett Foley wrote. ""This is about our government becoming an evil empire."" There are several anti-Snowden pages, too. Rob Edwards Ellison wrote that he supports sanctions against any nation that grants Snowden asylum. ""His alleged actions are not a political issue but rather a serious criminal matter for which the United States has the right to prosecute even if it means bringing the matter before the International Court in The Hague."" By noon Monday, CNN's story on Snowden had generated nearly 10,700 comments. Some commenters are citing the Boston bombings and 9/11 to justify government monitoring. Annie Mee said she was ""impressed"" with Snowden but ""when people found out the Boston Bombers had been under surveillance by the FBI, people demanded to know why MORE hadn't been done. ""So how do you want it, people? You can't have it both ways."" Snowden's actions are not tantamount to spying or aiding the enemy, argued a CNN commenter ""Bacon2014."" ""It's one thing to expose national secrets that are meant for foreign espionage. That's treason. That said, this man exposed a secret spying operation on US citizens - both innocent and otherwise. We have a Constitutional right against such intrusions. That's not traitorous ... ""I am all for punishing people who expose national secrets. I am very against the whole concept of WikiLeaks. But this is different. Exposing the government's violation of our constitutional rights is contextually the opposite of treason."" Some readers suggested those outraged by the government's program are being naive about terrorists. ""You'd prefer that terrorists operate in comfort with the knowledge that you'll be fighting for their privacy?"" Jermaine in Atlanta said. ""Why would you not want the US government to be able to have all the information it can have when it comes to protecting itself and its people?"" Gregory Keener shot back, ""The threat of terrorism does NOT justify abandoning constitutional principals (sic) ... the invasion of privacy of millions without ANY reasonable suspicion for the vast majority."" While observers continued to debate, a person with a unique understanding of the situation appeared on CNN Monday morning. Former FBI agent Coleen Rowley gained notoriety in 2002 when a scathing memo she wrote about the agency became public. She criticized the FBI for mishandling the investigation of terrorism suspect Zacarias Moussaoui before the September 11, 2001, attacks. Rowley said top bureau officials stymied a wider investigation into Moussaoui, then held in Minnesota on immigration charges. She also accused FBI officials of acting to ""circle the wagons"" after the attacks on New York and Washington. Moussaoui was later charged as a conspirator in those attacks, which killed more than 3,000 people. Rowley was one of three whistle-blowers featured as Time magazine's Persons of the Year in December 2002. ""I'm sure (Snowden) has a healthy awareness of the bumpy road ahead of him,"" Rowley said, adding that she felt it was ""sad"" that ""American truth tellers"" have to go to another country. But Rowley worked within the system, and that's what she says separates her from Snowden. What do you think? Was Snowden right to leak?

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The British Museum plans to display a statue of supermodel Kate Moss that it bills as the largest gold statue built since ancient Egypt. The statue of Kate Moss will be displayed in the British Museum in a gallery holding anicent Greek sculpture. Called ""Siren,"" the statue will be part of a group of major sculptures by leading British artists to go on display at the museum in October, the museum announced. The museum says the artist, Marc Quinn, claims it's the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt. His previous work included the marble sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant, which appeared on a plinth in London's Trafalgar Square. The Kate Moss statue, weighing 50kg, will be displayed in a gallery of the museum that houses ancient Greek sculpture. The museum calls it a ""fitting setting"" for the statue of Moss, ""interacting with the great Greek beauties that surround it."" Moss, whose slight frame was at the forefront of the waif look in the mid-1990s, is now nearly as well known for her celebrity lifestyle as her modeling career. The one-time girlfriend of British rocker Pete Doherty is a tabloid newspaper and celebrity magazine favorite, and now dates Kills guitarist Jamie Hince. She has recently mixed her modeling work with designing collections for the British clothing giant, Topshop. Other artists exhibiting include Damien Hirst, who most recently created a $100 million diamond-covered skull, and Angel of the North creator Anthony Gormley. The exhibit is expected to run from October 4 through January 25, 2009.","Statue of Kate Moss billed as largest gold statue built since ancient Egypt .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""I'm having a vision of the near future. Boom or bust? Experts have varying predictions on the future of CDs and albums as we know them. ""I see an artist pictured with her best friend. The friend is her manager and webmaster. The caption congratulates them for a Gold Click Award from Amazon.com for 500,000 play events. ""The two gals don't mention the RIAA, Best Buy or any label. They are thanking Facebook. They are thirteen years old."" These words from well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change. Almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site MySpace and three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- to form MySpace Music. The company is set to launch later in September, and for the record labels involved, it offers the chance to establish a greater online presence and earn advertising income as they challenge the effects of P2P file-sharing and the proliferation of online music promotion web sites. MySpace Music will allow users to listen to any song from the catalogs of the music giants for free. They will also be able to create playlists on their own page, and purchase tracks -- all while consuming advertisements. Such a project has been almost inevitable as record labels scramble for answers to declining album sales. But does MySpace Music offer the solution? While most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future, there are mixed feelings about MySpace Music as a panacea for album sales. Do you think recording industry can have a strong future in the face of the Internet? Degree leader in music industries at Birmingham City University, Andrew Dubber, believes the company will not have a massive impact on sales. ""I don't think it's going to have an impact on album sales or how many singles are sold,"" he said. ""This is just one of these cases where big businesses are getting together... it's just mutually beneficial. It's kind of 'business as usual' for the companies."" Long-time music industry figure Bob Lefsetz was more critical of the new venture. ""Radio on demand, in one's home, in front of the computer, which is what MySpace actually is, is not a sexy alternative to owning what you want and taking it to the beach, to the party, to your workout,"" he said. Avalon, however, told CNN he was optimistic about its chances. ""It's going to be an accounting nightmare and wrought with speed-bumps, but it's a step in the right direction. ""They know they can't simply survive selling CDs. The future is clearly in digital. It gives them an important piece of leverage over iTunes,"" he said. Working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters. The likes of tunecore.com, rawrip.com, sellaband.com and prominent social networking sites have all offered opportunities for artists to get their name and music to a global audience. However, will these sites be enough to topple the recording label giants? Not for a second, said Avalon. ""These are massive entities that are not just simply going to go away. They are still making money."" He said the Web sites were claiming a space in the market, but they are no match for the labels. ""We will see pretty soon an indie artist who finally sells 500,000 albums just off the downloads. But, if you are talking about someone who wants a worldwide hit or to sell a million or more CDs there's still no way to do that other than through a major record label,"" Avalon said. Dubber agreed about the power of the labels. ""While you may not need a record label to get yourself out there, you still need a lot of the things that a record label has. It used to be that there were signed and un-signed artists. Now there's a big, long gray area."" Lefsetz told CNN that record labels had too many valuable catalogs to disappear, but he felt they would decline if they did not find a new business model. What does the future hold then? Avalon sees some major changes, but also continuity, describing the current situation as the ""beginning of a new beginning"". ""It's (album sales) probably going to continue to decline, but not at the level we have seen. The reason they are always going to be around is because there are so many CD players in everything."" He believes that file-sharing is a ""fad"" and predicts it will fade in popularity. Lefsetz disagrees, saying that the industry needs to either legitimize file-sharing or create something ""just as good"" that is also cheap. Avalon also forecasts more deals where 'sales' can be regained as music gets bundled in with products. He cites cellular phone companies offering downloads as a part of pay-monthly packages. Such a service has been announced by Nokia in the United Kingdom, where subscribers can get a year of unlimited access to the Nokia Music Store catalogue. Although the move has drawn comment from analysts, who believe this could rival iTunes and form a future path for the industry, Lefsetz is again skeptical, saying: ""Don't give me any restrictions on when, where or what I can download!"" Lefsetz instead sees the future in a new business model for selling music, which offers the sale of bundled music at cheaper prices. He predicts it won't be the companies that create the change. ""Somebody under the age of 30 is going to create a trusted model and everybody will go with them. It's not going to be a corporation, it will be an entrepreneur,"" he said. Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model. ""There's a lot of people trying to find the 'new model'. My thought is that there isn't one. We are not in a period of change that's going to settle into one new thing."" As fresh developments are realized, and the nature of music ""sales"" transforms, Avalon suggests the way in which we define ""successful"" records will need to change. He questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a Web site. And Avalon's answer: surely not.","MySpace Music will allow users to listen to songs from record labels for free .

"(CNN) -- Three violent deaths in two stores marred the opening of the Christmas shopping season Friday. A Wal-Mart employee at this Long Island location was killed in a rush early Friday morning. In the first, a temporary Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death in a rush of thousands of early morning shoppers as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a Long Island, New York, store at 5 a.m., police said. In the second, unrelated incident, two men were shot dead in a Toys ""R"" Us in Palm Desert, California, after they argued in the store, police said. The toy company and authorities said the California shootings had nothing to do with shopping on Black Friday, which is historically one of the year's busiest shopping days. The Wal-Mart worker, whom authorities did not identify, was 34 and lived in Queens, said Nassau County police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming. ""This was utter chaos as these men tried to open the door this morning,"" Fleming said.  Watch police describe the 'utter chaos' » . Video showed as many as a dozen people knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the Wal-Mart store, Fleming said. The employee was ""stepped on by hundreds of people"" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, Fleming said. ""Several minutes"" passed before others were able to clear space around the man and attempt to render aid. Police arrived, and ""as they were giving first aid, those police officers were also jostled and pushed,"" he said. ""Shoppers ... were on a full-out run into the store,"" he said. The crowd had begun forming outside the store by 9 p.m. Thursday, Fleming said. By 5 a.m. Friday, when the doors were unlocked, there were 2,000 or so shoppers, many of whom ""surged forward,"" breaking the doors, he said. The man was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Others in the crowd sustained minor injuries such as sprained ankles, Fleming said. A 28-year-old pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, but ""the baby is going to be OK,"" Fleming said. She was to be released later in the day, he said. The California shootings occurred about 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), authorities said. By the time police arrived, two men were dead from gunshot wounds, Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Gutierrez said. He said authorities are not seeking any other suspects. Gutierrez said that the men did not appear to be store employees and that the dispute appeared unrelated to shopping. ""There was a confrontation inside of the store. But over a toy? I don't think that is accurate,"" he said. Two handguns were found near the men's bodies, Gutierrez said. In a written statement, Toys ""R"" Us spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh said the shooting appeared unrelated to the heavy shopping day. ""Our understanding is that this act seems to have been the result of a personal dispute between the individuals involved,"" she said. She said company officials were ""outraged"" by the shooting and were working with authorities to find out what happened. Gutierrez said no one else in the store was injured. The store remained closed Friday afternoon but was expected to open as usual Saturday.  Watch police confirm two people dead at a Toys 'R' Us store » . He said authorities would not release the men's names until their families have been notified. Daniel Watson said he was at home with his children when his wife called from the Toys ""R"" Us store, where she and her mother were shopping. ""All I could hear was gunshots in the back,"" he said. ""She said, 'They're in here shooting.' I told her to run and hide, stay down and hide."" He said his wife did just that, ducking under a clothes rack until the threat was over. Watson said neither woman was hurt. Asked about the possibility of criminal charges in the Wal-Mart death, Fleming said he would not rule it out but noted that charges would be ""very difficult,"" as it would be ""almost impossible"" to identify people in the crowd from the video, and those in the front of the crowd were pushed by those behind them. Hundreds of people may have lined up in an orderly fashion but got caught up in the rush, he said. Wal-Mart spokesman Kelly Cheeseman issued a statement saying, ""We are saddened to report that a gentleman who was working for a temporary agency on our behalf died at the store and a few other customers were injured. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this difficult time."" The company is investigating the incident, the statement said. Officers patrolling the shopping center overnight had had concerns about the size of the crowd, Fleming said, and had tried to get those in line better organized. Wal-Mart security officers were also present overnight, but he said he did not know how many. ""I don't know what it's worth to Wal-Mart or to any of these stores that run these sales events,"" Fleming said, ""but it has become common knowledge that large crowds do gather on the Friday after Thanksgiving in response to these sales and in an effort to do their holiday shopping at the cheapest prices. ""I think it is incumbent upon the commercial establishments to recognize that this has the potential to occur at any store. Today, it happened to be Wal-Mart. It could have been any other store where hundreds and hundreds of people gather."" Asked whether the security had been adequate, Fleming said, ""In light of the outcome, in hindsight, the answer is obviously no. ... This crowd was out of control."" CNN's Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.","34-year-old was unlocking Wal-Mart's doors when he was knocked down .

"City dwellers will soon be able to make greener travel choices just by looking at their smartphone. The CO2GO smartphone app automatically detects whether its owner is traveling by rail, car or bus and calculates the emissions using an advanced algorithm. The app has been designed by MIT's SENSEable City Lab and they expect it to be available for download by the summer. They say the technology will also turn citizens into walking sensors, collecting detailed information about how people use cities. ""We're in the middle of this kind of technology revolution,"" says director Carlo Ratti. ""Data allows you to make better decisions, either if you are the mayor or if you are the citizen."" Thanks to smartphone technologies and embedded sensors on everyday objects, a wealth of real-time information can today be tracked, harnessed and shared with citizens instantly, helping urban people adapt their behavior and make better choices, says Ratti. In a nutshell, ""hacking"" the city's data can help its inhabitants to be greener. It can also help city planners make better choices for the future, they say. Capturing urban information -- figures on energy use, mobility, food and water consumption -- will allow planners to run simulations of potential scenarios and start asking ""what if"" questions. They say visualization will help them to deal with pressing problems like mass urbanization, aging infrastructure and carbon emissions. ""It's the capacity to play 'SimCity' for real,"" says James Moore, senior vice president for National Community Planning and Urban Design at architecture firm HDR, referring to the popular computer game. ""You can figure out what the algorithms are and then you can begin to say, 'Well, if you want to add 100,000 people over the next 10 years, what's the optimal way to do it?'"" More from Road to Rio: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions . Moving toward models that show possible alternative scenarios can help avoid planning mistakes and optimize decisions about the ideal size and density level of a city, says Emma Stewart, senior manager for sustainability at technology group Autodesk. ""Ultimately that's the challenge here -- to figure out how many people, per square foot, per resource, to achieve a certain quality of life, that's the ultimate algorithm,"" she adds. There are already many groups that have started incorporating data visualizations and cloud-based simulations -- which offer users access to sophisticated tools from anywhere in the world -- as tools that could help tackle urban problems. In Bangalore, India, the Next Generation Infrastructure Lab, a division of policy research organization CSTEP, has been exploring and building simulations to imagine different kinds of urban scenarios over a long period of time. The group has also been holding gaming workshops where interactive simulations help decision makers and users understand the implications of different energy choices, such as usage of solar power over coal or oil. The goal of such workshops is to come up with the ideal sustainable mix that will cover India's energy needs for the following years, organizers say. Gabriel Harp, research manager for Technology Horizons at Silicon Valley-based Institute for the Future (IFTF) says such moves are important because they allow city planners, decision makers and citizens to come together at an early stage to find solutions at different urban problems. ""In particular, having conversations between the designers and the users of the system can be very important,"" adds Harp, who prior to joining IFTF worked with CSTEP in India. Floods, heat, migration: How extreme weather will transform cities . In Madrid, Spain, the ""In The Air"" project aims to make citizens more aware about pollution levels by using real time data provided by the city's authorities. The researchers have developed different interfaces to communicate the data, such as a web-based application that shows pollution levels and their evolution over time. They're also interested in bringing the information into the public space -- for example, fitting the outside of buildings with large digital screens to reflect a certain color depending on the level of pollution, or developing small portable gadgets that show pollution levels nearby. Nerea Calvillo, creator of ""In The Air,"" says the project aims to increase the public knowledge of an invisible urban ecosystem. It also wants ""to generate awareness of the high levels of some of the components that exist in our cities and, finally, to enhance personal engagement of citizens that would end up in decision making and political action."" Can we afford eco-cities? Ratti says that technology can radically change the way people interact with the urban environment and could allow them to get more engaged in decisions about where they live -- a key part of shaping environmentally friendly cities in the future. ""Building and managing cities have always been bottom-up collaborative processes -- some of this changed in the last couple of centuries with a top-down approach from city planners and decision-makers,"" he adds. ""Technology (will) allow us to return to (that in) the future in a way.""","Cities are a mass of data, if you know how to get at it -- that's where technology comes in .

"On Friday Italy held a national day of mourning. For this is not simply an accident. Accidents and emergencies cannot last two decades.  As a field researcher who has dedicated years of work to maritime migration, and as an Italian citizen, I am grateful to the Italian Council of Ministers for taking such an unprecedented decision to make this declaration. Today we honor the memory and the families of more than 100 refugees, young adults, women, and children from Eritrea, retrieved off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa; and of the many dozens who are still trapped at the bottom of the sea. We also honor the selfless work of the island's residents, tourists, armed forces, medical personnel, and fishermen who have now rescued thousands on their way to Europe. But I have listened uncomfortably to national and EU politicians who, as usual, have pointed their finger at smugglers, purporting that redoubling efforts to fight them will prevent further loss of life at sea. People at the helm of unseaworthy vessels are menial laborers executing the last and risky part of trips organized by transnational criminal networks. Smugglers are not the reason why people are on those vessels. Italian and EU institutions are asking what can be done to prevent further tragedies. To answer, they have to ask also whether they did anything to enable them in the first place, including failing to consider implications and alternatives of their specific actions and inactions. I need to raise a seemingly simple question. What brings thousands of people to trust criminals, pay them 10 times more than they would pay a comfortable seat on a ferry or airplane, and risk their lives? The overarching answer, in its brutal obviousness, is that they may not legally get on those planes and ferries. They come from countries, such as Eritrea, that methodically oppress their own citizens and will not grant passports and exit visas. They are refugees, forced to leave home without the time and resources to secure legal passage. They have survived the Sahara, and returning from Libya or Egypt is not a feasible and rational option. They are poor. They fail to offer the financial guarantees requested by European consulates, and will not be granted a visa. Quotas and legal channels for employment are inadequate both to their needs and to the needs of European economies and aging populations. They are prepared to die as they leave with hope, but do not wish to survive in despair. They fall through the immense cracks of a system that needs them for a job or might grant them asylum, but only if they first make it through miles of peril and years of exploitation. It is evident then, that the Mediterranean chronicle of death cannot end merely as a result of tougher penalties on smugglers, additional resources for search-and-rescue operations, and heightened military surveillance and dissuasion. Prisons, radars, and helicopters are not solutions. Every institution, at every level of governance, needs radical action. Fishermen and shipmasters should not have to fear that rescuing people will result in criminal charges for aiding and abetting undocumented immigrants. Or are they to engage in racial profiling and evaluate in hectic moments whether somebody in distress is a refugee or an undocumented economic immigrant? Should they rescue the former, but abandon the latter and perhaps face prosecution for failure to rescue? Can these decisions, and people's life, be left to discretion, chance, and the elements? EU intergovernmental border patrols (FRONTEX) and national armed forces need to clarify, to themselves and to citizens, whether they patrol the Mediterranean to deter migration, to rescue people, or to intercept and deport them to countries of origin and transit. 'Safe, legal channel needed' Citizens need to remember that in liberal democracies it is on their behalf and in their name that laws are written and implemented. They need to demonstrate to lawmakers that they are not ""afraid"" of their Eritrean, Syrian, Somali, Egyptian, Afghani, Iraqi, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani employees, fiancés, neighbors, schoolmates, and coworkers, to mention the nationalities increasingly resorting to maritime journeys. What happens with boundaries of socio-economic inclusion and integration is related to what happens at the border. National and EU policymakers need to envision a common family reunification and asylum policy, and establish more homogenous parameters for asylum adjudication. This could help curb the equally perilous journeys of hope of many Afghanis across the Strait of Otranto, from Greece to Italy and then to northern Europe. Most urgently, national and EU policymakers need to establish accessible, safe, and legal channels for internally and internationally displaced people to apply for asylum or to be granted temporary protection. These are not problems only concerning smugglers, immigrants, and refugees. This national day of mourning is a call for the EU and its member states to start refashioning what sovereignty and humanitarianism mean in the 21st century. It is an invitation to fellow Italian and European citizens, including migrants and their children, to practise democracy in its representative and participatory dimensions. And it serves as yet another reminder of north-south disparities in wealth and power, signaled by the fact that the Mediterranean is a frontier in the first place. There is no single solution to the Mediterranean chronicle of death. There are certainly alternatives to this state of affairs. They are more rational, and more just, than inaction and methodic negligence.","Smugglers are not why people are on these vessels, writes Maurizio Albahari .
Quotas inadequate both to refugees and European economies, he says .

"(CNN) -- Some 220 square miles of ice has collapsed in Antarctica and an ice shelf about seven times the size of Manhattan is ""hanging by a thread,"" the British Antarctic Survey said Tuesday, blaming global warming. Scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles. ""We are in for a lot more events like this,"" said professor Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Scambos alerted the British Antarctic Survey after he noticed part of the Wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on February 28, when he was looking at NASA satellite images. Late February marks the end of summer at the South Pole and is the time when such events are most likely, he said.  Watch aerial footage of the area » . ""The amazing thing was, we saw it within hours of it beginning, in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day,"" Scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on February 28. The Wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago, the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on its Web site . Another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that Scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of March 8, the group said. ""As of mid-March, only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup,"" the group said. Scambos' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles, comparable to the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland.  See a map and photos as the collapse progressed » . Once Scambos called the British Antarctic Survey, the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout. ""We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage,"" said Jim Elliott, according to the group's Web site. ""Big hefty chunks of ice, the size of small houses, look as though they've been thrown around like rubble -- it's like an explosion,"" he said. ""Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened,"" David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said, according to the Web site. ""I didn't expect to see things happen this quickly. The ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be."" But with Antarctica's summer ending, Scambos said the ""unusual show is over for this season."" Ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast. Because they are already floating, their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels, according to the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey. Scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from South America to Antarctica. But some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse. ""Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,"" he said. ""The ecosystem is pretty resilient."" Several ice shelves -- Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller and Jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades, the British Antarctic Survey said. Larsen B, a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf, comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island, collapsed in 2002, the group said. Scientists say the western Antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America -- has warmed more than any other place on Earth over the past 50 years, rising by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit each decade. Scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues. ""Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres, with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns,"" he said. News of the Wilkins ice shelf's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the United Nations Environment Program reported that the world's glaciers are melting away and that they show ""record"" losses. ""Data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled,"" the UNEP said March 16. The most severe glacial shrinking occurred in Europe, with Norway's Breidalblikkbrea glacier, UNEP said. That glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006, compared with less than a foot the year before, it said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN)  -- A Malaysian model, who is set to become the first woman in the Southeast Asian country to be caned for drinking alcohol in public, wants her punishment carried out in public. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno says that if a caning is meant to teach a lesson, then it should be in public. Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno said Thursday that if the intent of the Islamic, or Shariah, court that sentenced her was to set an example for other Muslims, then the flogging should take place in the open. ""Let's be transparent about it,"" she said. ""We want to challenge them,"" added Kartika's father, Shukarno Abdul Muttalib. ""The law is a little bit wrong. They say they are gentlemen who want to uphold values. Then the public should judge how gentlemanly it is."" An Islamic court in the eastern state of Pahang fined Kartika $1,400 (5,000 Malaysian ringgit) and sentenced her to six strokes with a rattan cane for drinking beer at a hotel bar two years ago. Kartika, a 32-year-old part-time model, was visiting Malaysia from Singapore, where she lives with her husband and two children. She pleaded guilty and has paid the fine. Malaysia, which considers itself a moderate Muslim country, forbids alcohol consumption by Muslims -- even those who are visiting. The country has a dual-track justice system, in which Islamic courts operate alongside civil ones. The law forbidding alcohol applies only to Muslims, who make up about 60 percent of the population. The country's Buddhist, Christian or Hindu population can drink freely. Kartika's case has caused an uproar, with many citing it as another example of growing fundamentalism in the multiracial country. In northern Malaysia's Kelantan state, authorities have forbidden Muslim women from wearing bright lipstick and noisy, high-heeled shoes, saying the ban will safeguard the morals and dignity of the women, as well as thwart rape. ""We want to present a face to the world that we are not a fundamentalist country,"" Ashli Chin, said a resident in Kuala Lumpur. ""This makes us a laughingstock."" Mohamad Isa Abd Ralip, president of the Syariah [Shariah] Lawyers' Association of Malaysia, said too much is being made of Kartika's punishment. ""It is not about causing pain. It is about educating others and to teach the person a lesson,"" he said. The recipient is fully clothed and the flogger cannot raise his arm high, Mohamad Isa said. The blows are delivered using a thin stick, so that they don't break the skin. Malaysia's civil court does not call for caning for alcohol consumption. It also cannot overrule a Shariah court sentence. The civil courts do, however, hand out flogging sentences for serious offenses such as rape. Neighboring Singapore also metes out caning as punishment. One of the most notable cases was that of American teenager Michael Fay, who received four strokes for vandalism in 1994. Kartika's punishment is unique because she has opted to go through with it, which would make her the first woman to be caned for drinking alcohol in public, Mohamad Isa said. Two other Malaysians sentenced to the same fate have filed appeals. Kartika will be taken from her father's house Monday. The caning will be carried out within seven days after that. ""I'm not really afraid. I feel relief,"" she said. ""I want to move on. This case has been hanging over me for a long time.""","Woman set to be first woman to be caned in Malaysia for drinking in public .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces battling Taliban militants in the volatile Swat Valley killed between 45 and 55 of the fighters over the last 24 hours, the military said Saturday. Pakistan has launched a massive military operation against the Taliban in the Swat Valley. An unknown number of civilian casualties also occurred as Pakistan's military continues its offensive against Taliban militants in the country's North West Frontier Province. The fighting is taking its toll across the province, where the U.N. refugee agency reports ""massive displacement"" of civilians fleeing the warfare. In its daily war round-up, the military said Saturday that the latest fighting occurred in Swat district, where attack helicopters targeting militant hideouts in the district's biggest city of Mingora killed 15 fighters. This occurred amid harassment of the civilian population and instances of looting and arson in the municipality, the military said. Mortar fire in Mingora also resulted in an unknown number of civilian casualties. This development comes as militants used houses as bunkers to fight government security forces. Troops engaged militants in a number of other locations in Swat, including Rama Kandhao ridge in Matta, and destroyed an insurgent headquarters in Loenamal. The military said 30 to 40 militants were killed. In neighboring Shangla district militants suffered heavy casualties in an operation, but figures were not available, the military said. Two Pakistani soldiers were also injured. Elsewhere, a girls' primary school in Kanju and a bank have been damaged by militants and the military reports progress in operations in Gulabad and Buner.

"If you meet someone from Newark in the next few days, treat them gently. Having been voted the least friendly city in the world last year (beating Islamabad, Kuwait City and even Detroit), the New Jersey hub has this year been named the least friendly in the United States. Logical, it would seem, but it must smart all the same. Conde Nast Traveler's annual Readers' Choice Survey unveiled the friendliest and unfriendliest cities in the country, based on reviews from the magazine's readers. Southern cities dominated the list of the friendliest cities with Charleston, South Carolina, topping the chart. Named the friendliest city in the world in last year's poll, Charleston is a ""quaint and special little gem"" according to the report, winning travelers' hearts with its hospitality, great food, local culture, history and natural beauty. Savannah, Georgia, came second thanks to the ""animated guides in seersucker suits"" and San Antonio rounded up the top three. The unfriendly list was dominated by medium-sized cities. Oakland, California, was voted second unfriendliest, and was described as ""rough around the edges."" Ranked third, Hartford, Connecticut, has ""been trying to lift itself out of a slump since the 1980s."" Detroit dropped from no. 4 to no. 6 in the unfriendly list. Called the ""armpit of the world"" by one reader last year, the report said comments this year were less brutal. Friendliest cities in the United States . 10. Asheville, North Carolina . = 8.

"The election of Danilo Medina as president of the Dominican Republic signals a continuation of the policies that many experts say have helped the country grow during the past eight years. Medina hails from the same centrist party as outgoing President Leonel Fernandez. His election suggests a public content with the way things are going on the island. Medina's vice president will be Margarita Cedeno de Fernandez, Leonel Fernandez's wife and outgoing first lady. Former President Hipolito Mejia, Medina's closest challenger, conceded Tuesday evening. He said the election results had been manipulated, pledged to push for reforms as the leader of the opposition and called on Dominicans to unite. In an interview with CNN en Español, Medina said his top priority was to make sure opportunities are made available to all Dominicans. He said he would work to create opportunity for young people. ""I want to build a middle-class society. That is my main goal -- to have a population that is able to go shopping, to have the capacity to consume,"" he said. Medina said he wants to ""create a society of inclusion that promotes opportunities for all."" ""This is a country that has created a lot of wealth in recent years. My job is to make sure that wealth trickles down,"" he said. It is an ambitious goal for a country that has seen some growth, but a number of ingrained obstacles. ""The Dominican Republic is one the country's that before the economic downfall had high rates of growth,"" said Johanna Mendelson Forman, a senior associate for the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But challenges include high costs of energy on the island, and the difficulties of sharing an island with the more fragile Haiti, she said. Health issues in Haiti, like a cholera outbreak, can easily cross the border in the Dominican Republic. Overall, the country had a good eight years under Fernandez, and one can expect to see the investments he made continue under Medina, Mendelson Forman said. Medina has been by Fernandez's side for quite a while, and ""he knows where all the ghosts are buried,"" which can be a good thing, she said. Medina is the first of eight children, and has a long history in politics in the Dominican Republic. He was elected to Congress in 1986, 1990 and 1994. During that final term, he was elected president of the Dominican House. He served as the spokesman for his political party and was a member of the Latin American Parliament. Medina was secretary of state twice, both under the leadership of Fernandez. As president, Medina said he would focus on education, too. On the campaign trail, he promised to spend 4% of GDP on education, and said he intends to see that through. A key to lifting people out of poverty, and the country as a whole, he said, is to have an educated workforce. Although he said his country will continue to have a close relationship to Hugo Chavez, whose country provides oil, he sees Brazil's recent success as the path to emulate. People are ""expecting significant changes,"" he said. He also addressed the issue of drug legalization, saying it does not matter whether Latin America legalizes or not. For legalization to have any impact, the conversation has to happen in the United States, where the demand is, not in Latin America where the supply is, he said. ""The problem of narcotrafficking is the market. If you limit the market, the drug trafficking falls.""","Former President Hipolito Mejia concedes .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Thousands of confidential files on the U.S. military's most technologically advanced fighter aircraft have been compromised by unknown computer hackers over the past two years, according to senior defense officials. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's self-diagnostic system was compromised by hackers, officials say. The Internet intruders were able to gain access to data related to the design and electronics systems of the Joint Strike Fighter through computers of Pentagon contractors in charge of designing and building the aircraft, according to the officials, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. In addition to files relating to the aircraft, hackers gained entry into the Air Force's air traffic control systems, according to the officials. Once they got in, the Internet hackers were able to see such information as the locations of U.S. military aircraft in flight. The Joint Striker Fighter plane is the military's new F-35 Lightning II. It designed to become the aircraft used by all of the branches of service. Most of the files broken into focused on the design and performance statistics of the fighter, as well as its electronic systems, officials said. The information could be used to make the plane easier to fight or defend against. Additionally, the system used by the aircraft to conduct self-diagnostics during flight was compromised by the computer intrusions, according to the officials. However, the officials insisted that none of the information accessed was highly sensitive data. The plane uses stealth and other highly sensitive electronic equipment, but it does not appear that information on those systems was compromised, because it is stored on computers that are not connected to the Internet, according to the defense officials. The Joint Strike Fighter's main contractor is Lockheed Martin Corp., and Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems PLC are major subcontractors in the plane's production. Lockheed Martin's chief financial officer denied that there was any breach of classified information, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. ""The U.S. government doesn't talk a whole lot about this, and neither do we. But in response to the [Wall Street Journal] report, we think it's incorrect,"" said Bruce Tanner of Lockheed Martin. ""There's never been any effective attack. We have measures in place, and there's never been a successful attack."" In a statement released later, the company reiterated its position that no classified information had been accessed. ""To our knowledge, there has never been any classified information breach. Like the government, we have attacks on our systems continually and have stringent measures in place to detect and stop attacks,"" the statement said. Representatives of BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman would not comment on the story and referred all questions to Lockheed Martin. Different variations of the Joint Strike Fighter will be produced for the different branches of service it will be used in. Many international partners are helping build the plane, and it will be sold to U.S.-allied countries. The involvement of multiple nations raises concern about the level of computer security measures the partner countries have, officials said. Companies contracting with the Department of Defense now have to prove that they are using the proper computer security before a contract can be awarded, Pentagon officials said. That measure was put into place within the past year because of the increase in cyber intrusions, they said. Asked whether sensitive technology for the Joint Strike Fighter had been jeopardized, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said, ""I am not aware of any specific concerns."" Whitman would not confirm the cyber-security breach on the Joint Strike Fighter program but said the number of attempted attacks on the U.S. military's network has been on the rise. ""We have seen the number of intrusion attempts more than double recently,"" he said. He would not reveal a timeline. He said the computer systems of the Department of Defense are scanned thousands of times a day by entities looking for ways inside U.S. military computer networks. Officials could not say who was behind the computer hacking, which has occurred numerous times since 2007. The intruders were able to cover their tracks, making it look like the virtual break-ins were coming from various parts of the world, according to officials. The Wall Street Journal reported that the attacks appeared to originate in China, citing ""former U.S. officials."" Last month, a Pentagon annual report to Congress about China's military power said China has been making continued progress in developing cyber-warfare techniques. The report noted that U.S. government computers were the target of ""intrusions that appear to have originated"" in China, although they were not confirmed to be from the Chinese military. CNN requested a comment about the accusation from the Chinese Embassy in Washington. An embassy spokesman denied the allegations to the Wall Street Journal. The Air Force, the main program manager of the Joint Strike Fighter program, has a number of ongoing investigations into the multiple hackings, officials said. The officials said that a number of safeguards have since been put into place to protect that system. CNN's Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","Intruders got access to Joint Strike Fighter info through contractor computers .
