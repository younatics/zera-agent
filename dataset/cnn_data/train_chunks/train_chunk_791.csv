"By . Jason Groves And Hugo Duncan . Ed Miliband was accused of ‘clutching at straws’ last night, as he claimed the squeeze on living standards will continue until 2020. The Labour leader dismissed mounting evidence of a sustained economic recovery and suggested millions on middle incomes will continue to suffer for years. Party sources said Mr Miliband will use a speech in Birmingham today to ‘ridicule’ Government claims that the economy is on the mend. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed middle class families were not enjoying the benefits of a return to growth . Nick Clegg last night accused Mr Miliband of desperation. The . Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Ed Miliband is clutching at straws and now . he’s down to his last one. Instead of making specious claims, the . Labour party should take responsibility for the past.’ Mr . Miliband cited forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility . suggesting average earnings will lag behind economic growth until at . least 2018. He said the cost-of-living crisis ‘will continue for the . five years of the next Parliament’ unless action is taken to ensure the . rewards of economic growth are spread more evenly. Official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row . Middle class families weathered the . recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for . free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today . reveals. Households in the . social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and . employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a . think-tank. Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn, the Social Market Foundation said. More . women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the . proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per . cent. An analysis of . household income also found that the middle classes became bargain . seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 . per cent increase in food prices. And . there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the . generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to . cut the cost of a childminder or nursery. Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report. Around . one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income . of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result . of the financial crisis. But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets. ‘The . middle class – once the solid centre of our economy – is being hollowed . out, with growing insecurity and the prospect, for the first time since . the war, that their children will be worse off than they were,’ he . added. Mr Miliband will today call for local councils to be placed in charge of drawing up their own economic plans. He . will pledge to give cities powers over £20billion of housing, transport . and skills funding to help close the productivity gap between the . capital and other parts of the country. ‘We . need a prosperous London, but we also need to build prosperity outside . it,’ he will say. ‘Today, every region outside London is below the . national average when it comes to productivity, while London is 40 per . cent above it. ‘Britain will never tackle the cost-of-living crisis … unless we break this pattern and reverse a century of centralisation.’ But . Mr Miliband’s wider argument on the economy was undermined by a Social . Market Foundation report yesterday which revealed that most middle-class . families have weathered the recession well. Around a fifth of families . classed as having a middle income in 2008 – those with net earnings of . between £26,000 and £41,200 – slipped down the income scale as a result . of the financial crisis. But two-fifths have stayed where they were and a further two-fifths have moved up to a higher income group. Emran Mian, director of the Social Market Foundation, said: ‘In reality, the middle  has coped surprisingly well since 2007-8.’ In . a further blow to Labour’s analysis, a report by accountants KPMG today . shows that starting salaries are rising at their fastest rate since . 2007. Mr Clegg said the Labour leadership had ‘spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise’. He added: ‘For a long time they insisted that the Coalition’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth. ‘Wrong . – the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back. Then . they claimed unemployment would rise by a million. Wrong – unemployment . is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work.’","Labour leader steps up attack on government despite brighter outlook .

"By . Julian Robinson . A midwife insists she is still 'a nice person' despite constantly seeing raised eyebrows from people looking at her heavily tattooed arms. Mother-of-one Claire O'Sullivan, whose tattoos include skulls, butterflies and mermaids, says 'kindness, compassion and ability' are the key to being a good nurse rather than just having clear skin. Now the 30-year-old, of Gwersyllt in North Wales, is hoping to be crowned Miss Tattoo UK  and is on a mission to be an inspiration for all tattooed women. Midwife Claire O'Sullivan, from Gwersyllt in North Wales, says she is 'a nice person' despite people raising their eyebrows at her heavily tattooed arms while she is working on the ward . Midwife Claire O'Sullivan, who is bidding to become Miss Tattoo UK. On her back she has a large dove overlooking two stars to commemorate the death of a close friend who left behind two children . The 30-year-old, who has a host of . tattoos as well as body piercings, likens body art to people decorating . their houses and wants to dispel negative stereotypes about tattooed . people. She admits some eyebrows have been raised over her heavily tattooed arms especially when she rolls up her scrubs on the wards at her work place in North Wales. Her tattoos include a mum with a baby . symbolising her work as a midwife on her left arm and a mermaid with a . baby on her right arm which Claire had done as a tribute to daughter . Molly. On . her back she has a large dove overlooking two stars to commemorate the . death of a close friend who left behind two children. Other pieces . include a large rose-based design up her right leg and a tribal chest . piece. But she wants to prove people wrong about judging her on the way she looks. Ms O'Sullivan said: 'Working in the healthcare environment means I have to have the skin on my arms exposed to ensure good hand hygiene and to prevent the spread of infection. Midwife Claire O'Sullivan, 30, says she has worked hard to ensure she is seen as an equal to her peers at work  - despite her body art raising eyebrows on the ward . 'This means exposing my extensively tattooed arms and I have worked hard to ensure I am seen as an equal to my peers. 'Despite having tattoos, I am a nice person. 'I have raised some eyebrows along the way and have always tried to prove that kindness, compassion and ability is what you need to make a good midwife, not clear skin. 'Tattooed people come from all walks of life. I am a mother and I have had to deal with raised eyebrows at the school gate and my daughter Molly has had comments made to her about my appearance. 'My daughter understands the importance of respecting individuals for who they are not what they look like and she has a very healthy outlook on life as a result and would never dream of judging a person on their clothing, their appearance or their choice of self expression.' Midwife Claire O'Sullivan, who is a finalist in Miss Tattoo UK next month, has tattoos representing her daughter Molly as well as to commemorate the death of a close friend who left behind two children . Ms O'Sullivan said she was overjoyed . to have come first in an online poll of 40 women hoping to qualify for . the final of the competition. And now the proud mother, who is also a singer in rock band Thunderlizard, will compete against nine other women at the Liverpool Tattoo Convention next month in the hope of being crowned Miss Tattoo UK. The final of the competition, now in its third year, will be held at the Britannia Adelphi Hotel in the city centre on May 17 as part of the three-day convention on all things body art.","Midwife Claire O'Sullivan, from North Wales, in final of Miss Tattoo UK .

"By . Tara Brady . Jerome Ellis was sentenced to six years detention for killing his stepfather in a savage knife attack with his big brother . A 14-year-old boy was sentenced to six years detention for killing his stepfather in a savage knife attack with his big brother. Jerome Ellis, 14, and Joshua Ellis, 23, stabbed Neil Tulley, 54, to death as he lay on the sofa at the family home in Cedar Way in Guildford, Surrey, last August. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, found Jerome not guilty of murder but guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter on the basis of loss of control. Joshua was found guilty of murder. Mr Tulley, who was in a relationship with their mother Marie, was caught by surprise as he lay 'asleep or nearly asleep' at the time of the attack, which was so severe he was nearly beheaded. He suffered more than 60 blows to his body. Judge Christopher Critchlow told Jerome: 'The evidence is not clear as to who did what in that savage attack - it maybe that Joshua did more than you. 'You accept that you used the knife and you knew what you were doing.' A year earlier Mr Tulley had threatened to kill Joshua and had swung at him with an axe, the court heard. He was arrested and charged with making threats to kill but was acquitted by a jury - although he had admitted some of the behaviour. He later returned to the crowded family home but by August last year the relationship between Mr Tulley and Ms Ellis had deteriorated and he was living on the sofa.

In revenge the mother-of-two persuaded a removal van driver to help gut his flat while he was out. Corrina Finney pictured leaving Swindon Magistrates Court. She took revenge on her cheating partner by asking a removal man to completely empty his flat while he was out . Brian Waite's profile page on the website Mature Free and Single. His profile says he is 'looking for romance' with some of his interests including music, movies and dancing . She took all his furniture, electrical equipment, bed, and even his clothing and toiletries - leaving just the underlay for the carpets. Mr Waite returned in the evening to find the interior of his flat 'looking like a new build'. Finney was quickly tracked down by the police and has now admitted a charge of theft at Swindon Magistrates Court in Wiltshire. But the defiant mum has refused to apologise - and said she is glad that Mr Waite 'got what he deserved.' She said: 'I am not sorry.

This was a man I loved for 10 years. I want everybody to know what this man has done. 'Now I have my revenge. He got what he deserved. I am no longer a victim, I am a survivor.

"By . Miles Goslett . Campaign donation: John Bercow with his wife Sally . House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been criticised for accepting a £2,500 donation from Tony Blair’s disgraced former fundraiser, Lord Levy. News of the Labour peer’s gift, which will go towards funding his 2015 general election campaign, was met with disbelief last night – with one Tory MP calling it ‘misguided and inadvisable’. Mr Bercow accepted the four-figure sum last month. His decision to accept the donation is regarded as unorthodox, principally because he sat as a Tory MP between 1997 and 2009 when he was elected Speaker. As Speaker, he is not supposed to be affiliated to any political party. But one Tory MP, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ‘For John Bercow to be taking money from a Labour peer so closely associated with Tony Blair yet again raises the spectre of an anti-Tory bias in him. This is misguided and inadvisable.’ The donation has also raised eyebrows at Westminster because of Lord Levy’s chequered financial career. The multi-millionaire met Tony Blair, the then shadow home secretary, at a dinner at the Israeli Embassy in 1994. The two soon became close friends and tennis partners, and Mr Blair decided to make him a life peer after Labour’s election victory in 1997. In 2000 Levy hit the headlines after it was revealed he had only paid £5,000 in tax during the financial year 1998-99, although he strenuously denied engaging in tax avoidance. Lord Levy, left, was a close friend and advisor of Tony Blair, right, during his time in Cabinet and then as PM . And in his 13 years as chief Labour Party fundraiser, during which he was nicknamed ‘Lord Cashpoint’, Levy was at the centre of the ‘cash for honours scandal’ and he ended up being arrested on two occasions. It was alleged that he helped to secure a series of six-figure loans from businessmen in exchange for offering them a seat in the House of Lords. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case in 2007 after a 16-month criminal investigation, claiming that it could find no direct evidence of any such agreements being made in advance of the loans. However Lord Levy emerged from the affair with his personal reputation badly bruised. At one stage the scandal even appeared to risk unseating Mr Blair. The 69-year-old peer, who raised an estimated £100million for Labour, was one of Mr Blair’s closest confidants during his decade in Downing Street. He stepped down from the fundraising post in 2007, when Mr Blair quit British politics, and relinquished his role as his Middle East envoy at the same time. His donation was disclosed in the latest register of MPs’ financial interests, where it is classed as a ‘sponsorship’. Mr Bercow, the MP for Buckingham, has stipulated that he accepted the money as a ‘donation to my campaign for re-election to the House of Commons’. Previously the fact that the pair knew each other was not common knowledge. However a source close to the Speaker said that he and Levy had struck up a friendship three years ago. They both share a love for tennis and are active charity fundraisers. Lord Levy originally qualified as an accountant before making a multi-million pound fortune in the music industry. He founded Magnet Records, which was sold to Warner Brothers in the late 1980s, and whose artists included Alvin Stardust and Chris Rea. He is now the chairman of International Standard Asset Management. In the register, Mr Bercow also revealed that he accepted a £5,000 gift from Michael Keegan, a friend of 30 years’ standing. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘The Speaker has been friends with Lord Levy for three years. They have undertaken various charity projects together.’","John Bercow's decision has been branded 'misguided and inadvisable'

"By . Martin Keown . Follow @@martinkeown5 . It was not a rigid formation in attack for United. In particular Shinji Kagawa drifted from the left into the middle and was a threat when on the ball. Danny Welbeck would go out wide and his pace scared Bayern at times. Wayne Rooney would drop back if he needed to. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eleven players who should leave Old Trafford in the summer . Drifting: Shinji Kagawa (left) continued his recent renaissance with a decent display . Pure pace: Danny Welbeck skips past Jerome Boateng . It was in general a good tempo from United and what Moyes must have expected when he took over this job. It was more like the United of old, and for the first 60 minutes as good a performance as any this season given the calibre of opponent they were up against. This was the all-conquering Bayern Munich. Maybe United do not need the massive overhaul that has been suggested. They looked a good side. It was a brave fight. Patrice Evra’s goal was a thunderbolt struck because he sensed blood at the start of the second half. Bayern responded like champions and it was Evra who allowed Mario Mandzukic to steal in for his header. I was very impressed with Chris Smalling, there now looks to be a future for him at centre-half; which is a positive from an England point of view. It was a big call by David Moyes to play Smalling in place of Rio Ferdinand but it worked. He looked dominant in the air – and beat Thomas Muller to a commanding header early on – and also coped well in one-on-ones with Franck Ribery when dragged to the wing. He was mobile and used the ball well. Steppingup: Chris Smalling (right) tussles with Thomas Muller as the centre back covered admirably . Plus point: Phil Jones (centre) has shown promise at right back this season . Phil Jones was another plus point at right back. Moyes will have to play at least one of the youngsters, perhaps both, with Nemanja Vidic and Ferdinand leaving in the summer. This will have been an important experience for both of them and given them confidence. Conversely, Jerome Boateng and Dante did not look comfortable at times in possession. Pep Guardiola likes to play out from the back but when questioned by United’s high pressing they would often go back to Manuel Neuer. I was disappointed with Bayern Munich, it was not as difficult for Manchester United as we would have expected. Usually in wide positions they have carousel of players and the full-backs bomb forward. But David Alaba and Philipp Lahm played very central, they came right in to central midfield. It was underlapping rather than overlapping. That made it easier for United to work out who should be picking up who. Over-tinkering: Although Arjen Robben (right) scored, he will have been frustrated with Bayern's system . Game-changer: The introduction of Rafinha (left) gave Bayern added impetus and gave them better shape . It might be because Pep Guardiola wanted Lahm on ball more often, and it also meant Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller could push further forwards. But instead they looked ordinary; it just didn’t work. It’s a system that would drive someone like Arjen Robben mad. He loves short passes with his full-back to cut in and find space in dangerous areas, but there was little chance of that. There was no-one running down the wings to create width. It seemed a case of Guardiola over-tinkering. When Rafinha came on to provide width, Bayern looked a different side.","The first 60 minutes was as good a performance as any from Manchester United this season .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . David Moyes and his Manchester United squad flew home from Germany to uncertain futures on Thursday as the Barclays Premier League champions faced up to a season that is effectively over with one month left. The United manager ducked out through a side door to avoid camera crews at Manchester airport as the official charter plane arrived home from Champions League disappointment in Munich. Moyes knows he must somehow end the domestic season in positive fashion but faces a potentially embarrassing return to his old club Everton in United’s next league fixture on Easter Sunday. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the players heading for Old Trafford exit . Strong finish: David Moyes will have to lift United after losing last chance for silverware this season . Last chance: David de Gea sees Thomas Muller's shot fly past him as United are beaten 3-1 in Munich . Saving face: United's next game is against Moyes's former club Everton - who won at Old Trafford in December . As for United’s players, there are as many as 10 with genuine question marks over their future and midfielder Darren Fletcher warned last night that it is up to them to prove that they are worthy of being retained beyond this summer. Fletcher, whose own future is far from secure, said: ‘We now have five league games left with nothing really to play for. That is a unique experience for us and we are  disappointed and hurting, but we have to go into these games and we have to win them. ‘He (Moyes) will definitely look back . on this season and realise it was a disappointment, but I fully expect . there to be some signings. It is time to show the manager that you . deserve to be at this club.’ Half century: Moyes' first 50 games in charge are still better than Alex Ferguson's early record . Rally call: Darren Fletcher (right) has challenged players to show they deserve to play for the club . United’s 3-1 defeat in Bavaria came with honour attached but nevertheless Moyes’s team are now facing up to no Champions League place next season and must finish at least one place higher than their current seventh to be sure of Europa League football. Some United fans are wondering why the board seem to be tolerating a  season of such disappointment. However, there was no word from United on their current malaise on Thursday as chief executive Ed Woodward stayed in Germany to talk to Bayern Munich officials about a possible summer deal for midfielder Toni Kroos. Moyes believes United’s reduced status will not deter summer  targets from joining United but he must decide which of the current crop to retain. Incoming? United's Ed Woodward stayed in Germany to discuss a potential move for Toni Kroos . On their way? Shinji Kagawa (right) could be one of up to 10 players surplus to requirements at Old Trafford . It now seems certain that left back Patrice Evra will join Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Anderson on the way out, while question marks remain over the likes of Alex Buttner, Nani, Ashley Young, Shinji Kagawa and Tom Cleverley. United gave Bayern a scare,  taking the lead through Evra. But the Germans seemed to possess a killer instinct United don’t have. ‘We need to rise to that standard, said Fletcher. ‘I don’t think we are as far behind as some people think. Whoever the manager signs, they will hopefully help us bridge that gap. If we end up in the Europa League, we can try and win it.’","United's last hope of winning silverware this season ended in Munich .

"By . Richard Spillett . A father who was knocked out at work woke up to find his memory had been wiped - and he couldn't even recognise his own daughter. Luke Shinnie, 35, didn't know who his toddler, Zoe, or his fiancee, Sarah Burrows, were when he first came round. Devastated Miss Burrows feared he would never remember his family again. But after months of hard work and help from medics, Luke has now managed to piece together his long-term memory. Luke Shinnie, 35, didn't recognise his daughter, Zoe, or his fiancee, Sarah Burrows, after the accident . And despite still suffering from some short-term memory loss, he now manages his condition by keeping a diary, where he writes down everything he does each day. Mr Shinnie, from Worcester, was seriously injured when heavy machinery fell on him at work in June 2012. He said: 'The last thing I remember is being in a meeting, and after that the next I knew I was lying in the hospital.' Miss Burrows rushed to see him at the hospital but was horrified when he didn't recognise her or their daughter, who is now two years old. She said: 'At first I was so scared that he would never remember us. It's one thing not to recognise me but the thought of him not remembering Zoe was heartbreaking. 'I had to show him pictures of him . with myself and Zoe and told him stories of things he had done in the . days and weeks leading up to the accident to try and jog his memory. Miss Burrows feared her fiance would never recover from the memory loss, but he has battled back using a diary to remember his daily actions . 'I told him about playing with Zoe in the house and what he had been doing at work. I don't know what triggered his recollection of us but I can't describe how relieved I was and still am.' Mr Shinnie was released from . Worcestershire Royal Hospital but had to return two days later after . suffering extreme dizziness and vomiting. Post Concussion Syndrome (PCS) affects around half of people who suffer concussion after a head injury. It can take many forms, of which memory loss or amnesia is just one. The exact cause is not agreed upon but many experts think it is a result of the brain's chemical balance changing after the initial injury. Doctors classify memories as immediate, such as sounds, short-term, such as telephone numbers and permanent, such as childhood recollections. Usually, the longer-term memories return first because they are more 'consolidated' by being re-used by the brain. There is no specific treatment for PCS, although sufferers are usually given medication for migraines and anti-depressants to help control psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. Most cases of PCS are resolved within three to six months and only one in 10 people will still have symptoms after a year, according to the NHS. As a result of the trauma he suffered, symptoms of which included mood swings, depression and short-term memory loss, the couple nearly broke up. Happily, they have stuck together and are expecting their second child in three weeks' time. Miss Burrows, 31, a deputy supermarket manager, said: 'When I first turned up at the hospital he didn't even recognise me at all - that was horrible. 'Although he remembered me within a few days, for the first six months he was nothing like the man I had fallen in love with, it was horrible. 'But I knew that I had to stick by Luke and together we'd make it through.' Mr Shinnie suffered damage to his brain's visual cortex, causing him short-term memory loss and to forget how the incident happened. Although his long-term memory had mostly returned within six months, Luke still struggled to retain day-to-day memories - and was devastated to have forgotten baby Zoe's first birthday, despite his family filming the event. Mr Shinnie said: 'As a parent, not remembering Zoe's first birthday was the worst thing that could happen to anyone. 'Watching the video doesn't help much as it's just like watching someone else's family. Even though I'm in the video, I don't remember a thing.' To try and build up his memory, Luke had to write down everything he did and had to do during the day. After being diagnosed with Post-Concussion Syndrone, he also suffered dizzy spells, excruciatingly . painful migraines and disrupted sleep. After being knocked out in an accident at work, Mr Shinnie couldn't even remember family events he watched on video or saw in pictures . The engineer admits he ended up losing a lot of friends at that time. He said: 'My change in personality meant that I wasn't the most pleasant person to be around for a long time. 'Unfortunately some people couldn't understand that, although I looked normal on the outside, I was having problems inside. 'I know now that the people who stood by me at the time are my real friends and I can't put into words how much that means to me. 'That's the only thing that's a silver lining with my memory loss - I can't remember how much of a worse person I was at that time.' The couple were helped by therapists at brain injury charity Headway and have since been able to rebuild their lives. Now Mr Shinnie has a new job, where he was promoted after one month, and is looking forward to his wedding. He said: 'I can't thank Headway and the NHS enough for the work they did with us. 'They were a God send for us, I don't think we would have been able to get through all of this without them.' Miss Burrows added: 'We've got a new son on the way in the next three weeks so we're both really excited. What I'm most looking forward to is us being a family again and building for the future.","Luke Shinnie's memory was wiped after he was knocked out at work .

Projects will include rockets, Mars rovers, climate simulators and cryogenic systems. On Thursday April 10, Nasa is set to reveal its enormous database of where to find software for more than 1,000 of its projects, including old rocket ship code. Pictured is the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1981 . Nasa will offer a searchable database of projects, according to Daniel Lockney, Technology Transfer Program Executive at Nasa. ‘We have collected a large amount of software projects, everything from design tools to robotic control systems,’ Lockney tells MailOnline. ‘We find that those problems we solve actually translate well into other problems people have, so we’re making this all available in one place.’ It will develop a ‘GitHub for astronauts’ by hosting the actual software code in its own online repository, which will be found at technology.nasa.gov. All of the code will be free of copyright, but special clearance will be required for anyone who wants to access projects like rocket guidance systems. Many projects are already available online, but they are spread out across many sites and difficult to find. What anyone does with the code is up to them. 'They could put together their own rocket,’ says Lockney. ‘It does take a bit more than that though, it is rocket science [after all].’ As well as being online, Lockney says limited print copies will be made of the Software Catalog .

They hope it will help hackers and entrepreneurs push their existing ideas in new directions — as well as help trigger new concepts. The new code database is the result of a 2011 order from President Barack Obama that federal agencies speed up the pace of technology transfer.

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Fresh from his drive to victory in last Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix - the so-called 'Race of the Century' - it is back to school for Lewis Hamilton. For the 2008 world champion is finding out as much data as possible on his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who was second, in an attempt to give him the edge in their embryonic, but captivating, duel for the world title. Hamilton, thinking ahead to the next race in China on April 20, said: 'Someone in the team did a huge study on my pace in Malaysia (the previous race, which he won comprehensively). As we arrived in Bahrain, Nico had this big document showing all the places where I was quick, and he used that to his advantage. Up for the cup: Lewis Hamilton sealed back-to-back victories after holding off Nico Rosberg for the Bahrain win . Champagne moment: Hamilton is drenched by his team after winning the Bahrain Grand Prix . McLAREN: Ayrton Senna (right) and Alain ProstThe greatest rivalry ever. Senna won the 1988 title ahead of his team-mate but lost in 1989. He was disqualified in the penultimate race after a crash with Prost. Prost won the title and left for Ferrari. FERRARI: Gilles Villeneuve (right) and Didier PironiIn 1982 at San Marino, Pironi passed Villeneuve to win. Two weeks later, the Canadian died in qualifying in Belgium with some claiming he was desperate to beat Pironiâ€™s time. WILLIAMS: Nigel Mansell (right)  and Nelson PiquetIn 1987 the pair won nine of 16 races but Mansell crashed in Japan to rule him out of the final two races and Piquet won the title. 'So now I'll do the same and hopefully I can capitalise. 'I have to study hard and work hard over these next two weeks. I'm going to be giving it a lot of digestion.' But will this approach work for Hamilton? A senior engineer who knows the driver well told me privately that Hamilton is at his best when he leaves the engineering to the engineers. He said Hamilton gives excellent feedback - his feel is intuitive - but that he could overcomplicate matters when not simply answering the engineers' questions and leaving the solution to them. Rosberg still leads the standings by 11 points having won the opening race in Australia and come second in the next two. Hamilton has had one non-finish and two first places. What will further spice the season up . is that Mercedes will permit their drivers to race against each other, . where sense allows. Team orders - which are now allowed, alas - will not . be deployed readily. Sunday . was a case in point: the drivers were told to take care but to get on . with it. This freedom served up a brilliant contest over the last 10 . laps, with Hamilton somehow defying Rosberg's attempts to pass on him on . the supposedly fastest tyre compound. Battle: Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg went wheel-to-wheel for the race victory in Bahrain . Paddy Lowe, Mercedes's technical director, said: 'Mercedes-Benz has a very long history in motorsport and I think this is just part of the philosophy that we want to let our drivers race. 'It's the spirit of Formula One and . motor racing generally. Team orders, putting in artificial constraints, . are just terrible for the spectacle. 'So we believe that we should let the guys race, particularly in a . situation where we have a pretty dominant car - it's become clear of . that now - it's all the more important to keep providing that . entertainment and excitement for all of us.' On track: Rosberg briefly got ahead of Hamilton, but the Briton snatched back the lead on the same lap . Moment to celebrate: Hamilton is embraced by his Mercedes team after winning his second consecutive race . The prospect is mouth-watering because internal team rivalries have served up Formula One's most memorable seasons. There was Nigel Mansell v Nelson Piquet and Hamilton v Fernando Alonso. But the most relevant parallel is the 1988 season, during the previous turbo era, when McLaren's Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna won all but one race in a ding-dong duel.","Lewis Hamilton won the Bahrain Grand Prix after duel with Nico Rosberg .

"By . Martin Robinson . Review: A panel said today that the the suicide of Frances Andrade days after she gave evidence against her abuser 'could and should' have been stopped . The suicide of a violinist days after she testified against her 'predatory' former choirmaster 'could and should' have been prevented, an investigation into her death has found. Frances Andrade, 48, was left 'utterly traumatised' after giving evidence against Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, and killed herself before they were convicted of a string of indecent assaults. Brewer, who was later stripped of his OBE, used his position to abuse Ms Andrade when she was 14 and 15 while at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Giving evidence Mrs Andrade told the jury: ‘This feels like rape all over again’ and complained her abuser had 'smirked' at her across the room as she exposed him as a paedophile. A week later the virtuoso musician then killed herself at home in Guildford, Surrey, . A serious case review said today Ms Andrade was 'let down' by mental health services who failed to realise how vulnerable she was as she fought to bring Brewer to justice. The Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board's report said: 'The panel considered that this was a suicide that could and should have been prevented. 'Mrs A had reasons to live and deserved support as a troubled teenager, and she most certainly deserved support again when, as a mature woman concerned for the safety of others, she stood up and faced her abusers in court. 'The panel commend her bravery for taking a stand in this way. Those services, who held responsibility for her care, were found wanting. 'Perhaps then, Mrs A's wish to protect other young people can belatedly become a reality.' Abusers: Michael Brewer was jailed for six years last year and is ex-wife Kay was also jailed for indecent assault on Frances Andrade . The trial heard the abuse took place in Brewer's office and in his camper van, which he used to drive Ms Andrade out of the school grounds and force her to perform sex acts. At the age of 18, his wife joined in the abuse, telling Frances that she ‘owed her’ as she indecently assaulted her. But he was cleared of raping her when she was 18 at his then home in Chorlton, Manchester. 'Traumatised': The violinist struggled to cope with appearing in court and how her integrity was questioned, saying it 'felt like rape all over again' Sentencing him, Judge Martin Rudland labelled Brewer 'a predatory sex offender' and his trial heard sexual activity between teachers and pupils at Chetham's was not uncommon. Today's serious case review said that music schools, along with other 'hothousing establishments', including ballet schools and drama courses, create a 'backdrop' of 'very particular and potent form of grooming'. The report's panel said staff acted at times 'with impunity'. The abuse Ms Andrade suffered only surfaced decades later when she confided to a friend at a dinner party in 2011. She contacted Surrey Police and it led to an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. The report said that the division of labour between the two forces created 'gaps' and boundaries, across which information did not pass. During the trial was at risk of causing herself harm and her state of mind after giving evidence was 'down and fragile', the report said. She was given medication and treatment by her home treatment team (HTT) in Surrey. The report added: 'It seemed as if Mrs A had stayed strong at her own emotional expense in order to maximise the chances of a conviction, but once she got home she declared herself 'utterly traumatised'. 'The HTT did not specifically assess Mrs A's suicide risk during this time nor how to mitigate it,' the report said. Behind her facade, Ms Andrade hid 'turmoil and fragility' and the HTT 'lost sight' of how the court case outcome would influence whether she would overdose again. A Mental Health Act assessment was not conducted and despite explicit statements to end her life, she was not considered to have passed the threshold for voluntary or compulsory in-patient treatment, the report went on. She then killed herself last 14 months ago. Probe: More than 30 former female pupils of Chetham's School of Music (pictured) have reported abuse to police since Frances' death . Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, said today: 'Victims of sexual abuse should not feel forced to choose between their well-being and justice. 'It is tragic that Frances Andrade felt she had to hide her mental health problems from a jury and subjected herself to cross-examination without the special measures that could have made the experience less distressing. 'We believe there is an urgent need for an inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues, matching recent efforts to help offenders who have mental health issues.' Detective Chief Superintendent Vanessa . Jardine, head of Greater Manchester Police's public protection . division, said: 'On behalf of the force, I would like to extend once . more our sympathies to the family of Frances Andrade. 'Her . incredible bravery in facing her abusers in court and supporting a . prosecution led to the conviction of Michael and Hilary Brewer and it is . tragic that she was not able to see justice served'. Surrey . Police said they accepted that 'more must be done' to recognise the . needs of vulnerable people in historic child abuse cases. Alan Wardle, head of . public affairs for the NSPCC, said: 'Despite being an adult when she . gave evidence, Frances Andrade was still clearly a very vulnerable . witness. 'There is an urgent . need to reform how vulnerable people are treated in court. Many victims . speak of the cross-examination being almost as bad as the original . abuse' A Government spokesman said: 'This tragic case highlights how vital it is that victims have the best support possible to help them recover and seek justice, from the moment they report a crime until the end of a trial and beyond'. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed by a gang vandalising his car, said: 'Mental health should never be a barrier to justice. 'The tragic death of Frances has shown how crucial it is for all involved to truly understand and work together to protect vulnerable victims as soon as they enter the criminal justice system. 'There are no words to describe how traumatic it is to re-live a harrowing crime by giving evidence in court . My three daughters had to go through it when their father was brutally murdered and they still live with it each day. 'Victims tell me things need to change. The Victims' Code and pre-trial cross-examination are a welcome step but I want to see proper accountability in place to prevent further lives being lost in the future.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 13-year-old boy who was trying to change a flat tire alongside a Tennessee highway has died after being struck by a hit-and-run driver. Tennessee Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Miller says Clifton Braunwalder, of Lascassas, died on Thursday after he and his mother, Sondra Braunwalder, 47, were both struck down by a passing car. The two were on Interstate 24 under the Sam Ridly Parkway overpass in Smyrna, switching the tires on their Chevrolet Cavalier, when a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero lost control while changing lanes.

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Uwe Rosler is sporting blue lips, courtesy of an ice cream he has just  consumed in what appears to be a rather desperate effort to remain awake. Two coffees and a water have already been demolished, with Wigan Athletic’s manager admitting he did not sleep well after seeing his side lose to Millwall at home the previous evening. ‘I watched it again,’ he says. ‘I was  frustrated because we didn’t perform like we should. Before I knew, it’s 4am. Then 6am. I must have had two hours’ sleep.’ VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Uwe Rosler's views ahead of the Wembley showdown . Up for the Cup! Uwe Rosler is hoping to upset Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final showdown at Wembley . Rosler believes in such detailed analysis. He says he studied last season’s FA Cup final before Wigan met Manchester City in this season’s quarter-final, publicly acknowledging predecessor Roberto Martinez’s contribution in demonstrating how to conquer their super-rich opponents. And this week Rosler was thanking  Martinez again, this time for providing a few pointers in how to beat Arsenal. Having watched Martinez’s Everton thrash Arsenal 3-0 last weekend, Rosler has taken what he can into his preparation for today’s semi-final at Wembley. Martinez has been hugely supportive, says Rosler. ‘I like Roberto,’ he says. ‘We had dinner soon after I came here. He is a very friendly, very helpful man. I like to soak up as much information as I can and he is one of the top managers. I’ve studied him very much, wasn’t surprised he found a tactic to cause Arsene Wenger problems. I was very impressed with how good Everton were at the beginning of the game without the ball — to break the rhythm, to deny them space, to counter-attack quickly. ‘I was also impressed by how  disciplined they were. They got their rewards. It was good for a young manager to see.’ Top tips: Rosler has been taking inspiration from former Latics manager Roberto Martinez . Blueprint: Martinez's Everton side crushed Arsenal 3-0 in their last Premier League game . Rosler is not offended by comparisons with Martinez. He modestly suggests he would be happy to be only half as successful as the Spaniard. But the 45-year-old  German has his own values and beliefs. He is his own man; the  product of a very different system to the one that nurtured Martinez. In his recent autobiography he writes at length about his upbringing in the former East Germany. In these pages he told how the Stasi, the East German secret police, tried to recruit him. But it is interesting to hear how much he feels he owes to the government-funded  education he received. He was just 11 years old when he moved from the family home in Altenburg to an elite sports school in Leipzig. But, like many boarding- school pupils everywhere, he insists it was the making of them.‘It made me the person I am,’ he says. ‘To survive an elite sports school like that — it provided intense competition from a very young age and I am driven by competition.’ Head to head: Rosler's Wigan will be overwhelming underdogs against Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at Wembley . As we chat in a Wigan restaurant, Rosler recalls stories that would horrify most of us. As well as those attempts to recruit him, he says he suspects team-mates, friends, even members of his extended family were already working as Stasi informants to keep tabs on him. ‘You knew people were looking at you, and after you, too,’ he says. ‘You were aware you were being watched, even if you were never sure who it was watching you. You could guess. It could be friends, family members at times, definitely my team-mates — informants. You knew you needed to be careful about what you said. ‘But when the government has invested time and money in you, they want to make sure you are not looking to leave the country. It would have been a defeat for the philosophy of the government to have something like that happen.’ Against all odds: Wigan pulled off a major upset by defeating Manchester City in last season's FA Cup final . Rosler’s defence of the system — for instance, he insists all those Olympic and world medals were ‘not just down to doping’ — reveals an admiration for discipline and hard work. Not to mention a scouting system he says was employed by German football in 2000 when they revolutionised their youth programme. ‘A lot of those principles came from East Germany,’ he says, while insisting he had no experience of doping in his sport. Catch Arsenal on the breakWigans's tactics of soaking up pressure and breaking in numbers worked against Manchester City in last year’s final. Expect more of the same from Uwe Rosler’s team. Exploit wide open spacesWingers Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman were key figures in last season's Wembley upset and are fit after injury. Rosler could have two aces up his sleeve. Rough them up a littleWigan are a more physical side under Rosler. The likes of Boyce, McArthur and Barnet unsettled City in the last round and Arsenal could be more susceptible. He nevertheless feels fortunate because the fall of the Berlin Wall enabled him to head west and make a good living — and help him enjoy an enduring love affair with City. ‘I consider myself very lucky to have lived 20 years in one system and now more than 20 years in another,’ Rosler continues. ‘It makes me more rounded. My DNA is still made from that time. Also from my parents: normal working- class people. ‘Some I knew in East Germany were not so lucky. Coming to the end of their careers, they were born at the wrong time.’ This is the kind of consideration a 45-year-old Rosler likes to show his players today. ‘I am a communicator,’ he says. ‘I communicate with players all the time. I want to know how they feel. I want to know how their private life is. I want to know so I treat them in the best possible way.’ Early education: As a player, Rosler was schooled in Germany before coming to Man City in 1994 . There is a sense of perspective here. Something that comes, he says, from his experience of serious illness. More specifically his battle with non-Hodgkin lymphoma 11 years ago. ‘It has definitely given me a greater sense of perspective,’ he says, ‘because you never know what is around the corner. ‘I was 34 and they said I would not make it through Easter. I was protected from that at the time. My wife (Cecilie) was told but she did not tell me at the time. She’s a very strong person. ‘It has made me appreciate more the family time. In my job there is not much family time but mine supported me through everything. I am ambitious. I want to be the best I can be but my family, my children, they are important too.’ Keeping his family happy was a factor in his decision to move from Brentford to Wigan last December. Ambition was also an element but taking his family back to Cheshire was a further incentive. So was the opportunity to work for Dave Whelan. Danger men: Callum McManaman (L) and Shaun Maloney have been marked as the players to test Arsenal . ‘I liked what he and the club . represented,’ says Rosler. ‘Stable ownership, stable finances, a short . line of communication. And I could be with my family in Manchester. ‘Before . I went to Brentford there were four interviews. With the owner here I . went to his house. We talked. Not just about football but about life, . and after 45 minutes he said the job was mine. “Just don’t be greedy,” he then told me.’ Whatever Whelan is paying Rosler, he must consider it money well spent. The German has not just restored stability after Owen Coyle’s troubled tenure. He has guided them into a play-off position, six points clear of seventh-placed Brighton with five games left, and he has followed Martinez in masterminding another astonishing FA Cup run. It is also worth noting that the Brentford side he left is within touching distance of automatic promotion from League One. ‘My philosophy is to work with young players, English players,’ he says. ‘The talent is here. The players are well educated but they don’t always get the opportunity. I try to identify those players. It worked at Brentford and it is working at Wigan.’ Not again! Rosler does not want a repeat of his Wembley loss with Brentford in last season's play-off final . Mention of Brentford does, of course, bring him back to Wembley and the 2-1 defeat by Yeovil in last year’s play-off final. ‘That was not a good memory,’ he says. ‘After all that happened, after the way we missed out on automatic promotion by losing to Doncaster on the last day, I needed a holiday to overcome it. The first three days I was just sleeping.’ He would hope to sleep better after tomorrow.","Wigan face Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday .

Child neglect: Crystal Hernandez, 34, allegedly left five children alone without food at her home while she gambled at a casino . According to the Sun-Sentinel, Broward County Sheriff's Deputy Matthew McGee said he found 'feces on the kitchen counter, along with feces on the floor.' There were clothes and old food strewn about the residence, said McGee, and the cupboards were empty of food. A WSVN reporter was given access to the home by Hernandez's boyfriend Marcos Perez, and he found a fridge full of rotten food and the apartment in an unkempt state. Concern: Neighbors called police after the children were seen wandering around outside the home asking for food . Squalid: Police found a fridge full of rotten food, empty cupboards and an overwhelming stench of urine and feces at the residence .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The site of the world's worst ever nuclear disaster has still not be cleared 28 years on as these bleak pictures show. The photographs were taken by sales manager and photographer Toby Batchelor who travelled to the nuclear site at Pripyat, Chernobyl. The 34-year-old of Derby spent two days in the city where a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Power Station exploded on April 26, 1986. During the accident itself, 31 people died and it has left devastating long term effects, such as cancer and deformities, which are still being accounted for. Mr Batchelor said: 'Each day when leaving the area you had to be scanned for high levels of radioactivity. 'In my images we can see everything from the school littered with gas masks to the abandoned cottage of a resident. 'It is a very tense place to be, as you have to pass through a couple of heavily guarded check points where they check you off with their list of visitors. 'There is a lot of shock and general interest from people when they see these photographs. It is something that you just can't imagine happening. 'It was very sad to see places that would have once been full of people, but very interesting to learn about.' As a result of lack of money, the project to clear the site is now ten years behind schedule and Ukraine's current political and economic meltdown could mean an even bigger delay is in store, with the intended finish of 2015 now out of reach.

"By . James Gordon . A woman from Nashville who allowed her young daughter to be beaten to death has pleaded guilty to reckless homicide and aggravated child neglect after she failed to protect the toddler. Neena Costanza, 22, accepted a plea deal to serve 30 percent of a 20-year sentence — with a chance for parole that means she could be free within six years. Little Eloise Costanza was just 17-months-old when she died after being beaten up by her boyfriend Jacob Scott Hughes, 23, who is already in jail and awaiting trial for the toddlers' murder. Charged: Neena Costanza, left, pleaded guilty in the death of her daughter, Eloise; authorities say she knew her boyfriend Jacob Hughes, right, had been abusing her but she still left her in his care . Happier times: Costanza pictured with an infant Eloise . The man caused head trauma, skull fractures and brain swelling that killed the child while Costanza was at work.

Hughes sent a message about the child struggling to breathe through Facebook. Costanza called 911 and rushed back home but by that time, the child had suffered more severe injuries. The . police report states that paramedics found the child covered in bruises . and unresponsive. Hughes has said the child received her injuries in a . fall. The girl died the next day at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The medical examiner ruled the child's death from severe head trauma was a homicide. Whilst . Hughes was arrested and indicted soon after the child died, it wasn't . until month later that police decided to arrest Costanza. Police . found that she had allowed the girl to be abused for weeks despite . being confronted by her mother and grandmother about the injuries. She had even mentioned the abuse to co-workers, and had images on a cellphone of bruises on the child. Costanza had also called the police a month before the child’s death to report a domestic assault by Hughes. After pleading guilty, her defense attorney David Raybin said she failed to protect her daughter but was herself being abused. 'People should understand,' he said, 'that domestic violence has consequences.'","Neena Costanza, 22, accepted a plea deal to serve 30 percent of a 20-year sentence .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Michael Palin will instead tour with his own solo show shelving plans for Monty Python to take their farewell shows to America . The Monty Python team have had to shelve plans to take their sellout show to America after one member of the veteran comedy outfit said he was too busy to go. Michael Palin will instead tour with his own solo show, a month after the Pythons’ farewell London performances at the 02 in July. Fellow Python Terry Jones told Reader's Digest magazine that while four members of the veteran comedy outfit were keen to take the money-spinning comeback shows to America following their performances in London later this summer, Michael Palin rejected the idea. Instead, the actor and presenter will now go on tour with his own solo show, just a month after the Pythons’ farewell performances at the 02 in July, the 70-year-old will embark on a 21-date tour to mark the publication of the third volume of his diaries. These cover his television-travel debut on Around the World in Eighty Days as well as looking back at his life as a shy schoolboy in Sheffield. Asked about whether they had plans to take the show abroad, Jones, 72, told Readers Digest magazine: ‘Everybody else agreed to do the show in America, but Mike Palin says he’s too busy…’ The group have already overcome a series of rows over the decades in order to return to the stage for a series of ten shows that are expected to net each member of the group up to £1m. Tickets for the shows sold out within minutes of going on sale and is one of the most eagerly-awaited shows in history. They first discussed reuniting in 1999, but Palin again pulled out at the last minute, reportedly angering Idle, who had worked on the project. He has since claimed that he felt uncomfortable performing as a group without Graham Chapman — the sixth Python who died of cancer aged 48 in 1989. There were also strains within the group over Idle’s idea to make a sequel to their hit film Holy Grail. When Cleese decided not to take part, the project was dropped. Cleese and Idle reportedly fell out in 2011 when Idle axed the Fawlty Towers star’s voiceover from hit musical Spamalot, denying him royalty payments. Cleese tweeted that Eric was ‘Yoko Idle’ — a reference to Yoko Ono’s role in causing tension among The Beatles. However, the new stage show will begin in July, with Jones revealing it will feature dance routines performed by scantily clad dancers. He said: ‘Eric Idle is directing and has written the script, dusting off some old classics and giving them a modern twist. Eric has already met with the choreographer Arlene Phillips. They’ll be 20 dancers. All the girls are wearing Agent Provocateur underwear. I don’t know what they’re going to do, though. The original cast of Monty Python are to play shows at the 02 in London in July. They are, from left - Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Carol Cleveland, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese . ‘Eric has also picked some sketches that we’ve never done on stage before, like the Spanish Inquisition. ‘In the slapstick lecture that closes Act One, I have to fall over a lot and get hit on the head with planks and things like that. I’m not sure how this is going to happen – we’re going to have to work out some padding. ‘It might look a bit odd with a lot of grey-haired people getting bashed up. Eric says we should all get fit, but I walk the dog for an hour on Hampstead Heath every day and I’m hoping that’s enough.’ The group made 45 episodes of Monty Python’s Flying Circus between 1969 and 1974, including sketches such as the Dead Parrot, Spam, The Lumberjack Song and The Spanish Inquisition. Their first movie, And Now For Something Completely Different, was released in 1971. Monty Python and the Holy Grail came out in 1975, while Monty Python’s Life of Brian followed four years later. Their final film, Monty Python’s the Meaning of Life, was released the next year. It proved to be the last time the six Pythons worked together on a full-time project. Their last live performance came in 1982 at the Hollywood Bowl.","Terry Jones says four Pythons were keen to take money-spinning show to America .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . He was there to receive an investiture for his artwork from Prince Charles . But on a recent trip to Buckingham Palace cross-dressing potter Grayson Perry claims the heir to the throne shared a revealing secret. As well as leaving the palace with a CBE, Mr Perry said he had discovered that the Prince confessed to wanting to wear his mother's clothes. This is the moment when Mr Perry said that the prince of Charles made the revealing comment . Grayson Perry left the palace with a CBE and a confession from Prince Charles. The artist said the second in line to the throne admitted: 'There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while' Mr Perry, 54, told The Sun: 'Charles did admit to me, 'There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while. The crown and jewels.' At the ceremony, Mr Perry dressed in, what he referred to as an 'Italian mother of the bride outfit', complete with a black feathered hat, midnight blue dress and jacket. The winner of the prestigious Turner Prize, which is presented to a British artist under 50, became the first male cross-dresser to collect a CBE wearing a dress. His outfit had been agreed with the palace before the event. He is known for his controversial artwork which features themes such as child abuse. He has said that he loves using clay because 'it is held in such low esteem in the art world'. Mr Perry is pictured in discussion with the Prince of Wales as he is handed his CBE . Mr Perry said: 'Charles did admit to me, ""There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while. The crown and jewels""' Mr Perry realised he was a transvestite when he was a teenager and was thrown out of his family house in Chemsford, Essex. He moved to London in 1980 and began attending pottery classes. From there, the artist rose to fame and won Turner prize in 2003. He said that the Turner honoured his 'hard graft' over 30 years. Mr Perry was the first potter to be awarded the prestigious title. His art depicts cultural steotypes as well as scenes from his childhood and family life. He also addresses topics such as child abuse and sexuality in his work. The potter is a tranvestite known for his alter-ego 'Claire' who he admits is modelled on Camilla Parker-Bowles. He is married to Philippa Perry, a psychologist and has a 21-year-old daughter called Flo. In pictures from the ceremony, the pair are seen to be chatting and smiling - but their conversation had previously not be revealed. After the ceremony he said: 'Receiving this was great, it's not just for me it's for all the artists - no really it's just for me, for 30 years of hard graft.' He admitted that his first thought before the event was: '""What am I going to wear?"" 'It's a serious thing, I'm not going to compromise my identity as Britain's pre-eminent transvestite. 'I Googled to see what people wore and went for the sexier end. I always do like the older woman who makes an effort.' Yet this is not the first time Mr Perry has commented on his January encounter with the Prince. He told The Telegraph that the medal would not fit over his head because of the size of his hat which Mr Perry said amused Prince Charles. Clarence house declined to comment on the conversation between the prince and Mr Perry. Grayson Perry pictured outside Buckingham Palace holding the CBE . Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

On British architecture: 'In the space of a mere 15 years in the sixties and seventies … the planners, architects and developers of the City wrecked the London skyline and desecrated the dome of St Paul’s' On Canary Wharf: 'I personally would go mad if I had to work in a place like that, because I would feel how the hell would you get out in the event of a fire apart from anything else.' In an interview with Jonathan Dimbleby: 'I’m not very good at being a performing monkey … I’m not prepared to perform whenever they want me to perform.' During a 1989 speech: '[I and others] wonder what it is about our country, and our society that our language has become so impoverished, so sloppy and so limited; that we have arrived at a wasteland of banality, cliché and casual obscenity.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Ethnic minorities should be encouraged to integrate into society rather than living in neighbourhoods with people from their own countries because it makes them 'feel more British', a study has shown. Researchers from Essex University and the University of Oxford have found that minorities living in mixed areas were five per cent likely to identify with being British than those who didn't. People who lived separately from their own ethnicity were also just as likely to take part in community activities, help out their neighbours and trust those they lived with as those who segregated themselves. A study has found that minorities who live separated from their own ethnicity are more likely 'to feel' British, and than more integration in Britain should be encouraged . The study of 4,391 people, 3,582 of which came from ethnic minorities found that, for white Britons, being poor was a bigger factor in breaking down trust between neighbours than race. 'Diversity is really good for minority members in Britain,' the report's co-author, Neli Demireva, said. 'If they live in diverse scenarios they identify more with Britain. Contact is good because they don't create reactive identities.' The report echoes comments by Lord Tebbit, who said that he was concerned by foreign minorities seeking to 'create their own country in Britain' The paper, published in Sociology, reverses years of study on the topic, with previous studies suggesting that ethnic mixing made people less trusting and lowered levels of community spirit. In conclusion, the report said: 'If anything, diversity should be encouraged to cement the integration progress of migrants.' The conclusion echoes statements by former Tory Party Chairman Lord Tebbit, who has criticised those who 'recreate their own country in Britain'. Speaking to Sky News in 2013, he said: 'The problem that is caused in our cities is caused by immigrants from the third world who have got no intention of integrating here. 'They are people who left their country, came here and are trying to recreate their country in our country. 'We are building not so much a multi-racial society or a multi-cultural society, we are building separate societies which really don't have much to do with each other.' David Cameron has also previously said that young immigrants should be taught to speak English and warned that some minorities are now more segregated from the rest of the country than their parents.","Report shows that integration has a positive effect on minorities .

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . The families of three Red Caps murdered by a mob in Iraq ditched a controversial lawyer amid claims he was also representing their alleged killers. Relatives of corporals Simon Miller and Russell Aston and Lance Corporal Thomas Keys dropped Phil Shiner over concerns he had a ‘disgusting’ conflict of interest. Mr Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers is representing Iraqi families at the £22million Al Sweady Inquiry into claims that British soldiers tortured and abused detainees in 2004. Claims that detainees were executed have been dropped. The Red Cap families believe some of those taking legal action were ‘directly or indirectly responsible’ for the deaths of the Royal Military Policemen a year earlier. The families of three Red Caps - Corporals Simon Miller (left) and Russell Aston and Lance Corporal Thomas Keys (right) - murdered by a mob in Iraq in 2003 have sacked a controversial lawyer Phil Shiner amid claims he is representing their alleged killers in a separate case . Last night John Miller, 63, the father of Cpl Miller, said: ‘I believe there is a conflict of interest involving Phil Shiner because both cases are inextricably linked. We feel betrayed by him. ‘It is disgraceful, utterly disgusting, that he would try to represent us while having the Iraqis on his books who I believe are the main antagonists. ‘The families have been brought over to London, had flights paid for, put up in hotels, and making legal claims here. I believe they are, or know, the murderers of the Royal Military Policemen.’ Cpl Aston, 30, Cpl Miller, 21, and L/Cpl Keys, 20, plus Corporal Paul Long, 24, Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, 41 and Lance Corporal Benjamin Hyde, 23, were slaughtered in Majar al Kabir, near Basra, in 2003. They were cornered by hundreds of locals at a police station and then executed. Their killers have never been brought to justice. The inquest into their deaths heard evidence that the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed. The relatives first had contact with Mr Shiner in 2011. Out of frustration at questions over their loved ones’ deaths not being answered satisfactorily by the MoD, four families accepted his offer to fight their case. Only one relative, Patricia Long – mother of Cpl Long – was granted legal aid. But after learning that the lawyer was also involved in the Al Sweady case, three families backed out. Phil Shiner is representing a number of Iraqi civilians who claim to have been abused and tortured by members of the British military . Mr Shiner, 57, has made his name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq. He has represented alleged victims of abuses by troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. He was awarded the title Human Rights Lawyer of the Year in 2004. On his firm’s website, his profile reads: ‘Phil is a committed socialist and the roots of his career as a lawyer are firmly planted in the law centre movement of the 1980s.’ He was the prime mover behind the Al Sweady hearing into allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others near Basra in 2004. The Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of the six Royal Military policemen. The claims were strenuously denied by the MoD, which insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle. Last month, the allegations were sensationally dropped at the year-long war crimes hearing after lawyers said that there was no evidence they were killed in cold blood. Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers is still representing another 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse. The firm has already been paid millions from the public purse, including around £3million in legal aid for the Al Sweady Inquiry. In an email to Mr Miller, Mr Shiner denied any conflict of interest. He said: ‘For obvious reasons, I did the most careful conflict of interest checking process before I agreed to take on Pat Long’s case. ‘That is required by the rules but was even more important in the very obviously sensitive circumstances of Pat’s case. I can assure you that that exercise has been conducted and that there is no conflict of interest.’ He was not available for comment yesterday. The Solicitors Regulation Authority code of conduct states: ‘If there is a conflict, or a significant risk of a conflict, between two or more current clients, you must not act for all or both of them unless the matter falls within the scope of the limited exceptions.’ A legal source told the Mail that because the Red Caps and Al Sweady cases were separate, it was unlikely a conflict of interest would occur, even though there were links.","Corporals Simon Miller and Russell Aston were killed alongside Lance Corporal Thomas Keys in Majar al Kabir near Basra in 2003 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pilot was forced to land his plane using an iPad app and his cell phone to help guide him to an airport after his navigation system malfunctioned on Tuesday. Raymond Cody was flying a single-engine plane across western Colorado to Grand Junction Regional Airport when the instrument panel in his cockpit stopped working not long after take-off. While his engine continued to work normally, the pilot quickly realized he would have no way of notifying airport officials as he approached his destination. Raymong Cody, right, has described TSA agent Gene Manzanares, left, as his hero after he helped him to land his plane which had suffered a malfunction of the navigation system . Cody used his cell phone to call the airport and at 8:01 a.m. spoke to Gene Manzanares, the Transportation Security Administration's master coordination center officer for the airport. ‘The airplane motor wasn't an issue of stopping, it was only the electronics in the airplane. So I had no radio, I had no navigation equipment,’ Cody told KREXTV. Using an iPad app, Cody was able to track his flight path and relay his position to Manzanares, who helped coordinate the landing with the airport's control tower. 'I was the one talking to him directly and the one talking to the tower and to the airport fire and rescue through our radios, so I was doing all three,' said Manzanares. Using an iPad app, Cody was able to track his flight path and relay his position to Manzanares, who helped coordinate the landing with the airport's control tower . The pair spoke for nearly half an hour until Cody was able to land his plane safely. It was only the next day that they met in person so Cody could thank the man who helped him out of a very tricky position. ‘Gene's my hero,’ said Cody. ‘He was real calm, kept me calm, and I do appreciate it.’ The use of iPads for pilots with a charter company was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration in February 2011. Pilots are typically required to carry a bag of paper charts and manuals on board, but the FAA's decision had the potential to change that. After the charter company's successful test period, the FAA extended the iPad option, allowing FAA-authorized operators to use the tablet as an alternative to the paper charts. Most recently, American Airline pilots were granted permission to dump their heavy bags of paper maps and charts for iPads.

"By . Paul Bentley . Control: A new mobile service is promising parents total control over how their children use their phones, from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on . Parent will soon be able to read their children’s text messages, control who they speak to and turn their phones on or off – no matter where they are. A new mobile service is promising mothers and fathers total control over how their children use their phones, from the websites they visit to the times of day the handset is on. Mobile phone company Bemilo has created the service, which will run on the Vodafone network, to appeal to parents worried about text bullying, sexting and the disruptive use of phones in schools. Campaigners say the phone deal, which is intended for children between eight and 16, hands power back to parents. The move follows the Daily Mail’s campaign for internet service providers to protect children by automatically blocking access to pornographic content, with adults having to ‘opt in’ if they want to view sexual material. Until now, any restrictions on children’s mobile phone use have had to be made using the parental control options on the handset itself. These settings can be difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, and many parents do not know they exist. Parents signed up to Bemilo’s system, however, can set restrictions for their child’s phone using a web page that only they can access. The site is linked directly to the phone’s SIM card, so if a child wants to add a friend as a contact they have to ask the parent, who can then use the website to decide whether or not to allow the change. Pleased: Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute, said 'parents have been wanting something like this for a very long time' All messages that are sent and received by the child can be viewed by the parents by logging on to the site, even if the child deletes them from the phone. Parents can also set a timer so that the phone cannot be switched on during lessons or late at night, for example. However, calls to the parents’ phones can be made at all times. The pay-as-you-go SIM cards are available from Bemilo’s website from today and from Carphone Warehouse later this month, with the parental control service costing from £2.95 per month. Campaigners are now calling on other phone networks to introduce similar services. ‘Parents being able to read texts means if bullying is going on they will be alerted straight off and can deal with it straight away. 'Now we need a joined up effort across all networks and all industries.’ Bemilo founder Simon Goff said: ‘Unlike an app, Bemilo’s SIM will work on any mobile device or tablet, and most importantly cannot be bypassed by the child.’ But Nick Pickles, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, warned: ‘Giving parents the tools to control what their kids can do with smartphones is a good thing, but this is a step too far. ‘If there are problems with what young people are using their phones for the way to fix them is not to have parents spying.’ Facebook is considering lifting a ban on children using its site – despite fears it could put youngsters at risk of bullying or grooming by sexual predators.

"By . Jonathan Block . The driver of a pickup truck who was severely beaten by a mob after accidentally hitting a child is now speaking to his family. Mandi Emerick, daughter of beating victim Steve Utash, said Friday that her father has retained consciousness and is talking, but remains in a confused state, according to the Detroit Free Press. Utash, who remains in critical condition, was also taken off a ventilator on Thursday evening. He was in a medically induced coma followed the April 2 attack by at least six people. Steve Utash, with his daughter Mandi Emerick, before he was beaten . 'When I went up there, they had just taken it out,' Emerick said. 'He made eye contact with me and was able to identify who I was. He said my name and he said, ""Mandi, Mandi, I’m sorry, I’m sorry."" He’s not really there,' she continued. 'He’s awake but he’s not really there. Sometimes when I talk to him he knows who I am and sometimes he doesn‘t. The doctors said not to get discouraged because he’s really drugged and coming out of sedation.' Emerick also said her dad is having flashbacks about the April 2 attack when he was beaten by a mob after he stopped to assist a 10-year-old boy that went into traffic and was hit by Utash’s pickup truck. Utash, 54, holds one of his grandchildren. On April 2, he was beaten by a mob after getting out of his pickup truck to help a 10-year-old boy who ran into the street and got accidentally hit by his truck . Utash, pictured with wife Starr, was in a medically induced coma before being taken off a respirator Thursday night . Repeatedly, Utash says 'I don’t want to die, I’m sorry,' and, 'Please get them off me,' according to his daughter. While Utash's prognosis is uncertain, doctors say the fact he is breathing on his own and recognizes commands are positive signs. 'They can’t give me a for sure answer on what’s going to happen,' Emerick said. 'They don’t know if it’s the drugs or something else. Deborah Hughes helped save Utash's life when she stepped between him and his attackers . 'It’s a pretty big deal and it’s hard not to be discouraged when you’re looking at your dad and he’s looking like he doesn’t know me,' she added. 'He knew who I was at first and a couple hours went by and I asked again if he knew me and he didn’t say anything. It’s really hard.' Four men and a 16-year-old male have been charged in the beating. Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather is white. His accused assailants are all black. Family members of Steve Utash spoke to a crowd gathered at Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday to pray for racial peace and for Utash's health.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The financial watchdog has been accused of committing an ‘extraordinary blunder’ by releasing market-sensitive information about an insurance inquiry which sent the stock market plummeting. Around £7billion was wiped off the value of insurers at one point on Friday after Clive Adamson, from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), revealed that 30million pensions and savings policies were due to be investigated. The watchdog rushed to reassure panicked investors about the inquiry into rip-off charges and sub-standard service, but despite their efforts to calm the market the industry ended up suffering a total fall in value of around £2.4billion. Criticism: Andrew Tyrie (left) the Treasury committee chairman said the FCA were guilty of making an 'extraordinary blunder' after the FCA's Clive Adamson (right) said 30million policies were to be investigated . MP Andrew Tyrie, the Treasury committee chairman, said the FCA had breached the principle that information should be released to all parties concerned at the same time, adding: ‘On the face of it, this is an extraordinary blunder. ‘This announcement may have led to a disorderly market in shares. It may also have damaged consumer confidence in the industry as a whole.’ The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday . that the FCA was planning to investigate financial policies worth . £150billion, sold between the 1970s and the turn of the millennium. The . inquiry, which is due to start in the summer, will attempt to discover . whether loyal customers who took out products such as private pensions, . endowments, investment bonds and life insurance over a 30-year period . are locked in with high exit penalties. The announcement was a fresh blow for . the industry after the Chancellor gave pensioners the freedom to draw . down as much or as little of their pension pot as they want, removing . the need to buy an annuity. Proposal: Pensions Minister Steve Webb promised a 'full-frontal assault' last week on pension schemes which give poor value . George Osborne’s radical pension reforms have been criticised by the former head of the Pensions Commission and the Financial Services Authority. From April 2015, all restrictions on access to a retirees’ pension pot will be removed. But Lord Adair Turner has claimed that the changes risk leaving millions of pensioners close to poverty in later life. He warned: ‘There’s a danger that people don’t realise how low the state pension is. ‘Many pensioners could even use their pots to invest in buy-to-let properties which could stoke future house price bubbles.’ And last week Pensions Minister Steve Webb promised a ‘full-frontal assault’ on pension schemes which give poor value, announcing that a 0.75 per cent cap will be imposed on charges from April next year. Mr Tyrie has now called for the investigation into the FCA’s release of information to be led by an independent figure and for any resulting report to be published in full. He said: ‘It is crucial that we have a full and transparent explanation about how such an apparently serious mistake came to be made by our financial services watchdog – the body appointed by Parliament to enforce high standards of conduct. ‘Responsibility for the FCA’s work on this should lie not with the board as a whole but with the independent directors alone, led by the chairman. This is an early test of their essential role in exercising oversight of the executives and ensuring that they meet the same high standards expected of the industry.’ The FCA declined to comment.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 74-year-old mother of legendary baseball star Cal Ripken Jr is too traumatized to return home after she was kidnapped at gunpoint last week. Ripken appealed for the public's help in locating the man responsible for the 'bizarre' and 'unsettling' abduction at a news conference in Baltimore today. Violet Ripken was taken from her . Aberdeen, Maryland, home at around 7am last Tuesday by a . handgun-wielding thug who dragged her into her 1998 Lincoln Town Car and . sped off. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Cal Ripken Jr. looks upset while speaking about his mothers kidnapping during a news conference at Oriole Park in Baltimore on Friday August 3, 2012 . The Hall of Fame infielder appeared . to choke up as he described a phone call from his sister last week . indicating that his mother might be missing. He said it was 'a horrible . night.' Vi Ripken was found unharmed in her car, but Ripken says she remains shaken up and is too traumatized to return the home where she and her husband, Cal Sr., raised four children. She is staying with family.. 'I appreciate all the outpouring of love and support for our family, ' he said. 'Mom is doing pretty good. It's a . traumatic situation that she was involved in, traumatic for all of us in . the family, and we're trying really hard to come together and support each other in this. 'But mom, by and large, is a tough, strong woman, and was able to endure this and she's doing pretty good.' He said there's reason to believe the . kidnapping was planned in advance, but he said he can't be sure and . doesn't know why she was targeted. 'It's bizarre in many ways,' he said. Investigators say there was no ransom . demand, and the elder Ripken has said her abductor appeared not to know . that she was the mother of the retired Baltimore Oriole who owns . baseball's record for most consecutive games played. Distressing: Violet Ripken (centre) mother of Cal Ripken Jr (right) and his brother Bill (left) was abducted at gunpoint from her home . Police have said little about the investigation but have released a sketch of a suspect and video surveillance footage pulled from a store. A manhunt for the pensioner and her . attacker was launched by the Aberdeen Police Department who described the . case as a missing persons investigation. As they searched police in Baltimore County, Maryland got a call from an anonymous tipster about a suspicious vehicle. According to wbaltv.com the . call came from a passerby who spotted Ms Ripken and her attacker in the . back seat of his car where he had bundled her in, tied up. The unnamed source confronted the man who said Ms Ripken was his mother and that he was taking her to hospital. But the source was not convinced so called the police who contacted the Aberdeen department to suggest that the car might be linked to their investigation. Shaken-up: Cal Ripken, pictured with his mother Violet in 2001, left, and in 2002, right, says his family is thankful for everybody's support . For a terrifying 24 hours, Ms Ripken's . distressed family had no clue as to her whereabouts while police . desperately searched for clues. She was eventually found at around 6am on Wednesday, bound and blindfolded in her car not far from her home. 'This has been a very trying time for . our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, . safe and healthy,' said a statement released by the Ripken family after her safe return. 'We want to thank everyone for their tremendous support, especially all of the law enforcement agencies that worked so hard and quickly.' The abductor, believed to be a white male in his late 30s to early 40s, remains at large. Ms Ripkin described him as tall and thin and said he was wearing glasses, a light-coloured shirt and camouflage print trousers. The FBI is also involved in the investigation.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The mystery illness that has killed 27 bald eagles in Utah this month appears to be West Nile Virus, state officials said Tuesday. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources said in a statement Tuesday that that laboratory tests done on some of the first birds found indicate they died from West Nile Virus. Since December 1, officials have found the birds in northern and central Utah. All were either dead or were ill and later died during treatment. Unknown illness: This undated image provided by the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Northern Utah shows one of four bald eagles that were brought in with odd symptoms. All later died . The eagles displayed similar symptoms, including head tremors, signs of seizures, weakness in legs and feet and a paralysis of the bird's wings. Beyond the 27 that have died, officials said five eagles were being treated at a wildlife rehabilitation center Tuesday. They appeared to be responding well to treatment, officials said. Utah wildlife officials aren't sure how the eagles caught the virus, but they suspect the birds contracted it by eating Eared Grebes that were infected with the virus and died recently. West Nile Virus, which is spread by mosquitoes, usually infects eagles and other birds during warmer months. Debilitating symptoms: In every case, affected birds display weakness and then paralysis in their legs and seizures. The affected birds die withing three to four days . Heartbreaking: Experts are frantically trying to establish the cause of the symptoms before more of the birds are affected . Majestic animals: Bald eagles are large birds of prey with a wingspan of more than seven feet . Mark Hadley, a Utah Division of . Wildlife Resources spokesman, said the grebes, a duck-like aquatic bird, . start arriving in Utah in October, when mosquitoes are still active. 'It's . possible that those grebes got bit by mosquitoes after they got here . when they arrived in the fall, and it just took a while for them to . die.' The bald eagles began arriving in . November and appeared to have died relatively quickly once they . contracted the virus, Hadley said. About 750 to 1,200 bald eagles begin migrating to Utah each November and stay until March, officials said. During those winter months, the eagles get most of their food by eating dead animals, such as grebes. Leslie . McFarlane, a wildlife disease coordinator with DWR, said in a statement . that there's still a chance a few more eagles could die, but because . the migration period for grebes is almost over, it's likely that the . risk to eagles will soon drop. The birds do not pose a risk to human health but people should not handle eagles if they find them, wildlife officials said. Hadley . said that in the 17 years he's been with DWR, he has never seen this . many eagles die off, particularly in such a short period of time. 'This is definitely unusual,' he said.","At least 27 birds have died since the beginning of December .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Seattle Seahawks kick returner Percy Harvin zipped past 11 Denver Broncos on his way to the endzone in the opening kickoff of the second half of Sunday's Super Bowl, he didn't just score a touchdown, he also cost a Missouri car dealership more than $300,000. As part of a promotion leading up to the Super Bowl, the Hutcheson Ford dealership in St. James, Missouri, offered potential customers the deal of a lifetime in its 'Super Weekend Sale': If a player returns an opening kickoff for a touchdown in the first or second half of the Super Bowl, anyone who bought a vehicle between January 29 and February 1 would receive a refund of the purchase price of the vehicle. Touchdown: Percy Harvin's return for a touchdown cost a Missouri car dealership more than $300,000 . Backfired: Hutcherson Ford promised to refund the price of any vehicle if either half of the Super Bowl started with a kickoff return for a touchdown . Unfortunately for the dealership, 12 people bought vehicles between the 29th and the 1st - and Percy Harvin returned the opening kickoff of the second half 87 yards for a touchdown. 'We're like ""Oh, my gosh,"" there's this five percent chance of this . happening, and it just blew up in our faces,' Kathleen Frazier, . marketing manager for the dealership, told ABC17News. One of the lucky beneficiaries of the promotion was Jim Carey, who purchased a new Ford F150 for $53,190. 'I started yelling at the TV, ""run, run,"" as loud as I could,' Carey said. His wife, Mary Jane, was in disbelief. 'I kept . saying, ""Is this real? Is this real? Is this live? Is this live?'"" she said. Pricey: The dealership is refunding 12 customers who bought vehicles ranging in price from $10,000 to $50,000 . Lucky: Jim Carey bought a truck for more than $50,000 - money that will now be refunded by the dealership . Carey says a salesman told him about the promotion a few days before it actually began. So he waited until January 29 to officially purchase his new ride. He even joked with the salesman that he would be back on Monday to pick up his check. Frazier says that most of the winners didn't believe that they would actually get paid. 'We had people call and they're like, ""You guys didn't mean that right?"" We're like, ""No, it's happening."" They're like, ""Yeah, but they're has . to be some kind of - this can't be happening you know,'"" she said. 'One of them . wasn't even aware of the promotion. So, when we called them, I think . they just about dropped whatever they were drinking.' According to Frazier, the prices of vehicles purchased during the promotion range from $10,000 to $50,000. In all, however, the dealership wound up paying out more than $300,000. Never forget: Hutcherson Ford VP Michael Tucker says he will never forget Percy Harvin, but will make the promotion an annual event . On Saturday, the dealership is hosting a gathering for the winners so they can take pictures with each other and their new vehicles. As for Percy Harvin, he's won a special place in dealership Vice President Michael Tucker's heart. 'I'll never forget him,' Tucker tells fox2now.com. 'He cost me a lot of money.' Despite losing a boat-load of cash, the dealership says it plans to make this promotion an annual event.","Hutcherson Ford in Missouri promised to refund the price customers the full price of their vehicle if the first or second half of the Super Bowl opened with a kickoff return for a touchdown .

"By . Louise Boyle In Queens, New York . A senior citizens' center told MailOnline today that it has tried to lure a group of troublesome pensioners away from a branch of McDonald's where they have spending sunrise to sunset hogging booths - but that they refuse to leave. President of the Flushing Senior Center Kwang Kim said on Wednesday that he provides coffee and snacks for the senior citizens . from 8.30am to 5pm every day but that 'they don't come'. Staff at the McDonald's franchise in New York are becoming increasingly frustrated with the Korean pensioners who pass hours gossiping at the window-seat tables amid piles of newspapers but buying very little. Some of the gang eat meals at the seniors' center - then head for the golden arches. A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens is battling a group of elderly Koreans whom they say hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little . The McDonald's in Flushing where the elderly patrons have frustrated the restaurant chain by taking up all the seats, often for hours at a time . Many customers bypass the McDonalds because they know there will be no seats . Mr Kim even undercuts McDonald's budget prices by asking just a 25c donation for the refreshments. He . said: 'I think they like it [McDonald's] because it allows them to have . their own chats away from the senior center. It gives them independence . and freedom.' Management . have been forced to call police to move on the ever-evolving group as . they are driving away business. Some customers have asked for refunds . because there is nowhere to sit. Sun Kim, 64, who was enjoying a coffee, fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in McDonald's, told MailOnline that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go. She said: 'It is open so early and stays open until after dark when it's late. It's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together.' The elderly Koreans' allegiance to . the neon-lit branch is especially peculiar because of the other options . available to the chatty seniors. The elderly patrons return to the McDonald's because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient, patrons said today . Flushing Senior Center offers the Korean community breakfast and lunch daily. They have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the McDonald's battle . The Korean . Community Service Center in Flushing also offers breakfast and lunch for the . elderly every day along with language and exercise classes. Mr . Kim said that although he understands that McDonald's must have trade, some seniors told him that the fast-food joint wants them to . drink their coffee in 20 minutes which he thinks is too short a time . period for elderly people. The . president also offered to provide buses for groups of elderly people to . join them at the seniors' center which has locations in Flushing and . Corona. However Sun Kim told MailOnline that the senior center was not open for long enough to suit her and her friends' needs. The battle between the pensioners and McDonald's has escalated over the past few months with the . police receiving four 911 calls since November about the group. A police source said that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems. The McDonald's in Flushing is the popular hang-out spot for some of the elderly Korean community in the area . An elderly customer leaves the branch where employees are becoming frustrated with how many hours the pensioners spend hogging the tables . However the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again. Police . could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and . the restaurant requested, but hope the matter could be worked out before . that stage. It appears that the group of men, and some women, are drawn to the McDonald's on the corner of Parsons and Northern Boulevards, because it offers a convenient meeting spot from their homes. However beyond these reasons, many cannot explain why they love to meet at McDonald's so much. Local people admit they bypass the location - which only has around ten booths and a few counter places - because there are never any seats. Lynn Hall, who was pushing an elderly woman in wheelchair whom she cares for, said they head to a McDonald's further away because it is always so busy. She says: 'Some people sit there all day long and and there's no room for the wheelchair.' Flushing resident Miriam said: 'I think that place must do no business. People go there to read the  newspaper. I go shopping for two, three hours and it's always the same people sitting in the same places when I return.' The elderly people sometimes alternate with a Burger . King nearby on Northern Boulevard which has more space and community . boards inside for customers in English, Chinese and Korean. Jack Bert, who owns the Flushing McDonald's franchise, said in a statement: . 'I'm sure you can imagine any business would find this situation to be . difficult when customers prevent other customers from enjoying the . restaurant. 'We . continue to work to resolve this situation and create an environment so . customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so.'","Staff at the New York branch are becoming increasingly frustrated with the pensioners who are driving away business by spending hours at tables .

"By . Helen Pow . A drug dealer charged in connection with Philip Seymour Hoffman's death has claimed he could have saved the Oscar-winning actor, who had a 'hardcore' 10 bag-a-day heroin habit. In a jailhouse interview on Rikers Island, Robert Vineberg, a jazz musician and fellow junkie, denied selling Hoffman the drugs that killed him, insisting he hadn't seen the star since October or even heard from him since December. 'I could've saved him,' Vineberg told The New York Post. 'If I knew he was in town, I would've said, ""Hey, let's make an AA meeting."" If I was with him, it wouldn't have happened. Not under my guard.' Vineberg said he had known Hoffman for about a year and the pair were friends, getting together to talk about books and art. Charged: Robert Aaron Vineberg, pictured in court on February 5, has claimed he could have saved Philip Seymour Hoffman, who he said had a 10 bag-a-day heroin habit . 'He was a normal guy. You wouldn’t know he was an Oscar winner,' he said. The performer, who has worked with Madonna, Wyclef Jean and the late Amy Winehouse, said he last saw Hoffman in October, when the actor was high at his Mott Street apartment, where police arrested him last week. After that, things seemed to be looking up for the actor. He went on a 28-day rehab stint before flying to Atlanta to shoot the upcoming 'Hunger Games' movie. 'He left me a voicemail in December saying, ""I'm clean,""' he said of their final contact. Hoffman was found dead in his bathroom a week ago with 73 bags of heroin scattered around his West Village apartment. Tragic: Hoffman was found dead in his bathroom a week ago with 73 bags of heroin scattered around his West Village apartment . But Vineberg, 57, denied supplying him with the drugs that killed him. When The Post asked if he had ever sold Hoffman drugs, he refused to answer. He said he was 'devastated' by Hoffman's death and offered his condolences to his family. He suggested his brief stint off the drugs may have made him more susceptible to overdose. 'When you're clean for that long of a time, your body can't take as much,' Vineberg said. 'Your body doesn't have the tolerance.' He added: 'He was a hard-core addict.' He is convinced that Hoffman was injecting 10 bags a day. 'How much was he found with? Seventy bags. You do the math . . . That's a one-week supply,' he said. Apartment: Vineberg said he last saw Hoffman in October, when the actor was high his Mott Street apartment, pictured, where police arrested him last week . Jazz muscician: The performer, pictured, has worked with Madonna, Wyclef Jean and the late Amy Winehouse . NYPD sources told the Post the estimate - about twice that of an average junkie - was about right. Vineberg was also a drug user and the pair battled with their addiction together, he said. Vineberg managed to stay clean for a week at a time between relapses and said he and Hoffman would text back and forth, to keep one another on the straight and narrow. But they fell out of touch late last year. Vineberg was charged with felony drug possession and was one of three people dealers charged in connection with Hoffman's death. A young couple who lived nextdoor to Vineberg's Mott Street apartment, where cops seized some 300 bags of heroin, were charged with misdemeanor cocaine possession. Wearing a gray prison jumpsuit, Vineberg told The Post he's 'a scapegoat' in the case. His attorney insists there is no evidence to suggest Vineberg supplied Hoffman with the deadly narcotics and claims the pair 'were true friends who had bonded over and struggled with the dangerous use of narcotic drugs.'

"By . Emily Hill . A look to dye for: Emma Watson turns heads as she takes her friend's dog Darcy for a walk after the treatment . Picasso had his rose period – and now so too does Emma Watson’s four-legged friend Darcy, after the Harry Potter actress headed out with a friend's dog, who was dyed a shocking shade of bubblegum pink. Thanks to a fashionable £90 treatment, the one-year-old bichon frise now has a look that might go down well  with pink-loving Hogwarts professor Dolores Umbridge – even if it has raised eyebrows among some animal-lovers. Ms Watson was spotted with the pink pooch on the streets of Bethnal Green, East London, on Friday, after Darcy had the dye treatment at Groom Dog City. Owner Stuart Simons said: ‘Pink is our biggest colour, but I do look after another bichon called Casper who comes in for a blue mohican.’ He said the beetroot-based semi-permanent dye is harmless. ‘All the dyes I use are completely animal-friendly. They are made from vegetable dye. 'I wet the dog, rub it on like a shampoo, leave it for five minutes and then wash it off. Because Darcy is white, it takes really well. 'She is a very calm dog, absolutely lovely, and she enjoys her groom.’ But TV vet Emma Milne said: ‘Dogs are not playthings; they are not dolls. If you are putting a chemical on a dog’s fur, you could cause that dog problems. ‘Even if the dye is completely safe – and the dye that Emma Watson has used should be absolutely fine – you are still altering the way the dog looks and smells to other  animals. Potentially, it could have an effect on the way that dog interacts with other dogs. ‘A dog is still a living object that hasn’t had any say on whether it wants to be pink.’ Unsurprisingly, Mr Simons – whose own dyed dogs have featured in campaigns for fashion house Mulberry – disagrees. ‘Lots of people say it’s cruel to dye a dog but I say, it takes no time, it doesn’t affect their skin and they don’t look in the mirror and go, “Oh, I’m so embarrassed.” Before and after: How Darcy looked prior to the treatment (left) and while walking in Bethnal Green, London, on Friday (right) ‘Rather, they get so much attention in public and all the strokes and interaction, it can’t be a bad thing.’ He also believes his salon will see a sharp increase in ‘doggy dyes’ during the Olympics. ‘Oh yes,’ he said. ‘I expect to get a lot of requests for red, white and blue. And I may be able to do the Olympic circles on poodles.’ Ms Watson, 22, later took to her Twitter page to reassure fans that the reason for the canine's bright colour was because her friend was raising money for Breast Cancer care. No shaggy dog story: The Harry Potter actress later took to Twitter to reassure fans that the dog's colour was a charity fundraising bid .

"By . Lydia Warren . Messy: Jamie Beckwith claims her ex, Larry, lied about the worth of his company before their divorce . An interior designer is trying to undo a quick divorce from her wealthy ex-husband because she claims he misled her about the value of his energy company before selling it for millions. Jamie Beckwith, from Franklin, Tennessee, claims her former husband, Larry Beckwith, said his large stake in the ethanol company, Eco-Energy, was worth $15 million - before selling it for $100 million months after their divorce. In a lawsuit, which seeks the divorce to be scrapped and re-drawn, she claims that the move by the father of her three children left her cheated out of millions. She also claims that the divorce was forced through after Mr Beckwith, 52, hand-picked a lawyer for her and illegally paid him a $50,000 bonus to speed up the process, The Tennessean reported. Before the divorce in December 2011, Mr Beckwith owned a majority stake in the biofuel company. After 16 years of marriage, Mrs Beckwith, who was previously a professional singer, was given $6.8 million in the settlement. This was about half of the $15 million Mr Beckwith claimed he had in the company. Payout: Eleven months after the divorce, Mr Beckwith, pictured right with a relative, sold his stake in the ethanol company for seven times the value he had suggested it was worth in the divorce . But she is now claiming this was just a fraction of the company's real worth because, just days after the divorce, its value jumped much higher. According to the lawsuit, he forced through the divorce before December 27, 2011 and just two days later, the U.S. ethanol import tariff was set to expire. It meant that companies in Brazil were eying businesses in the U.S. because the end of the tariff would mean more exports for the country. Eleven months later, he sold his share of the company for $100 million to a Brazilian company. Estate: The couple's seven-bedroom home in Franklin, Tennessee is now on the market for $5.2 million . 'During their sixteen years of marriage, . Mrs. Beckwith was literally kept in the dark concerning Eco-Energy and . had no knowledge of the finances of the business,' the lawsuit alleges. A . recent law school graduate, James Singleton, was hired to assess the . value of the company, but he underestimated its value, the suit claims. The . suit also claims that Mr Beckwith paid $50,000 to both his and his . wife's attorneys to hurry the paperwork; paying lawyers a bonus in this . manner is illegal in divorce cases in Tennessee. Benjamin Papa, who was hired by Mrs Beckwith after her husband suggested him, denied the fee to the Tennessean. The . lawsuit alleges fraud, breach of contract, recklessness and other . charges. She claims that the lawyers' bonuses mean the divorce was . secured following an act of fraud. Home: The couple's 3 children split their time between the home and their father's $3.5 million mansion . Mrs Beckwith, an award-winning interior designer, still lives in the couple's home, which is on the market for $5.2 million, while her husband moved nearby into a home worth $3.5 million. Zillow lists the sprawling former family home, which is in Laurelbrooke, with seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, as well as spas, a pool and a wine cellar. Beckwith's Eco-Energy company, which is based in Cool Springs, is a bio-fuel supply chain company which carries out marketing, trading and distribution of biofuels across the U.S. According to Linkedin, he is now chairman of Beckwith Entertainment Group and LBDB Holdings.","Jamie Beckwith, a singer turned interior designer, and Larry Beckwith, a wealthy energy mogul, divorced in 2011 after 16 years of marriage .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Updated: . 02:31 EST, 29 December 2011 . A Christian couple and their one-year-old son have been shot dead by Muslim gunmen in a 'religious attack' in Nigeria, police said today. The family were in a village near the the city of Jos on Tuesday evening when the killers - believed to be Muslim herdsmen - opened fire. Plateau state spokesman Pam Ayuba said today that assailants shot the Christian couple and their child near their home. The attack just two days after Christmas is the latest in a spate of religious violence in the country. A car burns outside St Theresa Catholic Church at Suleja, Neigeria, after an explosion on Christmas Day. Five bombs exploded that day at churches in the country . In a separate attack, extremists threw a homemade bomb into an . Arabic school in Nigeria's Delta state. Seven people were wounded in the attack, including six children who were younger than nine. The attack at around 10 p.m. on Tuesday . came two days after a series of Christmas Day bombings on churches and . other targets by Islamist militant group Boko Haram claimed around 32 . lives. Boko Haram, which means 'Western education is forbidden', wants the imposition of strict Sharia law in Nigeria. 'Some men driving in a Camri car . threw a low capacity explosive into a building where an Arabic class was . taking place,' police spokesman for the state Charles Muka said by . telephone. 'Children aged between four and nine were taking a lesson. Six children were injured and one adult (was),' he added. Hundreds have died in recent years in . communal attacks and reprisal attacks in the Jos area in the nation's . 'middle belt,' where the largely Muslim north meets the predominantly . Christian south. Around 90,000 people have so far been displaced during the clashes, according to the BBC. Army gunmen and security personnel arrive at the scene of an attack in Jos, where a Christian couple and their one year old baby have been shot dead . An injured women is cared for by hospital staff after she was injured in the car bomb in Madalla, near Abuja, Nigeria, on Christmas Day . Christians in northern Nigeria said . yesterday they feared that a spate of Christmas Day bombings by Islamist . militants could lead to a religious war in Africa's most populous . country. The attacks killed more than two dozen people. The . warning was made by the northern branch of the Christian Association of . Nigeria (CAN), an umbrella organisation comprising various . denominations including Catholics, Protestant and pentecostal churches. The . Boko Haram Islamist sect, which aims to impose sharia Islamic law . across Nigeria, claimed responsibility for the blasts, the second . Christmas in a row it has caused carnage at Christian churches. Saidu Dogo, secretary general for CAN in Nigeria's 19 northern provinces called on Muslim leaders to control their faithful, saying Christians will be forced to defend themselves against further attacks. 'We fear that the situation may degenerate to a religious war and Nigeria may not be able to survive one. Once again, ""enough is enough!"",' Dogo said. The attacks risk reviving tit-for-tat sectarian violence between the mostly Muslim north and the largely Christian south, which has claimed thousands of lives in the past decade. Dogo said the CAN was calling on all Christians to continue respecting the law but to defend themselves when needed. 'We shall henceforth in the midst of these provocations and wanton destruction of innocent lives and property be compelled to make our own efforts and arrangements to protect the lives of innocent Christians and peace-loving citizens of this country,' Dogo said. The most deadly attack killed at least 27 people in the St Theresa Catholic church in Madalla, a town on the edge of the capital Abuja, and devastated surrounding buildings and cars as faithful poured out of the church after Christmas mass. Security forces also blamed the sect for two explosions in the north targeting their facilities. Officials have confirmed 32 people died in the wave of attacks across Nigeria, though local media have put the number higher. But the church bombs are more worrying because they raise fears that Boko Haram is trying to ignite a sectarian civil war in the nearly 160million nation split evenly between Christians and Muslims, who for the most part co-exist in peace. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has come under pressure to do more fight the growing security threat which risks derailing economic gains in the OPEC member and Africa's top oil-producing nation. Nigeria's main opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari, a northerner and former military ruler who lost a presidential election in April to Jonathan, accused the government of incompetence on Monday, saying government was slow to respond and had shown indifference to the bombings. The CAN said in the statement that it was concerned that the perpetrators and their sponsors 'are well-known to government and no serious or decisive actions have been taken to stem their nefarious activities'.","Six children wounded after attackers throw homemade bomb into school in separate attack .

A teenager killed his ex-girlfriend by strangling her and watching his friend stuff a sock down her throat before they tied her body to cinder blocks and dumped it in a river, authorities have said. Je'Michael Malloy, 17, allegedly had help from his 18-year-old friend, Dominic Lock, in the grisly murder of his former girlfriend, Danielle Locklear, 15, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The teenage boys, who appeared in court on Wednesday, were arrested on Tuesday after Malloy allegedly confessed to strangling Danielle and dumping her body.

"By . Associated Press . A ship which sank during a violent storm a century ago has been found largely intact at the bottom of a lake by a group of divers. The Henry B. Smith freighter went down in Lake Superior, Michigan after sailing into the Great Lakes Storm of November 1913. The Duluth News Tribune reported on . Sunday that shipwreck hunters found the boat last month in about 535 . feet of water off the shore of Marquette. Courtesy of Mark Eliason . Secrets of the deep: The 'flying bridge' of a previously undiscovered shipwreck in Lake Superior about 30 miles north of Marquette, Michigan almost 100 years after the boat is believed to have sunk in a huge storm . Watery grave: The SS Henry B. Smith was a steel-hulled, propeller-driven lake freighter which sunk in 1913, killing all 25 crew on board . The group says it hasn't seen the name of the ship on the wreck yet, but all signs indicate it's the Smith, sitting amid a spilled load of iron ore. 'It's the most satisfying find of my shipwreck-hunting career,' said Jerry Eliason, of Cloquet, part of the group that has found many lost ships in recent years. 'It's a fantastic find,' said maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse, of Marquette, who has written about the Smith. 'I'm excited at the opportunity to look at the video and see if we can learn the cause of the wreck, to write the final chapter of the ship.' The Henry B. Smith and its crew of 25 disappeared after sailing into the Great Lakes Storm of 1913. The storm, one of the biggest on the lakes, wrecked more than a dozen ships and killed about 250 sailors. The Smith was safe in the Marquette harbor on November 7 and 8, and loading iron ore, but on the evening of November 9, Captain James Owen decided to leave port for Cleveland. Hidden depths: The shores of Lake Michigan where shipwreck hunters recently found a boat believed to have sank 100 years ago . 'The lake was still rolling, but there seemed to be a lull in the wind, the velocity having dropped to 32 mph,"" shipwreck expert and longtime University of Minnesota Duluth professor Julius Wolff wrote in Lake Superior Shipwrecks. 'The gale ... should have blown itself out. But, this was no conventional storm. In taking his vessel out of the safety of Marquette Harbor, Captain James Owen sailed into eternity.' Sailors on other boats reported seeing Smith deckhands battening down hatches as it went onto the open lake, Stonehouse wrote in his book, Went Missing. Other witnesses watched the ship make a turn to port, as if Owen had decided to head back to shore. Then the Smith vanished - and entered Great Lakes lore as a 'ghost ship'. Calm exterior: The North shore of Lake Superior. The 1913 storm is legendary in the area, wrecking more than a dozen ships and killing 250 sailors . Eliason isn't revealing exactly how his group found the Smith, because he hopes to use the same method to find other wrecks. But he said it wasn't a case of merely running a grid pattern over the lake in hopes of getting lucky. He said the group used a culmination of hunches, research and data to pinpoint a specific search area. The data pointed them toward a possible wreck about 30 miles north of Marquette, and the hunters found the Smith just 20 minutes after dropping a sonar unit into the water. An underwater camera captured enough detail in videos and photos to convince the group that they found the Smith. 'A number of wrecks we've found have been over the span of 20 years searching, multiple times a year,' said Kraig Smith, a member of the hunting group from Rice Lake, Wisconsin. 'Going and finding a wreck 20-some miles offshore in the span of a couple hours is extraordinary.' Fellow hunter Ken Merryman, of Minneapolis, said it appears the ship is broken in the middle but largely intact in the front. The stern has more damage, Merryman said. 'It's a beautiful wreck' with great visibility, he said. 'No zebra mussels; clean.' The crew will return to the site this summer in hopes of getting more questions answered. But the group is already starting to piece together events that led to the Smith's demise. 'It's very clear to me that this one appeared to have broken on the surface, spilled its iron ore contents over the bottom, and then landed on the iron ore,' said Eliason, who had been considering retiring from wreck hunting partly because he wasn't expecting any more significant finds on Lake Superior. 'This was a gift from the lake gods,' Eliason said.","The Henry B. Smith freighter went down in Lake Superior, Michigan after sailing into the Great Lakes Storm in 1913 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A San Francisco Bay Area private all-girl Christian high school has won the ire of parents after an ill conceived decision to put fried chicken, cornbread and watermelon on a Black History Month celebration lunch menu. Officials at Carondelet High in Concord have had to dole out some serious apologies for the debacle, which some students actually first conceived on Friday as a way to celebrate the holiday. But good intentions weren't enough to keep community members angry at the arguably racist menu at bay. Bad idea: A private Christian high school in Northern California has apologized for putting fried chicken, cornbread and watermelon on the menu for a month honoring back history month . 'Chicken, watermelon, collard greens,' University of San Francisco professor James Taylor told KNTV. 'These stereotypes of black Southern culture come from the same place that the N-word comes from.' Apologies: Principal Nancy Libby quickly apologized for the outrageous mistake. 'Please know that at no time at Carondelet do we wish to perpetrate racial stereotypes,' she said . Because of responses like Taylor's that school officials held an assembly Wednesday to discuss the issue. Officials also sent a letter apologizing to parents. Principal Nancy Libby wrote that the items were taken off of the menu and that the last thing the school wanted was to appear in any way racially insensitive. 'I'd like to apologize for the announcement and any hurt this caused students, parents or community members,' Principal Libby wrote in the letter. 'Please know that at no time at Carondelet do we wish to perpetrate racial stereotypes.' According to KNTV, members of the school's black student union approached school officials asking that just the watermelon be taken off the menu. Libby said the entire menu, including the chicken and cornbread, would be nixed. She also said the school plans to hold a racial sensitivity assembly for both faculty and students. Neither Libby nor the school's dean of students would discuss the matter directly with media. Meanwhile, Professor Taylor emphasized just how wrong the school was in ever making the decision. 'This is not like, ""This food represents this heroic moment in African-American experience."" What it represents is the degradation and the stereotyping of African-Americans.'",Bay Area all-girl Christian school Carondelet High apologized for what they reportedly thought would be a way to honor black history .

"By . Alice Smellie . It’s rare to walk into a house and instantly yearn to live there. So it must have been a wrench for Pearl Lowe and Danny Goffey to decide to sell their enchanting Jacobean home. The Old Rectory, on sale for £1.3 million, is just outside Wanstrow in Somerset, fortunately several miles from the flood-hit parts of the county. From each upstairs window is a magnificent view across to green rolling hills. ‘We have lived in Somerset for six years and in the Old Rectory for a year,’ says Pearl, 43. She and Danny,  39 – drummer with Supergrass and, more recently, Babyshambles – want to move somewhere smaller locally and invest in a property abroad. Selling up: Pearl Lowe, 43, is putting her Somerset home. which she shares with husband Danny Goffey and three of her children, on the market for £1.3million . A Lowe-ing home: The Old Rectory has six bedrooms and is located just outside Wanstrow in Somerset . Once a singer in the bands Powder and Lodger, Pearl now has fashion and interiors ranges. She and Danny both work predominantly from home, commuting to London for meetings. Three of their four children live with them – teenagers Frankie and Alfie, and eight-year-old Betty. Pearl’s daughter with singer Gavin Rossdale is 25-year-old model Daisy Lowe. ‘The great thing about Somerset is  that I can drop Betty at school, whizz up to town by train for meetings  and pick her up at the end of school,’ says Pearl. ‘I love the buzz of London, but a quieter family life in the country is wonderful.’ In the 1990s, Pearl and Danny were part of the Primrose Hill Set, the group of actors, musicians and models living in North London who became known for their party lifestyles. But just as members such as Noel Gallagher, Sienna Miller and Jonny Lee Miller now have a settled way of life, so have Pearl and Danny. Room for family: One of the six bedrooms in the Old Rectory, which Pearl and her family are selling to find something smaller . Lowe and behold: The kitchen boasts a blue Aga stove as well as a sizable pantry . Design by Pearl: The Lowe-Goffey family snuggle up on the leopard-skin sofa on chilly evenings to watch television . Swimming in style: Pearl refurbished the Old Rectory, including the baroque-style master en-suite bathroom, which has a roll-top bath . Bohemian: Not satisfied with the family home, Pearl Lowe also renovated a gypsy caravan . With six bedrooms and four bathrooms, there is plenty of space in The Old Rectory for a large family and guests, including Daisy. Before moving in, Pearl spent six months refurbishing from top to bottom. She says: ‘Everything needed replacing – electricity, plumbing, the avocado 1970s bathrooms .  .  .’ Most of the walls are white, with clever touches of colour – in the  high-ceilinged drawing room the window frames are a delicate lilac, and the windows hung with Pearl’s own-design lace curtains. The large kitchen has pastel woodwork and a pale blue Aga warms  the whole room. ‘We had to have  a pantry as Danny loves to cook,’  says Pearl. Beyond the kitchen is a cosy snug where the family watch telly together on chilly evenings. Walking up the wide stairs, you  are faced with a large, light landing with rows of bookcases on either side. ‘This is a great place to sit and read,’ says Pearl. Fashionable family: Pearl with her daughters Betty and Daisy Lowe  at a 2010 fashion show . Her vintage style is evident upstairs. Betty’s bathroom has a pale-blue cast-iron bath, and  the sink is patterned with wild flowers. The master bedroom leads  into probably the coolest (not literally) bathroom in the country. With silver-and-black-lace-patterned wallpaper, grey-black curtains and freestanding bath, it is stunningly opulent. An enormous dressing room is lined with cupboards for Pearl’s clothes. Outside the back door is an enchanting walled courtyard with picnic table and chairs. The rest of the three-acre garden is mostly lawn  and orchard, with a paddock. ‘Betty wants a pony, but we haven’t got round to it,’ says Pearl. A little outhouse constitutes another spare room. This one boasts an  en suite bathroom and would be  ideal for a nanny. To the left of the house is a refurbished barn with a mezzanine, kitchen and bathroom. And in the grounds there’s a traditional gipsy caravan which was renovated  by Pearl. ‘We’ll miss The Old Rectory,’ she says. ‘It’s been a haven from the madness of city life.’ 01749 671172, killens.org.uk .","Pearl Lowe and husband Danny Goffey, 39, are selling their home .

"By . Jaya Narain . The love of horseracing is ingrained in the culture and history of Britain unlike almost anywhere else in the world. But the toll of horses who die or are destroyed on racecourses each year is leading to a wave of public disgust. A race meeting held a fortnight ago saw Hired Hand - a seven-year-old gelding - die at Bangor-on-Dee. Earlier this year the Grand National asked jockeys to slow down to cut the number of injuries and deaths to horses during the historic race . He became the 1,000th horse to die on a racecourse since Animal Aid began their Death Watch in 2007. Animal rights campaigners say the sport is exacting is a dreadful price on the horses that compete in it and are questioning whether it is a price worth paying any longer. They say that while the sport is undoubtedly popular - attracting millions of people each year - punters should be more aware of the suffering it causes the horses. Animal rights campaigners say that while the sport is undoubtedly popular punters should be more aware of the suffering it causes the horses . Dene Stansall, Animal Aid‘s horseracing consultant, said: ‘If horses are to die so that someone can enjoy a bet, punters should be aware of a basic truth. And this is that betting on horses means horses will suffer and die.’ Earlier this year the Grand National made history after jockeys were urged to slow down to cut the number of injuries and deaths to horses during the historic race. The instruction was one of a series of measures introduced after the death of one race favourite, Synchronised, as well as According to Pete, in the 2012 event led to a major outcry from the watching public and animal welfare charities. Animal rights campaigners say the sport is exacting is a dreadful price on the horses that compete in it and are questioning whether it is a price worth paying any longer . And the RSPCA says the horse race has to change if it is going to survive. Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, said the Grand National is on ‘trial.’ He added: ‘I simply don’t think the public will tolerate another National like the ones we’ve had the last few years.’ In the event two horses - Little Josh and Battlefront - died during the three -day meeting at Aintree this year. Animal Aid says 10 horses died or were destroyed on British racecourses in the space of a month this year. 23 July Hired Hand was destroyed after being injured at Bangor-on-Dee; Sunglasses was destroyed after breaking a hind leg at Southwell. 20 July Galaxy Rock was destroyed after falling and being injured at Market Rasen. 16 July Autumn Draw died after a starting stall incident at Kempton. 15 July Bad Girls was destroyed at Newton Abbot after pulling up injured. 4 July Kaolak suffered a fatal heart attack during a race at Perth; at the same meeting Now I Win Again suffered an injury to its foreleg and was destroyed. 28 June Francisca was injured and destroyed at Doncaster. 26 June Cruise Control died after falling at Worcester. 24 June Shesadanser collapsed and died after a race at Thirsk. Around 17,500 horses competed on racecourses in Britain last year while around 6,600 – 38 per cent – are calculated to have participated in jump racing. An estimated 157 horses died as a result of jump racing last year and Animal Aid claims that this equates to a one in 42 chance of a jump horse dying over the course of a year. But the British Horseracing Association fiercely rejected the claims, pointing out that horses were raced several times a year. Animal Aid’s figures show that the Cheltenham racecourse topped the league for the highest number of horses killed since 2007 with 42 animals. It is followed by, Sedgefield on 44, Market Rasen, 40, Newton Abbot, 32, and Aintree with 31. However the true number of deaths is suspected to be significantly higher. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) confirmed in response to a recent parliamentary question that there were 162 more equine fatalities over the past three years than Animal Aid has recorded. But a BHA spokesman said: ‘Racing is a sport that carries risk, and British racing is honest and open about the risks involved. ‘British racing is very proud about the welfare standards which are required in the sport – in which we are considered world leaders – and has nothing to hide.’ Last week Animal Aid wrote to David Heath, minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, calling for the BHA to publish the full data on recorded horse deaths. It said: ‘Given the special place that horses have in British culture, such a national discussion would be very much in the public interest. We urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that all such relevant information is placed in the public domain.’","A race meeting held a fortnight ago saw Hired Hand die at Bangor-on-Dee .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . Harry Martin, a film student, went missing when he went out to take black and white photographs of the coast near his home, his parents believe . A student may have been killed by storms when he went out to take photographs of the scenery, an inquest heard yesterday. Harry Martin, 18, is believed to have gone out to take black and white pictures of the coastline near his home in Membland, Devon on January 3. The former Greenwich University student's naked body was found eight days later in a remote gully near Carswell Cove in the Noss Mayo area of south Devon. Today, the Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon coroner Ian Arrow recorded an open verdict in the case. He concluded that Harry’s death was caused by ‘immersion in water'. During . the inquest, the teenager's family learned that he had suffered a . broken shoulder blade before his death. It is suspected that the injury . was a result of a heavy fall. The coroner said: 'He has fallen heavily and fractured his shoulder and found himself in the sea.' Mr Arrow said Harry, a film student at the London university, was naked when he was found. But the coroner said that it was not possible to determine whether Harry . had removed his own clothes to try and get buoyancy in the water, or . whether the storms had washed them off his body. Harry’s mother Georgina Martin said that her son had bought an old 35mm camera on eBay which she had not been able to find. She . said he was ‘absorbed completely’ with his studies saying: 'I think he . went to go out and experiment with black and white film which to his . generation was a novelty.' Harry was identified by dental records and police said there were no . suspicious circumstances and no third party involvement in his death. A post mortem could not say he drowned but his death may have been caused by ‘his sudden immersion in cold water’. Carswell Cove in Devon. Harry Martin's body was found in a gully near the cove . Harry could either have fallen over and plunged into the water, or washed away from the ground by the stormy seas, the inquest heard. Dan Fellows found Harry’s body on January 11 as he and other colleagues used kayaks to search Carswell Cove. He said he almost overlooked the area by one cove but found legs dangling from a gully after he clambered over rocks. His aunt, Alison Marshall, saw him heading up a hill near his home on . the day he vanished ‘carrying an object in his right hand’. Harry Martin, left, was tragically killed during January storms. His mother Georgina Martin is pictured right after today's inquest. A coroner concluded death by 'immersion in water' She said he ‘waved and grinned’ at her as he walked away on the ‘fine, dry, sunny day’. Mr Arrow said: 'Harry was making the most of the weather conditions.' Another . witness, Susan Lovett, said she saw a young man fitting Harry’s . description standing in a local creek when the tide was out - but . Harry’s family rejected that sighting saying it was in the wrong . direction and that man was not wearing Harry’s clothes. Detective Constable Dan Wojciechowski said all the evidence pointed to ‘Harry’s death being a sad and tragic death’. He said: 'There is no evidence of third party involvement or any suspicious circumstances at all.' The coroner told the inquest that Harry had fallen and ‘subsequently went into the water, or the water 'came up to him’. The . coroner also said he could not answer Mrs Martin's question about whether Harry . would have been conscious from his fall and able to walk to safety. He said that Harry’s face had been deformed by him being washed around by the sea and dashed against the rocks. Mr Arrow commended the actions of the local community who went out searching for Harry for days on end.

She said: 'I had no other female to share the experience with and . ask for help. I had to share a cabin with four men, and use the same . communal showers and toilets as them.

"By . Darren Boyle . Karen Armitage was convicted of wrongly claiming £50,000 of benefits despite living with her civil partner . A lesbian mother-of-one pocketed almost £50,000 in benefits by claiming she was an unemployed single parent despite being in a civil partnership with another woman. Karen Armitage, 42, even tried to claim her partner, Micheala Axall, was actually her mum when the seven-year deception came to light. Armitage was given a suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to two charges of failing to notify a change in circumstance and two charges of making a false statement. Prosecutor Camilla Buck said Armitage made claims for income support, Job Seekers Allowance, unemployment support and housing and council tax benefit dating back to 2000. The court heard the mum-of-one failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions that she had lived with hospital worker Miss Axall from 2005 and that they were in a civil partnership from August 2006. Armitage was arrested after evidence showed the couple had been living together at the semi-detached house in Seacroft, Leeds, West Yorkshire. The prosecutor told Leeds Crown Court: 'She was interviewed in July 2012 and said Miss Axall was her mother.' Armitage later admitted being in a relationship with her but claimed that they did not live together. The court heard Armitage has previous convictions for theft, handing stolen goods and obtaining property by deception. The total amount illegally claimed was £49,409. Defence solicitor Richard Reed said Armitage now accepted that the couple shared bank accounts, Miss Axall supported her and that she should have declared the fact to authorities. Mr Reed saidArmitage had not worked much in the past. He said she was now looking at ways of paying back the money. He added: 'But she is realistic that she may never be able to repay this vast sum.' Benefits cheat Karen Armitage lived with her civil partner Micheala Axall in Seacroft, Leeds, West Yorkshire where semi-detached homes are worth £90,000 . The lawyer said Armitage’s daughter was now in her teens and would suffer if her mother was sent immediately to prison. Mr Reed said his client had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and had expressed remorse for her offending. Judge Rodney Jameson, QC, gave Armitage a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. She was also told to do 200 hours unpaid work and attend a 15-day programme designed to address her offending. The judge said most people in Armitage’s situation should normally expect to go straight to prison. But he added: 'There is no real reason to believe that you will re-offend, or that you are in any way a danger to society as a whole. 'If you can repay, as I am told you are hoping to do, at least some part of this money, that is in the public interest as well as in your own interest.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . Police are asking for the public’s help identifying eight women who stormed a California sun glass store and made off with over $20,000 in merchandise. The March 29 robbery of the Sunglass Hut at Valencia Town Center, in Santa Clarita, was caught on surveillance footage investigators hope will help them to solve the flash mob-style thefts. Footage shows the group, believed to be between the ages of 18 and 25, crowding display cases and stuffing their bags with the eye wear just before 3.00 p.m. They continued to pilfer even as the clerk pleaded with them to stop. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Brazen: The band of thieves walked into the Sunglass Hut just before 3.00 p.m. March 29 . Thieves: The women are then seen each stealing several pairs of sunglasses .

The thieves only left after the worker dialled 911. They then ran out and jumped into a waiting SUV which sped out of the mall, police told CBS Los Angeles. ‘This is a flash mob type of situation, where a large number of people entered the location and quickly cleared out lots of merchandise, and fled” LA County Sheriff’s Deputy Joshua Dubin told the station.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Nabbed: Casey Wentworth is accused of stealing a laptop over a year ago. Police arrested him Monday after a call he made to Apple tech support using the computer's serial number led police to him. But wasn't an overnight success for owner Michael Witonis . A New Hampshire man whose Mac laptop was swiped from his home while he slept in 2013 may soon finally get it back all because the alleged thief called Apple tech support. But the call was made nearly a year ago and it's taken since then for Michael Witonis to convince Apple to give police the dirt they have on suspect Casey Wentworth. Witonis says he finally got them to hand over their records by tweeting at CEO Tim Cook. The Dover mechanical engineer's aggravating saga started in February 2013 when someone came into his home and took his MacBook Air, just months after he'd purchased the pricey computer. He's chalked it up as a loss until a few months later when Apple support emailed him regarding a support call made in regards to a computer with the serial number of the one he'd had stolen. Apple representatives informed him that they could only give their information to police. 'That was the start of an eight-month battle with Apple to get the information from them,' Witonis told ABCNews.com. He requests to have them turn the info over to police were met with scripted responses about an internal procedure they have in place for such issues. But the information stayed put even after Witonis obtained subpoenas. So Witonis decided to take his grievance to Apple's CEO himself via social media. '@tim_cook #feedup with #red-tape in . the #apple legal department. 2 subpoena still no progress. I just want . my stolen #macbook back,' he tweeted at Tim Cook last October. After several months of continued silence, he tweeted again. '@tim_cook . please help! I'm feed up  w/ #apple legal dept. 8 months & 2 . subpoenas later still no progress. I just want my macbook air back,' he . wrote . Scroll down for video . Sluggish: Witonis learned of the suspects tech support call but Apple was not forthcoming with their information that could help nab the suspect . The exasperated Witonis finally decided to tweet his problem at Tim Cook. After two attempts, Apple suddenly went from unhelpful to totally forthcoming. Two hours after the cops got their information, they located the suspect . Witonis won't have his 'beat up' MacBook Air back until it's allowed to leave the evidence room, but he's just happy the suspect's been arrested (FILE) 'Within a day, a guy at Apple executive customer relations called me back,' Witonis told ABC. Five days later, Witonis said the police were getting the necessary information. Then Witonis says that 'within two hours' after police had it, they also had their suspect, Casey Wentworth. Wentworth was arrested Monday and released on $1,000 bail. he's due in court in May. Meanwhile, Witonis has yet to get back the laptop police had described to him as 'pretty beat up.' He'll have to wait until it leaves the evidence locker before he knows exactly how beat up. But Witonis is just happy to have some closure. 'It was sort of shocking,' Witonis told WMUR. 'I guess luck was on our side that the guy who took it didn't try to get rid of it, which was sort of strange. Then, all of a sudden, he decides in his infinite wisdom, ""Well, I'll just call Apple and see if they can help me unlock this thing.""'","Michael Witonis had his MacBook Air swiped while he slept in his Dover, New Hampshire home in February 2013 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Mystery man: 'John Smith' woke up in Oslo in December with no recollection of who he is or where he came from . A man who was discovered in a snowdrift in the Norwegian capital Oslo in December not knowing who he was or how he even got there claims that he was sexually assaulted, robbed – and was the victim of attempted murder. The claim was made as a Czech couple identified him as their son. The mystery man, who calls himself John Smith but does not know his real name, was found with a cocktail of drugs in his system and cuts on his wrist suggesting they had been strapped. He said on Wednesday that he believes he has been the victim of a violent crime. He told AFP: ‘What apparently has happened is that I was robbed, I was for sure sexually assaulted, and then I was thrown onto a street in Oslo. ‘What might have happened is that they took advantage of the fact that Europe has open borders - this amazing European invention - and that they basically used Oslo as a garbage place to dump me.’ He told TV2 that evidence suggests he may have been kept locked up, with his hands tied, for several days without any food or water. ‘I'm afraid,’ he said. ‘It's my opinion they tried to kill me.’ A Czech couple, meanwhile, have stepped forward and declared that they're the parents of the man, who is believed to be 36 years old. He told Norwegian broadcaster TV2 he was excited about the news and it feels like ‘he is about to be rescued from hell.’ Discarded: 'John Smith' said his attackers used Oslo (pictured) as a 'garbage place' to dump him . The couple’s claim tallies to an extent with the man’s initial thoughts that he understands the Czech language best. He also understands Slovak, Polish and Russian and speaks with a heavy Russian accent. Police said they will now seek to confirm the man's identity with DNA comparisons and are also investigating if he has been a crime victim. Czech police said it's still unclear why the man was in Norway.","The man, who is thought to be 36, woke up in Oslo last December .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Italy is selling off its presidential wild boars to be turned into salami and prosciutto. They have lived on the President’s estate at Castelporziano, near Rome, since popes and Roman emperors hunted there centuries ago. But faced with budget cuts, staff have found a novel way to balance the books – by selling off some of the boars each year to a tourist lodge that makes its own cured meats. Wild boars (file picture) are being sold from Italy's president's estate to a hunting lodge that specialises in salami . The sale is set to raise 40,000 euros (£30,000) a year. The boars are to be sold to a hunting lodge in Abruzzo, specialising in wine tasting and processing of sausages, salami and proscitto, current affairs magazine Espresso reported. Last month Italy, still crawling out of its worst recession since the World War II, began selling off its fleet of executive cars. The boars are to be sold to a hunting lodge in Abruzzo, which specialises in producing salami and the sale will raise £30,000 per year . The sale of 1,500 ‘jags’ used by public officials is part of an ambitious programme of cuts announced by new prime minister Matteo Renzi. The spectacular presidential estate, with five kilometres of beach, has for centuries played host to Rome’s elite. It was the playground of the Roman emperors and then the popes. Hunting was banned on the five thousand hectares surrounding the Presidential castle in the 1970s and in 1999 it became a private nature reserve.","The boars have lived on the president's estate near Rome for centuries .

"By . Dan Bloom . A retired Rolls Royce worker has died after he slipped overboard on a Vietnamese holiday boat. British David Wright, who could not swim, may have got up in the night to visit the bathroom when he fell off the boat in the world-famous beauty spot of Ha Long Bay last week. The 63-year-old's body was found the next morning, hours before he was due to fly back to Derby, East Midlands, at the end of the two-week adventure holiday with friends. Paradise: Mr Wright's boat was in the world-famous beauty spot of Ha Long Bay in northern Vietnam (file photo) His friend Judy Lomas, 67, said: 'I . remember David telling me he was so happy that evening. He told me that . this was the best day of his life.' The pair often travelled together and were among a group of European travellers from Britain, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. She said: 'We had been trekking and camping in the northern hills in the run-up to this boat trip, so we were used to being out in the wilds. 'On the night when it happened, we were on the boat and there was a party in the evening. We were out in the bay at anchor and it was lovely. 'At the end of the night we all headed off to our separate cabins and in the morning he just wasn't there.I realised something was wrong when nobody could find him. 'A member of the crew had knocked on his door to tell him breakfast was ready but he was gone. Everyone was searching the boat. His friend Judy Lomas said: 'I don't blame anyone for what happened. It was a tragic accident' (file photo) 'Someone called the police when he was nowhere to be found and within a couple of hours they had located him on the shore nearby. 'I thought maybe he got up in the night to visit the bathroom but lost his footing on the deck. Maybe he just slipped and fell. David couldn't swim. 'I wondered if he was sleep-walking and at the end of the deck it was open. He could have fallen from there.I don't blame anyone for what happened. It was simply a tragic accident.' Mr Wright, a keen photographer who also worked for the train manufacturer Bombardier, retired aged 58 to travel the world. His destinations included Armenia, Slovenia and India and in 2012 he visited the Everest Base Camp, which is higher than many mountains at 16,900ft above sea level.

"By . Darren Boyle . A former primary school teacher hanged herself after her 'meticulous' and 'perfectionist' nature left her struggling to cope with both work and her family life, an inquest heard. Nicola Worrall, 32, was so conscientious she quit her job after putting herself under undue stress due to the pressures of her workload. Her mental state then worsened after she had a baby with her husband David and her life 'spiralled out of control' when the couple split up and the boy went to live with his father. Former primary school teacher Nicola Worrall made detailed handwritten notes on how to hang herself shortly before she took her own life . Ms Worrall had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was receiving treatment for her condition at the time of her death. Her body was found at her home in Poutlon le Flyde, Lancashire by her father Graham Lawton and his partner Lorraine. Nicola Worrall resigned her job as a primary school teacher because she struggled to cope with the pressure . An inquest at Fleetwood was told Lancaster University educated Ms Worrall had suffered with anorexia following her mother’s death when she was 13 which she had 'taken quite deeply'. After graduating, she trained to be a teacher and got a job as a primary school but left and later got a promotions job within the NHS. Mr Lawton told the hearing: 'She was very close to her mother probably closer than she was to me. She probably hid it quite well really but it did affect her quite deeply. She suffered from anorexia probably partly caused by that. 'She was a very meticulous girl and if anything, overprepared. She was very good at what she did and the school started to put more onus on her because she was capable of it. In the end she couldn’t cope with the additional pressure. 'I knew Nicola was very, very keen to be a mother. It’s fair to say that we weren’t totally convinced it was a wise decision probably because of her mental health and putting more pressure on herself.' The couple went on to have a little boy but almost immediately after his birth she became unwell again. She was admitted to the Wythenshawe Specialist Mother and Baby Unit where she remained for around eight weeks. Ms Worrall split from her husband David soon after giving birth to their son because of her illness . Mr Lawton told the inquest he and his son-in-law visited Mrs Worrall virtually every day. But the couple later split and their son lived with David and and following a change in medication she was admitted to Parkwood Mental Health Unit at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. Mr Lawton told the inquest his daughter’s mental health was 'fluctuating' but she was discharged under his care to live with him. She then moved into a flat by herself just half a mile away from her father. He added: 'Very occasionally, sometimes she would be very low but we thought we could convince her there was still a positive future for her. She didn’t give any indication that she would take her life, it wasn’t of any great concern. 'It was one of the things that was in the back of your mind but not an immediate threat.' Bipolar disorder was previously known as manic depression and can cause extreme mood swings. Approximately one person in one hundred is at risk of developing the condition. Sufferers can experience episodes of deep depression followed by intense mania. The condition's symptoms depend on whether the patient is suffering depression or experiencing mania. Often these episodes can last for several weeks or longer. In many cases a patient may only feel 'normal' for very short periods. It is very important for someone at risk of bipolar disorder to get a correct diagnosis as patients during depressive episodes may decide, like Nicola Worrell (right) to take their own life. Often a patient will be diagnosed with clinical depression first before doctors identify the manic element of the illness. Anyone experiencing symptoms of depression and are considering harming themselves should contact their GP immediately or the Samaritans. During manic episodes a patient may feel very happy and can even go on spending sprees on goods that they do not need. The mania can also prevent a patient from eating or sleeping properly. There are a range of treatment options available for sufferers including long-term medication to counter the mood swings. Also patients can learn how to identify early warning signs of either depression or mania and seek appropriate help in time. Some patients also benefit from psychological treatment and therapy to counter depression. Also, regular exercise is thought to help with the symptoms. Source: NHS Direct . The hearing was told Ms Worrall had returned to work due after her condition improved but this soon changed. Community psychiatric nurse Wendy O’Connell said: 'She was enjoying being back at work and she was glad that she was achieving things again. initially when she went back to work she was coping. 'I was on leave just prior to her death and her mood fluctuated again and she started to have worries about work, feeling that she wasn’t doing her job properly and she was actually on sick leave. 'Work had noticed changes, first she was aiming high and then struggling. With Nicola being so conscientious, we had done some triggers for her to look out for.'She added: 'Nicola was a bit of an open book in respect of the way she looked, she looked very worried all the time almost like a rabbit caught in headlights, she had that look about her. 'I think like her dad said, it was always in the back of your mind the possibility that it would come to this and we were putting everything in place. 'But she always said to me that she would never do anything to harm herself because she would never do that to her dad and family.' Mrs O’Connell said that Ms Worrall had a planned appointment with the team on Wednesday,  December 11 last year yet received a phone call from a worried colleague who hadn’t been able to contact her. She then contacted Mrs Worrall’s dad and she, together with his partner, Lorraine, entered Nicola’s flat where they found her body. A note addressed to 'Dad and Lorraine' was found as well as an A4 notepad open on her bed with detailed handwritten notes about how to hang herself. Coroner Alan Wilson concluded Mrs Worrall took her own life and said: 'Clearly Nicola has had a troubled life as far as her health was concerned, starting I’m sure with the death of her mother when she was only 13. 'She started a career in teaching but appears to have struggled to cope and eventually left that and went into the health service. 'She met and married David and they had a child but the relationship deteriorated. She was a perfectionist and conscientious, maybe she was hoping to get by on her own steam. 'There became a time when she broke down, her child had been placed with his father..Things were spiralling downwards it would seem, until she was found at the flat. 'While it clearly came as a shock it was not the greatest surprise.'

"By . James  Nye . The last sighting of State Department diplomat William Bradford Bishop was on March 2, 1976 - one day after police say he brutally bludgeoned his wife, three sons and his mother to death in their Potomac, Maryland home. The bodies of wife, Annette, his mother Lobelia and his three boys, 4-year-old Brad, 10-year-old Brenton and 5-year-old Geoffrey were discovered burning in a shallow grave the same day in South Carolina. Despite pictures of the multi-lingual Yale graduate being plastered across the nations television screens and newspapers the fugitive seemingly vanished into thin air. Today the FBI added Bishop, who was dubbed the 'Family Annihilator', to its top 10 most wanted list - in the hope that nearly four decades later the extra publicity will finally bring about his capture. Scroll Down for Video . Then and now: The FBI has released this model of what they believe William Bradford Bishop (left) in the 1970s would look like now as they added him to their Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Thursday . Family Annihilator: Police believe Bishop used a sledgehammer to murder his wife, Annette, his mother and his three boys, 14-year-old Brad, 10-year-old Brenton and 5-year-old Geoffrey, back in 1976 . 'It's getting late in the day for him,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Steve Vogt told NBC Washington. 'He's 77, but we're going to put it out there and give it our best shot.' Savage: Bishop's mother Lobelia (pictured) was also battered to death with a hammer after she returned home from walking the dog on March 2, 1976 . Investigators believe that the well educated State Department officer who is fluent in five languages could have forged his own passport and over the years there have been a number of unconfirmed sightings in Europe. Indeed, they believe that Bishop is still alive and could be living in plain sight, having altered his appearance since the death of his entire family. 'His wallet has never been found. His passport has never been found,' Vogt said. 'There's no indication that he's dead.' Police strongly suspect that on March 1, Bishop used a hammer to beat his mother and wife to death inside their home and then battered his three sons while they were sleeping. Montgomery County Sheriff Darren Popkin, who has been working the case for twenty years believes that Bishop killed his wife first as she was reading. Then he callously killed his three young sons in their bedrooms before murdering his own mother as she returned home after walking the family dog, Leo. Authorities say Bishop, a former Foreign Service officer, wrote of wanting a 'freer life' before the killings. 'He went from room to room,' said Popkin. 'And one at a time hit them around the head and killed each one of them.' Scene: William Bradford ""Brad"" Bishop Jr., a State Department employee at the time, allegedly bludgeoned his family to death in their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and then drove to a wooded area in North Carolina, where authorities say he dumped their bodies in a shallow grave and burned them . Beloved pet: The only member of the Bishop family who seems to have been spared was the family dog, Leo (pictured) 'There was an awful lot of rage,' Popkin said. Bishop 'went from room to room with such anger and rage, it was just a terrible crime scene.' Bishop then allegedly put the bodies inside the back of his maroon 1974 Chevrolet station wagon and drove six hours to North Carolina. 'A park ranger saw fire burning and immediately went to see what was going on. What he found was just absolutely grizzly. The discovery of five bodies in a shallow grave that was burning,' said Popkin to NBC Washington. A grand jury indicted him on five counts of murder, but in the 38-years since, Bishop has not been apprehended - disappearing along with his dog. 'When Bishop took off in 1976, there was no social media, no 24-hour news cycle,' said Steve . 'The only way to catch this guy is through the public.' Brutal: In March 1976, Bishop allegedly used a hammer to bludgeon his family, including his three boys ages 5, 10 and 14 . Horrific: Investigators believe he then set fire to the bodies in a shallow grave in North Carolina using the gas he bought (pictured) Evidence: This is the shovel that Bishop allegedly used in 1976 to bury his family in a shallow grave . The FBI, along with the police and sheriff's departments of Montgomery County, Maryland, and the U.S. Department of State formed a task force last year to reinvestigate the Bishop case. As part of that effort, a forensic artist created a three-dimensional, age-enhanced bust of what Bishop may look like now, at 77 years old. 'If Bishop is living with a new identity, he's got to be somebody's next-door neighbor,' Vogt said. 'Don't forget that five people were murdered. Bishop needs to be held accountable for that.' A reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading directly to Bishop's arrest, the FBI said. Bishop's final few hours that authorities can account for began in the afternoon of March 1, 1976, when he left work early, telling his boss he was coming down with the flu. Maroon Chevrolet: Bishop allegedly wrapped his family in sheets and transported them in this station wagon . He withdrew $400 from his bank and instead of driving home went to Sears at Montgomery Mall and bought a gas can and a hammer. From there he went to Potomac Village to purchase a shovel and a pitchfork. He was last seen at a Jacksonville, North Carolina, sporting goods store, where he bought a pair of sneakers, the FBI said. He then allegedly killed his entire family before wrapping their bodies in sheets and driving them to Columbia, North Carolina. It took authorities in North Carolina a seven days to identify the bodies after using dental records and clothing descriptions. In discussing what Bishop would look like now, NBC Washington spoke to the FBI, who said that his most distinguising feature is his pointed chin. Do you recognize this man?: The former U.S. Department of State employee, William Bradford Bishop Jr., has been on the run since 1976 and could be hiding in plain sight, the FBI said . The FBI, along with the police and sheriff's . departments of Montgomery County, Maryland, and the U.S. Department of . State formed a task force last year to reinvestigate the Bishop case. As . part of that effort, a forensic artist created a three-dimensional, . age-enhanced bust of what Bishop may look like now, at 77 years old . The FBI also revealed that hs has a curl to his upper right lip and a scar on his back from surgery. Vogt said, 'I would expect him to still be in fairly good shape, based on his activities and what he enjoyed doing.' Investigators describe him as being adventurous and a lover of outdoor sports such as skiing and hiking. He has a military background - which could enable him to live off the land as self-sufficient. The FBI also pointed out that they have never found the body of Bishop's dog, Leo. 'People brought it up over and over that he loved his dog,' Vogt said. 'He took his dog with him. That's the only creature that survived in that house.' Bishop also had a pilots license and was able to speak, Italian, French, German and Croatian. Other skills he possessed, which adds fuel to theory he may have left the United States, were that of making passports. 'There's a certain potential that he could be overseas,' Matus said. 'He was certainly trained for that. He was certainly educated enough to pass off as a diplomat.' There hasn't been a confirmed sighting of Bishop since 1976, in Jacksonville, N.C., although three people who knew him have reported spotting him in Europe over the years, most recently in 1994. Horror: 'There was an awful lot of rage,Â¿ police said of the scene inside the house. Bishop 'went from room to room with such anger and rage, it was just a terrible crime scene' 'Brad, you've been living with this on your conscience now for 38 years,' Montgomery County, Maryland, Sheriff Darren Popkin said. 'I am the voice of your family who can no longer speak. The time is now to contact law enforcement.' People on the FBI's most wanted list have included Osama Bin Laden, Boston organized crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger and James Earl Ray, who assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The list was founded in 1950, and more than 90 percent of the 501 people placed on the list have been found. The FBI, the State Department and local police established a task force last year to review the Bishop case, and authorities hope that by placing him on the list, the public might be able to help find him. 'Bishop broke with his life and assumed a new identity. Because of that fact, most traditional fugitive investigative techniques are worthless,' said Steve Vogt, special agent in charge of the FBI Baltimore Division. 'We're hoping media and people who are active on social media pay attention to this; they'll be the ones to solve this case.' Bishop replaces alleged MS-13 gang member Juan Elias Garcia on the most-wanted list. Garcia, who's charged in the execution-style murders of a 19-year-old woman and her 2-year-old son, surrendered in late March, just two days after he was placed on the list.","William Bradford Bishop has not been seen since March 2, 1976 .

"By . Sam Webb . Changing nightwear: Many UK men now spurn pyjamas, saying they are for children. File picture . Pyjamas have fallen out of fashion because many adults have stopped wearing anything at all in bed, according to researchers. One in four Britons do not own pyjamas or nightwear of any kind. This is the highest proportion for any country in Europe, a study found. Men think pyjamas are for children and should be kept out of the bedroom while women are five times more likely to own a pair than their partners. The Europe-wide study by Ipsos for cotton trademark Cotton USA asked 5,000 people aged 15 to 54 about their clothes shopping habits. Italians are twice as likely as Britons to wear pyjamas in bed. Only Germans have shown a similar trend to the UK for opting to sleep in  the nude. Stephanie Thiers-Ratcliffe, of Cotton USA, said: ‘Since 2012 we have seen a rise in the number of people who do not own any pyjamas – one reason for this could be the growing popularity of loungewear.’ One of those sticking with tradition is Prime Minister David Cameron who has admitted to wearing pyjamas, even while working in the mornings. The research found the average Briton owns 18 pairs of underwear, 17 pairs of socks, 14 t-shirts and three pairs of shorts – but only one suit. The survey also discovered that Italian women own the most bras –12 – while Germans have the highest number of socks at 24 pairs, plus 23 lots of underwear. British women typically own nine bras, nine dresses and six skirts. The study revealed the average Briton owns a single suit, meaning we wear that outfit to all occasions, from job interviews to weddings and funerals. Fashion conscious Italians have the most suits, at three on average. Miss Thiers-Ratcliffe said: ‘An interesting finding is that Brits only own 1.4 suits these days, which they will wear to every kind of formal occasion. ‘The fact the number of shorts in the nation’s wardrobes has fallen too shows it’s been a while since the country enjoyed a decent sunny summer.’ Research also showed that six out of  ten Britons donate their unused clothing to charity.","Men think pyjamas are for children but women still opt for nightwear .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A pensioner has been told that he must cut back a tree in his council property or he may face eviction - despite the fact that it was already there when he moved in. Widower Brian Smithers, 73, has lived in his house in New Malden, south-east London for 30 years. He lost his wife two years ago. Now, he has been told by the council that he should 'consider moving to a property without a garden'. Widower Brian Smithers, who lives in New Malden, has been told that he needs to maintain the tree or he could face eviction . Kingston council, which manages the property, has said that Mr Smithers must maintain the tree or find another home. A letter from the council’s housing management team read: 'You must pay urgent attention to these matters now. 'If . you are unable to manage the gardens and find it too much, perhaps you . might consider moving to a property without a garden so you no longer . have this burden. 'If the . tree has not been dealt with and the garden at the rear and front cut . down so that it is tidy and well cared for as it should be, then I will . have no other option but to serve you with a notice of seeking . possession and you might lose your home as a result.' Mr Smithers said: 'They want me to chop it down but I said no because it’s their tree. They are trying to evict me. I am a pensioner. 'The tree was here when I moved in. It . is leaning quite badly and the roots look like a lot of snakes but they . want me to pay for it. But it is their tree they have got to deal with . it.' Local councillor Terry Paton said he was 'horrified' by the letter. He said: 'I think we should be looking to help someone so vulnerable rather than threatening them. Local councillor Terry Malden said he was 'horrified'. He added: 'I think we should be looking to help someone so vulnerable rather than threatening them' 'The poor guy has just lost his wife and does not need to be treated like that. I feel a lot of sympathy.' A Kingston Council spokesman said the council had acted on complaints from neighbours. He added that part of Mr Smither's tenancy agreement was to keep the garden in order. The council spokesman added: 'We are concerned that Mr Smithers, an elderly tenant, may be finding managing the gardens which are his responsibility too much of a burden. 'We will deal with the tree, and we are trying to discuss with Mr Smithers the possibility of him moving to a home without gardens to look after. 'He wasn’t at home last week when a housing officer called for an arranged appointment.' Mr Smithers has now received support from others through social media. One person said: 'If his neighbours feel strongly about it, why don’t they help the old guy, I am sure someone has a saw and a ladder, I would go and do it for him if I knew where he was.'","Brian Smithers told to maintain tree following neighbours' complaints .

"By . Julian Robinson . A rare eagle born as part of a breeding programme has grown into one of Britain’s biggest birds thanks to her daily diet - of fish and chips. The massive bird called ‘Inowashi’ - Japanese for ‘big eagle’ - was hatched in the UK as a small chick five years ago. Inowashi was one of the first Steller’s sea eagles to be bred in captivity in Britain as part of a scheme to swell the birds’ numbers. Eagle-eyed: Inowashi the Steller'­s sea eagle and her owner Charlie Heap exchange a glance at The International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire. The bird, which has an 8ft wingspan, enjoys a daily portion of fish from Scott's fish and chip shop in Helmsley and has become one of the biggest in Britain . A proper beak full: Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle gulps down a generous helping of fried fish which owner Charlie Heap says has helped the bird grow into one of Britain's biggest birds . Any more? Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle spreads its huge wings as it surveys a fish and chip box - its owners have even supplied salt and vinegar for the all round chip shop experience. The huge bird has become one of Britain's biggest and is being looked after at the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, in Helmsley, North Yorkshire . But the beautiful creature has since grown into a 14lbs whopper with an 8ft wingspan thanks to her daily fish supper. Inowashi eats fish and chips seven days a week at International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire. The super-fit bird likes the meal so much her keepers have been forced to get a regular supply every day from local chippy Scotts. Inowashi the Steller's Sea Eagle enjoys her daily fish from Scott's fish and chip shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. The massive bird, with a wingspan of 8ft, takes her treat from the hands of owner Charlie Heap at the International Centre for Birds of Prey in Duncombe Park, Helmsley . Just look at me now: Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle perches on the corner of a picnic table after her feast of fried fish, which she has daily from Scott's fish and chip shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. And right, this is how she used to look as a tiny chick five years ago. She is being looked after by Charlie Heap at the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire . Charlie Heap, who runs the bird of prey centre, said: 'We are just around the corner from Scotts so thought I would be cheeky and ask if they might consider donating fish to us on a regular basis. 'With an estimated 5,000 pairs in the world, Steller’s sea eagles are very rare, therefore we have to look after Inowashi very carefully indeed. 'She is a fussy eater, but she can’t get enough of the fish that the shop supply. Inowashi is now probably the best fed Steller’s sea eagle in the world.' The bird has been at the International Centre for Birds of Prey since it opened last year, and takes part in thrice-daily flying displays. Steller’s Sea-eagle is the biggest bird in the genus Haliaeetus and is one of the largest raptors overall. Tony . Webster, who owns Scotts, of Helmsley, said: 'We are delighted to help . Charlie by supplying the centre with fish we can’t use. Scott's fish and chip shop, in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, has been doing a roaring trade thanks to Inowashi the Steller's sea eagle's appetite for the traditional British supper. The eagle, which has a massive 8ft wingspan, has become one of Britain's biggest and is one of the rarest species in the world . A bit peckish: Inowashi the eagle settles in to her favourite daily meal of fried fish from the local fish and chip shop in Helmsley, North Yorkshire. its huge yellow beak is primed to snap up some tasty scraps from the box at its home in the International Centre for Birds of Prey in Duncombe Park. Don't bite the hand that feeds you: Inowashi the eagle dives in to a portion of fish and chips as she grips her fearsome talons around owner Charlie Heap's glove. The bird is one of the biggest in Britain and its species one of the rarest in the world . Charlie Heap and his huge eagle Inowashi sit side by side after enjoying some fish and chips together. The Steller's sea eagle, now one of the biggest in Britain, enjoys nothing better than the traditional English meal at his home in the International Centre for Birds of Prey at Duncombe Park in Helmsley, North Yorkshire . 'Whilst every chippy says they are ‘frying tonight’, we can boast that we are ‘flying’ every night too. 'Inowashi has now become our most regular customer. You can tell she loves the fish because she never leaves any scraps.' Scotts has been presented with the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF) Fish and Chip Quality Award - putting them in the top 2.5 per cent of chippy in the country. The Steller’s Sea Eagle - Haliaeetus pelagicus - is a large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is an eagle that lives in coastal northeastern Asia and mainly preys on fish and water birds. On average, it is the heaviest eagle in the world, at about 5 to 9 kilograms (11 to 20 lb). Dig in: Inowashi takes a large chunk of fish from a box of her favourite food, supplied by a local chip shop.

"By . Tamara Cohen In Jerusalem . Ed Miliband was 'deeply moved' by a surprise meeting yesterday with the son of a woman who hid out with his own relatives during the Second World War. The Labour leader was approached by Mendel Mandelbaum just before speaking to students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was shocked to hear Mr Mandelbaum's mother was sheltered by the same family - in a tiny Belgian village - as his own aunt and grandmother. Labour leader Ed Miliband is shown around the Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem in Jerusalem . Mr Miliband, joined by wife Justine, lay a wreath at the Hall of Remembrance at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial . In all 17 of his relatives on his father's side, who were hidden there, survived Nazi persecution. Mr Mandelbaum went to the university - where his son Jonathan works - to meet the Labour leader after hearing about the connection the night before. He and his wife Justine then paid an emotional trip to Yad Vashem, the holocaust museum in Jerusalem, and laid a wreath to commemorate the dead. Mr Miliband's father Ralph, then 16, and his father Samuel, fled their home in Brussels and got the last boat to England from Ostend when the Germans invaded in 1940. But his mother RenÃ©e and younger sister  Anne-Marie, then 12, stayed behind, and when they feared imminent deportation to a concentration camp, fled to the village of  Montignies-lez-Lens. Mr Miliband rekindled the Eternal flame at the Hall of Remembrance as part of his visit to the memorial . Mr Miliband's father Ralph, then 16, and his father Samuel, fled their home in Brussels and got the last boat to England from Ostend when the Germans invaded in 1940 . Mr Miliband praised the 'incredible courage' of the Vos family of Catholic farmers, who hid them until the end of the war. 'Eventually they sheltered 17 members of my family and also sheltered this blokeâ€™s family. It shows how this country is bound up with stories of dislocation, refugees, grief and loss' he said. He told how his grandmother was forced to flee Brussels in the summer of 1942, after she was taken to the city's Gestapo headquarters where the Germans had intercepted a letter from her son that revealed details about his escape to England. She was questioned for four hours but told them nothing, before being released. The Milibands also met children at the 'Blue Box Recreation Centre' in Sderot near the border with Israel and the Gaza Strip . The centre is fortified to withstand rocket attacks from Gaza who having been firing Qassam missiles for the past 13 years on the Israeli border town making it unsafe for children to play outside . Mr Miliband said: 'The Gestapo called in my grandmother and, extraordinarily, let her go, at which point she thought it was time to leave. 'She used to sell hats at a market and knew a woman who was a farmer who sold eggs. They had gone to visit them one summer. Somehow there was a communication and they said come join us.' The family was eventually re-united after the war in London - but 43 members of his wider family did not survive. During his visit to the museum, part of a two day tour of Israel and the West Bank, and his first major trip as Leader of the Opposition, he said: 'It is a reminder of the terrible loss that my family suffered, the loss of so many Jews around the world to the Nazis and the people who showed incredible courage to save lives and save Jews.'","Labour leader makes an emotional visit to Israel with his wife Justine .

"By . Ben Spencer . Butterfly numbers have nearly halved in the last four decades – despite last year’s sizzling summer, say conservationists. The insects, which thrive in warm and sunny conditions, are still recovering from an onslaught of washout summers. The wet summer of 2012 was the worst on record for butterflies –with some rare species in certain parts of Britain being wiped out. Butterfly numbers have nearly halved in the last four decades, but last . year's hot summer was excellent for the insects with numbers up . significantly. Among those breeds seeing a resurgence is the Clouded . Yellow (top) Small tortoiseshell butterflies are among the breeds that saw an increase last year, their population rising 278 per cent . Last year’s hot weather was excellent for the insects, with numbers up significantly compared to 2012, according to the UK  Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. But despite the 2013 boost, numbers were still at a worrying 53 per cent of the population in 1976 – well below average. Dr Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, which led the survey, said there was still a long way to go before butterflies returned to their former glories. He said: ‘We had successive bad summers from 2007 to 2012, it was terrible. Last summer was better and there was a real bounce back, but we need another good spring and summer for them to breed successfully.’ Dr Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation, which led the survey, said there is still a long way to go before butterflies returned to their former glories . Some 46 of the 56 species in the Monitoring Scheme in 2013 saw numbers increase. Rare species such as the Lulworth skipper were up 162 per cent compared with 2012, and the critically endangered high brown fritillary by 133 per cent. Common species also saw a revival – the small, large and green-veined whites bounced back from their worst year on record in 2012 to above average numbers in 2013. The small tortoiseshell had its best year in a decade and migrants such as clouded yellow butterflies from the Continent also increased.","Butterfly numbers have nearly halved in the last four decades .

"By . Dan Bloom . Four daughters are in a stand-off with a Catholic cemetery which refused to have their mother's year of death put on the family headstone - because her ashes are not buried under it. Rita Sztukowski died aged 82 last April and her family had her cremated, splitting the remains among her children and grandchildren and placing them in jewellery. But when they asked to complete the family stone they have had since 1955 at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Cudahy, Wisconsin - which already bore her name and year of birth - the director refused. Unholy row: The family of Rita Sztukowski (right and left with her daughter Shelley Blackwood) cannot engrave the year of her death into a headstone on the Catholic family plot because her ashes were not buried under it . No closure: The headstone on the family plot which has existed since 1955, where Rita Sztukowski was supposed to be memorialised next to her husband, Norbert. Her daughter Shelley called the spat 'ridiculous' Instead of the year 2013 engraved next to the details of several other relatives, including her husband Norbert's, there is a large white space. The cemetery's boss told them it was against tradition to recognise a burial unless all the remains are buried together in the plot. Shelley Blackwood, 48 - one of Rita's four daughters - told MailOnline: 'We don't want her to be in the cold ground. It's hard for us because we live all across the U.S. and we just want her close to us.' Mrs Blackwood, who lives 500 miles away in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, added: 'My sisters and I aren't Catholic any more and we don't know the rules of the church. 'But my mother said ""throw me in the tomatoes - maybe I'll be good for the garden.' She wouldn't have cared. 'We had the funeral for her last May so this has gone on for almost a year. The way he has handled this is ridiculous. Paying tribute: Daughters Pam, Sue, Holly and Shelley at the headstone last year after their mother's cremation . Argument: How the headstone looks now. The incomplete section for Rita can be seen bottom right . 'The cemetery is very special to us and it's where our father used to take us as a place of peace, so going there and seeing those numbers missing makes it very hard to grieve.' The daughters' original plan was to bury the ashes as the 26,000-plot cemetery would have wanted, but they changed their minds. To help ease the row they engraved 'In cherished memory' above the name, but were still not allowed to complete the work, they said. Their family plot is home to the remains of five relatives, including Rita's husband Norbert, his parents and two others. Butch Miller, the cemetery's director, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'If you let this go, then what's next? ""Oh, I want to have a statue of Satan on the cemetery grounds. I want . the crucifix upside down. I want the Virgin Mary with a dagger in her . womb."" What's next? Row: The strictly Catholic Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Cuhady, Wisconsin, has around 26,000 plots . He added: 'Our policy is on Christian burial beliefs, and when we have a person who has been cremated and they wish to have those cremated remains whole and buried at our cemetery, that is the only way we'll recognise.' Cremation has long been controversial among Catholics, who see the body as a temple of the human spirit which should not be destroyed after death. Early Christians associated burning a body with paganism, and until recently it was banned completely by the Catholic Church. The Vatican lifted its all-out ban on cremations in 1963 and from 1997, cremated remains were given the same respect as remains in a casket at funerals. However, the church still forbids scattering ashes or keeping them separate or at home.","Rita Sztukowski died in April last year at the age of 82 and was cremated .

The child – named by neighbours as Zane Gbangbola – and his father, Kye Gbangbola, 48, were discovered during a rescue in Chertsey, Surrey, yesterday. It is understood that Zane’s mother, identified as Nicole Lawler, 36, was also taken to the nearby St Peter’s Hospital, but did not require treatment. Scroll for video .

The boy's mother was also checked over by hospital staff but did not need treatment . A further 15 people, including a number of police officers, also underwent medical checks after complaining . of feeling unwell. Officers appealed to anyone in the area showing ‘signs of . vomiting, diarrhoea and fever’ to seek immediate help. Wale Gbangbola, Kye's brother, said last night: 'Zane was a very intelligent boy who was cheerful and energetic.' Local resident Anoop Hothi said he found out about the tragedy through his neighbours. ‘I’ve been in shock all day about little Zane,’ he said. ‘He was a lovely little boy, a really good boy, a delightful person.’ Zane . was a pupil at St George’s Junior School in Weybridge, Surrey.

Headteacher Antony Hudson has emailed parents asking them to explain to . their children what had happened to the youngster, a keen taekwondo student, and to ‘keep him in your prayers’. Elizabeth Anionwu, the co-founder of . the Sickle Cell society, of which Mr Gbangola was chairman told The . Sunday Times: 'He is a wonderful family man and a wonderful father.' Mr Gbangold runs an eco-management consultancy firm called Total Eco Management, with his partner Miss Lawler.

'Police officers are currently with them and we will continue to offer our support during this difficult time . 'Our aim is to keep people safe and find out the cause. 'I would like to reassure local residents our officers are working closely with partner agencies and a full and thorough investigation is currently under way to determine the circumstances around this tragic incident. 'We are currently following various lines of inquiry and it would be wrong to speculate on the cause of death at this stage. 'The cause of the illness is currently unknown but what I can confirm is that the people who were taken ill are from a very localised area. ‘We . cannot rule out a link to flooding in the area and while the . investigation is ongoing, local residents should follow sensible . precautions.’ Police have cordoned off several houses while they investigate what caused the boy's death (pictured) Another shot of the family home shows the severity of the flooding. The Thames burst its banks on Saturday, prompting the Environment Agency to warn of flooding in the area . The . tragedy came as the Met Office described the storms of the past few . weeks as the worst in 248 years.

"By . Gareth Rose And Daniel Martin . Scottish First Minister Alex Salomd has been accused of 'trying to cover up' expenses . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has been accused of covering up a £3,000 expenses claim that paid for a four-night stay at a top Chicago hotel. The five-star Peninsula Hotel has confirmed that the First Minister booked one of its grand deluxe suites when he visited the city to promote Scottish independence. The ‘Team Scotland’ delegation were there to make a handful of speeches during the time of the Ryder Cup in 2012, but the majority stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah course, which charges £60 for a room. However Mr Salmond and his wife Moira chose a suite at the Peninsula – which is popular with such celebrities as Beyonce and Brad Pitt – even though it was much further away. He has consistently refused Freedom of Information requests to reveal how much he spent at the public’s expense, dismissing criticism of the trip as ‘ridiculous frippery’. And Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon even claimed that she was ‘flabbergasted’ to be asked about the bill during a debate last week. But last night, after the hotel revealed how much he paid to stay at the luxury suite, Mr Salmond was facing new calls to ‘come clean’ about his use of public funds. His suite usually costs guests at least £1,164 per night. Civil servants managed to get the room for $1,194 per night – £740 using the exchange rate at the time – because they also booked rooms for other members of the delegation at the same time. This meant that the bill for Mr Salmond’s room alone would have come to nearly $5,000, or £2,956, for the four-night stay. And the delegation’s total bill at the hotel was almost £10,000. The Peninsula has seven grand deluxe suites, which all have more than 1,000sq ft of floor space, a guest ‘powder room’, a spacious living room, a dressing area and a surround-sound stereo system. Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Lake Michigan and the city’s historic Water Tower Park. There are also three flat-screen televisions in each suite, mood lighting and PlayStation games consoles. Last night opponents called for an investigation into his spending, with Scottish Labour’s Paul Martin MSP saying: ‘It is time for Alex Salmond to come clean about his Chicago trip. Mr Salmond stayed here at the Peninsula Hotel in Chicago on a recent trip to the city to promote Scottish independence . ‘For a year and a half he has refused to say how much taxpayers’ money he spent on himself. ‘Now we know that he spent thousands on himself to stay in luxury at a five-star hotel.’ He added: ‘There are still thousands of pounds not properly accounted for. Everyone in Scotland will be asking themselves what does Alex Salmond have to hide. ‘If he won’t come clean we need an Audit Scotland investigation into what he spent our money on.’ Mr Salmond previously charged the taxpayer more than £250 for a pair of tartan trousers on a visit to China – and then spent the next seven months attempting to hide his failure to pay the money back.","First Minister stayed in a grand deluxe suite at the Peninsula Hotel .

"By . Ray Massey . The Third World conditions experienced by passengers at Gatwick airport last Christmas were foreseeable and should be a ‘wake-up call’ to other airports, a report warns today. The report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick - with just one functioning but ‘disgusting’ toilet shared by thousands and a lack of food and water for stranded passengers. More than 11,000 travellers were hit by delays and 72 flight cancellations - with easyJet worst affected - on December 24 after flooding caused a power failure at the West Sussex airport. The Third World conditions experienced by passengers at Gatwick airport last Christmas were foreseeable and should be a 'wake-up call' to other airports, a report warns today . The report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick - with just one functioning but 'disgusting' In a scathing report, the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ¿get a grip¿ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning. The failure also knocked out flight-information, baggage check-in and retrieval system - which meant that even those who wanted to leave could not get their bags back in order to do so. In a scathing report, the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ‘get a grip’ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning. The flooding fiasco should be ‘a wake-up call for airports across the UK’ in tackling foreseeable disruption’, the MPs said. More effort should also be made to ensure passengers know and receive reimbursement and compensation in line with their consumer rights. More effort should also be made to ensure passengers know and receive reimbursement and compensation in line with their consumer rights . More than 11,000 travellers were hit by delays and 72 flight cancellations - with easyJet worst affected - on December 24 . A Gatwick spokesman apologised at the time to passengers saying anti-flood work was in hand but the weather conditions had been extreme . Passengers gave evidence to MPs of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and with access to just one functioning but ‘putrid’ toilet. One said: ‘Many toilets, which were reliant on electronic flushing mechanisms, were out of action,’Sussex police had to step in to keep order amid the chaos and lack of loudspeaker announcements. British Airways passengers Neil and Jennifer Smith are quoted by MPs in the report saying: ‘As a result of BA staff’s unwavering refusal to speak to customers or provide any information in the terminal, we received no food or drink vouchers at any stage during our 11 hours at Gatwick.’ Had BA informed them that their luggage was unlikely to be on the plane, ‘we would have bought some essentials from the airport to relieve the stress and discomfort,’ they said. Dr Sylvia Baron said: ‘All this time no food was provided at any point by easyJet (13 hours total).’ Daniel Salt says: ‘eastJet failed at every stage to notify the public of what was happening.’ And Malina Majithia said they received no food or water: ‘More shockingly, the washroom facilities were appalling. The toilets were a disgrace. They did not flush and the putrid stench was overpowering.’ Even Labour peer Lord Triesman, caught up in the chaos spoke of ‘distressed and crying and shouting children’ and the ‘massive queue to the only functioning loo.’ Passengers wait in the departure hall of Gatwick airport's North Terminal as severe weather caused delays and cancellations to numerous flights . Passengers were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and just one toilet to access . Janet Coombs tells MPs: ‘19 hours without food or fluid; 15 hours standing; 15 hours without access to toilets; 2 days lost holiday; 2 nights lost sleep.’ Many phoned relatives outside the airport to find out from news reports what was happening. Anna Powell spoke of lost luggage, distress, and the ‘joy of securing the last chicken’ in Sainsburys but noted: ‘As far as we were concerned our Christmas was cancelled.’ Today the House of Commons Transport Committee thanked those passengers who wrote with their testimony. They said the main problems had been poor and often inconsistent provision of information about what was happening, lack of clarity about who was in charge, and a lack of basic facilities, such as toilets and drinking water. Christmas plans were badly affected for thousands of people after storms across the UK resulted in flooding and caused havoc at Gatwick Airport . Passengers gave evidence to MPs of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating . The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick¿s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals . The chaos at Gatwick was compounded when airport bosses sought to switch passengers from the blighted North Terminal to the still-working South Terminal in a move that ‘was not well tested.’ MPs were particularly concerned the ‘that contingency planning had not involved major airlines.’ Launching the report today, the committee’s chairman Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside said: ‘Passengers need accurate and consistent information, must be able to identify who is in charge during periods of disruption, and should have ready access to toilets and drinking water. ‘If our largest airports cannot demonstrate they can look after passengers’ interests in this way then the CAA must act.’ She added: ‘Passengers must also be promptly reimbursed for the extra costs they face as a consequence of disruption.' Mrs Ellman said: ‘It was clear from evidence to this inquiry that there is considerable scope for airlines to ensure passengers are far better informed about their rights when flights are delayed or cancelled and how to enforce these rights.’ Passengers need accurate and consistent information, Labour MP Louise Ellman said . The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport¿s North Terminal . The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick’s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals, to focus on passenger welfare. The committee suggested that similar arrangements should also be put in place at other major UK airports. Gatwick’s own report into the chaos concluded in February that passengers were failed because airport bosses ‘overreached themselves’ and communications to passengers were ‘disappointingly poor’. The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport’s North Terminal. But rather than cancel flights straight away managers tried to get as many people away as possible - by switching them to the unaffected South Terminal. However, this merely added to the chaos. Gatwick non-executive director David McMillan said in own February report: ‘On this occasion, the airport community overreached itself in seeking to maintain a close-to-normal flying programme on the day. MPs demanded to know why the country¿s second-biggest airport had been unable to cope with flooding . ‘In doing so, while the majority of airport passengers flew that day, a very significant number of passengers endured poor levels of service and information before seeing their flights either substantially delayed or, ultimately, cancelled.’ MPs had earlier accused country’s second-biggest airport -owned by an American private equity Global Infrastructure Partners of failing to invest at Gatwick while making bumper profits. Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman said the sorts of problems encountered by Gatwick should not have been unforeseen, unexpected or unprepared for: ‘The problems that unfolded were not new and the whole event should be a wake-up call for airports across the UK to improve their operational resilience.’ This was the scene at Gatwick Airport Station on Christmas Eve amid chaos around the airport . The report itself concludes: ‘None of the issues discussed in our report is new. Contingency planning, communications and passenger welfare were all covered in the Begg report into disruption at Heathrow due to snow in December 2011., themes we then picked up in our 2011 report on the disruption to transport caused by snow and ice.’ It added: ‘The CAA recently told us that it had already given the industry some guidance about what is expected in relation to oversight of operational resilience.’ MPs said the CAA had told them: ‘If the plans produced by airports over the Spring and Summer do not include all appropriate elements, we will use our licence powers to requite this to be remedied.’","Report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick on December 24 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . One of the architects of a large-scale corruption scandal that nearly bankrupted the Los Angeles suburb of Bell was sentenced Thursday to nearly 12 years in prison by a judge who called her a con artist and a hog. Former Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, 55, was also ordered to make more than $8million in restitution to Bell. Spaccia was the first of seven former public officials to be sentenced for their roles in the scandal that authorities said cost the small, working-class city more than $5.5million. More than a quarter of Bell's 36,000 residents live below the federal poverty line. Comeuppance: Former Bell assistant city administrator Angela Spaccia talks to her lawyer after she was sentenced April 10 to 11 years and eight months in prison for bilking the city's coffers of thousands of dollars . Harsh words: Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy (right) called Spaccia (left) a 'con artist' and a 'hog' driven by greed, referring to an email the former official had sent to Bell's chief of police . Former Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley once described the scandal as 'corruption on steroids.' 'This was not a one-time lapse of judgment on defendant Spaccia's part; it was a criminally sophisticated conspiracy that drove the city of Bell to the edge of bankruptcy,' prosecutors wrote in a memo to Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy that sought a sentence of 12 years, eight months. The judge gave the former official, who has been incarcerated since her conviction in December, 11 years and eight months. She could have sentenced her to as long as 17 years. 'Iâ€™m not saying that Ms. Spaccia is a horrible person; I think sheâ€™s a con artist,' Kennedy said. 'Itâ€™s all about the money, and it was all about greed,' NBC Los Angeles reported. Spaccia has been found guilty of 11 criminal counts, including misappropriation of public funds, conspiracy and falsification of government records. Authorities said she signed off on contracts and other financial documents as part of the scandal in which taxpayer dollars were illegally diverted to pay her and other top officials huge salaries. Some of the most damning pieces of evidence introduced at her trial were emails she exchanged with Bell's former police chief in which she told him the city's contracts were carefully crafted to avoid disclosing to the public what the officials were paid. Payback: Spaccia was also ordered to make more than $8million in restitution to the working-class Los Angeles suburb of Bell . Damning evidence: Spaccia exchanged emails with Bell's former police chief in which she told that he can get his share of the pie and 'get fat' together with her . When the newly hired chief said he was looking forward to taking all of Bell's money, Spaccia replied, 'LOL ... well you can take your share of the pie ... just like us. We will all get fat together... pigs get Fat ... Hogs get slaughtered!!! So long as we're not Hogs ... all is well!!' At the sentencing, Judge Kennedy said: 'Greed overtook. she became a hog, not a pig.' By the time she was fired by Bell in 2010, Spaccia was making $564,000 a year and her boss, former City Manager Robert Rizzo, had a salary and compensation package of $1.5million. Five former City Council members were each paid about $100,000 a year. On Wednesday, former Bell Mayor Oscar Hernandez and former City Council members George Cole, Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal and Victor Bello pleaded no contest to two counts each of misappropriating public funds. They face terms that could range from probation to four years when they are sentenced at separate hearings in June and July. Guilty: Spaccia is led away in handcuffs after being found guilty of a string of corruption charges last December . Pointing fingers: Spaccia testified that it was her boss, former City Manager Robert Rizzo (right) who masterminded the bilking scheme . Rizzo, who pleaded no contest to 69 counts of fraud, misappropriation of public funds and other charges, could face as many as 12 years in prison. During her trial, Spaccia testified that it was Rizzo who masterminded the scheme. She said she knew she was being paid a lot but didn't believe it was illegal. 'It was love at first sight between the two of them,' said Deputy District Attorney Sean Hassett. 'They never met a dollar in the city of Bell they didn't like.' Spaccia's attorney, Harlan Braun, said he was disappointed with the sentence, telling the jurors that while his client may have been grossly overpaid, she did not commit any crime. An audit by the state controller's office found Bell illegally raised property taxes, business license fees and other sources of revenue to keep the salaries flowing. During the trial Spaccia, 55, testified that she knew she was making too much money when her salary exceeded $340,000, but she maintained it wasn't criminal . Jailbird: Spaccia seen walking free on bail after her original 2010 arrest for corruption . At one point homeowners in Bell, where the annual median household income is about $36,000, paid higher property taxes than people in Beverly Hills. Thousands of Bell residents organized a recall campaign after learning of the salaries and subsequently voted all of the council members out of office. Bell's current mayor, Nestor Enrique Valencia, said he believes Spaccia got off too easily. His city is still struggling financially, Valencia said, and the damage she did to its reputation will likely endure for a generation. 'They're all going to say, ""I'm so sorry, feel sorry for me,""' he said of Spaccia and the other defendants. 'I think that's just disingenuous of them and in the community we don't believe them. They got the money and we're never going to see that money again.'","Angela Spaccia, 55, sentenced to 11 years and eight months, and ordered to pay the City of Bell $8million in restitution .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A young woman was killed by a friend on Friday night in a prank gone horribly wrong, it has been claimed. Premila Lal, 18, was allegedly hiding in a closet and jumped out around 8pm when she startled Nerrek Daniel Galley, 21, who reportedly shot her in a Longmont, Colorado home. A neighbor, who asked to remain unidentified, said she and her husband called the police after they heard yelling and screaming. She told The Times-Call that 'three or four' individuals got into a car and sped away, leaving the front door open. Premila Lal, pictured, was allegedly shot by friend Nerrek Daniel Galley, after she jumped out of a closet and scared him . Longmont, Colorado police are investigating the death of Premila Lal, pictured. Lal, 18, was a Niwot High School graduate and track star . Galley and two of Lal's male relatives, ages 12 and 15, loaded her into her own vehicle and took her to Longmont United Hospital, The Denver Post reprorts. The neighbor woman also told The Times-Call said her husband walked over there and saw blood and an abandoned mobile phone on the stairway. He came and got her, and together called 911. Longmont police were called at 8:02pm regarding the shooting. Just two minutes later, officers were called to the house regarding an 'unknown problem.' Lal died at approximately 9pm, Longmont police Cmdr. Jeff Satur confirmed. Nerrek Daniel Galley, pictured, allegedly shot Lal after she jumped out a closet and scared him on Friday evening in Longmont, Colorado home . The home, located on Cambridge Drive, was allegedly a rental. Neighbors have said that residents frequently move in and out of the property. A unidentified man also told The Times-Call that he believed a younger family lived in the home. The neighbor said he often saw a 'gangsta'-type man hanging out on the property out front, speaking on the phone. Galley, of Orem, Utah, was arrested at approximately 2:11am on Saturday. He is suspected of child abuse and reckless endangerment, says an arrest report released to the media on Saturday morning. Galley is also suspected of permitting a juvenile to have a firearm. This stems from allegedly allowing Lal's 15-year-old brother to have a handgun in his possession without the permission of the boy's parents, Satur said, which is a felony under Colorado law. The report, written by Longmont police officer Billy Owens, alleges that upon searching the residence, he saw a handgun with a live round stuck near its ejection port on top of the stairs in the living room. In his report, Owens said Longmont police are requesting a high bond for Galley, because he has 'no ties to the community with a permanent residence.' Longmont police are working with the Boulder County District Attorney's office to determine whether Galley will be charged in relation to Lal's death. Lal was a high school track star and graduate of Niwot High School, CBS Denver reports. Her parents are heartbroken over the loss of their daughter. 'My life ended so suddenly and I think it’s going to take a few more days for us to really, you know, comprehend she’s gone,' Praveen Lal said.

"By . Laura Clark . Schools should teach pupils to speak eloquently to help ‘grunting’ and ‘monosyllabic’ teenagers, according to a former speechwriter for Tony Blair. Peter Hyman argued that not enough teaching time was devoted to developing speaking skills and criticised an assumption that quiet classrooms were best. Speaking eloquently was key to finding work but oral skills were an ‘undervalued’ part of the curriculum, he said. Schools should teach pupils to speak eloquently to help 'grunting' and 'monosyllabic' teenagers, according to Peter Hyman, a former speechwriter for Tony Blair. (Picture posed by models) Mr Hyman, who is now a head teacher of a London free school, said schools needed to help ‘dispel the myth of the grunting teenager, the monosyllabic teenager.’ He also criticised last year’s decision to remove the speaking and listening mark from the final grade in GCSE English, pointing out that oral exams were still regarded as intrinsic to foreign language qualifications. Learning to speak eloquently was becoming ‘a moral issue’ because it is crucial to success in life, he told the Times Educational Supplement. ‘If you can speak and articulate yourself properly, that will happen,’ he said. ‘But it’s also the number one issue that employers put in all their surveys: they want good oral communication.’ Mr Hyman (above), who is now a head teacher of a London free school, criticised last year's decision to remove the speaking and listening mark from the final grade in GCSE English . He added: ‘We’ve got to dispel the myth of the grunting teenager, the monosyllabic teenager that make employers say “I’ve got this person who I know on paper is quite good, but they can’t string a sentence together”.’ Mr Hyman, who now runs School 21, a new free school in Newham, east London, said the general trend was moving further away from encouraging pupils to develop their speaking and communication skills. A fashion for quiet classrooms is wrong and pupils should spend time discussing ideas and debating with each other, he insisted. ‘Speaking aids thinking, speaking aids depth of knowledge, speaking aids writing,’ he said. ‘I think some people out there think the silent classroom is the good classroom, but the silent classroom is the death of learning, unless there’s a particular reason for it.’ Mr Hyman added: ‘I think there’s too much of a fashion now of saying ""the quieter the better, that shows you’ve got behaviour under control"". ‘I think that is completely the wrong way to go and we’ve got to put speaking up there on a completely equal footing with reading and writing.’ Mr Hyman told TES that he wanted to go around the classrooms of his school, and hear children talking to each other, discussing, debating and questioning. The spoken word, he said, was ‘built into the DNA of the school’. Mr Hyman made the remarks part-way through a pilot project with the University of Cambridge which is testing a range of ways teachers can boost and assess students’ talking skills. Professor Neil Mercer, director of the project, said policy makers would take speech more seriously as a subject if it could be formally assessed. ‘The government has tended to blow hot and cold on talk in schools,’ he said. ‘It tends to be taken for granted, but it’s important to children’s development in so many ways. ‘Speaking and listening is included in the primary curriculum now but in secondary it is there in a token way and not nearly enough to develop children’s life skills.’",Peter Hyman argued that not enough teaching time was devoted to developing speaking skills .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wells Fargo has become the latest bank to be targeted by a cyber gang seeking revenge for the anti-Islam film Innocence of Muslims. A group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for the attacks on America's fourth largest bank. The online assault is the third in recent days after attacks were launched last week under the name Operation Ababil, meaning 'swarm'. Wells Fargo has become the latest bank to be targeted by a cyber gang seeking revenge for the anti-Islam film Innocence of Muslims . Wells Fargo said in messages posted on Twitter that the website Sitedown.co received . hundreds of complaints from customers who were locked out of the Wells . Fargo website yesterday. A spokeswoman said the bank was working hard to resolve the issues but declined to comment on the source of the problem. The attack on Wells Fargo comes after the Cyber Fighters group hacked  into and disrupted JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. The financial services industry group last week warned U.S. banks, brokerages and insurers to be on heightened alert for cyber attacks causing unexplained outages on their public websites. Wells Fargo's problems occurred on the same day that an unidentified person on the Internet called on 'cyberspace workers' to attack the bank's site. Wells Fargo is the third financial institution to be hacked by the Cyber Fighters group following attacks against JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America . In a posting on pastebin.com, the person also warned of attacks later this week against U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. A similar posting last week made threats against Bank of America and the New York Stock Exchange. The post said the attacks would continue until the film that had stirred up anti-U.S. protests across the Middle East was removed from the Internet. A U.S. Bancorp spokesman said the bank was aware of the posting and was working closely with law enforcement authorities. Senator Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said he believes Iran was behind the attacks. Experts believe Iranian hackers have repeatedly attacked Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup over the past year as part of a broad cyber campaign targeting the U.S. Wells Fargo's problems occurred on the same day that an unidentified person on the Internet called on 'cyberspace workers' to attack the bank's site. The attacks, which began in late 2011 have primarily been 'denial of service' campaigns that disrupted the banks' websites and corporate networks by overwhelming them with incoming web traffic, said the sources. Dmitri Alperovitch, chief executive of CrowdStrike nobody's information had been compromised and no data has been stolen during the attacks . He said the group claiming responsibility for the attacks began its cyber campaign in early summer and therefore to claim it was retaliation against the anti-Muslim film was untrue. The attacks have been described as massive in scale and well co-ordinated. Some have flooded the bank's websites with information at up to 100 gigabits a second; the usual DDoS attack is in the order of 5-10 gigabits a second.","A group called Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for the attacks .

"By . Martin Robinson . A family dog helped snare a burglar after biting him so hard that police were able to use blood left in the dog's mouth to trace him. Missy, an 11 year-old rottweiler sank her . teeth into the crook as he reached his hand through the cat flap at the home in . Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. The usually mild-mannered pet did so much damage that police were able to take DNA samples from blood left at the scene - including on Missy's teeth. Bark off: Missy saw the burgler's hand come through this cat flap and bit it to protect her home . The attempted break-in happened at Pauline Cunningham’s home last week while the family were away dealing with an emergency. A neighbour who was looking after the house found the back door covered in blood and called the family back. Pauline, 53, said: 'She’s now a crime fighting dog. Usually she’s a very docile family pet. It’s so out of character for Missy. 'She’s a big softie and a lovable old girl. In dog years, she’s an old pensioner.

Chilling out: The 11-year-old rottweiler takes a break from being a 'crime-fighting dog' The neighbours who were looking after . the property that night turned the lights off and left the stairgate . open – meaning Missy had the run of the house and the burglar had no . idea she was there. The next morning when neighbours checked, they found the back door drenched in blood and called the Cunninghams. The attempted break-in happened somewhere between last Thursday evening and 9.30am on Friday. Missy’s family were away from their home at the time dealing with a family emergency. Daughter Amanda, 25, said: 'The burglar must have reached through the cat flap trying to reach the door handle. 'Because the lights were off he wouldn’t have seen Missy coming. 'It looks like she grabbed hold of his arm and tried to pull him through.' Proud: Missy's family admire her bravery when she took on the burglar and won last week .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Publishers of lads mags such as Nuts and Zoo have vowed to tone down the images of scantily-clad models on their front covers. The move follows pressure from Tesco which came under attack from feminist groups and parenting websites for making money from the publications. Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, said it will also change its magazine displays to make sure children cannot see the front cover images. Restrictions: Tescos will stock magazines with tamer cover images. They will change their magazine displays so children will not be able to see the raunchy pictures . It will ban the sale of the magazines to anyone under the age of 18, putting them in the same category as drink and knives. However, feminist groups behind the Lose the Lads Mags campaign said the safeguards did not go far enough. They said the retailer should ban the magazines completely. They will also go ahead with a series of protests outside stores on August 24. The campaign has been led by activist groups UK Feminista and Object and has been fronted by the British actress Romola Garai, who has made a video message. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We’ve had in-depth conversations with our customers about this issue, and we’re putting new measures in place. Pressure: Tesco has urged lads mag publishers to tone down their front covers. Tesco, in turn, have been under attack from feminist and parenting groups who say their safeguards don't go far enough . ‘We’ve listened carefully to the concerns raised by the campaign groups, but our priority is to make sure we meet our customers’ needs and expectations.’ But Kat Banyard, of UK Feminista, said: ‘Tesco has been forced to act because of the thousands of people who have protested against the UK’s biggest retailer selling such sexist and harmful publications. ‘Age restricting lads mags is a half measure that does not address the damaging impact caused by stocking these sexist magazines. ‘Significantly, they will continue to profit from selling them.’","Supermarket chain will change its displays so children can't see the raunchy cover images .

"By . Amanda Williams . Police have come under fire for asking homeowners whether they were gay or bisexual in a Neighbourhood Watch survey . Police have come under fire for asking homeowners whether they were gay or bisexual - in a Neighbourhood Watch survey. The questionnaire by West Midlands Police asked residents in Birmingham questions about their sexual orientation so they could help officers 'detect crime and anti-social behaviour.' The force claim that by asking whether people were straight, gay or bi-sexual it would help them decide where certain information about police initiatives should be best sent. But residents and politicians in the city have accused the police of being too politically correct. Gary Harper, 30, from Kitts Green, Birmingham, said: 'It's complete leftie nonsense and completely irrelevant. 'West Midlands Police need to mind their own business.' Electrician Paul Potter, 30, added: 'What has being gay got to do with Neighbourhood Watch schemes. 'It's ridiculous. It's another example of authorities trying to be too politically correct and it just makes them look stupid.' It comes two months after the city's council was ridiculed for asking residents their sexual orientation in a quiz on wheelie bins. Birmingham councillor Deirdre Alden said she was baffled by the survey. She said: 'It seems West Midlands Police is following the same politically correct pathway for which the council was derided. 'You would have thought the police commissioner would have learned from that. 'Notes attached to the form claim that personal data will be used to prevent and detect crime, reduce nuisance, anti-social behaviour and disorder and improve community safety. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said quizzing residents on their sexual orientation allowed the force to target different cross-sections of the community. The force claim that by asking whether people were straight, gay or bi-sexual it would help them decide where certain information about police initiatives should be best sent . She said: 'West Midlands Police regularly sends information about crime and policing initiatives to cross sections of the community and surveys such as this one to Neighbourhood Watch members helps us to target these messages and make sure they go to the right people. 'There may be an issue specific to a particular group in the community and we can make sure they are informed. 'The equality question is just one part of the survey about how people receive information from the police and includes questions of gender, ethnicity and faith. 'People can choose whether to give this information. The force takes equal opportunities and diversity extremely seriously. 'This week it backed a national campaign to raise awareness of homophobic and transphobic hate crime and to encourage residents to speak out.'","Questions designed to help officers 'detect crime and anti-social behaviour'

"By . Beth Stebner . A large sinkhole opened up in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania today following significant sewer work in the area . The sinkhole was at least 30 feet wide by 12 feet deep, and caused significant damage to houses in the neighborhood, authorities said. News of the phenomenon comes only two weeks ago when a Florida man was swallowed up in a sinkhole that opened under his house. A large sinkhole opened up in the backyard of a home forcing an evacuation of the homeowners in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on Sunday . Neighbors look at the sinkhole, which was more than 30 feet wide and 12 feet deep . The Morning Call newspaper of Lehigh Valley reports that while no injuries were reported, there was significant structural damage to buildings within a half a block radius of the giant hole. It formed under the home of resident Doris Jenkins, who said that there were a few indicators that a sinkhole could be forming. She said that while she was taking her three dogs for a walk around 4am Sunday morning, she saw an unbelievable site: ‘A big hole opening up at the end of the driveway.’ Officials evacuated Ms Jenkins and her daughter, Ingeborg and deemed their home uninhabitable. Township manager Howard Kutzler told the Express Times that it is unclear what caused the sinkhole, though construction work on a sewer line could be a culprit. The woman's house experienced structural damage, including cracks in her foundation and walls, but no one was hurt . Jeff Bush, 37, a Florida resident, was swallowed alive by a sinkhole earlier this month; his house was later demolished . ‘We have aging infrastructure and we’re looking to fix it,’ he said, adding that much of the township’s pluming dates back to the 1970s. As the paper notes, sinkholes are not uncommon in that region of eastern Pennsylvania, as the limestone bedrock is relatively weak. Sinkholes are caused by the sudden dissolution of soluble materials and can cause significant damage. Jeff Bush, 37, was swallowed into a 50-foot-deep hole at his family’s house in Brandon, near Tampa, Florida, two weeks ago. Though emergency crews tried to rescue him, they eventually called off the search and razed the home to the ground. Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities. When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion. Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes. While they often occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed.Source: USGS .","Sinkhole opened early Sunday morning in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania in resident's driveway following sewer work .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It almost looks like it is sleeping, but sadly, this little frog will not jump again as it froze solid trying to cross a lake in Norway. It is thought that a sudden rise in temperatures fooled the hibernating amphibian and it ventured out across the lake to find a girlfriend. However, as the lake froze, possibly overnight, the frog would have returned to hibernation out in the open, and died from the cold. Cold shouldered: This unfortunate frog froze to death as he attempted to find a mate on Lake Bindingsvann, just outside of Oslo, Norway . Photographer Svein Nordrum, 54, discovered the creature caught out by freezing conditions. He said: ‘I was out skating for a couple of hours and, suddenly; I saw something on the surface of the ice. When I saw it was a frog, frozen stiff, I was quite shocked. I have never seen anything like it before.’ He said: ‘It was a sad thing to see, but at the same time it was quite beautiful. I think this frog was trying to find a hole in the ice and swim back to shore once the lake started to freeze. ‘The poor thing obviously didn't make it and was left stuck to the ice I don't think it would have been there for very long as something would have taken it to eat.’ Beauty sleep: The poor amphibian did not make it to the other side, and despite daring to cross the ice, he died trying . Billy No-mate: The lovelorn frog met a tragic end, although it merely looks like he is sleeping . Mr Nordrum captured the shot while skating on Lake Bindingsvann, just outside of Oslo. He said: ‘It was a once-in-a-lifetime photograph. I am very lucky to have captured it.’ Silviu . Perovan, conservation coordinator at UK conservation charity Froglife, . said the frog could have been looking for a mate when it froze. He said: ‘It is fairly common to see frogs crossing areas covered in snow. Some frogs hibernate on the water but most hibernate on land in the vicinity of a body of water. ‘I think that for whatever reason the frog became active again during hibernation. There was probably a slightly warmer period which led the frog to become active, perhaps for reproduction. ‘It . was probably in search of a mate and was crossing the lake when the . temperature dropped again, probably overnight, and it was frozen to the . lake.’ Although frogs normally hibernate during the winter, a raise in temperature could have fooled the amphibian to think that it was springtime, and it awoke to find a mate .","The unfortunate amphibian froze in his step as he attempted to cross Lake Bindingsvann, just outside of Oslo ."
"By . Suzannah Hills . Many people try to bravely soldier on when they have the flu but new research has shown it really would be best - for both them and their employer - if they stayed home. Staff who take two days off work when sick with the flu reduce the risk of their colleagues getting the bug by 40 per cent, a study has found. And the simulated flu epidemic showed that even having just one day off was still beneficial - cutting workplace transmissions of the virus by 25 per cent. Stay home: Staff members who take two days off sick when ill with the flu cut the chances of their colleagues getting the virus by 40% (stock image) Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that staff staying home when sick with the flu prevented further illness among their colleagues and reduced the overall cost to their company. Epidemiologist Dr Supriya Kumar said: 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people with flu stay home for 24 hours after their fever breaks. However, not everyone is able to follow these guidelines. 'Many more workers in small workplaces than in large ones lack access to paid sick days and hence find it difficult to stay home when ill. 'Our simulations show allowing all workers access to paid sick days would reduce illness because fewer workers get the flu over the course of the season if employees are able to stay home and keep the virus from being transmitted to their co-workers.' Dr Kumar and her colleagues found that ‘flu days’, in which all employees had access to one or two paid days off work to recover from the virus, drastically reduced the spread of the bug in the workplace. The analysis, the first of its kind, . showed staff are more likely to keep away when the bug is at its most . infectious if they know they won’t lose any pay. But flu days worked best in large workplaces with 500 or more employees, the American Journal of Public Health reports online. Dr . Kumar added: 'These findings make a strong case for paid sick days. Future research should examine the economic impacts of paid sick-day . policies.' Transmitting the virus: Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found that paid flu days cost companies less in the long run (stock image) Her researchers used a computer model called ‘Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics’ (FRED). Co author Professor Donald Burke said: 'Our mission is to protect the US and the global community against communicable infectious disease threats. 'Our modelling work allows scientists both here and worldwide to investigate strategies to minimise epidemics. At the heart of this effort is free, open data sharing.' A previous study by scientists at the University of Arizona found that when just one person comes to work sick, more than half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office become infected with the virus by lunchtime. Conducted in an office, the study included about 80 participants, some of whom received droplets on their hands at the start of a normal work day. While most of those droplets were plain water, one person unknowingly received a droplet containing artificial viruses mimicking the cold, the flu and a stomach bug. Employees were instructed to go about their day as usual. After about four hours, researchers sampled commonly touched surfaces in the office, as well as employees' hands, and found that more than 50 per cent of surfaces and employees were infected with at least one of the viruses. Researchers swabbed surfaces and hands again at the end of the work day. By then, the cold and flu viruses, known for their short survival time, had dissipated, but the stomach virus had continued to spread, infecting up to 70 per cent of surfaces tested. However the study also revealed that . simple interventions, such as hand washing and the use of hand sanitiser . or wipes, can drastically reduce employees' risk of infection.","Staying home for just one day can still cut transmissions of the virus by 25% .

"By . Saurabh Shukla . An anticipated New York meeting between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September has raised hopes on both sides of the border. South Block remains circumspect, however, having received inputs about a renewed and reconfigured Pakistan effort to put the Kashmir issue back on the boil. South Block has concluded Indian policy makers must factor in Sharif's secret 'K plan' before resuming talks with Islamabad. Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh (right) and Nawaz Sharif (left) are expected to meet to discuss Indo-Pakistan relations at the United Nations General Assembly . Mail Today has accessed a series of internal notes sent to top officials of the security establishment in South Block that speak of Sharif clearing a new Kashmir strategy. Sharif, who has espoused the Kashmir cause in earlier stints as Prime Minister, wants the nerve centre of this strategy to be a new Kashmir Cell in his office. This cell will monitor Pakistan's fresh push on Kashmir, in contrast to the previous Pakistan Peoples Party government that put Kashmir on the back-burner. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League has been perceived as soft on terror groups that found safe haven in Punjab, the party's traditional stronghold. There has been an upswing in violence in the Valley since Sharif took over as Prime Minister (see box). Two-faced Pakistan . According to the notes, Sharif has told his key advisors that Kashmir has to be given priority but he and the members of his Cabinet should not be seen as raising it too much. Anti-India rhetoric should not be associated with key functionaries of the government, the Sharif plan says. Analysts believe this part of the Sharif strategy is driven by the motive of keeping the Pakistan-India relationship on an even keel in the run-up to the New York meeting, for Islamabad wants to be seen as a moderate nation. Attacks on the Army in J&K have gone up in recent weeks. It could be part of Pakistan strategy to bring the Valley to a boil again . Supporters of Pakistan's outlawed Islamic hard line group, Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) shout anti-Indian slogans during a protest in Lahore . The flip side of this soft projection is that the Kashmir cell will direct propaganda activities, receiving directions from Sharif to ensure that the issue stays on the boil. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) has been told to tell militants to limit their activities, keeping any links with state functionaries invisible. This would mean a reorganisation of terror camps, and a slowdown in infiltration. ""It is to ensure that Kashmir is back on the international radar with complete deniability for the Pakistan government,"" a south Block source said. Part II of the Sharif strategy will be to ensure high voltage international propaganda. The ISI has been told to activate its propaganda cells on Kashmir in Brussels, London, Washington, New York and Toronto. These will not be run by the Pakistani diplomatic missions but by NGOs and Kashmir support groups with the funding to be channelled by the ISI. The use of local NGOs to espouse the Kashmir cause at the United Nations and in the European Union is part of this new strategy. Some reports say that key Pakistani functionaries have also been told not to indulge in India-bashing. Significantly, Jihadi leaders like Hafiz Mohammed Saeed have been told to continue their anti-India propaganda but keep the government completely out so deniability can be achieved. Part of the strategy is to ensure that while infiltration will be controlled, the attacks in Kashmir will be intensified to give them a local colour, and as the reaction from the Indian security forces grows, this will be showcased through hired NGOs and amplified through media stories to help internationalise the Kashmir issue. While the strategy is devious from the analysis provided to South Block is it apparent that Sharif 's K plan will achieve two objectives: one, get the Kashmir issue back into focus as the core issue in the dialogue with India, and second, to ensure that international pressure is on India, with the issue taking centre-stage through a concerted campaign by NGOs in Europe and the US to help build a case for Kashmir being a conflict zone. Armed with these inputs, India will now have to factor in the new Kashmir strategy in its diplomatic approach as it prepares for the New York meeting. Besides this, sustained pressure needs to be built on Islamabad, that the dialogue process will not gain momentum till Pakistan takes action against the perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks. Bad news for J&K . While Sharif is unlikely to make any dramatic concessions to India on the issue of terrorism, and the 26/11 trial may not yield much, there could be some progress on the issue of trade where Islamabad may give India Most Favoured Nation status couched in a different name to signal progress. With Plan K back on the table, however, India should be prepared for a fresh onslaught of violence in Kashmir. Kashmir, it seems, is back at the nerve centre of the India-Pakistan ties. Pakistan urged India to bring to justice all those responsible for the killing of Kashmiris in India. ""The killing of Kashmiris in the Indian held Kashmir is a matter of concern to us. Pakistan has expressed its concern over the fresh episode of violence. ""Likewise, the reported desecration of the Holy Quran is a matter of grave concern to us. We understand that the Indian government expressed its intent to carry out an investigation. ""We hope and urge that it is done expeditiously and those responsible for such acts are brought to justice,"" the spokesperson of Pakistan's Ministry of External Affairs told Mail Today on Friday. Pakistanis, especially the followers of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, have taken to to the streets across the country in the past few days to protest against the Indian government. On Friday, the religious leaders delivered hateful speeches against India and vowed to take revenge. Followers of groups like JuD and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi have urged the Nawaz Sharif government to ask India to stop the massacre of Kashmiris. Sources said, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi was planning to send trained men to Kashmir to fight the Indian army. However, an influential commander of the outfit refused to comment. ""My comments are 'I have no comments',"" Abu Talha told Mail Today from an undisclosed location. Reliable sources said the commanders of militant groups operating in Kashmir are using internet telephones for internal communication to avoid the chances of being tracked.","Internal documents reveal Sharif's propaganda campaign on Kashmir .

"By . Shari Miller . A Belgian Shepherd dog born with two noses, who was struggling to find a new home because of his rare defect, is set to begin a new life after offers to adopt him flooded in from around the globe. Five-month-old Snuffles had previously been rejected by four owners and was in the care of the Dog's . Trust Rehoming Centre in Uddingston, Glasgow. But after issuing an appeal, the centre received 40 messages and 20 calls from people in the USA and South Africa, as well as Britain. Happy tail: Snuffles, the dog with two noses, has finally found a new owner . Looking up: Snuffles will begin a new life next week after finding an owner from East Lothian . Supportive: Staff at the care home gave him the endearing name because of his odd appearance . Pamela Jackson from the centre, told The Mirror: 'Some families just turned up hoping to adopt him. 'We wanted to pick the best home for him. 'The eventual new owner took him for a walk to get to know him and they got on brilliantly. 'He said Snuffles was perfect and everything he was looking for.' Snuffles was born with a rare congenital defect which gives him the appearance of having two noses. Vet Angela McAllister explained: 'Instead of his nostrils being fused together he's got some sort of split there. 'It's . a defect in his palate which gives him the appearance of having two . noses as his nostrils can move completely independently of each other. 'I've never seen the condition in my 20-year career.' To add to his unique appearance, Snuffles can also move both noses independently of each other. The centre's manager Sandra Lawton said: 'He may not have been blessed with the looks of Lassie but he has a heart of  gold and really can claim to be a dog in several million.' Snuffles will begin his new life with a family from East Lothian next week. Rare: Snuffles was born with an unusual defect to his nose . Striking: The dog has four nostrils and can move each side independently . Care: The Dog's Trust Rehoming Centre in Uddingston, Glasgow has been looking after Snuffles . Obedient: Staff at the centre say Snuffles would be a perfect dog to train . Young: Snuffles is only five months old, but has already been re-homed four times . The deformed calf which was born with two heads in Morocco . The piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was born with three eyes and two mouths . In December, a village in northern Morocco was shocked by the birth of a two-headed calf. The young animal was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic. After its birth, the creature attracted a lot of attention, with . locals of Sefrou, a village less than 20 miles from Fez, flocking to the . farm to see it. The calf is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head. Just a few days earlier, a two-headed piglet came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born in Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province. Unfortunately for the animal, vets said it would find it very hard to survive with the mutation. In June, the San Antonio Zoo in Texas also welcomed a bizarre addition - a two-headed turtle they named Thelma and Louise. The . female Texas cooter was born with four others on June 18 displayed at the zoo's Friedrich Aquarium - swimming and walking as . normally as her one-headed brothers and sisters. The condition is supposedly common among snakes and turtles. In 2011, a piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was been born with three eyes and two mouths. Xiao . Jintu, owner of a local pig farm, said the piglet was one from a . 12-strong litter. 'It came out 5th and I was stunned in seeing its . appearance', he said. In 2009, a snake with two heads was . found in a drawer full of rubbish in the US, while a cat suffering the . same deformity was born in Australia a year earlier. In 2008, Fisherman Christopher Johnson found a pregnant bull shark in the Indian Ocean. When he cut it's stomach open, he found a foetus of a two-headed baby inside. Scientists said it was the first time the condition has been seen in a shark.","Snuffles is in the Dog's Trust Rehoming Centre in Glasgow .

"Kate tried her hand at table tennis while Harry joined the basketball court and William took to the football pitch . By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . Her husband and his brother are the sportsmen of the family. But yesterday the Duchess of Cambridge beat them both hands down. While Prince William’s shot at goal on the football pitch was wildly inaccurate and Prince Harry missed all four basketball hoops he attempted, Kate picked up a table tennis bat and showed the menfolk exactly how it was done. She was described as ‘unbelievably talented’ by a coach – despite playing in heels – while trying her hand at the sport as the three young royals attended the launch of a project in South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches. Scroll down for video . Princess of ping pong: The Duchess of Cambridge plays table tennis as she visits Bacon's College to launch the Coach Core programme yesterday . Hidden talents: Onlookers said Kate was a 'dab hand' at the sport as she ably took on an opponent from the club . Known for her sporting prowess, Kate recently impressed members of the British hockey team too when she took to the pitch to show off her dribbling skills . On the football pitch William . sweated in the heat as he kicked a ball, dribbled it through some cones . and then wildly mis-timed a shot at goal. Prince Harry missed his four shots at goal in the . basketball but Kate looked calm and she played table tennis. Kate looked the picture of summer . perfect in a patterned white and beige Hobbs summer dress, low beige . wedges and with her trademark blowdry. Kate's 'Wessex' dress cost £35 in the sale from High . Street store Hobbs but is sold out. Later on she . changed into more appropriate wear – a white polo shirt and slender blue . trousers – to join William and Harry again to welcome the Olympic flame . at Buckingham Palace. The Duke was joined by Michael de . Giorgio, chief executive of Greenhouse, and chatted to some of the . coaches who were taking the lessons. But William could not resist joining in and lined up with a group of youngsters for shooting practice. The royal shimmied through some cones . then passed the ball to a trainer who returned it for the shot, but . William hit it just wide of an empty goal. With . his head bowed he trudged back to the middle of the pitch but a few . minutes later had the chance to redeem himself when the students were . asked to volley the ball into the net. As William ran forward the trainer . threw the ball into the air and shouted 'keep your eyes on it' but the . royal sent it just over the bar but received the encouraging comment . 'much better' from the coach. In a short speech about Coach Core . William jokingly likened himself to being a 'giraffe on ice skates' on . the football pitch and ribbed his brother Harry about 'cheating' to . become the fastest man on earth -  a reference to his legendary race . against Usain Bolt in Jamaica earlier this year'. But he charmingly described his wife, Catherine, as being ' a sight to behold with a tennis or hockey stick in her hand'. The . Coach Core programme is being piloted by the organisation Greenhouse . and will train 16 to 19-year-olds to become qualified coaches and . mentors for their schools and communities. The . hope is that the talented young sportsmen and women will be able to . inspire their students and build a future for themselves in sport. Forget your kit, Kate? She may not have the right attire, but a very game Duchess of Cambridge attempts to dribble a football wearing her Pied-a-Terre wedged espadrilles . If . it proves successful, the foundation aims to roll out the initiative to . other sectors where inspirational young coaches can become role models . for and inspire young people. 'The . Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry . wanted to develop a sports programme in recognition of London hosting . the Olympic Games and developed the Coach Core concept with Greenhouse . charity,' a spokesman for the three said. William made a speech and thanked . John Martin, the Headteacher, the staff and pupils of Bacon's College . for hosting the event and giving himself, Kate and Harry such a warm . welcome. 'Over the next . month, the eyes of the world will be on Great Britain. For us to hold . the Olympic and the Paralympic Games here in London is a great moment . for our Nation, which itself is steeped in sporting history. 'Therefore, . for Catherine, Harry and me there could be no better way of starting . this epic time than being with you here in Rotherhithe, so close to the . heart of London 2012, to launch Coach Core,' he said. The young Royal told of how important coaching is within the sports field. He . said: 'Coaching is a vital part of any sport.  Being properly coached, . really knowing about your sport – how to play it, how to train for it, . how to compete - allows you to enjoy it to the full and gain most value . from it.  Being properly coached is also the key to success, over the . next few weeks we just need to look over the river to see the power of . coaching.   ‬‪‬ . The Duchess of Cambridge tried her hand at judging a judo match - but stopped short of actually joining in with the contact sport . 'Coach Core will offer 16 to 22 year olds the . opportunity to become first class coaches, taught and mentored by . professionals in their field and in turn passing these skills on to . other young people.  Once this year’s pilot scheme is successfully . completed, we hope over the next few years to train hundreds, then . thousands, of young people to become coaches -  and in time, transform . the sporting potential, aspiration and enjoyment of many thousands more . across this Country.‬‪ . 'A . special thank you to all those here today who have already signed up for . the project. Catherine, Harry and I wish you every success in your new . careers as sports coaches.‬‪' William and his brother were dressed . equally casually - well, for male royals - in open neck shirts and . chinos. Harry sported a distinctive patterned African belt and brown . suede shoes. He walked onto the five-a-side football pitch where dozens . of school . children were practising shooting, dribbling and passing skills, and . made two attempts on goal after running through a series of plastic . cones. He . put the first shot 6ft wide and the second over the top of the bar. He . later joked with one girl: 'Obviously it was the shoes.' William and Harry asked a group of about a dozen boys and girls which team they supported. Many answered Arsenal or Chelsea. One boy told William he supported the duke's favourite team, Aston . Villa, to which William replied: 'Good man, good man.' Another boy said . Xavi, the Barcelona and Spain midfielder, was the best in the world. William said: 'He is good, isn't he.' The Duke and Duchess prepare to join in a football games, in which William attempts to score - but blames his shoes when he misses. RIGHT, sharing a joke with Harry . We're game!

"By . James Slack . For 13 years, quangos and public bodies were stuffed with former Labour ministers and activists. The imposition of the party’s supporters on everything from the Food Standards Agency to the broadcast regulator Ofcom began the moment Tony Blair seized power in 1997. Of the senior appointments made that year, an astonishing 75 per cent declared political affiliations for Labour. The Tories were instantly marginalised, with only 13 per cent of posts. Spree: Both former prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, pictured together in 2004, appointed large numbers of known Labour supporters to positions of power . During every one of the New Labour years, more than half of all appointees with declared affiliations were backers of Mr Blair or Gordon Brown. On seven occasions, it was higher than 60 per cent. Significantly, in Mr Brown’s last year, the figure hit 70 per cent - as the party prepared to put in place a ‘government in exile’ that would allow its ideological bedfellows to hold sway over public life even with a Tory prime minister in power. The truth is that however loud Labour squeals about Michael Gove’s ejection of Sally Morgan from her role as head of schools watchdog Ofsted, it remains in control of the unofficial levers of power. This is in part down to David Cameron’s own failure to redress the balance. In a letter remarkable for its hypocrisy, Michael Dugher, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, yesterday claimed non-Tories were being weeded out and replaced with placemen who would ‘support the Government’s political agenda’. The facts tell a very different story: Since 2010, three times more Labour supporters (312) have been appointed to powerful roles in the public sector ‘quangocracy’ than Tories (105). In 2011/12, 77 per cent of those appointed to public bodies with declared affiliations were Labour supporters – worse even than under Mr Blair. Last year, the numbers were more in balance, with Mr Cameron overseeing the appointment of 36 Tories and 33 Labour supporters. But this still amounts to only 37 per cent of public posts being filled by Tories. By contrast, even John Major managed 57 per cent during his last year in office. Here, we look at how Labour – which was spending £64billion a year on 1,162 quangos by 2010 – put its acolytes in control of almost every aspect of British public life.ELECTIONS . Left-winger: Former campaigner Jenny Watson earns £100,000 for a three-day week as head of the Electoral Commission . Jenny Watson has been head of the Electoral Commission, which regulates party donations and organises elections, since 2009. The former left-wing campaigner earns £100,000 for a three-day week. Her partner, Andrew Puddephatt, is a former Labour leader of Hackney Council. She was the last chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission before the creation of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights quango. In 2013, she was re-appointed to her electoral post by the Tories.FORESTSThe Forestry Commission was put into the hands of Pam Warhurst – a former Labour council leader – in one of the final acts of the Brown administration. A quango veteran, she was also given senior jobs in the Countryside Agency, Yorkshire Forward and the Calderdale NHS Trust.ENVIRONMENTFormer Labour culture secretary Chris Smith chairs the Environment Agency, where he has come under repeated fire for the quango’s handling of the Somerset floods. Paid an estimated £100,000 for a three-day week, he was first appointed to the role in 2008. He was re-appointed by then Tory environment secretary Caroline Spelman in 2011. 'Cronyism': Maggie Atkinson's appointment as Children's Commissioner in 2010 was forced through by Ed Balls . CHILDRENFormer teacher Maggie Atkinson was made Children’s Commissioner by Ed Balls in 2010 amid accusations of cronyism. She does not have a declared political affiliation but a Commons committee rejected her appointment as they feared that she would be too obedient to the Labour government. Mr Balls over-ruled them and she remains in post.ARTSLiz Forgan, the chair of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian newspaper, was handed posts in charge of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Heritage Lottery Fund and, from 2009 onwards, the Arts Council England. The ex-BBC and Channel Four executive was a vocal critic of the Coalition’s cuts to the arts budget. There were howls of protest from the left-wing establishment when her contract was not renewed last year.FOODJeff Rooker was the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr from 1974 until 2001 before being given a seat in the House of Lords. He served as an immigration minister during the years the party was presiding over an ‘open door’ policy, before being put in charge of the Food Standards Agency in 2009. His £60,000 part-time role put him in charge of GM foods – despite being a past cheerleader for the controversial technology. Stood down last year. New Labour adviser: Ed Richards worked for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before being given control of Ofcom's £140million budget . MEDIAA senior adviser to both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, Ed Richards was given the job of running the media watchdog Ofcom in 2006. He . presides over nearly 1,000 staff and has a budget of around . £140million. Despite earning £380,000, he ran (unsuccessfully) to be the . director general of the BBC in 2012. The . Corporation remains a favoured destination for men of the Left, . however. The BBC recently appointed the former Labour Cabinet minister . James Purnell as its £295,000-a-year ‘director, strategy and digital’. CONSUMER RIGHTSEx-Labour general secretary and minister Lord (Larry) Whitty was made the chairman of Consumer Focus, the consumer protection watchdog, when it was established in 2007 and paid £48,000 a year for a three-day week. It was swiftly re-branded Consumer Futures. In 2012, ministers announced it was being abolished.HERITAGEBaroness (Kay) Andrews, a former communities minister and former adviser to Gordon Brown was put in charge of English Heritage, which looks after some of the country’s most treasured buildings, in 2009 as Labour packed public bodies with its supporters in the government’s dying days. Her replacement by investment banker Sir Laurie Magnus has been cited by Labour in recent days as an example of a supposed Tory purge, even though he has no affiliation.CHARITIESThe notorious ‘Quango Queen’ Dame Suzi Leather was accused of using her £80,000-a-year (plus perks) job heading the Charity Commission to wage war on private schools, by attempting to strip some of them of their charitable status. The former polytechnic lecturer earned huge sums from the public purse. Her senior quango posts included Consumer Focus, Exeter NHS trust, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Food Standards Agency. Her reign was finally brought to an end in 2012, though last year, she resurfaced as a member of the governing body of the General Medical Council.NHSDame Julie Mellor, the Health Service Commissioner for England, is in charge of handling the most serious complaints against the NHS. A campaigner for greater representation of Labour women in Parliament, she was chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission between 1999 and 2005, and of the Fatherhood Institute between 2004 and 2008. Has held other quango posts, including the National Consumer Council.P.S. David Cameron has continued to give key jobs to Labour supporters and ministers. Examples include former Labour special adviser Simon Stevens, who is the new chief executive of the NHS; former Labour minister Alan Milburn, who is the PM’s social mobility tsar; former Labour minister Lord Hutton, who headed a commission drawing up plans to reform public sector pensions; and the left-wing economist Will Hutton, who was taken on by the Coalition to lead an independent review of fair pay in the public sector in 2010.","For their 13 years in power, more than half of appointees supported Labour .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle have paid $98,169 in taxes on their $481,098 income for the 2013 fiscal year, according to tax returns the White House released Friday. They paid an effective federal income tax rate of 20.4 per cent. The couple's 2013 federal income tax return was posted on the White House website four days before the tax filing deadline. Low point: In 2013, President Obama had the lowest total income that he has had in the past three years since his book sales dropped down to less than half of what they were in 2012 . Forbes notes that sales of the President's book dropped from $258,722 in 2012 down to $104,000 this past year. By comparison, the Obamas reported income of $662,076 and paid $112,214 in federal taxes at a rate of 18.4 percent for 2012. Avoiding the bump: Obama, seen here on Friday in New York, did not have to pay the 'millionaire tax' he implemented because his income was far under the cut off . In 2011, they earned $844,585 while paying $162,074 in federal taxes. After deductions, the couple's adjusted gross income was $608,611 in 2012 and $789,674 in 2011. Obama's annual presidential salary is $400,000. He had planned to return 5 percent of his pay in 2013 as a gesture of solidarity with federal government workers who faced unpaid leave amid deep spending cuts. Obama reported $394,796 in 2013 wages, and it was not immediately clear if or how he returned any portion of those earnings. Because his overall taxable income this year came in at $333,329 that keeps him well below the $450,000 mark where individuals begin being taxed at the raised 39.6 per cent rate that the President boosted in the 'millionaire's tax' that his administration put into effect not long ago. The 42-page document shows the Obamas reported donating $59,251 to 32 charities which equates to 12.3 per cent of their adjusted gross income. That figure is $90,000 less than the . couple donated to charity last year, which may be a result of . his falling book sales. Their largest charitable gift, $8,751, went to the Fisher House Foundation, which supports military families. Among . the Obamas' other notable charitable contributions were $5,000 to the . Sidwell Friends School, the exclusive private school where daughters . Malia and Sasha are enrolled, $4,000 to the American Red Cross and . $2,000 to One Fund Boston, which was created last year to aid victims of . the Boston Marathon bombings. The Obamas also released their Illinois income tax return showing they paid $23,328 in income taxes to their home state. Separately, . Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill paid $96,378 in federal tax . last year on adjusted gross income of $407,009. Giving back: The Obamas gave less to charity this year than previous years since their giving rate has always been reflective of their annual income, but they gave the most to the Fisher House Foundation which supports military families (Michelle seen at one of their events in 2012) They paid an effective federal income tax rate of 23.7 per cent, according to their tax returns. They paid $16,444 in taxes to their home state of Delaware. Jill Biden, a community college professor, also paid $3,470 in income tax to Virginia, where she teaches. The Bidens donated $20,523 to charity last year.","Obamas' total income in 2013 was less than their 2012 and 2011 income .

"By . Reuters . The FBI is probing Herbalife Ltd, the nutrition and weight loss company that hedge fund manager William Ackman has called a pyramid scheme, sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday.The news, first reported by the Financial Times, sparked a sharp sell-off that sent the stock price down nearly 14 percent. One source briefed on the matter said that the investigation has been going on for some time, but declined to give further details. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Boston declined to confirm or deny the investigation. So far no charges have been filed in the matter. Former Herbalife distributors reached by Reuters said they had been contacted by agents who were interested in finding out more about the multilevel marketing company's business practices, including how it recruits new members into its distribution scheme. FBI agents are also reviewing Herbalife documents obtained from former distributors, two other sources familiar with the matter said. Scam? A Herbalife logo is shown on a poster at a clinic in the Mission District in San Francisco, California on April 29, 2013 . Herbalife said on Friday that the company has not received any inquiries from the FBI or the Justice Department about any investigation. But it would not be unusual for law enforcement to investigate a company without telling executives about it. The company has steadfastly denied running a pyramid scheme, where distributors earn more money for recruiting new members into the scheme than they do by selling products to consumers. News of the FBI probe comes roughly a month after Herbalife confirmed that the Federal Trade Commission had issued a civil investigative demand to the company to look more closely at how it works. In January, U.S. Senator Edward Markey called on the FTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the company, in part because of allegations from civil rights groups that Herbalife unfairly targets minorities. Herbalife denies this. The company, which reported sales of $4.8 billion last year, employs a vast network of independent distributors who sell its powders and shakes in more than 80 countries, including China, the company's fastest growing market. For months Herbalife has been a battleground for heavy-hitting investors. Ackman, who runs $13 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management from New York, first called the company a fraud in December 2012 when he unveiled a $1 billion short position against the company. Since then, billionaire investors Carl Icahn, George Soros, Daniel Loeb and William Stiritz have taken the other side of the bet, helping push the stock price up 138 percent last year. Their involvement has comforted other investors that Herbalife will eventually get a clean bill of health, one investor said. Pyramid scheme? Former Herbalife distributors have reportedly been contacted by FBI agents to better understand the company's business practices . But Ackman is sticking by his forecast that the company's share price will eventually fall to zero after regulators start looking at the company more closely. His firm declined to comment on Friday. Pershing Square has published dossiers about Herbalife's top distributors, charging they lure in new recruits with videos featuring big houses and expensive cars even though company statistics show that the majority of distributors never earn any income from Herbalife. Michael Araujo, a Massachusetts resident who tried to set up his own Herbalife distribution business for a year after having been laid off by Bank of America, said his family lost roughly $85,000 on the scheme. He said he spent about $4,000 a month buying business leads and purchased $7,000 worth of Herbalife products. ""They target people who are desperate,"" Araujo said in a telephone interview, about the company's sales tactics. Meanwhile Tish Rochin, a distributor in Texas who went from driving a truck to saying she became a millionaire thanks to Herbalife, said it is 'simple but hard work' to become wealthy by selling the company's products. This year Herbalife's stock price has tumbled 34.6 percent, kicked lower first by news that Senator Markey was involving himself. Last month news that the FTC opened an investigation hastened the fall. On Friday, the company's stock price closed at $51.48.","FBI is reportedly probing Herbalife Ltd, a nutrition and weight loss company but so far no charges have been filed .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Stock markets sank for a second straight day Friday on fears earnings growth is faltering. Weaker than expected results at JPMorgan Chase dragged bank stocks lower while sell-offs in tech stocks once feared to be on the verge of a bubble pushed the Nasdaq composite - down for the third week in a row - to levels not seen in months. 'The market has been trying to come back, but each time the selling just picks up,' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential. 'The buyers are just not stepping in.' Many analysts believe the drop is part of a market correction that has been long overdue. On the floor: Specialist Anthony Rinaldi works at his post Friday on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . The bears were out early after before-the-open news that JPMorgan had missed analysts' earnings estimates. Investors worried that technology shares were overvalued dumped them for a second day, with some of the biggest gainers of late falling sharply. Facebook fell 1.1 per cent, after a 5 per cent drop during Thursday trading. Netflix fell 2.4 per cent, Amazon, 1.7 per cent and Google's new Class C shares, 1.9 per cent. 'A lot of investors were long the momentum trade,' Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist told CNBC. 'All of last year's big winners -- biotech, Internet stocks, this is where you've seen the biggest reversal; that momentum trade has basically been broken.' The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index sank 1.3 per cent to 3,999.73, the first time it has dropped below 4,000 since February 3. The index was down 3.1 per cent for the week, it's worst since June 2012, CNBC noted. 'There's a lot of uneasiness about how far and fast the market ran last year, so any piece of news, even a single earnings report, can have a contagion effect,' Dorothy Weaver, co-founder of Collins Capital, told the network. Trader: Joseph Lawler, center, works on the floor as indexes drop for the week . Investors are jittery after stocks price surges outpaced earnings growth - the fundamentals did not back the rise in both the tech and banking sectors. The Dow Jones industrial average fell . 143.47 points, or 0.89 per cent, to 16,026.75. The broader S&P 500 fell 17.39 . points, or 0.95 per cent, to 1,815.69. Dropping stocks outpaced those rising on the New York Stock Exchange by a two to one margin. Financial analysts expect earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to drop 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, according to FactSet, a financial data provider. At the start of the year, they expected a jump of 4.3 per cent. If profits do fall, it would be only the second quarterly drop in the past three years as the country has desperately tried to claw its way back from the Great Recession. 'Earnings are going to come in on the sloppy side,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. 'The market needs to correct,' he added. A market correction is a sharp downturn in stocks that brings them off highs to where market sentiment believes they belong, but it is not seen as negatively as a bear market - which is what occurred in 2008 at the onset of the recession. In a crowd: Trader Michael Zicchinolfi, center, is surrounded Friday by other traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . 'We're about 7 per cent from the highs, so we're creeping towards what you would classify as a correction, so I wouldn't be surprised, but I don't think we're heading towards bear market territory,' trading firm ConvergEx Group's Peter Coleman told CNBC. All ten industry sectors in the S&P 500 dropped. Consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, down 1.4 per cent, and technology stocks were the third-biggest decliner, down 1.2 per cent. Earnings last year for S&P 500 companies rose 6 per cent, but individual stocks rose much faster — to the tune of nearly 30 per cent for the index as a whole. Stocks continued to rise as the Federal Reserve's bond buying program designed to stimulate the economy largely benefited Wall Street. The slowing, or 'tapering,' of the bond buying has also soured market sentiment as of late. 'Investors haven't worried about earnings because it hasn't mattered. Fundamentals haven't mattered,' said Prudential's Krosby. 'All that has mattered ... is what is the Federal Reserve was going to do.' She said a 10 per cent correction from highs would be healthy for the market, and give it a sturdier base on which to rally. Happy days: Zoes Kitchen President and CEO Kevin Miles, center, and company CFO Jason Morgan, left, applaud as their Initial Public Offering begins trading Friday . The Nasdaq is already well on its way. It is now 8 per cent below its recent high in March. The S&P 500 is off 4 per cent from its recent high on April 2. JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank by assets, fell $2.10 Friday, or 3.7 per cent, to $55.30. The firm announced earnings slid 20 per cent in the first quarter as revenue from bond trading and mortgage lending declined, a sign the housing market may be cooling more than expected. 'They're just struggling to grow, and then they didn't have the strength out of the investment bank to help offset that,' said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst for Edward Jones. 'All around, it's just a lackluster quarter for them.' Bad results at JPMorgan Chase are seen as a harbinger for worse results across the industry. Issues outside the finance and tech sectors also made major news during the last trading day of the disappointing week. General Motors dropped $1.37, or 4.1 per cent, to $31.93 after it said it must fix a second ignition part in compact cars it is recalling for switch problems. It said the fix will increase its first-quarter recall costs above $1 billion. Gap Inc. fell 89 cents, or 2.3 per cent, to $38.40. The San Francisco-based company, which owns the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brands, said revenue for stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent. Zoe's Kitchen, a restaurant chain, soared 65 per cent in its trading debut. The stock gained $9.72 to $24.72.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . Two associates of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez were indicted Friday on murder charges in the shooting death last summer of Odin Lloyd. A grand jury in Bristol County indicted both Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in the June 2013 killing of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said, and their lawyers are blasting the moves. Ortiz and Wallace, who are from Bristol, Conn., where Hernandez grew up, had previously been charged with accessory to murder after the fact and pleaded not guilty. They had been ordered held on $500,000 bail on the older charges and remained in custody. Charged: Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz . 'Ernest Wallace did not shoot or kill anyone,' lawyer David Meier told the Boston Globe in his client's defense. 'he nature and timing of this new charge against Mr. Wallace speaks for itself. 'One can only ask, is it based on the facts and the law, or something else? Ernest Wallace looks forward to confronting his accusers in a court of law.' Ortiz's lawyer, John Connors, said he had . not seen the indictment but called it 'totally ridiculous.' He said, as . he had in the past, that Ortiz was 'just along for the ride' with . Hernandez, Wallace and Lloyd on the night Lloyd was killed. 'We started out having a gun [charge], then accessory after the fact [of murder], and now we’re up to first-degree murder,' Connors told the Globe. 'This is absolutely crazy.' Connors insisted the district attorney's office has strung his client along, charging him first with a weapons violation, then accusing him of being an accessory. 'It almost looks to me like they felt . they couldn't use him as a witness, (so) they're going to charge him?' he said. 'Why wouldn't they have done this months ago? There's no new . evidence in this matter.' Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to . murder in the killing of Lloyd, a 27-year-old Boston resident who was . dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Jenkins, who testified before the grand jury, has been charged with perjury in the case. Hernandez's . cousin Tanya Singleton, who refused to testify, has been charged with . criminal contempt and conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact. Both have pleaded not guilty. Joint venture: Experts believe that charging both Ortiz and Wallace makes it easier to win a conviction against Hernandez because prosecutors no longer have to prove the former Patriot pulled the trigger - it only has to prove he was aware of the murder and did nothing to stop it or present when it happened . The . district attorney's office said Friday that Ortiz and Wallace would be . arraigned in Fall River Superior Court on the new charges at a date yet . to be scheduled. The office said it would have no further comment on the . indictments until then. Questions have been raised about the . reliability of Ortiz as a witness. Prosecutors say he has told . authorities that he didn't see who shot Lloyd but that Hernandez and . Lloyd were alone outside the car. That's different from his initial . story, in which, according to court records, he told police that . Hernandez and Wallace got out with Lloyd. The Globe reported that these indictments allow the state to charge Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace under the 'joint venture law.' 'Defendants can be convicted of murder if they were present at the time of a slaying, knew that a killing was about to take place, or aided or encouraged it in any way,' the paper explained. Gerard T. Leone Jr., a former district attorney now working in private practice, told the Globe that the credibility of any testimony from Ortiz or Wallace can be called into question - but also that the indictments make it easier to win a murder conviction. 'It’s a much more difficult case to have Hernandez as the sole person charged with murder,' he said. 'You have no joint venture theory against people who are charged with different charges and not the murder.' Another lawyer agreed, telling the Globe jurors 'might be puzzled as to why he’s the one holding the bag, if all three of them were together.' Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found by a jogger in an industrial park in North Attleborough. Prosecutors have said Hernandez was upset with Lloyd for talking at a nightclub to some people with whom he had problems. They have not identified who they believe pulled the trigger. A message was left for Wallace's attorney, David Meier. Wallace has been described by prosecutors as Hernandez's 'right-hand man.'

"By . Alex Greig . Canadian police have charged a woman with human trafficking for allegedly blackmailing her roommate into prostitution. Amanda Kathleen McGee, 31, offered an 18-year-old newly arrived in Calgary from her home in British Columbia cheap rent in her apartment. It's alleged McGee then began slipping drugs into alcoholic drinks the pair were consuming, waiting until the young woman was unconscious then taking sexually explicit photos of her. Accused: Amanda McGee, 31, is accused of blackmailing her young roommate into prostitution . McGee then used the images to blackmail the 18-year-old into becoming a sex worker. According to CBC News, the 18-year-old arrived in Calgary in October 2013 for a job and met McGee while looking for a place to live. Concerned about her welfare, in January the woman's family asked local police to check on her. Police located the young woman at a bus station on January 11, attempting to return home. She told officers that she had been held against her will and forced into prostitution by Amanda McGee, her roommate. 'I would suspect the family may have had information that she was attempting to travel back to her home residence,' acting staff sergeant Mike Saunders told the Calgary Herald. 'My understanding is she was trying to get away from the situation, return to family and friends.' Write caption here . Police say McGee told the woman she would show the explicit photographs to her family and friends if she did not participate in sex acts for money. McGee advertised the woman's services on social media, and clients would meet her at the home she shared with McGee. The landlord of McGee, also her neighbor, said she didn't notice anything untoward occurring at the home. ""[I'm] totally surprised. We had no inkling at all that anything was going on over there,"" Sharon Lawton told CBC News. Lawton said McGee told her that the 18-year-old was her young cousin. McGee . is also facing charges of extortion relating to a second victim. The . female victim was allegedly a client of the 18-year-old girl and the . pair were secretly filmed engaging in sex acts by McGee. Cheap rent: The alleged crimes occurred in this apartment block, where McGee and the victim lived together . The 31-year-old then used that footage to blackmail the woman. Saunders did not elaborate on what McGee was forcing the victim to do. Saunders said the second victim will not be charged for procuring a prostitute. Amanda McGee is facing nine charges: trafficking in persons, administering a noxious substance to aggrieve or annoy, living on the avails of prostitution, keeping a common bawdy house, sexual assault with a weapon, forcible confinement, procuring a person to become a prostitute, extortion and voyeurism. She is currently in custody and will appear in court Tuesday. The victim is being supported by family and members of the vice unit.","Amanda McGee, 31, is accused of forcing her 18-year-old roommate into prostitution .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Texas jury sentenced Ana Trujillo Friday to life in prison for fatally stabbing her boyfriend with the five-and-a-half-inch stiletto heel of her shoe, striking him at least 25 times in the face and head. Trujillo was convicted of murder Tuesday by the same jury for killing 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson during an argument last June at his Houston condominium. Defense attorneys argued that Trujillo, 45, was defending herself from an attack by Andersson, who was a University of Houston professor and researcher. Scroll down for video . Headed for prison: Ana Trujillo sobs as she listens to closing arguments in the punishment phase of her trial on Friday, which concluded with her being sentenced to a life in prison . Plea for mercy: Trujillo's attorney, Jack Carroll (left), asked jurors to give her a two-year sentence . Trujillo could be seen silently weeping when her sentence was handed down. ‘I never meant to hurt him,’ Trujillo said before the judge made the jury's decision final. ‘It was never my intent. I loved him. I wanted to get away. I never wanted to kill him.’ Andersson's niece, lva Olofsson, said the family was pleased with the outcome of the trial. ‘My uncle was a great man. He was kind. He didn't deserve what happened to him. We are happy that justice is served,’ she said. During closing arguments in the trial's punishment phase, prosecutor John Jordan asked jurors for the maximum sentence: life in prison. Jordan said Trujillo not only violently killed Andersson but tried to ruin his character during the trial by falsely claiming he had abused her. ‘Send the message that in our community, when you beat a man to death for no reason, when you come into a courtroom and you slaughter his good name ... that we in Texas are going to hold you accountable,’ Jordan said. Trujillo's attorney, Jack Carroll, asked jurors to find that his client acted in the heat of sudden passion, which would limit her sentence to between two and 20 years. Carroll asked jurors to give her a two-year sentence. In her own words: Ana Trujillo testifies during the punishment phase of her trial on Thursday, two days after she was convicted of killing her boyfriend with a shoe . Emotional: Trujillo told the jurors she killed him in a desperate attempt to save her own life during a brutal fight of more than an hour . Narrative: The 45-year-old convicted killer said she was chased down, knocked into a wall and thrown over a couch by the victim . ‘Ms. Trujillo needs mercy right now,’ he said. During Carroll's closing argument, Trujillo began sobbing. She later stated: 'I respect their [jurors'] decision, but it was self-defense. I loved him and never wanted to kill him.' During . their deliberations Friday, jurors asked to look at several pieces of . evidence, including the blue suede stiletto heel — a size 9 platform . pump. They reached . agreement on a sentence after more than four hours of deliberations, and . also found that the crime was not done in the heat of sudden passion. Prosecutors . argued Friday that Trujillo didn't kill Andersson in a moment of sudden . passion but that his slaying was a vicious murder in which she pinned . him down and repeatedly stabbed him with her shoe while he never fought . back. Trujillo, 45, took the witness stand in Houston for the first time Thursday during the two-week trial as part of the punishment phase. Victimized: During more than five hours of testimony, Trujillo said that she had been repeatedly abused by men . Blood on her hands: Trujillo testified that she did not realize how badly she injured her boyfriend until she looked at her gore-covered hands . Trujillo's attorneys said Andersson attacked her and she defended herself with the only weapon she had available, her shoe. During . more than five hours of rambling testimony by mid-afternoon Thursday, Trujillo . said that she had been repeatedly abused by men, including sexual . assault by her first husband. Trujillo told jurors Andersson became enraged and she fought for her life during a fight that lasted more than an hour. She said she tried to calm him down, but Andersson started yelling at her and Trujillo realized she could not talk him down. ‘I . became frightened. I did fear for my life. I felt he lost it,’ she . said, adding that she started striking him with the shoe anywhere she . could. ‘Why did you keep on hitting him?’ her attorney Jack Carroll asked. ‘He wouldn't let go of my leg. The pain wouldn't stop,’ she said. Reenactment: Defense attorney Jack Carroll, left, and Ana Trujillo demonstrate the fight that led to a fatal stabbing . When asked by her attorney, Jack Carroll (pictured), why she kept striking her lover with the shoe, Trujillo replied that he would not let go of her leg . Trujillo said that at first she hit him on his back and on his arms, then on his head as a last resort. ‘I had no idea I was hurting him that . badly,’ she said. ‘I reached over and said, “Oh God, what happened?” I . reached over and my hands were full of blood.’ She . also told jurors that Andersson, a native of Sweden, was a heavy drinker who refused to eat . and whose mental and physical health began to deteriorate. She said she became afraid of him because at night he would wake up angry, disoriented and start yelling. When . asked by her lawyer, Mr Carroll, why she didn't leave Andersson, . Trujillo said: 'Because I loved him and I wanted him to get better. I . wanted him to stop drinking so much.' Ana Trujillo reacts after being found guilty of killing her boyfriend, after the jury deliberated less than two hours, on Tuesday in Houston, Texas . But during the testimony, Trujillo did not discuss Andersson in great detail. During often meandering testimony, . Trujillo told jurors she had a history of being sexually or physically . abused by men. She said she had been sexually assaulted by her first . husband and told jurors that another boyfriend had kicked her in the . stomach when she was pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. Trujillo was found guilty this week of killing Alf Stefan Andersson with her stiletto shoe . Trujillo described being attacked in an incident reminiscent of Andersson's slaying. She told jurors a friend in 2009 had tried to rape her in his apartment, pinning her down and that she used the only weapon within reach - a candlestick - to fend him off. Trujillo's former friend testified Wednesday that it was Trujillo who knocked him out with the candlestick in an unprovoked attack. No charges were filed related to that incident. She also discussed her upbringing, including growing up in Arizona after being born in Mexico, and her various jobs, including massage therapist, club bouncer and artist. Witnesses presented by prosecutors in the punishment phase . detailed Trujillo's criminal history or firsthand experiences in which she . became violent toward them when she drank. Trujillo was arrested twice for . drunk driving. She had been drinking the night of Andersson's death but her . blood alcohol level was not tested, according to testimony. A psychologist testifying for the . defense told jurors Trujillo had been in a series of violent or abusive . relationships, including with Andersson, and she was acting in . self-defense on the night of the slaying. Jurors on Wednesday also heard from Anderson's family and friends, who testified that he was a good person who wouldn't hesitate to help anyone and that they were still trying to understand his violent death.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Every parent's worst nightmare: Three-year-old Emma Varnadoe is in critical condition after the horrific incident . A three-year-old North Carolina girl was rushed to the hospital Thursday after a lawn mower severed most of her left leg and the foot off her right one. Emma Varnadoe is in critical condition at Levine Children’s Hospital, in Charlotte, a spokesperson told MailOnline. She is expected to have surgery Saturday. Grandmother Pam Wade told WSOC that the amputations occurred as she ran to her grandfather as he mowed the backyard on a riding lawnmower and somehow came in contact with the blades. ‘We're asking for prayers,’ she added. ‘Please pray for her recovery.’ The incident occurred around 3.00 p.m. Thursday, according to the station. First responders immediately made the decision to have her taken to Levine, about 35 miles south of Wade’s China Grove home. Footage from WSOC’s report showed the tractor sitting exactly where it was when it struck the young girl. The lawnmower severed her left leg off just below the knee and also removed most of her right foot, family told the station. It appeared to be rounding a tree as the tragic events unfolded, her grandfather may not have seen her running towards him. A neighbor told the station how hard the incident has been on the close-knit community. Dangerous: The tractor is still sitting exactly where it was as the incident unfloded . ‘Some of us up here [have] not slept all night long,’ said Sherrie Rowell-Monnell. The woman began crying as she described young Emma. ‘Gorgeous, gorgeous, playful… pretty blonde hair,’ she continued. She also pleaded with people to be more careful around machinery. ‘Keep your kids, grandkids away from push mowers, riding mowers.’ The hospital declined to provide any further information, and a person who answered the phone at a number listed to the Wades was hung up immediately.","Emma Varnadoe is in critical condition in a Charlotte, North Carolina children's hospital .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Trying to spot your friend in a crowded room can be tricky. Your brain has to retrieve the memory of their face, and then hold it in place while scanning the crowd. But the brain is able to make the task simpler by paying special attention to objects, according to a new study. Scroll down for video... Researchers at MIT have identified a brain circuit that¿s key to shifting our focus from one object to another. Screen shots from a video of overlapping images of faces and houses, shown to subjects who were asked to pay attention to one or the other . Scientists in Massachusetts have found that a part of the brain, known as the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), controls visual processing areas for objects. They hope their understanding of the process behind concentration could someday develop techniques that will help people with short attention spans focus more easily. Currently, scientists know much less about object-based attention, such as recognising a face, than spatial attention, which involves focusing on what's happening in a particular location. ‘The interactions are surprisingly similar to those seen in spatial attention,’ said Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Robert Desimone. ‘It seems like it's a parallel process involving different areas.’ If you can’t resist the chance to put on a bet, blame your insula. Scientists think that when this brain area is overactive, the heart rules our head and we can’t help but chase our losses. The Cambridge University researchers said: ‘Future treatments for gambling addiction could seek to reduce this hyperactivity, either by drugs or psychological techniques.’ The researchers made the link after asking people with various brain injuries and healthy people play slot machine and roulette-style computer games. A near miss on the slot machines made the players, except those with the damaged insulas, extra-keen to try their luck again. Similarly, the scientists found that all of the players, apart from those with faulty insulas, made a common mistake when they played roulette. MIT researchers used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to scan human subjects as they viewed a series of overlapping images of faces and houses. Unlike functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is commonly used to measure brain activity, MEG can reveal the precise timing of neural activity, down to the millisecond. The researchers presented the overlapping streams at two different rhythms — two images per second and 1.5 images per second — allowing them to identify brain regions responding to those images. Each subject was told to pay attention to either faces or houses; because the houses and faces were in the same spot, the brain could not use spatial information to distinguish them. The researchers found in both types of focus, the prefrontal cortex - the control centre for most brain functions - appears to take charge. When the subjects were told to look for faces, activity in different regions of the brain became synchronised, suggesting that they were communicating with each other. MIT researchers used magnetoencephalography (pictured) to scan human subjects as they viewed a series of overlapping images of faces and houses . When the subjects paid attention to houses, the IFJ synchronised with a region known as the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which interprets information about places. The researchers believe that the IFJ holds onto the idea of the object that the brain is looking for and directs the correct part of the brain to look for it. MIT scientists are now studying how the brain shifts its focus between different types of sensory input, such as vision and hearing. They are also investigating whether it might be possible to train people to better focus their attention by controlling the brain interactions involved in this process.","Study identified a brain circuit that shifts focus between different objects .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Partying with beautiful women, racing European supercars and stealing selfies with Paris Hilton, the sons and friends of Mexico's most feared drug lords are not shy in keeping the world up to date with their exploits through Instagram and Twitter. While countless people were killed just because they had seen reclusive Mexican Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán Loera, his sons Alfred and Ivan Guzman appear to have no such worries. Advertizing their ill-gotten wealth, no doubt bought with drug money from North America's most feared trafficking organization, Alfred and Ivan are joined showing off online by Serafin Zambada and Mayito Zambada - the sons of  Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada Garcia, who was El Chapo's right hand man. Sharing through social media with them is Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa, or El Chino Anthrax, the hitman for the New Generation Cartel, who was arrested in December in Amsterdam, shortly after posting a seflie of him and an unaware Paris Hilton. Fast cars: Ivan Guzman is not shy about his racy life - showing off this supercar meet that appears to be made up only of Lamborghini's, Porsche's and Ferrari's . The less than discreet Twitter and Instagram accounts updated by the next generation of Mexico's deadly and dangerous drug cartels are a platform for them to threaten and to boast. They update their feeds with pictures of their luxury cars, holding silver and gold embossed automatic weapons and posing up with scantily clad women. Other shots show them parading their lion cubs and in other more frightening photographs, the personal armed guards they control which do their bidding. Indeed, while tens of thousands have died during Mexico's bloody narcotics violence, the sons of the cartel leaders seem happy to show the world their collections of Porsche's and Ferrari's. Designer pets: Alfredo Guzman boasts not only of his Bentley motor car but the fact he is happy for a lion cub to scratch it . Beer, pool and drugs: Alfredo is very keen to show off what constitutes a lazy day for him . Brought down by partying: El Chino Anthrax posted these boastful pictures of him and beautiful women and himself in his terrifying war gear . There are even risqué references to the plight of their father, who was apprehended after 13-years on the run and in hiding in February. A blurry picture El Chapo is shown in a forrested area - just three months before authorities captured him in the coastal city of Mazatlan. Of course their drugs and their money is blatantly put on display, as is their boasts of using bullet-proof glass in their supercars. However, the sons of the drug cartel leaders would be well advised to heed the fate of their friend, El Chino Anthrax. Incriminating: This ill-advised selfie with Paris Hilton - who was totally unaware of who was next to her - helped lead authorities to El Chino Anthrax . Expensive pet and drive: Alfredo Guzman and his pet lion make a great pairing for his brother Ivan and his Ferrari and golden automatic weapon . Not so glamorous: This man is one of the many killed in Mexico's bloody narcotics war and the body was posted by Alfredo Guzman . Silver, gold and a cheetah: Serafin Zambada shows off his plated Ak-47s while Alfredo Guzman seems to have acquired another big cat for a pet . He was the suspected top enforcer for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and is currently awaiting extradition to Southern California on drug charges. Anthrax is suspected top enforcer for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel . Several folk songs, known as narcocorridos, mention 'El Chino Anthrax' as an elegant and fit man with a taste for sports cars, yachts and Champagne. While it si not clear the exact role social media played in Arechiga's arrest but the International Business Times reported the information garnered provided important clues about his movements and contacts. Arechiga is a right-hand man of Sinaloa bosses Ismael Zambada and Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. Brothers: On the left is Ivan Guzman in a profile picture from his Twitter account while on the right is Alfredo Guzman . Rare: This image of El Chapo - Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán - was posted by the Guzman brothers in October - three months before their father was arrested in Mexico . Disturbing: This teddy bear and automatic weapon is one of the many questionable pictures uploaded by the Guzman brothers to Twitter along with piles of money made from the drugs trade . His identity was initially kept secret by Dutch police, who simply said they'd arrested a 33-year-old Mexican man on behalf of U.S. authorities. His name was later leaked to the Associated Press by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the case. He is being held in a Dutch jail, pending his extradition to the U.S. El Chapo was taken into custody in February after a wiretap being monitored by ICE agents in Southern Arizona provided the final clue to Guzman's whereabouts days after he narrowly avoided capture in Culiacan, the capitol of Mexico's Sinaloa state. Since Guzman's arrest some lawmakers have pressed for his extradition. He faces multiple indictments in the United States, including in Chicago, New York and San Diego. John Feeley, principal deputy at the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said the Justice Department is the lead agency in asking for Guzman's extradition but the U.S. 'will be in discussions with the Mexicans.' 'But it may not result in immediate transfer,' Feeley said. Protected: This is bullet proof glass to protect the Guzman brothers from the Sinaloa cartel's many enemies . Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican, complained that those discussions should already be taking place. Broun said he worried that Mexico may be unable to keep Guzman jailed or prevent him from continuing to run his drug empire from jail. Guzman was convicted in Mexico of drug and other offenses in the early 1990s and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in 2001. 'This is a question of trust and confidence in our partnership,' Feeley said. 'We have every trust and confidence that the Mexicans are able to hold him.' U.S. law enforcement officials and the Homeland Security Department have long touted the relationship with their Mexican counterparts. But in the early days of Pena Nieto's term in 2013, his government ordered that all contact with U.S. law enforcement would go through 'a single window.' Sergio Alcocer, deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said at the time that all contact would be channeled through the federal Interior Ministry, the agency that controls security and domestic policy.","Alfred and Ivan Guzman are two of the sons of Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán Loera - the head of the Sinaola cartel in Mexico .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The bodies of three American servicemen who went missing in action more than 40 years ago during the Vietnam War have been returned to the U.S. after being discovered in Cambodia. The remains, in three white coffins draped with U.S. flags, were hoisted Wednesday into a C-17 military cargo plane for transport to Hawaii, where they will undergo DNA testing to try to confirm their identities. An honor guard of four currently serving U.S. servicemen carried the coffins. ‘As the son of a combat helicopter pilot who served in Vietnam twice, I am truly privileged to be a part of this important ceremony,’ U.S. Ambassador William Todd said in a speech at Phnom Penh International Airport in which he also thanked the Cambodian government for its assistance in searching for the missing. Honoring fallen comrades: American military service personnel in Cambodia pay their respects to one of the three coffins that were being flown back to the U.S. to determine the identities of the corpses that have been found . ‘To my fellow Americans assembled here today, I am humbled and honored to join with you to pay respect to our fellow countrymen who put our nation's needs above their very lives,’ Todd said. ‘Today, we honor colleagues who died far from home and whom we never knew.’ Some 90 Americans were listed as missing in action in Cambodia from the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975, but the remains of only 37 have been recovered and identified. The latest sets of remains were found in eastern Kampong Cham province. U.S. forces staged a brief ground incursion into eastern Cambodia in 1970 and bombed the country heavily from 1969 to 1973.

A year ago, the Pentagon announced the burial at Arlington National Cemetery of the fragmentary remains of a Marine who perished in a failed helicopter rescue from Cambodia of the crew of the merchant ship Mayaguez in May 1975, an incident that is considered the last U.S. military engagement in the long Vietnam War. Their helicopter crashed after coming under heavy fire; 13 aboard were rescued at sea and 13 others were declared missing. Remains of 12 other U.S. servicemen who also were aboard the helicopter had been accounted for previously, following a series of searches off the coast of Cambodia. The latest remains were repatriated just two days after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he is establishing a new Pentagon agency with more focused authority and innovative approaches to account for missing U.S. war dead. ¿As the son of a combat helicopter pilot who served in Vietnam twice, I am truly privileged to be a part of this important ceremony,¿ U.S. Ambassador William Todd said in a speech at Phnom Penh International Airport . The Pentagon has been under congressional pressure for months to take decisive action to improve the POW-MIA accounting effort. Its failings were highlighted last summer when The Associated Press disclosed an internal Pentagon report that said the search for remains of missing soldiers on foreign battlefields was mismanaged, wasteful and acutely dysfunctional. After lengthy study, Hagel decided to combine the functions of the two leading agencies in this field — the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command, based in Hawaii, and the Defense POW-MIA Office, based in the Pentagon. Those two organizations will disappear; the new agency will be directed by a civilian official not yet named.","Three unidentified remains have been found in the Kampong Cham province in eastern Cambodia .

"By . Emily Kent Smith . A couple has been handed a £900 bill from Virgin Media for pornography over a five-year period - despite the fact that they insist they have never ordered any. Ann, 72, and Ron Hayward, 75, who live in a one-bedroom bedsit in Stockport, Cheshire, now have no internet or television because the provider have accused the couple of 'abusing' services. The great-grandparents first received a bill for almost £200 in 2009, and another £200 last week. They were also sent another letter ordering them to pay more than £500 for blue films. Scroll down for video . Annie and Ron Hayward are pictured with their £900 bill from Virgin Media,  racked up over five years for films they say they have not watched . Adult channels paid for through Virgin media cost £5.99 for a 16 hour period. Users can also buy a monthly subscription package to channels such as Playboy TV for a monthly fee of £11. For the price of the bill, the couple could have watched 150 16-hour stints through different channels or a total of 2,404 hours of pornography - the equivalent of 100 days. But the pensioners, who live in a quiet housing block for elderly residents, were adamant they had never ordered, let alone watched, the pornographic films. The company then agreed to waive the bills and said they would remove the ‘on demand’ feature. It was not until they upgraded their service to Virgin’s latest 'TiVo' box last month that they reluctantly agreed to reactivate their on demand services, and problems resurfaced. Mrs Hayward said: 'Because of what happened before, we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time' The TiVo box allows viewers to record up to 500 hours of television. Mrs Hayward, 72, said: 'Because of what happened before, we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time. 'The lady I spoke to promised me that we had absolutely nothing to worry about and that there was no way it could happen again. 'After a couple of days a message appeared on the TV saying ‘channels unavailable’ and I had a feeling something wasn’t right - that’s one of the things that happened the last time. 'I started to get a bit worried so I called them the next day, just to be told that I had ordered more than £200 worth of films. 'I was in complete shock - I just couldn’t believe it was happening to us all over again after they reassured us that everything would be okay.' Pictured: The Virgin TiVo box can record up to 500 hours of television. When the couple subscribed to the box (not this one pictured), problems resurfaced . Last week, the elderly couple received another bill for watching dozens of 18-rated films a day - costing more than £200. Virgin staff have now told the Haywards that all of their services will be cancelled because ‘they are abusing the service’ - and they have until 9th May to find a new provider for their telephone, broadband and TV. Retired nursery nurse Mrs Hayward said: 'I told them I’m not paying a penny of these bills - they insist it is us, but they won’t even tell us what time the films have supposedly been downloaded. 'I just feel like I am being ignored and it makes me so mad that this big company can just brush off their customers like that. 'Just because they can’t find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us. 'We are retired and in our 70s, we can’t afford to pay out to have everything installed again.' The pair has a large family with five sons, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren but both Mr and Mrs Hayward are adamant that no one else has had access to the television. To watch adult films through Virgin, the user has to enter an adult pincode. Mrs Hayward added: 'We live alone in a small bedsit, in a secure residential complex - no one else has access to our flat. Mrs Hayward said: 'Just because they can't find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us.' 'If we lived in a big house with a big family then maybe I could understand it, as you couldn’t know what was happening in every room. 'You wouldn’t believe the conversations we have had to have with our family, friends and neighbours about it all. 'There is obviously something wrong with the technology or someone somewhere is hacking into our services, and if it can happen to us it can happen to anyone. 'Virgin just keep insisting that the . films have been bought using our box and that it must be us doing it. But it isn’t as if someone has been sneaking in and out of our flat. 'The . whole situation is just ridiculous. I am just completely gobsmacked, . they were supposed to have made the situation better for us, but they . have just made it worse.' Dana Hashem, from Virgin Media, said: 'These films were unquestionably watched by someone in the Haywards’ home.

"By . Richard Spillett . The death-defying bravery of a daredevil First World War pilot has been revealed after his diaries, log-books and photos were brought together in one collection. Aviation pioneer Major Robert Loraine shot to fame as one of Britain's best-loved pilots at the beginning of last century, when he became the first person to fly across the Irish Channel and the first to land on the Isle of Wight in 1910. He was also the first to fly in a rainstorm, when he took to the air wearing nothing more than a pair of goggles with his flying suit for protection, and sent the first ever radio message in flight. The Oxford English dictionary at the time credited him with the first use of the word 'joystick' in 1909, which he used in his diary because of the joy he got from flying. The dashing pilot - said to have been popular with ladies of the time - . used his expert flying skills to climb the ranks of the recently-formed . Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and even landed one of his planes after being shot in the neck. He was awarded the Distinguished Service . Order in 1917, but a year later his military career was brought to an end . when he was shot in the leg. The . x-rays of his injured limb . are thought to have been carried out by Marie Curie, who had a mobile . unit where he was treated. After leaving the Flying Corps, the married father-of-three went on to star in a handful of films and Broadway shows, before he passed away in 1935, aged 59. An enormous collection of his log books, photos, maps and newspaper cuttings - along with the x-rays taken of his leg - has now been brought together by historian Jim Hine, 60, who is planning to sell the collection for an estimated £25,000 at a book sale later this month. Mr Hine, of Ilminster, Somerset, said: 'He was a really gung-ho character, larger than life. He really was very brave. These planes were very susceptible to engine failure and if you ditched into the sea there was no chance of getting picked up. 'He was able to get so many firsts because it was the very early days of flying. The Wright brothers were literally flying for the first time just a few years before - it was real seat of the pants stuff.'

He was one the first into the air during the war after mastering flight in the Bristol Boxkite (right) His adventures in early aircraft came with considerable dangers, and he is pictured here, wounded (far left), after a crash in a Bleriot plane . Loraine, from Cheshire, served as a volunteer in the Boer War between 1899 and 1901 before a stint on Broadway until he took up aviation in France in 1909. He is pictured here in his Farman biplane around 1910 . In 1910, he piloted one of two Bristol Boxkites in British Army manoeuvres on Salisbury Plain, during which he sent the first radio message from the air in Britain while flying over Stonehenge . Loraine and his friends inspect the site of one of his many crashes in early aircraft before the start of the First World War . During the First World War, Loraine (circled) climbed the ranks of the Royal Flying Corps. His gallant efforts earned him the Military Cross for shooting down an albatross biplane in 1915 with 'conspicuous gallantry and skill' After he was shot in the leg in 1917, these x-rays were taken of his leg and are thought to have been carried out by Marie Curie . Robert Loraine's private pilot's license from his time in the USA, dated Oct 23rd 1933. He spent time working as an actor in the US after retiring from the military. A press cutting written around his time of death in December 1935 says: 'Robert Loraine will be remembered as one of the handsomest romantic actors of the present century.' An enormous collection of Loraine's log books, photos, aviation maps and newspaper cuttings were brought together by amateur historian Jim Hine, who is selling the documents at a book fair at Oxford Brookes University later this month . One of Loraine's more dramatic crashes is documented in a photo taken just before the First World War (left) and a caricature of Robert Loraine from 1910 (right).

"By . Luke Garratt . CCTV has been released of the shocking moments when a gang terrorised post office staff with a gun and a knife in a daylight raid on the £20,000 contents of a security van. The footage shows two masked robbers armed with a gun and a knife entering a post office in Halton, West Yorkshire just after a security van arrives to replenish the cash machine. The members of the gang who took the cash box from the post office worker have now been jailed for a total of 40 years. Scroll down for video... The members of the gang who carried out the terrifying daylight raid were all eventually caught thanks to CCTV footage and the safeguards of the cash box they stole . Throughout the whole ordeal, the terrified guard and post office staff are crammed into a corner as the masked men point the knife and handgun at them. The they appear to lead the helmet-wearing post office worker who was delivering the cash box outside, before heading back to their car. A short clip at the end of the footage, taken from the secure van, shows the men calmly get back into a silver Vauxhall with fake number plates and and speed away with the cash box. The large man wielding the knife in the footage is Ryan Patterson, 29, one of three men who was sentenced to jail at Leeds Crown Court, alongside Matthew Richardson, 29, and Gavin Ross, 28. The post office worker calmly leaves his secure van to replenish the cash inside the cash machine, unaware that his arrival was being watched . The members of the gang run from their silver Vauxhall into the store, one brandishing a knife and the other armed with a gun . The court heard the three men were part of a gang that committed two 'callous' crimes. First was the post office robbery, then afterwards came an unsuccessful attempt to attach a cashpoint in a shop to the back of a Honda and drive it away. Footage shows the thieves burst into the store, manhandle the staff, and then wreck parts of the store to make way for a cable that they attach to the ATM. However, when the cable breaks, the thieves have to make a run for it empty handed, simply driving away in their car. The gun wielding member of the gang bursts through the door moments after the cash box delivery worker enters, hitting him with the door and knocking aside the cash box he is carrying . The thieves pick up the cash box as they cram the post office workers to the back of the store by waving their weapons around . Ryan Patterson, jailed for 11 years and 3 months . Gavin Ross, who was jailed for 18 years . Matthew Richardson, jailed for 11 years . As with the post office crime, the robbers were armed, but this time they were brandishing machetes. Leeds Crown Court, heard the raid on the post office left staff so traumatised they now have trouble sleeping and feel stresed and anxious every time cash is now delivered or picked up from the premises. His Honour Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'This I make clear is the human costs of crimes such as this. 'Post offices provide a valuable service to the whole community. Communities rely on post offices. 'Those who work in them and deliver to them are vulnerable. The members of the gang then lead the helmet-wearing post office worker out of the store, forcing him to walk in front of them . The thief with the gun continues to lead the helmet-wearing member of the post office staff to his van, to continue their robbery . The gang members briefly stop in behind the secure van before making good their escape . The gang members are briefly caught on the secure truck's internal CCTV before they enter their silver Vauxhall and speed away . 'These were very well planned robberies, each participant played an important, valid and, no doubt pre-determined role.' David Gordon, prosecuting, told the court, that two of the robbers entered the post office, where there was also the post master, a member of staff and an elderly customer. Mr Gordon said: 'Both masked men, one of a distinctive tall and large build, were armed, one with a handgun and the other with a knife. 'Patterson was the large man. He had the knife. 'The security guard was threatened with the gun.' The guard was unable to open the box so the gang took it, they tried to get cash from the van, but didn’t suceed, before 'making good' their getaway. Not long after police were alerted to the Vauxhall, which had been dumped nearby. Mr Gordon said: 'By the time police arrived in Whitkirk the security box had been damaged and the money taken from inside.' He told the court that a security device in the box had been activated when they opened it and had stained the banknotes with blue dye. Scroll down for video... Members of the gang also faced charges for a failed raid on Osmondthorpe post office after they successfully robbed a post office . They then drag the cable into the store from the car, looking for the shops cashpoint . They run through the store brandishing machetes (or large knives) and threatening the staff inside . It was when cops investigated the car and its purchase that they made a connection to Ross through phone records. When they went to his home they found several bills stained with dye. They same dye appeared on a shirt of Patterson’s when he was arrested just days after the robbery.Mr Gordon said: . 'Patterson was also seen in Asda stores in the days following the robbery apparently at cash tills at which subsequently a significant number of blue bank notes were uncovered.' By the time of the attempted ATM robbery, 6 January 2013, Patterson, of Leeds, was in custody. They tip over one of the store's racks of produce to make room for the cable that is attached to their car . While one member is trashing the store to make way for a cable, the other decides he is going to manhandle the employee, pulling the employee's top over his head . The thieves attach the cable to the ATM before running it back through to their car . Following the failed robbery Ross was linked to the purchase of the car by phone records and Richardson took delivery of the vehicle. The court heard that Richardson told a sales assistant if anyone asked who bought the car she should say a 'black lad' did. All three men were arrested after their respective crimes and later charged with conspiracy to commit robbery. While Patterson and Richardson pleaded guilty to the charge, Ross was found guilty at trial. Ross was also sentenced for producing cannabis whilst on a suspended sentence for supplying cannabis. Richardson was also sentenced for his involvment in yet another masked robbery, this time at a dairy warehouse. The cable snaps as they attempt to drive away with the ATM, leaving their robbery unsuccessful . Before they leave, one of the thieves steals something from behind the counter . The thieves make a dash for it, after being unsuccessful in their robbery . Ross was jailed for a total of 18 years, Richardson for a total of 11 years and four months and Patterson for 11 years and three months. All three men have extensive criminal records. Detective Inspector Richard Holmes from West Yorkshire police said: 'These were very serious offences committed by offenders who thought nothing of threatening innocent people with weapons including a gun and knives. 'They were terrifying ordeals for the victims and witnesses involved who, despite the trauma they suffered, co-operated fully with the investigation that brought these men to justice. 'The significant sentences they have received reflect the seriousness with which the courts treat offences of this nature. 'This case should serve to remind people that the police will leave no stone unturned when it comes to tracking down and convicting offenders such as these.'","Gang jailed for post office raid and failed theft of a cash machine .

"By . Jack Doyle . The country’s most senior prosecutor . last night denied being ‘on a mission’ to bring down celebrities as she . came under fire over a string of failed court cases. Alison . Saunders defended the Crown Prosecution Service against claims that it . was ‘star struck’ and had ‘lost perspective’ in wrongly pursuing famous . suspects. She said it was . right to prosecute MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of rape and a string . of other sex charges on Thursday – despite several of his ‘accusers’ telling the police they did not believe they were victims. Scroll down for video . Former DPP Lord Macdonald said prosecutors must not lose perspective . Mrs Saunders said ‘victims may not . always think of themselves as victims’ and used cases involving grooming . as an example. She also pointed out an 86 per cent prosecution success . rate across all cases. But last night, detailed figures on sex attacks provided by the CPS showed those prosecutions have a much lower success rate. Some . 63 per cent of rape cases ended in a conviction in 2011/12, meaning . more than one in three defendants walked free. The success rate was . slightly higher for sexual offences, at 77 per cent, but nearly one in . four cases still ended in a not guilty verdict. Mrs Saunders came under . fire from her predecessor as Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord . Macdonald of River Glaven, QC, who said prosecutors needed to ‘keep a . cool head’ when approaching historical abuse cases. He told The Times: . ‘We don’t want prosecutors only to bring sure-fire winners, that way . lots of guilty people would never be taken to court. ‘The . more challenging cases need to be prosecuted too, so that the courts . can decide. What the CPS need to avoid, however, is going on a mission . and losing perspective. This particularly applies to historical cases . which have garnered a lot of publicity. You have to keep a cool head.’ The . Evans verdict followed not guilty decisions in the cases of Coronation . Street stars Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell. During Mr Evans’s trial, . the court heard three of his seven alleged victims did not consider an . offence had been committed against them, a fourth ‘had a bit of a . giggle’ about the MP’s supposed assault, while a fifth wanted to . withdraw his allegation about what he called ‘a drunken . misunderstanding’. Mrs . Saunders pointed to evidence from the charity Barnardo’s that suggested . those who are ‘groomed’ may not think they are victims because their . abusers ‘love them and take care of them’. However, . the charity said its research applied only to child victims, and all . the ‘victims’ in the Evans case were adults. Mrs Saunders said the CPS . had made the ‘right decision’ to take the Evans case before the court . and denied prosecuting ‘weak’ cases. She . told the BBC: ‘We apply the same test no matter who the offender or the . victim is, and it’s very important that we do that. So I certainly . don’t think that the CPS has been star struck in any way. We looked at . all the evidence and decided there was a realistic prospect of . conviction. And what we have to remember is that juries apply a very . different, much higher test, which is – are they satisfied beyond all . reasonable doubt?’ A married Tory activist, brought to court as one of Nigel Evans' alleged victims, has told of his astonishment that he had to give evidence about an incident that was simply a 'bit of a laugh' ‘What . we do know, and there is evidence from Barnardo’s and others that shows . this, is that victims themselves may not always think of themselves as . victims, it rather depends on the relationship they are in with their . alleged abusers. So if someone is in a position of power, or perhaps we . have seen it in grooming cases where victims think they are not victims . because their abusers love them and take care of them. ‘So I think we should be very careful just to say, “people don’t think they are victims and therefore they are not”.’ Former . prisons minister Crispin Blunt told Sky News there were ‘no winners in . this process’ and called for the CPS to examine their procedures. Former . Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw told Sky News that before the . revelations about Jimmy Savile, public figures ‘got the benefit of the . doubt’. ‘I think probably these days if you are a public figure then the balance is going to swing the other way,’ he said. Speaking . at the end of the trial, Nigel Evans said he had 'gone through 11 . months of hell' after he was cleared of committing nine sexual offences . against seven young men. Outside . Preston Crown Court, Evans said: 'Can I first start by passing on my . condolences to one of the jurors whose father died during the trial. My . deepest condolences to him and his family. 'Can I also thank my legal team....I thank them for their support during this trial. 'As many of you know I've gone through 11 months of hell.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Claims that a Tory official used taxpayers' money to fund a gay sex party at £2,500-a-night hotel are to be investigated by Parliament's expenses watchdog. A senior aide is alleged to have booked out a suite at the lavish Light ApartHotel in central Manchester during a Conservative Party Conference, and used the hook-up app Grindr to invite young men to his rooms. The figure - who cannot be named for legal reasons - is not an MP, but is claimed to have enjoyed indirect access to taxpayer cash through a research company funded almost by MPs' expenses. 'Sex party': The LightApart hotel in Manchester, pictured, costs as much as £2,500 a night. A Tory figure was said to have used a suite there to host the party . In the wake of the allegations, which were revealed last week in the Mail on Sunday, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), has launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesman said Ipsa was 'deeply worried' by the claims. Its rules state that public money cannot be used to fund party political activities, such as attending conferences. The official in question - who is paid £70,000 a year - allegedly booked the hotel suite through an organisation called the Policy Research Unit (PRU). The think tank is mostly funded by the public purse, as Tory MPs pay for its research from their expenses allowance. A spokesman for the organisation told the Independent: 'Allegations that the PRU has misused public money are . deeply worrying and pose serious questions for the PRU board to answer.'We . have received the proper assurances and evidence from all MPs who claim . through PRU but, in the light of these concerns, we will be contacting . PRU to seek further assurance about their work and that the claims fall . within Ipsa’s scheme.' The gay sex party is alleged to have taken place at the Light ApartHotel, a luxury apartment complex in Manchester where suites cost up to £2,500 a night. Party time: The Tory aide who organised the gathering allegedly used gay hookup app Grindr (file photos) Engineers managed to restore about a quarter of the deleted profiles, but the rest were lost permanently, he claimed. It is just over half a mile from the Manchester Central conference centre and is popular with footballers and WAGs. The complex can be entered by driving straight into the underground car park, escaping the attentions of the paparazzi. The official was among a group of Tory aides who stayed there during the conference in 2011. He organised the party using the Grindr app, which enables users to make contact with fellow gay men in the vicinity. After a series of intimate exchanges with another man, he invited him to a party in his hotel suite. It is alleged that other men were later invited.

The source, who has seen the Grindr messages, said: ‘The gist of it was, “I’m up here with the Tory Party and have some great young guys in my suite. We party every night, come and join us.” ‘The other man responded very enthusiastically and said he was also involved in politics so they had lots in common.’ Shortly after the conference, a formal complaint was made to the party by an individual who saw the Grindr exchanges between the named official and the other man, who did not disclose his identity.","Tory official allegedly used public cash to book a hotel suite in Manchester .

"By . Darren Boyle . Just 17 prisoners from EU countries have been sent home to serve their remaining sentences in their native countries despite a two-year old transfer deal among European nations. There are currently an estimated 10,000 foreign prisoners serving jail terms in England and Wales costing the taxpayer £400 million a year. The EU Prisoner Transfer Agreement signed in 2011 allowed for the compulsory transfer of prisoners between EU states. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan MP (pictured) discovered just 17 EU prisoners out of 4,016 had been sent home to serve the remainder of the sentences . According to Mr Khan, David Cameron pledged in 2010 to 'personally intervene' to send home 'thousands of foreign prisoners' It is estimated that there are 10,000 foreign inmates being detained in prisons across England and Wales such as HMP Pentonville (pictured) However, according to a parliamentary question on the matter lodged by Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan MP, only 17 prisoners have been returned home. A total of ten prisoners have returned from EU prisons to serve their remaining sentences - one of which is more than 15 years. Mr Khan said the government was failing the British taxpayer by failing to act on this issue. 'Back in 2010 David Cameron said he'd personally intervene to make sure thousands of foreign criminals would be sent back to their home countries to serve their prison sentences. 'Yet, four years on and still only a handful have been repatriated. Because of this broken promise, the taxpayer is still left with a £400 million a year tab to keep the 10,000 foreign prisoners behind bars, an enormous drain on stretched budgets.' Prisons minister Jeremy Wright (right) told the House of Commons that just 17 EU prisoners had been sent home with ten UK prisoners returning . According to official figures, almost 800 prisoners from the Republic of Ireland are not included in the repatriation deal costing the British taxpayer an estimated £27 million a year. So far, 18 out of 27 EU states have signed the 2011 agreement allowing nations to send prisoners back to their native home. Worse still for Mr Cameron, a plan to send home 773 Jamaicans held in British jails failed after the Kingston government refused the British request. There are almost 800 prisoners from the Irish Republic being detained in England and Wales who are not subject to transfer at a cost to the taxpayer of £27 million a year . Prisons minster Jeremy Wright MP confirmed that there were 4,106 prisoners from EU countries being held in England and Wales. Of that, 2,307 were from one of the 18 nations subject to the EU deal, with 1,422 having received a sentence. In a written reply to the parliament, Mr Wright said: 'To date 18 member states (including the United Kingdom) have implemented the agreement. The European Court of Justice will have jurisdiction over the measure from December 1, 2014 and member states may face infraction proceedings if they have not implemented the agreement by then. 'The use of the EU PTA is at an early stage and the number of prisoners transferred remains low. However, we expect to see a significant increase in the number of prisoners transferred once the Agreement has been implemented by all member states. 'To date 17 prisoners have been transferred to other jurisdictions.' The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (pictured) assumes responsibility for policing the EU Prisoner Transfer Agreement on December 1, 2014 . Mr Wright claimed the number of foreign nationals jailed in England and Wales had almost doubled between 1997 and 2010. He added: 'All foreign national offenders (FNOs) sentenced to custody are referred to the Home Office to consider them for deportation at the earliest possible opportunity. 'The prisoner transfer process is just one mechanism for removing FNOs. The number of FNOs deported under the Early Removal Scheme (ERS) has increased under this government. In 2013, we removed nearly 2,000 FNOs.'","Just 17 EU prisoners have been sent home to serve remaining jail term .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . There’s a fine line between a well done burger and one that’s cremated. And whether you are a fan of a gas barbeque or carefully stoking charcoal, it can be difficult to cook meat and other foods exactly to your liking all at the same time. But soon dangerously chewy chicken and overly sizzled steaks could be a thing of the past as one company is launching a ‘smart grill’. A good grilling: Californian company Lynx is currently developing a luxurious barbeque that is voice activated, so you can tell the machine what you want to cook and let it sort out the perfect way of grilling it . The grilling process begins with a couple of simple questions from the grill about what's to be cooked. The barbeque connects to an online database to find the optimal grilling time and technique for the food and tells the chef where on the grill to place each item to ensure the best result. This also means that all the food will be ready at the same time. The grill can send notifications via audio, visual alerts, and an app. For peace of mind, the grill shuts off if it does not hear instructions for 30 minutes. Californian company Lynx is currently developing a luxurious voice activated barbeque, so a user could tell the machine what they want to cook and let it tell them the perfect way of grilling it. When the Lynx Smart Grill launches next year it will connect to a home Wi-Fi network in order to access recipes and cooking times on a database that has been put together by ‘master grillers’. For example, if you tell the grill you would like to cook a piece of chicken, it would automatically fire up the gas burners and instruct you where to place the meat for the best result, using an accompanying app. Grill master: The barbeque connects to an online database to find the optimal grilling time and technique for the food (pictured) and tells the chef where on the grill to place each item to ensure the best result. This also means that all the food will be ready at the same time . Grillers will be able to keep tabs on the progress of their dinner using the app or receiving text messages. They could also choose voice prompts if they are nearby. This means that if the weather is far from perfect, chefs can keep warm inside while the grill is cooking dinner, or if they are throwing a party, they could mingle with guests and be reminded when their food is ready. While some people might worry leaving a barbeque unattended is dangerous, the smart grill will automatically switch off to prevent food from burning if a person misses their reminders, or if it has been inactive for 30 minutes. There's an app for that: Hungry grillers will be able to keep tabs on the progress of their dinner using the app (illustrated) or receiving text messages. They could also choose voice prompts if they are nearby, freeing them up to mix with guests if they are having a party . The grill is currently only a prototype by the company, which is based in Downey, California and there is no indication as to how expensive it will be or if it will be available in the UK. The company said: ‘As we move towards a production model next year, we expect the technology will cost a slight premium but our objective is to keep the price per unit of the production version well within the window of affordability for our customers.’","Californian company Lynx is currently .

"By . Lizzie Parry . He is the youngest person to have conquered 100 marathons and holds the world record for being the youngest and fastest person to run 10 marathons in 10 days. But Adam Holland has added another first to his list of achievements - beating a horse in a 10-mile race. The 27-year-old won the unusual contest, taking on Tango, a five-year-old 14.2 hands high Appaloosa Welsh Horse. The pair raced through the Devonshire countryside, taking on moorland and bridleways near Tavistock. Challenge: Runner Adam Holland, who holds the record for the youngest and fastest person to complete 10 marathons in 10 days, raced a horse Tango, ridden by his owner Kate Melville, over 10 miles, beating his equine challenger by 10 minutes . Owner Kate Melville rode Tango, who she rescued along with another horse four years ago, in the race against Mr Holland, whose running name is Tango. And despite Tango's four legs, Mr Holland just pipped his equine challenger to the post, winning by 10 minutes. He said: 'I think I had an advantage on the hills - I’m a very good down hill runner but the horse had to walk down the hills. 'It was good fun. I know Kate enjoyed it too.' Ahead of the race Dr David Marlin, an expert in equine exercise physiology, said there were many scientific reasons why the outcome would not be as straightforward as people might think. 'In terms of biomechanics, the horse has the advantage because it has four legs. It uses less energy and is more efficient,' he said. Record breaker: The 27-year-old took on the challenge through 10 miles of moorland and bridleways in Devon . 'Of course, not all horses are as good as one another. 'At 27, Adam is at his peak fitness, while the horse is still quite young. Endurance horses usually peak at between eight and ten years old. 'Tango has a better capacity to use oxygen, but with heat production is at a disadvantage, because it is bigger and produces more heat. 'As for Adam, he can manipulate his exercise programme and diet to maximise his energy stores before the race. 'On the course, Adam can maintain a consistent speed, but with the changes in ground condition, the horse will use up energy slowing down for turns and then speeding up again. 'It’s not straightforward, but if I had a bet I would probably put money on the horse.' The event was to raise money for the Brathay Trust, a charity that works to improve life chances of children and young people. Scott Umpleby, 48, head of fundraising at the Brathay Trust said: 'Adam is very modest and very understated. 'He has a very unique approach to running and strives on competing. 'He’s very determined, very focused and a natural runner. He has a very efficient and flowing running style. He looks like he’s putting in no effort at all and is always so fresh when he finishes. 'We appreciate all that the runners do, both physically and also with the huge amount of effort they put into the fundraising too.' Mr Holland is the youngest person to run 100 marathons and also holds the word record for being the youngest and fastest person to run 10 marathons in 10 days. He now wants to beat his own record for running 10 marathons later this year. Between Friday, May 9 and Sunday, May 18 he will again run 10 marathons in 10 days, around England’s largest lake - Windermere. If he can run each marathon in under three hours he will set a new record. Charity: Mr Holland completed the challenge to raise money for a charity that helps vulnerable young people. He said: 'I think I had an advantage on the hills - I'm a very good down hill runner but the horse had to walk down the hills'","Adam Holland is the youngest and fastest person to have completed 10 marathons in 10 days .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Neo Nazi': Michael Piggin is accused of plotting terrorist attacks . A Neo-Nazi sixth former who plotted a Columbine-style massacre was bullied by Asian classmates and had no friends up until he started secondary school, a court heard today. Michael Piggin, 18, drew up a 'hit list' of pupils and teachers and said he wanted to 'eliminate' them. He also planned to target his past and present schools in Loughborough and the town's university, council offices, mosque and cinema, the Old Bailey heard. He was arrested last February after drawing a knife in the street and threatening other teenagers. When police searched his room they found a giant Swastika flag above his bed, a copy of Mein Kampf by Adolt Hitler, military books and a copy of Zero Day, a film dramatisng the 1999 Columbine school shooting. The court heard Piggin had also stockpiled knives, guns, homemade bombs and a crossbow on his bedroom floor, and kept a journal of his plans to commit mass murder. The English Defence League supporter, who was just 16 at the time of the alleged plot, planned to carry out mass murder two months later on the April anniversary of the Columbine massacre, jurors heard. Earlier in the trial the jury was shown a video, allegedly of Piggin spraying anti-Islamic graffiti at a wall in Loughborough before hurling a Molotov cocktail at it. Scroll down for video . Footage: The Old Bailey was shown a video, which allegedly shows Piggin spraying anti-Muslim graffiti and throwing Molotov cocktails . Burning: A figure is shown standing in front of a burning patch of ground after throwing the explosive . Today the teenager, who has been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, told how he was bullied throughout school, which forced him to move several times. 'People kept starting on me so I went to a different school. I didn't have any friends. I used to go home from school and just read in my room,' he told jurors. Asked who bullied him Piggin said: 'I was bullied quite a lot by Asians. I remember one incident in particular with a Bengali boy. He beat me up.' Piggin said his home life was 'unsettling' because he and his mum got evicted from their family home after missing rent payments. They then went to live with his grandmother but were kicked out following an argument and had to move in with his brother, who is 10 years older than him. During that time he said he missed periods of school 'because it was more important to find somewhere to live.' When he did return he saw a counsellor, which he said 'helped' him. By that time Piggin had made two friends and said he felt 'happy I guess.' Giving evidence in an Arctic Monkeys T-shirt, Piggin said they were one of his favourite bands along with The Who, Led Zeppelin and The Beatles. Bedroom: The Old Bailey heard investigators found Nazi symbols and a copy of Mein Kampf in Piggin's bedroom . He said he became interested in the military at a young age and had a massive collection of war books and DVDs. 'I was interested to go into the Army when I got older,' he said. And he told how he started collecting 'knives, air guns and BB guns' because he thought it was 'cool.' 'I felt happy when I went shooting,' he said. Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs. However, Piggin maintains he was not planning a terrorist attack. He denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism, and possession of a document or a record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Piggin, 18, is accused of plotting terrorist attacks in Loughborough .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Tragic: Lucas Drummond, 16, from Hackney, north London, has plummeted to his death while leading a rock climbing expedition in Costa Rica . The parents of a 16-year-old British schoolboy who plummeted to his death while leading a rock climbing expedition in Costa Rica have paid tribute to their 'adventurous' and 'loving' son. Lucas Drummond, from Hackney, north London, is believed to have fallen as he abseiled down a rock face in Santa Ana, a suburb of the capital San Jose. He had travelled to Central America to complete his sixth form studies as part of an . International Baccalaureate programme. The teenager's parents Carol and John, a property developer and former Hackney councillor, flew to Costa Rica after learning of the tragedy last Friday. In a statement today, they said: 'We are devastated by the loss of our son Lucas, who was a devoted and loving brother and son to us and friend to so many. 'Lucas was always full of life and energy, someone with so many ideas of how to change the world for the better, and that is how we will remember him. 'He was given the opportunity to study abroad in a multi-cultural international school with an ethos of being able to help others while learning about themselves. 'This was like a dream come true for Lucas and an opportunity to help develop his lively mind and his spirit for adventure which was a strong part of his being. He died doing what he loved.' It is not known when the couple will fly home, and the curtains remain drawn at their Victorian terrace home near Victoria Park. 'Adventurous': The teenager is believed to have fallen as he abseiled down a rock face with a group of students . Location: He had been out of sight of the rest of the party as he led the descent in Santa Ana, San Jose (above) Lucas, a former pupil of Stoke Newington School, is understood to have been an experienced climber who had taken part in competitions around Britain. He had been leading four . other students from the United World College of Costa Rica (UWC) under the . supervision of a local instructor when he fell, according to reports. He is believed to have been out . of sight of the rest of the party as he led the descent on the mountain range, before plummeting to his death. In the statement, Lucas's parents thanked UWC for their support, adding: 'We . ask that our privacy be respected as we grieve for Lucas.' Today, tributes were being paid to the teenager, who is said to have been 'talented in many areas'. Lucas's former headteacher, Annie Gammon, said: 'Everyone at Stoke Newington School is shocked and saddened by this tragic news. 'Lucas was a popular member of our school for the five years he was with us - many of our students stayed in touch with him once he had left and started sixth form in Costa Rica. 'He was very talented in many areas and we remember his drama performances particularly well. 'Staff and students have signed a book of condolences at the school, and our thoughts go out to his family at this terrible time.' Meanwhile, Mauricio Viales, Principal of UWC Costa . Rica, said: 'We are all very saddened by the loss of our student, Lucas. Devastating: Today, tributes were being paid to Lucas, who is said to have been 'talented in many areas' 'He was an outstanding young man, full of energy and creative ideas, . always looking to serve others and dedicated to the ideals of diversity . as it applies to the larger world of history, politics, and economics. 'Our entire community including Lucas's fellow classmates, his teachers, . and our support and administrative staff deeply feel his passing.' Dominic O'Reilly, director of communications at UWC International, added: 'The staff and students of UWC Costa Rica . united in activities and vigils, including a tree planting, to express . their grief and remember a hugely popular and valued member of their . community.' 'UWC Costa Rica is cooperating fully with the local authorities’ investigation'. Mountain range: An area of Santa Ana, believed to be close to where Lucas plummeted to his death last Friday . Neighbours have also paid tribute to the schoolboy, saying the community had been left 'heartbroken' by his death. Mother-of-two Paula Milhazes, 39, said: 'He was a really nice boy. His death has come as such a shock to everybody. 'No-one . ever had a bad word to say about Lucas. He was a really, really nice . boy and really brave to go abroad to go to school. He was really . bright.' She said Lucas had chosen to complete . his sixth form studies in Costa Rica himself, even though his parents . had some concerns about him living so far away. 'They . weren't happy for him to go,' she said. 'They were scared because he . was going so far. But he wanted to go and do it and they couldn't stand . in his way. 'They were a very close family. His parents must be heartbroken.' She added: 'He was always quite adventurous. I know that since he was a boy he liked to go climbing. Everyone is really heartbroken for the family.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'We are all very upset. It is tragic.' Police are investigating Lucas's death, and have examined his ropes and climbing equipment so far. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office refused to comment on the circumstances of the teenager's death. But he said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national and we are providing consular support.'","Lucas Drummond, 16, died during climbing trip in Santa Ana, San Jose .

"IF your home can’t actually be a castle, it’s surely the next best thing to have one in your garden. And this beautiful manor house comes with one that dates from the 11th century. For £850,000 – the price of a one-bedroom flat in central London – the buyer will get the eight-bedroom house and the castle, which has sea views from the turrets. Home: The lavish eight-bedroomed Georgian home, built in 1808, is at the heart of the property. It has welcomed figures as diverse as the Queen and former Labour leader Michael Foot . Garden: The package, available to lease from the Duchy of Cornwall, also boasts remains of a Norman castle, seen left, and spectacular views over the Plymouth sound . Remains: The circular keep, pictured above, has no roof and has been reimagined as a romantic walled garden . Grand design: The Georgian house was designed by Benjamin Tucker, a naval man and surveyor general of Cornwall . There is one drawback: It will be yours for only 20 years before the lease expires. Trematon Castle was built shortly after the Norman Conquest by Robert, Count of Mortain. It was sold to Richard, Earl of Cornwall in 1270 and is now owned by Prince Charles’s Duchy of Cornwall. Standing in nine acres of landscaped gardens, the manor house features a dining room, drawing room, library, study, pantry, larder, boot room, kitchen, cellar and four bathrooms. Also in the grounds is a keep or tower that stands on a hill, a two-bedroom lodge and an ‘Indian influenced’ outdoor heated swimming pool. Forever England: The home, which is currently leased by landscape gardeners Julian and Isabel Bannerman, is richly appointed inside as well as boasting impressive history and spectacular views . Rooms with a view: Breathtaking vistas over the Plymouth Sound, praised by poet laureate John Betjemen, can be seen from some of the property's eight bedrooms . Knockdown deal: Estate agents Knight Frank say the property - on the market for an £850,000 leasehold - would be worth £3million if put on the market outright . Stylish: The dining room is decked out with china pieces and sketches of a viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel - which is visible from the windows . Picturesque: A glimpse of Plymouth, which lies across the water from the castle, can be seen from the window of the substantial kitchen . Entertaining: There would be plenty of room for guests in the huge house, which featured traditional fireplaces and extensive gardens for summer . Extensive: The large manor house even features a 'boot room', which is pictured here . While the leasehold on the property near Saltash, Cornwall, is only 20 years, it is expected that it will be renewed. Richard Speedy, of Knight Frank estate agents, said: ‘The keep is currently not being used for anything and if you were living there it could be turned into whatever you like. There is no roof on it so it might make a very nice garden.’ Trematon Castle was built by the Count of Mortain to strengthen the hold of William the Conqueror in England after his triumph against King Harold at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Warlike heritage: The castle, currently owned by the Prince of Wales's estate, has outlived its defensive purpose. The rustic-looking wooden cannon which 'guard' the property were installed by the current tenants . Vista: The castle can be seen, below centre, nestled in the dramatic Cornish landscape . Grounds: In the shadow of the keep is an outdoor pool, built in the 19th Century to commemorate an 1812 visit by George IV, then Prince Regent . Imperial: The architecture of the pool reflects designs common in areas of India colonised by the British Empire . Inside the keep: Currently the circular walls of the open keep contain a romantic, thriving garden . In Elizabethan times it was used by Sir Francis Drake to house Spanish treasure, the fruits of his piracy in the Pacific. More recent tenants include diplomat Hugh Foot, Lord Caradon, brother of the late Labour leader Michael Foot. It was also spoken warmly of by poet laureate John Betjeman, who called the vista from the property ‘one of the most superb views of Cornwall’. Bonus: The package for sale also includes this two-bedroom lodge, which is currently rented out for around £420 per month . Floor plan: The above diagram shows the extensive layout of the 17-century manor house . The grand estate of Trematon castle had a vibrant history extending far beyond its beginnings in the wake of the Norman conquest. The fortification was built by the Count of Mortain to strengthen the hold of William the Conqueror in England after his triumph at the Battle of Hastings. Historical: Sir Francis Drake spent time at Trematon before returning in triumph to London with Spanish treasure . But, since Britain has never been invaded since, the fort has never seen battle. Nonetheless it has played host to a variety of historical figures across the centuries. The property’s Grade-I listed gatehouse was built as a Cornish home for Edward the Black Prince, who won dramatic victories in France and founded the chivalrous Knights of the Garter. In Elizabethan times it was used by Sir Francis Drake to house Spanish treasure, the fruits of his piracy in the Pacific Ocean. He lay low at Trematon Castle before parading the hoard, including emeralds and gold, up the Thames in his ship the Golden Hind. The ornate swimming pool in the lower reaches of the gardens was built by 19th-Century tenants of the castle to commemorate an 1812 visit by the Prince Regent, who was later crowned George IV. Trematon eventually passed into the possession of Hugh Foot, Lord Carodan, who was a top British diplomat in Cyprus, Nigeria and Jamaica while they still belonged to the empire. His young brother, Michael Foot, was Labour leader for part of Margaret Thatcher’s time in office, and would often stay at the family seat. There are reports of him being soaked in one of the bedrooms when a pipe burst above his head. It was also spoken warmly of by poet laureate John Betjemen, who called the view: 'one of the most superb views of . Cornwall, a Brunel stone viaduct crossing a foreground creek, the Lynher and . Tamar estuaries beyond, and the wooded slopes of Anthony'. In more recent Royal history, Queen Elizabeth made a visit to Trematon in 1962.","Trematon Castle, near Saltash in Cornwall, was built after William the Conqueror invaded in 1066 .

"By . Laura Clark . Students will be asked to analyse the speeches of Tony Blair and Boris Johnson as part of their English GCSEs. They are also scrutinising the commentaries of international cricket matches and transcripts of Hairy Bikers TV cookery programmes. It comes after recent exams have asked pupils to analyse the rambling armchair stories of Ronnie Corbett and Eddie Izzard’s performances, fuelling the argument of those who claim the exams are being ‘dumbed down’. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, and London Mayor Boris Johnson, right, are both politicians who could see their speeches analysed in the exams. Blair's addresses on the death of Princess Diana and the eve of the Iraq War are two of the texts students could find themselves studying . Transcripts of television programmes, such as cookery show The Hairy Bikers, will also form part of the exams . Pupils studying English Language with the OCR exam board must write an essay on extracts of spoken language – worth 10 per cent of the marks. But critics have questioned why pupils are being encouraged to study the language of TV hosts and entertainers rather than great orators such as Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln. The exams are among those facing the axe in a radical exam overhaul. Even the commentaries on sporting events, such as international cricket matches, could form part of courses . Education Secretary Michael Gove has ordered examiners to rethink GCSEs in English and other core subjects to counter apparent dumbing down. As part of the changes, being phased in from next year, so-called ‘controlled assessments’ – such as the spoken language assignment – will be scrapped and all marks will rest on performance in final exams. But teachers preparing pupils for exams in 2015 have been told that youngsters can study either Tony Blair, London mayor Boris Johnson or comic David Mitchell. Critics of the courses say students should study history's great orators, such as Britain's Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill, left, and America's President during the country's civil war, Abraham Lincoln, right, who gave famous speeches such as the Gettysburg Address . They are then given four hours of classroom time to complete a 1,000-word essay on the spoken language of their chosen person. Education Secretary Michael Gove has launched a crusade against what he sees as the 'dumbing down' of exams . Schools are allowed free rein as to which of Blair’s speeches they select but his ‘People’s Princess’ speech on the death of Diana is known to be among those chosen, as is his address to the Iraqi people on the eve of war. Guidance to schools says pupils should focus on how the speaker establishes a rapport with the audience, how they create impact with their speech and how they use techniques such as timing and pace. The interviews of Jeremy Paxman, Michael Parkinson and John Humphrys have also made it onto the syllabus, as have transcripts of commentaries of cricket matches and the men’s Wimbledon singles final. Extracts from cookery shows hosted by the Hairy Bikers, Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith have also been considered suitable material. One recent year saw the examining board use the Queen, Martin Luther King and comedian Rob Brydon as speakers to be studied. Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is important that children are not denied access to speeches that have stood the test of time. The interviews of Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, top, chatshow host Michael Parkinson, bottom left, and Radio 4 Today Programme presenter John Humphreys, bottom right, will also be texts for study . ‘Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, for example, provide a much richer source of oratory than contemporary radio show hosts and TV comedians. In a study of spoken English the only real justification for studying the words of Tony Blair or Ronnie Corbett is to expose the limitations of their language in comparison with truly great oratory.’ An OCR spokesman said: ‘Where speakers are selected for the controlled assessment task, schools are given the flexibility to choose speakers or topics which will engage and interest their students.‘Speakers are selected because they are public figures whose speeches are widely available and have the breadth to sustain a critical appraisal.’","Speeches, sports commentaries and comedy transcripts are just some of the texts students will be studying .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Model railway enthusiasts have recreated the Great Train Robbery in a small scale depiction of the infamous crime. Volunteers from Luton Model Railway Club spent over a year carefully building the replica train, robbers and money bags from the heist. Their diorama shows the night in August 1963 when a gang of robbers stole £2.6million from a mail train in Buckinghamshire. Small train, big money: Enthusiasts from Luton have painstakingly recreated the night in 1963 when thieves made off with £2.6million . Getaway: The overnight train was brought to a standstill by the gang as it travelled through Buckinghamshire . Detail: The model train fans made the diorama after being inspired by coverage of the robbery;s 50th anniversary . During the incident driver of the train Jack Mills, was hit over the head with an iron bar suffering serious head injuries. He recovered but still suffered from severe headaches, and although he returned to work, he retired in 1967. He died in 1970 aged 64 from an illness unrelated to the robbery but his family maintains the trauma . never left him. The scale model includes mini bags of cash being unloaded from a carriage and the robbers making off with their haul. The club said they were inspired by last year’s 50th anniversary of the robbery. Nigel Adams, 54, project manager at an electronics company, said: 'We do not condone the actions of the event, but it is a fact that the Great Train Robbery has become a part of the national consciousness for many people over a certain age. 'National consciousness': A spokesman for the group said they wanted to mark the event because of its historical importance . Heist: Seven of the robbers, including Ronnie Biggs, were given lengthy jail sentences after they were caught . 'We have tried to portray this event . in a sensitive way, taking due regard for the injuries sustained by the . locomotive crew on the night.' The . diorama is an O gauge 7mm finescale and measures in at three metres . wide, with light and sound helping to portray what happened that night. The . exhibition is currently insured at a value of £8,000 including . operating stock and requires two people and two cars to transport it to . exhibitions. Aftermath: These images show the looted train after the robbery had taken place . Embankment: This is the grassy bank where the robber would have made off with their stolen cash . Victim: Train driver Jack Mills was hit over the head with an iron bar during the Great Train Robbery and suffered severe headaches in the years after before he died in 1970 . Mr Adams added: 'There are 15 figures on the display, although we have taken care to present them as just that - figures on a model. 'We do not identify any personalities due to the sensitive nature of the subject.' The Great Train Robbery saw Ronnie Biggs make off with the stolen money but he escaped from prison and eventually fled to Brazil. He returned to the UK in 2001. Another seven men involved received huge jail sentences. The reconstruction, which includes a commentary, will be on display at the National Festival of Railway Modelling in Peterborough in October.

"By . Martin Robinson . The Co-operative Bank could go bust within months if it does not raise £400million, it was revealed yesterday. The dire warning was contained in the bank's financial results, which showed a £1.3billion loss last year. Directors warned that failure to find the cash to plug a hole in its accounts could affect its ability to continue as a 'going concern'. Losses: The Co-op Bank could go bust within months if it does not raise £400million, it was revealed yesterday . Auditor KPMG said there was 'significant doubt' over the bank's future if it does not raise the funds. If it did collapse, investors' money would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It emerged yesterday that former directors and senior executives would miss out on £5million in bonuses because current management blame them for steering the bank to the brink of collapse. Pay rise: Co-op Bank boss Niall Booker was paid £1.7million this year - and will get £2.9million next year if results improve . As its catastrophic results for last year were published the bank also issued an apology for its past failings and warned a return to any profit is unlikely before 2016. Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a . £1.5billion hole was discovered in its finances. But despite the huge losses, the bank admitted its current chief executive . Niall Booker will receive a £2.9million salary for 2014, of which . £1.7million is dependent on performance. At the end of three years he would get a £1.2million bonus if the bank was profitable. It also emerged in the annual report that Mr Booker was paid £1.7 million last year, including £943,000 as a fixed allowance 'that takes account of the broad range of specialist skills required of the role'. The allowance is equivalent to £140,000 per month and is payable quarterly up until June 2015, the Co-op said. He said on Thursday that there are still 'significant issues' that need to be resolved and he expects there will be further losses in 2014 and 2015. Experts said that for such a relatively small bank the losses were 'truly shocking'. The £5 million of withheld payments to former directors and senior executives relate to performance targets which have not been met as well as from some of the legacy issues at the bank. Neville Richardson, the former . Britannia boss, who took the helm of the Co-op Bank after its ill-fated . 2009 takeover of the building society, is among those likely to miss out on a bonus. Quit: Lord Myners' resignation on Thursday came just four months into his job, plunging the group into further crisis . Changes: The world's first Co-operative store was opened in Rochdale Lancashire in 1844 (pictured), but the now huge group has been led to the verge of collapse . The bank has repeatedly delayed the publication . of its annual report twice until today due to the chaos both at the lender and at . the Co-op Group. Its crisis deepened further on Thursday with the sudden resignation of the former minister charged with dragging the troubled organisation into the 21st century. Lord . Myners, who was brought in to modernise the group, quit just four . months into the job after facing opposition to his reforms. Reverend Paul Flowers, the Co-Op Bank's former chairman, was exposed by the Mail on Sunday as buying crystal meth and crack coacaine . It . came just a month after the chief executive quit branding the business . 'ungovernable' and leaves the Co-op struggling to repair its reputation . after its banking boss Reverend Paul Flowers was exposed by the Mail on Sunday for buying crystal meth and crack cocaine. Lord Myners will continue his review of the group but will no longer serve as an independent . non-executive director, a role for which he is being paid a nominal sum . of £1. The review was launched after the . Rev Flowers scandal and the discovery of a £1.3billion black hole . in the Co-op Bank’s accounts. Questions have been asked about why Rev Flowers was ever put in charge of the Co-Op Group's banking arm . But attempts to repair the group's finances - and reputation - have repeatedly faltered. Last month Euan Sutherland, the Co-Op . Group chief executive, resigned claiming senior Co-op officials 'talk . the talk of reform, but in practice they won't do it' and the group was 'ungovernable'. Rev Flowers’ drugs shame was revealed in an expose by the Mail on Sunday when the Methodist minister was covertly filmed counting off £20 notes to buy crystal meth and crack cocaine. He had resigned as chairman of the Co-op Bank six . months prior to the scandal, over criticism of alleged lavish expenses. There have been repeated questions about how he was ever put in charge despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector.

"By . Julian Robinson . Police are hunting an 'elderly' hit and run driver who struck an 18-month-old toddler after she let herself out of her garden. Little Safa Ally opened her front gate and ran into the road while she was playing at her family home in Daubhill, Bolton, Greater Manchester. Her grandfather saw a red Vauxhall Astra hit the toddler and, fearing she was dead, rushed over to the tiny child who was lying in the road. Safa Ally, pictured next to the garden gate she opened moments before she was struck down by an 'elderly' hit and run driver in Daubhill, Bolton, Greater Manchester. Police descended on the scene outside Safa Ally's home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Sunday after the 18-month-old toddler was struck down by an elderly hit and run driver. After a night in the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, Safa is now back at home with just cuts and bruises - and the family say they forgive the car driver despite their ordeal. Her aunt Sabiha Ally said the family feared the worst after the accident which happened at about 12.30pm on Sunday. She said: 'When he picked her up off the road, she was unconscious and he was distraught. Safa Ally was found by her grandfather lying unconscious in the road after a hit and run driver ploughed into her. Fearing she was dead, he carried her inside and called an ambulance . The scene outside 18-month-old Safa Ally's home in Daubhill, Bolton. Moments earlier, an elderly driver had ploughed into the toddler after she strayed in to the road having opened her garden gate . 'He kept saying ‘She’s gone, she’s gone’ but, after a few minutes, she was crying and started moving her arms and legs, so we knew she was okay. Then we called an ambulance.' The driver, thought to be an elderly man, has still not been traced, but a  police spokesman said they had found the car. Safa’s father, Javid Ally, said he had been 'heartbroken' to hear what had happened but that the family was now starting to get back to normal. Playing happily on her pink toy car, Safa Ally was lucky to escape her hit and run ordeal with just minor injuries. She had let herself out through the garden gate on Sunday before being ploughed into by an 'elderly' driver outside the home in Daubhill, Bolton . He added: 'It takes a while for us all to recover from the shock of something  like this, but we are okay now and, most importantly, Safa is okay. Her injuries are mainly just cuts and scratches. 'I wasn’t at home at the time, but when my sister phoned me to tell me what had happened I didn’t believe it. I was distraught and heartbroken. 'Of course, I am very relieved and I think we just want to forget what happened now and move on and make sure that Safa is okay.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A rise in lamb prices has led to s spate of sheep rustling across the country . The rising cost of lamb has triggered a rural crime wave, with farmers £6million-a-year to sheep rustlers. In recent weeks there has been a spate of thefts of . sheep and lambs across the country, including in Northumberland, County . Durham and Yorkshire. Now senior Conservative MP Anne McIntosh has accused the government of failing to take rural crime seriously, and questioned if the Tories could still claim to be the ‘party of the countryside’. The issue of rural crime is to be debated in the Commons tomorrow. The value of sheep has risen sharply since the start of the year, from around £50 per ewe in January to £75 in mid-March. Nearly one farm a week is being raided . in the valley of Swaledale in North Yorkshire, with £120,000 worth of . livestock disappearing in 25 separate raids over just ten months. Mrs McIntosh told MailOnline: ‘I am not sure any prosecutions have been brought. The financial value to the farmer is huge. If they are stolen at this time of year before lambing, they have lost the mother sheep – the ewe – and the lambs. ‘They will take whatever is in the field.  Why is this crime, an economic crime, being treated any less seriously than a crime taking place in an urban area? It does seem to be quite widespread.’ Mrs McIntosh, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the scale of the problem but drew a blank. She added: ‘I do believe it is something Defra should taking seriously. I always thought the Conservative part as the party of the countryside… I do believe we have got to take rural crime seriously. ‘It is very disappointing that a rural crime of quite large proportions financially is going unprosecuted.’ Insurers NFU Mutual warn sheep rustling is costing farmers £6million every year . Sheep rustling is a crime and is covered under the Theft Act 1968. The Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs insist they have not had any formal representations about sheep rustling. But Tim Price, rural affairs spokesman at insurers NFU Mutual, said: . ‘During the decade to 2010, livestock rustling had been at historically low . levels, while rural thieves concentrated on easy pickings - stealing quad . bikes, tractors and expensive power tools from farms. Tory MP Anne McIntosh accused the government of failing to take rural crime seriously . ‘Now however, high meat prices and improved security on farm . vehicles appear to be leading to a resurgence in livestock rustling. In the . last few years we have seen a worrying increase in thefts in all livestock . rearing parts of the UK. ‘Rustling is one of the world's oldest crimes. Since the . first cavemen kept goats, rustling has been a feature of farming. However, the . worrying trend today is that instead of small numbers of animals being taken in . one attack, we are increasingly seeing very large numbers of sheep being . stolen.’ NFU Mutual's claims figures show that the cost of rustling has . risen dramatically since 2010, up 170 per cent in 2011 and 3.6 per cent in 2012 . People who live in the countryside are now being urged to ‘keep . an eye on sheep in fields near their homes, and report and suspicious activity . to local farmers or the police’. Farmers and butchers buying stock are also being told to . check livestock records and ear tags carefully to make sure they are not buying . stolen animals. Last year rustling is estimated to have cost UK farmers . over £6m, with the South West, North West and North East hardest hit. Home Office minister Norman Baker said: ‘It is for Police and Crime Commissioners to ensure that forces use those resources to tackle the crimes that matter most to the communities they serve, including sheep rustling where that is a local priority. ‘The Government will provide £8.5 billion to the police in England and Wales in 2014-15, demonstrating our continued commitment to protecting the public from crime. In addition, the police receive around a quarter of their total funding from the police precept component of council tax.’","Lamb prices have soared from £50 per ewe in January to £75 in mid-March .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A solicitor has told of the terrifying moment she was savagely bitten three times in the face by a vicious dog as she tried to stop it mauling her eight-month-old puppy. Michelle Parker, 43, feared her Pomeranian Toby was going to be killed when it was grabbed around the throat by the out-of-control dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier – in a public park. The mother-of-one watched in horror as the dog threw Toby around ‘like a ragdoll’ in Townhill Park in Southampton, Hampshire. Michelle Parker, 43, pictured after the attack, suffered a cut lip, bites to her right ear and a bruised cheek after a Staffordshire bull terrier mauled her and her eight-month-old puppy Toby . She was attacked by the dog when she leant down to try and pull the dogs apart and suffered a cut lip, bites to her right ear and bruising on her cheek. She said her beloved puppy would’ve been mauled to death had she not stepped in to stop the savage attack. She said: ‘I was walking along with Toby who was on a leash. ‘I heard some shouting and I heard the owner shout at his dog, which was running towards my dog at a million miles an hour. ‘Toby started to run off and he was quite scared. ‘I could not get hold of him and the dog was biting him and throwing him around like a ragdoll. ‘As I leaned down to pick him up, that was when the dog went for me and bit me in the face. ‘At the time my only concern was for Toby, if I had not stepped in he would have mauled him to death. ‘I was not concerned about me. The dog could have bitten my ear off for all I care, I just wanted to save Toby.’ The ordeal only ended when the owner grabbed the raging dog - which was not on a lead. The young man later fled the scene when witnesses asked him to give his details. Mother-of-one Ms Parker feared her eight-month-old Pomeranian Toby was going to be killed when it was grabbed around the throat by the out-of-control dog - believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier - in a public park .

"By . Jack Doyle . Ministers have been handed ‘conclusive evidence’ of how leaks by surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden damaged national security. It claims suspected terror cells and individuals disappeared from the intelligence radar after the American revealed information on techniques used by the British listening station GCHQ. A dossier showing how the publication of leaked material in newspapers including The Guardian affected UK spying operations has now been passed to David Cameron and senior Cabinet colleagues. Spy chiefs claim that the work of GCHQ, pictured, has been severely compromised by Snowden's leaks . A senior counter-terrorism official yesterday said there was ‘unambiguous’ evidence that the release of information from the Snowden documents had made gathering information about terrorists more difficult. Charles Farr, head of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, told The Times: ‘Ministers want to understand the impact of Snowden and have been provided with material on more than one occasion. ‘It is part of our job to provide to ministers evidence that Snowden has changed our national security work. ‘I’m clear that that evidence is conclusive. Our coverage of counter-terrorist activity is not as good as it otherwise might have been.’ Edwards Snowden, the American whistleblower, has released classified documents . Mr Farr, among those tipped to take over as director of GCHQ from Sir Iain Lobban, refused to give specific examples of the damage done because it could create ‘a danger of making a problem worse’. His comments come days after a watchdog rubbished claims about the extent of mass surveillance made by Snowden, 30, a former IT  contractor with the US National Security Agency. He stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to The Guardian and the Washington Post and has now sought refuge in Russia, where he was granted asylum. However, the Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May said it was untrue that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, were engaged in ‘mass intrusion’ into the private lives of millions of innocent citizens. Nor were they breaking the law, or using US intercept material to snoop on Britons overseas.He said they did not ‘misuse’ the powers given to them by Parliament to engage in ‘random mass intrusion in to the private lives of law-abiding citizens’. Such acts are not permitted by law and would be ‘comprehensively unlawful’, he added. Mr Farr also revealed how terrorist suspects have been hauled from aircraft as a result of a new early warning system designed to give airlines better information about passengers. He said a ‘handful’ of people judged to ‘pose a threat to aviation security’ have been stopped travelling by air as a result of work by the National Border Targeting Centre. They were off-loaded before they boarded flights bound for Britain, thanks to a system designed to give airlines ‘advanced, real-time information’ about travellers, he said.","Ministers have been given dossier on how GCHQ's work has been hindered .

"By . Mark Duell . Royal Marine: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was found guilty of murdering an injured Afghan fighter . A Royal Marine jailed for life for executing a severely wounded Taliban captive ‘lost his head’ amid fears he would be ‘skinned alive’ if caught by insurgents, a court heard. Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, blasted the Afghan prisoner in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol in a ‘moment of madness’ on the battlefield. Blackman – known as Marine A at his trial – is serving a minimum of ten years in prison after becoming the first UK serviceman to be found guilty of murder in a warzone since the Second World War. Yesterday he launched a legal bid for freedom by having his conviction quashed or sentence reduced. The experienced commando and his men lived in daily fear of being blown up by IEDs or, worse, captured and mutilated by inhumane enemy fighters, senior judges were told. Anthony Berry QC, representing Blackman, told the Court Martial Appeal Court the Marine had succumbed to ‘extreme stress’ after a gruelling tour of Helmand. He said: ‘There was a cocktail of circumstances which led this brave and modest man, to whom loyal duty and allegiance to the corps was second to nothing, briefly to lose his head. ‘The task and stress of leadership is considerable when you hear and see your comrades being killed … and how they fear being caught by Taliban insurgents and knowing what they would do, namely skinning them alive, cutting off their testicles and displaying body parts in trees as a warning to other forces.’ Mr Berry said the conviction was ‘inherently unsafe’ because a seven-man military board was permitted to find him guilty on a simple majority. He said the odds were stacked unfairly against the Marine at the court martial which meant the conviction failed to ‘satisfy the criminal standard of proof’, and argued the sentence was ‘manifestly excessive’. Shooting: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine showing Sgt Blackman during a patrol in Afghanistan in which an insurgent was killed . In attendance: Claire Blackman, the Marine's wife, at the Court Martial Appeal Court in London today . The judge at his court martial had not . taken into account his patrol ‘remained in hostile territory and knew . of further insurgents in the immediate vicinity’. As . well as being jailed, Blackman was dismissed with disgrace from the . Marines after he had served with distinction for 15 years, including . tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. Urging . the three judges to reduce the ten-year term, Mr Berry said: ‘His . career is over. His reputation and standing is lost and the loss of the . comradeship is perhaps the most significant punishment for him to bear. ‘He is a normal citizen, tainted only by the impact of war.’ Blackman, . from Taunton, Somerset, killed the injured insurgent following a fierce . firefight on September 15, 2011. The captive had been hurt by cannon . fire from an Apache helicopter after an attack on a British base in . Helmand. Recordings from a . helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade captured the moments when . Blackman shot the prisoner and told him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, . you ****.’ He then told his comrades: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ In November, he was convicted of . murder. Sentencing Blackman, who served with Plymouth-based 42 Commando, . Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett said he had ‘tarnished the . reputation’ of the Armed Forces. Sent down: A court drawing of Sergeant Alexander Blackman, standing in front of the judge, as he passes sentence and jails him for ten years last November . Hearing: He was jailed for life after being convicted last year at a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire (pictured) But . the severity of the sentence sparked a massive wave of support with . more than 100,000 people, including MPs and senior military figures, . calling for leniency. Blackman’s wife Claire, 42, was at the hearing but said she would not comment until after the court gives its decision. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, Sir . Brian Leveson and Lady Justice Hallett are expected to rule after Easter . on whether or not the conviction can stand. The footage was captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine in the aftermath of a helicopter attack in Helmand. He shot the unknown insurgent in the . chest but said he believed the man was already dead and he was taking . out his anger on a corpse. As . the fighter lies on the floor convulsing and struggling for breath, Sgt . Blackman tells him: 'There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil you . c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.' He then turned to his comrades and said: 'Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.' Blackman is the first British serviceman to be found guilty of murder during combat since the Second World War. Blackman completed tours of Iraq, . Afghanistan and Northern Ireland during his military career, and before a . video of the murder came to light, he was being considered for . promotion to Colour Sergeant.","Sergeant Alexander Blackman's case  heard at Court Martial Appeal Court .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . After the week he has had, it is no surprise that David Cameron was looking for divine inspiration. Hours after the Prime Minister was forced to defend Maria Miller’s resignation over her expenses, he told religious leaders at an Easter reception in Downing Street: ‘The Bible tells us to bear one another’s burdens.’ The stressed-out Premier was also seen leaning against a pillar with his eyes shut as a soprano sang the – rather appropriate –  hymn ‘Ave Maria’. David Cameron held a reception for Easter in Downing Street hours after the resignation of his Culture Secretary Maria Miller . The Prime Minister asked church leaders if there were any volunteers to help bear his burdens . After spending a week defending Mrs Miller, Mr Cameron yesterday admitted he had learned the hard way that public anger over MPs' expenses is still 'raw'. In the Commons he struggled to explain why he clung on to his Culture Secretary after she was ordered to repay £5,800 in over-claimed expenses and apologise to the Commons. Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the PM of a 'terrible error of judgement' by refusing to sack Mrs Miller earlier, adding: 'He just doesn't get it.' But by evening Mr Cameron was rather more . philosophical, ignoring the advice of former Labour spin doctor . Alastair Campbell that Downing Street does not 'do God'. Hosting the Easter reception in Number . 10, he told church leaders how he finds ‘moments of greatest peace’ at . Thursday morning services and even claimed Jesus was responsible for . his ‘Big Society’ policy. Soprano Laura Wilde sang Ave Maria for guests, before Mr Cameron addressed the audience. Maria Miller quit as Culture Secretary six days after being told to repay £5,800 . The . Prime Minister said: ‘The Bible tells us to bear one another’s burdens. 'After the day I’ve had, I’m definitely looking for volunteers.’ Mrs . Miller was told on Tuesday night by an ‘emissary’ that senior Tories . believed she should offer to resign for the good of the party. She . then had a late-night phone call with the Prime Minister as he was . returning from the state banquet for the Irish president at Windsor . Castle in which it was agreed she would quit. Mrs . Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed mortgage expenses and . found to have broken the MPs’ code of conduct in her belligerent . attitude towards the independent parliamentary standards commissioner. The offence was compounded when the Culture Secretary delivered a curt 32-second apology in the Commons. Allies . of Mrs Miller claimed she had been the victim of a ‘witch-hunt’, in part . fuelled by opposition to her policy to legalise gay marriage. Mr Cameron made no reference to the issue in his speech, according to a Bloomberg report. Instead he focussed on his own faith, and went further than he has before in describing the comfort he takes from the church. He . described Jesus Christ as ‘our saviour’ and said his ‘moments of . greatest peace’ come ‘perhaps every other Thursday morning’ when he . slips into the sung Eucharist at St. Mary Abbots, the church in . Kensington, west London. Soprano Laura Wilde sang Ave Maria, hours after Mrs Miller was forced to quit over her expenses . Mr Cameron was seen leaning against a pillar with his eyes shut as Miss Wilde sang . The . church is linked to the school his children attend. He added: ‘I find a . little bit of peace and hopefully a bit of guidance.’ Mr Cameron also spoke of the support he received from the church when his son Ivan died in 2009. Mark Abrey, the vicar of at his local church, was the ‘person who looked after me’, Mr Cameron said. ‘I can’t think of anyone who was more loving or thoughtful or kind,’ he added. The . Big Society, to encourage more volunteering and social enterprise, . was one of the flagship ideas of Mr Cameron’s Tory leadership. Mr Cameron also spoke of how he finds his 'moments of peace' during Thursday morning visits to church . Mr Cameron said Christians are now the most persecuted religion around the world . But the onset of the recession, and confusion about what it really meant, has sen it quietly dropped in recent years. But last night Mr Cameron boasted: ‘Jesus invented the Big Society 2,000 years ago; I just want to see more of it. ‘If there are things that are stopping you from doing more, think of me as a giant Dyno-Rod’ to clear any blockages. He went on: ‘It is the case that Christians are now the most persecuted religion around the world . ‘We should stand up against persecution of Christians and other faith groups wherever and whenever we can.’","Prime Minister hosted Easter reception hours after resignation broke .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A schoolboy who was teased when he failed to light a fire on a Scout trip decided to build one in his garden - and sparked a £10,000 blaze which left him in hospital. Edward Hawkins, 14, hoped to prove himself to his friends by stacking up wood in the garden of his family home in Wainscott, Kent, and dousing it with petrol as his mother took his brother to school. Armed with a camera phone to capture the moment, he put a match to the pile but watched in horror as flames leapt onto spread to his father, Eddie’s, shed. Aftermath: Edward Hawkins was treated at the specialist burns unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead after burning himself in a fire he set . This picture, taken through a neighbour's window, shows the scale of the fire the schoolboy started . It contained two explosive gas canisters, and as Edward frantically tried to empty it, a petrol can exploded, soaking him as he stamped down the flames. The fire spread up from his feet, engulfing his clothes and body before blistering his hands and face. The schoolboy tried to put out the flames by rolling on the ground as neighbours raced to throw wet blankets over him and called emergency services. Edward was taken to hospital suffering superficial burns to his face, and is now waiting to hear if he will need a skin graft for a bad burn to his thumb. The fire wrecked the home-made shed where site manager Mr Hawkins, 48, kept his expensive tools and garden equipment, causing £10,000 damage. Scout Edward Hawkins, 14, built a large fire in his parents' garden in Wainscott, Kent, but ended up in hospital with severe burns . Edward said: 'I just remember thinking, I need to put out the fire and I need to get the tools and gas out of the shed. 'Apparently I was shouting, but I couldn’t feel anything, I was just panicking and didn’t realise how badly I was burnt.' Neighbour Len Cracknell, 74, said he heard Edward shouting 'Help me, help, I’m on fire' and called the fire brigade. The schoolboy's mother, Carol, 49, a party planner, said: 'I abandoned my car and sprinted up the road, screaming for Edward. 'The first I saw him he was on a . stretcher ready to be wheeled all the way down the road to the ambulance . because it couldn’t get to the house. 'I was so frightened, I felt like I was going to collapse. All I could hear was Edward saying ‘Mummy, help me, please help me’.' She added: 'This all came about because those Scouts teased him when he couldn’t get his fire going. 'He just wanted to show them he could light one, bless him. Unfortunately I think he went a bit too far. 'The firefighters said to us the two gas canisters still in the shed were seconds off exploding from the heat and if they had, Edward might not be here today. 'To be honest, Edward wasn’t thinking about himself, he was more worried about how angry his dad would be that the outhouse he built from scratch, and all his tools, had been destroyed. Up in smoke: The wooden shed, hand-built by Edward's father, contained tools worth £10,000 . Edward was badly burnt as he tried to save the contents of the shed, and may need a skin graft on his thumb . Edward's mother, Carol, 49, said she sprinted to the house to see her son being carried out on a stretcher . 'But at the end of the day they’re replaceable, my son isn’t and I’m just so happy and relieved that he is alive.' Firefighters were delayed in tackling the blaze because double-parking in the Hawkins' cul-de-sac . prevented them from getting their vehicles near enough, forcing them to lay out hoses first. Edward was taken to Medway Maritime Hospital, before being transferred to the specialist burns unit at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Doctors say the burns on his face are likely to heal, but he may need a skin graft on a bad burn to his thumb. Edward is a member of the 27th All Saints Frindsbury Scout troop. Assistant Scout leader Derek King refused to comment today. Scouts work towards a variety of badges, two of which involve learning about fire safety. The Camper Activity badge is awarded to Scouts who can demonstrate their ability in a variety of camping skills, one of which is constructing an 'altar fire', ie one on top of a trestle-table shaped construction. Scouts aiming for the Fire Safety Skill badge must learn about 'the dangers of fires at camp and what precautions should be taken', as well as how to act if fire breaks out.  They must also know how to deal with a person whose clothes are on fire.

"By . Tom Latchem . Fiona believes that by confronting the issue of pregorexia, Emmerdale could help many expectant mothers . Emmerdale's ongoing 'pregorexia' storyline may be the first time the dangerous condition has ever featured in a British soap. But for the many thousands of women around the country carrying babies while in the grip of anorexia and bulimia, it's a constant battle that can lead to severe complications and dangerously undernourished babies. Actress Fiona Wade, whose character Priya Sharma is currently going through the eating disorder one in 14 pregnant women suffers from, is glad she's raising awareness of what is essentially a mental disorder. 'Pregorexia is a dangerous condition,' says the 35-year-old, 'yet most people have never heard of it. I don't think it's taken as seriously as many other mental illnesses - but that's what it is. 'When you think how many people watch the show we're really getting the message out there. I've had lots of lovely letters from people with the condition saying they feel they can be more open about it now it's out there. It's wonderful to think the storyline might be making a positive difference to viewers' lives. I just wanted to portray it as accurately as I could.' Fiona researched the condition in detail, speaking to psychotherapists and reading sufferers' accounts. And what she uncovered shocked her - a study by University College London found seven per cent of pregnant British women have a full-blown eating disorder, while a quarter are highly concerned about their weight, placing their life, and that of their unborn child, at risk. Fiona's research has helped her realistic portrayal of Priya, who's seven months pregnant and obsessed with avoiding food and making herself sick after meals. 'I threw myself into it to help me get into sufferers' mindsets. It's been challenging, with lots of scenes that take it out of you. But I feel passionate about it.' While Fiona, nominated for Sexiest Female at next month's British Soap Awards, has always been slim, thankfully she's never suffered an eating disorder herself. Though that doesn't mean the actress, who has previously stripped down to her underwear for racy photoshoots and sex scenes, is without self-doubt. Fiona Wade on set with Bhasker Patel (right) and Rik Makarem (left) 'Oh, I'm as insecure as every other girl,' she says. 'I'm the biggest worrier. I'll do a shoot and think, “Oh God, was that alright?” I pull myself apart the same as anyone.' Aside from that, Fiona, who's just signed on with the ITV soap for another year, says she's having the time of her life. The only thing missing, though, is a man to share it with. 'I'm in my 30s and, while being single is fun, it would be nice to meet someone. I'm in a great place career-wise, so that would be the icing on the cake. Priya likes a bad boy, but I definitely don't want one - I'm ready to meet a great guy who'll be my best friend. 'Yes, I'm super busy, constantly running between my home in Leeds and my mum's place in Hertfordshire, but if you want to be with someone enough you'll make it work. I wouldn't let anything stand in the way.' Dubai or Las Vegas? Dubai is perfect for winter sun and relaxation. Juice or cola? I don't drink alcohol so I'm obsessed with fresh juices -  I try to have one every morning. Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio? Leonardo is incredible - every film, every character he plays, he nails. Kylie Minogue or Rihanna? I like all kinds of music, but I've been loving Kylie's new album Kiss Me Once lately. Monopoly or Cranium? My family all play Cranium at Christmas - it gets everyone thinking and is such fun. 4x4 or a sports car? I really like the Range Rover Evoque - it's a 4x4 with a sleek look for women.Winding down with friends or a spa weekend? I love a catch-up  at mine with a movie and food.","One in 14 pregnant women suffer from an eating disorder .

"By . Kim Carillo . Ah, the glorious hint of summer, the softness of the breeze, the winter grump giving way to lightness, but — ugh — the clothes! Few things can dull the mood of a (slightly) older lady like a sweep around the shops as autumn/winter’s woollens give way to pastel atrocities and, horror of horror, sleeveless shifts. At 54, my arms pay no heed to twice-weekly Pilates classes or 40 lengths of the pool. So stubborn are those pockets of fat that the number of surgical ‘arm lifts’  carried out in Britain increased by 97 per cent from 2009 to 2011.But I prefer to rely on the perfect summer sleeve, revealing just the right amount of skin. At last, the High Street is taking notice, and there are more spring dresses with sleeves than ever. I checked out what’s available . . . Denim shirt dress, £30, next.co.uk, Heels, £29, dorothyperkins.com . My . initial reaction to this was ‘Prisoner Cell Block H’. I do wear denim . quite a bit but this looked a lot younger than what I would usually . attempt. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised that with a few . tweaks — rolling up the long sleeves and tying the belt tightly around . my waist — and a nude pair of heels, it actually looked nice. Not an . outfit for an expensive lunch, perhaps, but nice for a potter around the . shops or a picnic. Bright pumps are a must, though. SCORE: 3/5 . LK Bennett lace sleeve dress, £295, johnlewis.com. Heels, £195, lucychoilondon.com . This . flattering soft pink made my skin look tanned and felt really modern . and fresh. The delicate, elbow-length lace gave a tantalising glimpse of . flesh without being too revealing and made my arms appear slimmer. The . dress skimmed over my hips and was comfortable both sitting and . standing. I intend to wear this again as it’s sexy without being . overdone and incredibly comfortable to wear. SCORE: 5/5 . Floral print dress, £95, Coast-stores.com, Heels, £198, lucychoilondon.com . I am really not a  floral person — I don’t have a single floral item in my wardrobe — but this I really loved. It’s . perfectly cut, managing to simultaneously fit like a glove while also . having plenty of give, so you don’t feel like you’re sewn in. The . elbow-length sleeves make my arms looks slim and trim. In fact, I like . it so much I’m going to wear it to a swanky lunch party. Love it. SCORE: 4/5 . Phase Eight maxi, £120, johnlewis.com, Heels, £60, office.co.uk . A . lovely evening look with three-quarter-length lace sleeves which were . neither heavy nor scratchy. Although very fitted, the gentle gathering . across the stomach cut a flattering shape, and navy was a nice change . from funereal black. Lace sleeves are the perfect answer to summer . dressing, especially for over-50s. Very nice.     SCORE: 3.5/5 . EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT . Goat belted dress, £450, Fenwick: 0207 629 9161, Heels, £195, lucychoillondon.com . I . loved the pleating around the bust, while the belt nipped in at  just . the right point. The sleeves were a lovely length and the hem  was cut . for an elegant  silhouette. I wouldn’t usually go for white in a dress . as it can be very unflattering, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Yes, it . is expensive but it looks — and feels — it too. Would look even better . with a light tan at a  garden party. SCORE: 4/5 . Embellished midi dress, £399, tedbaker.com, Heels, £69, dune.co.uk . Oh gosh. Not my cup of tea at all. The length made me feel dumpy and, as it was difficult to walk in, I felt incredibly inelegant. The sleeves were cut at an unflattering length and were too unfitted, while the chainmail overlay was far too heavy. Even bare arms would be better. I don’t see myself wearing this any time soon and certainly not at that cost. SCORE:0/5 .","Ranging from £30 to £450, Kim Carillo looks at the Spring dresses that reveal just the right amount of skin ."
"By . Nicole Lampert . Keith Barron & Gwen Taylor are to star in a new stage version of the hit TV show of Duty Free . A reunion after nearly 30 years is always going to be a nostalgic event, but I didn't expect this. Gruff Yorkshireman Keith Barron is sitting in front of me, big fat tears rolling down his face, as he talks about when he first realised the 1980s sitcom Duty Free was special. 'It was one of the first scenes we did, when Gwen (Taylor, who played his shrewish wife) pushed me into a pond,' he says, misting over. 'And as I was under the water I was smiling to myself thinking, ""This is good, this is really good.""' Gwen, who's sitting next to him, smiles and pats him on the knee. It's been a bit emotional all round. Duty Free only ran for two years, from 1984 to 1986, but was one of the biggest comedies of the decade, regularly attracting 12 million viewers. The show was a farce about two working-class Northerners, David and Amy Pearce, enjoying their first trip to Spain. There they meet posh Southerners, Robert and Linda Cochran, and David and Linda decide they're in love, mainly because he pretends to be a lot more worldly than he really is. There's lots of hiding in wardrobes and romantic interludes rudely interrupted, mostly by Amy who's determined to keep David from straying by constantly outwitting him. All the while Robert remains blissfully oblivious to the whole thing. The show's still regularly aired on various satellite channels, and Keith says he gets stopped at least four times a day by people who want to talk to him about it. 'And I'll get people in the supermarket joking, ""Are you going to pay for that in pesetas?""' laughs Gwen. She says the show struck a chord with so many because the couple had the same flaws as real people. 'Women would stop me in the street and say, ""David's just like him"" about their husbands. The fibbing and the sucking in of the stomach when the ladies walked past, the pretending to be sophisticated with wine. Amy always knew that once she got him home he'd be back to normal - he'd just had his head turned. The thing about the show was it was always on the verge but you never saw any sort of sex. They were always thwarted by a donkey, or a monkey... but mainly by me.' The original cast of Duty Free in 1984 Keith Barron, Gwen Taylor, Joanna Van Gyseghem and Neil Stacy . Keith laughs and adds, 'Taxi drivers used to shout at me, ""Have you got your leg over yet?"" And I'd say ""No"" - we all knew if I got my leg over there'd be no show. It was all about the pursuit.' No wonder then - hot on the heels of the rejuvenated sitcom Birds Of A Feather - a new stage show is bringing Duty Free back to life. 'When they first approached me about it I thought, ""What took you so long?""' says Keith, 79, who's been popping up in everything from DCI Banks to Benidorm ever since. 'We enjoyed the success of it so much. I just thought, ""I have to do it.""' But Gwen, 75, who was given her own sitcom, Barbara, after Duty Free finished, almost turned it down. Joanna Van Gyseghem who played Linda, the object of David's affections, was unable to do it because she'd just become a grandmother to twins. But she's been replaced by Carol Royle while Neil Stacy returns as Robert. 'I was worried that without Joanna the whole thing would be unbalanced but Carol is wonderful,' says Gwen. We meet just five days into rehearsals. 'The first week has been a bit awful,' says Keith, lowering his voice. 'It's been a bit messy,' adds Gwen. 'People assume we don't need to bother getting to know the characters but it was 30 years ago. And there's been a fair bit of crying,' she adds. 'Getting back together has been really moving; this show meant so much to us. It made us household names and that's an amazing thing.' The new show, Last Of The Duty Free, picks up the story 30 years on. Surprisingly, given that they've barely seen each other for 30 years, their easy chemistry makes Gwen and Keith seem like they really have been married for decades. 'We've spoken a bit but not really stayed in touch.' says Keith, 'That's the odd thing about the business. You take up where you left off. It's strange.' The new show, Last Of The Duty Free, picks up the story 30 years on. David has bumped into Linda at a train station in England and the two have planned a secret rendezvous at the Spanish hotel where their frustrated love affair first started. But then their spouses find out; and all four find themselves back in Spain. Three decades on means 30 years older though, and at the rehearsal studio today both are carefully avoiding the low sofa - . 'You'll never get up from that,' Gwen warns Keith. 'Oh, it's terrible. We're old now,' says Keith. 'Yes, we've got aches in our knees and our hips,' adds Gwen. 'When I see old episodes of the show I look so beautiful and young that I can't bear it.' The play has been penned by original Duty Free writer Eric Chappell, and he knows his leading pair well enough to incorporate some of their own characteristics into it. 'I can be a bit rude at times,' says Gwen, who's married to playwright Graham Reid in real life. 'I do come out with things and then think, ""Oh no, I shouldn't have said that.""' Keith, who has two sons with his stage designer wife Mary Pickard, admits he empathises with David's constant fibbing. 'I think most men lie,' he shrugs. 'It's the quest for something better in life. I think David would like to be staying at the Ritz - if he'd heard of the Ritz; he's always trying to climb out of the situation he is in. 'Our characters were from the common . herd. We are everyman and everywoman and people used to like seeing us . getting one over on the posh people.' Keith Barron . 'Our characters were from the common herd. We are everyman and everywoman and people used to like seeing us getting one over on the posh people. It was a show families would watch together because there was never any sex in it. They don't really make sitcoms for families now.' The show required a certain amount of suspension of disbelief; essentially the group were on the same holiday for over two years. And the series never actually made it to Spain (although one Christmas special was partly filmed there) because of budget constraints. The resort was replicated at Yorkshire Television Studios - money was so tight there was only one bedroom with curtains and soft furnishings being changed between scenes depending on who was supposed to be sleeping there. With the success of sitcoms like Rev and Miranda, could a TV comeback be next for Duty Free if all goes well on tour? 'I say yes, but quietly,' says Keith. 'At the moment I'm more concerned about trying to get ready for the tour.' 'I'd be worried about high-definition,' adds Gwen. 'It's so cruel and shows every flaw. Even the most beautiful girls look flawed on it.' Keith grabs Gwen's hand as if they'd skipped over 28 years in a heartbeat, 'Oh, but darling, you look lovely.' The UK tour of Last Of The Duty Free opens on Tuesday at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.

"By . James Peachey . Emma Thompson says she very much enjoyed her kissing scenes with Pierce Brosnan in their new movie The Love Punch . Emma Thompson seems to be suffering some sort of mid-life romantic crisis. First she pronounced that dancing with Prince Charles was 'better than sex', then she told us all how the perm she'd had for her role as Mary Poppins author PL Travers in movie Saving Mr Banks  had put a serious dent in her love life. Now, she's positively drooling over Pierce Brosnan, her  co-star in comedy heist movie The Love Punch. 'We play a divorced couple and had some kissing scenes to do,' explains Emma. 'I just kept messing up the scene in so many different ways, as often as I could, because Pierce was such a good kisser and I didn't want the scene to end. When we finally got it right, Pierce turned to me and said, “Have we been kissing all day?” And I said, rather sheepishly, “Well yes, I rather think we have.” 'But how can you resist Pierce?! He has an enormous amount of glamour but he's also very surprising to the point where you suddenly expect him to whip out some knitting. He has the most extraordinary grace. He's like a ballerina, he has this remarkable way of moving and yet he can also sit there and do the crossword and be very normal.' 'You can't really be a movie star if you can't walk or run and some people just can't. I don't mean they can't get about, they obviously can, but you don't want to watch them moving about because they aren't attractive when they do so, they don't do it with grace. Pierce does. That's why he was such a successful Bond. Watching him move in that role was so wonderful.' Emma - looking younger than her 54 years - is cast as Kate, the ex-wife of Pierce's character Richard in The Love Punch. The couple have been divorced for eight years following Richard's numerous affairs but are brought together again by unfortunate circumstances. 'Richard's company is stripped of its assets. All their income that's paying for their children's education, the mortgages on their respective homes, is taken from them,' explains Emma. 'They join forces to try and gain revenge on the businessman who asset-stripped the company and who's spent £10 million on a diamond for his fiancée. Stealing the gem, and selling it, would solve Richard and Kate's financial problems so they travel to France to try and pinch it.' Emma Thompson with her husband Greg Wise at an after party for the Closing Night Gala European Premiere of Saving Mr Banks . Aided and abetted by their best friends Jerry and Pen (Timothy Spall and Celia Imrie), they become unlikely burglars, intent on stealing back the diamond by whatever means necessary. Working as Home Counties versions of The Pink Panther also reawakens the passion between them, although even at the beginning of the movie there's not a lot of animosity between Richard and Kate. 'The truth is, she's more amused by his failed relationships with much younger women than upset by them. She thinks he's nicer than he used to be and much less of a twit. 'There was an earlier draft of the script where the couple had only been divorced for a short while and there was still a lot of rage and pain between them. But I think this works better, it's lighter and it's funnier. This movie is about lifting people's spirits and God knows that's what we all need from time to time! 'Also, I wonder whether we haven't stumbled on something important here. Richard and Kate have taken a proper break from their marriage, a beneficial break, and I wonder whether this isn't the way forward for a lot of married couples? You look at it and think that maybe every marriage should have a kind of sabbatical, that couples should be forced to take a break from each other every so often, if just for a year or so. It's actually not a bad idea.' 'You look at it and think that maybe . every marriage should have a kind of sabbatical, that couples should be . forced to take a break from each other every so often. It's actually not a bad idea.' She's warming to her theme now. 'You need to go off perhaps, although not to be with other people. I think that would make things very difficult: that free love stuff has been tried and tested and doesn't work and has been proven to make relationships very, very tricky. But I'm sure a sabbatical could work if it were done properly. The Love Punch proves it. It's about two people who know each other very, very well coming back together again and loving each other in a different kind of way second time around.' So is Emma thinking of taking a sabbatical from her own marriage to actor Greg Wise, whom she met when they were both appearing in the 1995 movie Sense And Sensibility? 'Oh no,' she says, looking somewhat shocked. 'I'm not talking about myself, I'm talking  in general terms about long-term relationships.' She's equally matter-of-fact on the subject of holding grudges, the kind that drive Kate and Richard to seek revenge in The Love Punch. Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan as Kate and Richard in Love Punch . Twice an Oscar winner for her performance in Howards End in 1992 and for her script for Sense And Sensibility, you might imagine there are people in Emma's life against whom she might legitimately hold a grudge. Kenneth Branagh, perhaps, her first husband, whose affair with actress Helena Bonham Carter on the set of Frankenstein put the skids under his marriage to Emma in the early 90s? But no, she says, grudges just aren't her  thing. 'I don't hold grudges. I really ought to hold them slightly more - I'm rubbish  at them. It's actually one of my best qualities, not to hold grudges. I have many vile characteristics but  that's quite a nice one. Frankly, I haven't got the energy. It takes a lot of energy to hold on to grudges and I don't really see the point of them.' What she does see the point of is making a sequel to The Love Punch, if the opportunity arises. She clearly had a ball filming this first movie, which was shot entirely on location in France. 'I was surprised, in particular, at how much I enjoyed all the action scenes, whether it was playing beach volleyball, slipping into a rubber diving suit or driving a car very fast through the streets of Paris. The highlight was definitely the driving. 'I was allowed to do a lot of it and I had Pierce sitting next to me in the passenger seat as I manoeuvred this car down a very steep flight of steps. He was genuinely frightened at the prospect of tipping over. Imagine that! Stunt driving with an ex-James Bond beside you, and he's the one that's frightened! 'I've definitely got the taste for a full-on action movie now. Maybe, if enough people come to see this film and it makes enough money, we could do a sequel where Jerry and Pen are on holiday in some exotic location, and Richard and Kate have to rescue them from pirates? I'd be keen to do that.' James Peachey . The Love Punch is in cinemas from Friday and will be available on DVD and Blu-ray from 18 August.","Emma Thompson returns to cinema screens in a new film The Love Punch .

"By . Christopher Stevens . We're a nation of hoarders, but Drew Pritchard might inspire you to take a closer look at your clutter. His TV show Salvage Hunters proves that junk can be priceless - if it has the 'X Factor'. Drew, 43, is no ordinary antiques trader. He describes himself as a 'decorative salvage dealer', scouring collections and hoards everywhere from country houses to bric-a-brac shops, in search of things to renovate. He has an eye for the pieces other dealers miss, and his discerning clients - who include fashion designer Ralph Lauren, chef Marco Pierre White and Hollywood star Jim Carrey - trust his taste in the unusual. Drew Pritchard on the hunt for hidden treasures . A typical Drew find might be a rusty arc lamp or a vintage barber's shop chair... or even part of a building, such as a gargoyle. He got his eye for art from his father, a painter who taught him about perspective, scale and form. 'I still can't paint,' he admits with a laugh, 'but I can look at something and know at a glance whether it's right or wrong.' He insists he never overthinks what to buy. 'It's very organic, I just let it happen,' he says. At 15 he set out on a lifelong treasure hunt, learning how to find buyers and turn a profit. He and his wife Rebecca now sell all over the world from their warehouse in Conwy, North Wales, and in January they opened a stand at the Liberty department store on Regent Street in London. 'This is the best job in the world. I . get to wander round beautiful buildings, and buy something wonderful. I own it for a . brief space of time and then I make my living out of it.' 'That was a fluke,' Drew says. 'The head buyer of Liberty called into my warehouse when he was on holiday. He didn't even know I had a TV show!' Most antiques traders are well aware of Drew's television fame - this week sees the start of the show's fourth series - and that creates its own problems. 'I don't mind getting recognised, and . it doesn't really push the prices up - in fact, some people want to . strike a deal just because they love the show. But I do end up with . things I sometimes didn't intend to buy, because so many youngsters . approach me with their discoveries. They've found something unusual, and . I want to encourage their passion for antiques, so we end up haggling . and I end up paying. That's OK, because it's helping to shape the next . generation of salvage hunters.' The . new series sees Drew uncover an Aladdin's cave above a Shropshire pub, . where the landlord has been collecting oddities for 50 years. 'I'm a . hoarder,' confesses Alan East, 77, who  runs The Yew Tree Inn. 'It . goes back to the war - you didn't throw anything away.' The rooms . upstairs, which once might have been let by the night to travellers, are . now over-stuffed museums packed with the unexpected... such as a . 19th-century three-cornered hat with ostrich plumes, and a velveteen . dress uniform that would not have looked out of place on the cover of . The Beatles' Sgt Pepper album. Drew's celebrity clients include fashion designer Ralph Lauren (left) and chef Marco Pierre White (right) But Drew's eye picks out an oak box that contains a bizarre Edwardian apparatus for delivering electric shocks to treat psychiatric illnesses. It's just the sort of puzzling contraption, all cables and dials with brass levers, that might turn up in any junk shop with a £5 tag... but the right buyer might pay a hundred times that. That nose for a bargain uncovers all sorts of unlikely gems. In a barn on the grounds of a Georgian manor house in Wales, Drew sees a battered armchair lying upside down. Its stuffing is slashed and two legs have snapped off - most people would take one look and sling it on a bonfire, but Drew pays £150. Even his wife thinks he's taken leave of his senses, until it emerges from his renovation workshop with all four legs. Suddenly, the chair is a classic, and worth an estimated £550. He has to be quick off the mark to find the best pieces, and be prepared to go wherever the treasure is hidden. 'Last week I got an email from a friend about a mill in Halifax, with some photos of carts made out of pony skins - huge square things, with massive cast iron wheels, 160 years old. We were there next morning and bought 16. You've got to get in the car, know what they're worth to you and have the money ready. The only downside is the amount of driving - it's often five hours on the road.' On a visit to Kevin Marshall, who runs what some say is Britain's best junk shop in Kingston upon Hull, Drew falls in love with a chair from a traditional barber's shop. It's child-sized and decorated with a metal horse's head to keep young customers amused while they were getting a short back and sides. Kevin is reluctant to part with it, but Drew knows that many visitors to his stand at Liberty would happily pay £1,500 to buy it for their own young family. A deal is soon sealed. 'I'm so lucky,' Drew enthuses. 'This is the best job in the world. I get to wander round beautiful buildings, see antique collections that are like time capsules, and buy something wonderful. I own it for a brief space of time and then I make my living out of it.' So next time you think of clearing out your attic, just remember - one man's junkyard is another man's fortune.

"By . Monty Don . Working with my hands has always given me a deep satisfaction, and the physical, tactile skills of gardening are an essential part of its pleasure, regardless of which plants I'm growing. For ten years in the 1980s my wife Sarah and I ran a jewellery company, designing all the pieces ourselves and, for the first few years before the business grew, making them all too. Sarah had studied jewellery design but I had to learn on the job. One of my regrets is that I didn't maintain my silversmithing skills, because I loved working with that sublime metal. Monty says that it's essential for us to preserve our ancient crafts before they die out . But I became swept up in the desk-based business of making a living rather than making objects. The truth is that the demands of a professional craft require absolute dedication. The half-hearted soon get found out. Making things matters. We were once a nation that made everything from buttons to ships. Now we make hardly anything, and we are losing the sense of self-worth that comes with doing something well yourself. This loss often extends to whole communities. But I believe many of us still have a hankering to learn the skills necessary to make things we can be proud of. I became convinced of this while filming a new series called Monty Don's Real Craft. In it we follow three very skilled, keen amateurs in six different crafts on an intensive month-long course aimed at raising their skills to a professional level, culminating in a competition for a prestigious commercial commission. Stone mason, Brad Steele at work . The crafts in this series are blacksmithing, stonemasonry, weaving, pottery, furniture-making and glass-blowing. Each was led by a master craftsman who lived and worked with the trainees cheek by jowl, guiding and overseeing their work, acting as mentor, instructor and, at times, brutally harsh adjudicator of their efforts. The results were fascinating. All the hopefuls were shocked to realise the gulf between the amateur and the working professional. A prime example was when Aidan McEvoy - a Surrey-based cabinet maker who creates furniture of breathtaking quality for clients including the Royal Family - set his three trainees, Richard, 46, Jodie, 32, and Daniel, 30, the task of making a box in four hours. They showed, I thought, remarkable skill and application, though none had finished when Aidan called time. One by one he picked their work apart. 'Look at this,' he said, peering at one of Jodie's dovetail joints. 'This relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all, in every craft, for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week' 'This is half a millimetre out. There's a gap you could drive a car through.' It must be pointed out that this half-millimetre gap would be permanently hidden inside the box. 'But I know it's there,' said Aidan, 'and you know. And in 60 years that joint might give. When I make furniture I want someone to treasure it in at least 100 years' time.' Within half an hour of arriving at the glass-blowing works in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, trainees Kira, 39, Bee, 24, and James, 24, were asked by master glass-blower Jim Adlington to make a pair of identical wine glasses. I'd had a go at making a glass bowl and know that handling the molten glass is desperately tricky. They struggled bravely but for the most part hopelessly. Making just one good one was tough. Making two the same seemed impossible. But, as Jim pointed out, people buy glasses in sets. There seemed to be a mountain for them to climb to even begin to achieve the standard expected. Sam, 30, Stephane, 41, and Jo, 28, . worked for days making mouldings to replace 500-year-old stones from . Worcester Cathedral, thrilled their work would stand for centuries . alongside medieval craftsmanship. The . results were astonishingly good. But not good enough, according to . mentor Brad Steele. All three were rejected as unworthy to stand with . the work of any of the masons who'd worked on the cathedral through the . ages. This relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all, in every craft, for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week. Trainee blacksmith, Sally, gets to work . They spent their days in a strange combination of mental and physical exhaustion, and exhilaration at getting expert tutelage in the thing they loved most. At any point they could have given up; a couple did. But most persevered, despite sometimes feeling hopelessly out of their depth. Sally, 23 - a petite mother from Lancashire - had trained as a farrier, making and fitting shoes for horses, but broke her back in an accident. This meant farriering - with its intense bursts of activity requiring great strength and awkward crouching to pick up hooves - was no longer possible. But she took to the steadier rhythms of blacksmithing - general metalwork using an anvil and hammer - with fierce determination despite desperately missing her baby daughter and constant pain from her injured back. Likewise Joel, her fellow trainee, at 28 recovering from ME and at times looking dangerously exhausted, gave himself wholeheartedly to the hours of physical labour shaping the hot metal, eventually transforming himself as well as his skills. It was hard. But for all of them, from the glassblowers making spectacular chandeliers for the hotel chain Hotel du Vin, to the weavers creating woven bags for smart menswear retailer Hackett and the potters making a porcelain tea service for the chic Goring hotel in London's Belgravia, it was a transformative experience. Other than the two who decided to leave, all our trainees made scarcely believable improvements. Some will go on to new careers in their chosen crafts. This series shows our hunger for excellence hasn't been blunted by modern consumerism. The crafts passed on through the centuries are still vital, and their mastery provides a life richer and more rewarding than anything money can buy.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Keith Ballantine was struck down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome after consuming too many liquorice allsorts - which gave him an upset stomach . A grandfather who got an upset stomach after eating too many of his favourite sweets developed a rare nerve condition that left him paralysed. Keith Ballantine was struck down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome after consuming too many liquorice allsorts - which gave him an upset stomach. Doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight the upset stomach caused his body to react badly - and Mr Ballantine, from Worcester, then developed the deadly nerve disease. Within weeks, he was completely paralysed - and only now, a year later, has he managed to relearn to walk again. The 68-year-old said: 'I ate a whole packet of liquorice allsorts in one sitting - they were always my favourite treat. 'I ended up having a bit of an upset tummy, and a week later, I was struggling to get out of bed. 'It’s been an absolute nightmare. I lost three stone in a month and it’s taken me a year to start walking again.' He first noticed something was wrong shortly after eating the sweets when he couldn’t turn the ignition in his car. 'My thumb felt weak but I brushed it off as old age  - just as I did when I lost the feeling in my feet.' After struggling to get out of bed the following week , his wife Jennifer, 64, took him to their GP in September 2012. His condition deteriorated rapidly as he lost feeling in almost all of his body and he was admitted to hospital while doctors frantically tried to diagnose his mystery illness. It was only when a doctor asked him whether he had had been unwell in the previous weeks and he remembered his stomach bug that he realised GBS was a possibility. As a former nurse, he was aware of the symptoms and knew the seriousness of the situation. Doctors believe the antibodies Mr Ballantine (with wife Jennifer) produced to fight the upset stomach caused his body to react badly - triggering the debilitating nerve disease . GBS usually occurs when antibodies produced by the immune system to fight an infection also start attacking the nervous system. Although it only affects one in every 40,000 people, sufferers normally lose mobility and spend months in rehabilitation relearning to use their limbs. Guillain-Barre . (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition . of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects . about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in . men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural . defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing . them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around . 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or . months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve . damage. For more information: www.gbs.org.uk . Consultant Neurologist Dr John Winer is an expert on GBS and how it develops. He said: 'In 75 per cent of cases of GBS there is a history of infection and that can be caused by either bacteria or a virus. 'We . can identify which infection GBS developed from in half of all cases, . but we don’t understand it completely and in a large number of cases, . the cause of the GBS is unclear. 'There are hundreds and hundreds of infections which are incriminated as triggers although some are more likely than others.' Caroline Morrice, director of the Guillain-Barré support charity, Gain, . said: “This is a matter of much research and the causes of GBS just . aren’t always known. 'However it definitely could have been related to these liquorice allsorts. “But it’s like all rare illnesses - we need to do more research to help people such as Keith.' After his three month stint in Worcester Royal Hospital, Keith left hospital in December still in a wheelchair. It was another four months before he could take his first steps unaided thanks to a painful course of physiotherapy and he now tries to walk a mile a day. Within weeks, Mr Banantine was completely paralysed and it has taken him a year to walk again . Amazingly, Keith has made an almost complete full recovery and has just begun driving again. He said: 'Although I’m not the man I was, there’s no point crying ""why me?"". I’ve just been very unlucky. 'If you’d asked me two years ago which, of all the illnesses I could get, which one would scare me most, I would have said GBS. 'There’s something about this illness, it’s so horrible - I really feared it. I’m just so thankful that my family have been there to support me through my recovery.' The 68-year-old said: 'I ate a whole packet of liquorice allsorts in one sitting - they were always my favourite treat. But the last year has been a nightmare'","Keith Ballantine ate whole bag of sweets in one go, upsetting his stomach .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . For most parents, having grandma take care of the children once in a while is a godsend. But it seems she may not be sharing the benefits – at least not if she does it too often. Looking after the children for five days a week or more can make grandmas less mentally sharp, a study claimed yesterday. Staying sharp: Grandparents who look after their grandchildren once a week stay mentally alert for longer, research has found . It found those who did so performed poorly in a test of working memory and mental processing speed. However, grannies who looked after the  children just once a week showed improved mental agility. Margery Gass of the North American Menopause Society, which published the study in its journal, said: ‘We know that older women who are socially engaged have better cognitive function and a lower risk of developing dementia later. But too much of a good thing just  might be bad.’ The research, carried out by the Women’s Healthy Aging Project, looked at 120 Australian grandmothers aged 57 to 68. Each woman was given three tests of mental sharpness. Nana knows best: Caring for children was found to have a particularly positive effect on grandmothers . Those who spent one day a week taking care of their grandchildren performed best in two of the tests. But those who lent a hand for five days or more fared significantly worse in the test that looked at working memory and mental  processing speed. The researchers also found that the more time grandmothers spent taking care of the grandchildren, the more they felt their own children had been demanding of them. This suggests that mood may have affected the result. The investigators are already following up the project with more research. Although other studies have examined the relationship between mental sharpness and being socially engaged, this is the first to look at how it affects grandmothers. After the menopause, women are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other cognitive disorders. ‘Because grandmothering is such an important and common social role for postmenopausal women, we need to know more about its effects on their future health,’ said Dr Gass. ‘This study is a good start.’","Grandparents benefit from looking after children once a week .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . When Joshua Tucker was taken to hospital after serving in Afghanistan the only thing keeping the Arizona soldier strong was knowing his military dog Ellen was waiting for him. But just as the K9 MP finished his treatment for injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, the Armed Forces called his wife, Sherie, to say the dog had been moved. What followed was an extraordinary effort over three years, involving the Army, Air Force and Congress to reunite Tucker with the dog that meant so much to him. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Army veteran Joshua Tucker with wife Sherie and his beloved dog Ellen on the day they were reunited . Support: Ellen and Joshua Tucker served in Afghanistan together . The black Labrador Ellen was finally tracked down to a base in Germany, and the pair shared an emotional reunion last month after the Army agreed to hand her over. For Tucker, it was the moment he had been waiting for since he was medically retired in 2011. 'They gave me my life back,' he told the Army Times. Not being able to see his dog, who had accompanied him on dangerous missions since 2009, was hard for Tucker. 'We had no idea he would never see her . again. They never let him say goodbye. ... I lost the man . that my husband was,' his wife said. She explained that when he returned from his last tour in Afghanistan he was 'banged up quite a bit' and only agreed to treatment because he believed it meant he would get to work with his dog again. But the day before he was due to leave hospital, Mrs Tucker received a phone call asking her to break the news to her husband that he wouldn't see Ellen again. 'To have to sit there and look my husband in the eye and say ""I don’t know how to tell you this, but she’s gone"",’  It was like telling him that our child just died,' she told Spouse Buzz. Refusing to give up on Ellen, the couple began a complicated journey to find the dog and adopt her. Bond: Tucker had worked with Ellen the dog since 2009, and quickly became devoted to her . Mission: Sherie and Joshua spent three years tracking down Ellen so they could adopt her . The search took them from the Joint Base Lewis-McChord base in Washington to the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, before finally finding that Ellen had been sent to a base in Ansbach, Germany. The couple contacted friends stationed in Germany, who were able to confirm Ellen was there by checking a tattoo in her ear. Tucker thought his dream of seeing Ellen had finally been realized, but despite a program to let soldiers wounded in combat adopt their service dogs, the Army declined his request. Refusing to give up, the couple enlisted the help of Arizona representative Krysten Sinema, who sent letters to the Army insisting Ellen be retired. On February 20, Tucker finally got the call he had been waiting for, when a member of the Army stationed in Europe told him: 'She's yours.' Ellen was flown to the U.S. and the pair had an emotional reunion in a hotel, where the dog charged into Tucker's arms as soon as she saw him. Focus: Tucker, pictured with Sherie and Ellen, was separated from his dog when he was treated for PTSD . 'It was kinda like seeing someone come back from the dead,' he told Fox News. His wife said seeing Ellen had an immediate affect on her husband, adding: 'I watched his eyes change back ... They gave a soldier his life back.' The couple took Ellen to meet Congresswoman Sinema this week, and to thank her for her help. She said: 'Spc Tucker and Ellen served our country valiantly in Afghanistan, and Spc Tucker has paid a dear price for that service, returning home with PTSD. 'Reuniting Spc Tucker with his best friend and prior service dog Ellen was the right thing to do and I'm so glad that our office was a part of this happy reunion.'","Joshua Tucker lost track of his bomb dog while being treated in hospital .

"By . Richard Spillett . Jasvir Ginday, 29, has been found guilty of murdering his wife Varkha after she threatened to 'out him' as gay . A gay bank worker who strangled his new bride with a hoover pipe and burnt her body in an incinerator after she threatened to 'out him' was today found guilty of murder and jailed for life. Jasvir Ram Ginday killed 24-year-old Varkha Rani in September last year following a lavish wedding ceremony in India just six months earlier. The 29-year-old strangled his wife with a metal hoover pipe before forcing her body into the 22-inch deep incinerator and setting it alight. Neighbours described a smell similar to the kind which comes from a crematorium but Ginday told them he was just 'burning some rubbish'. He then reported his wife missing and police attended the marital home on Victory Road in Walsall, West Midlands. Officers returned the next day when they saw black smoke billowing from the property and discovered Varkha's charred remains in the incinerator . Ginday was arrested and initially denied killing his wife before eventually claiming he had 'lost control' and strangled her to death. The IT expert pleaded guilty to manslaughter and a further charge of perverting the course of justice by lying to police but denied murdering his new bride. But a jury of five men and seven women found him guilty of murder unanimously today following a three-week trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Sentencing Ginday to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 21 years, Judge John Warner said he had showed a 'complete lack of any humanity' and had told 'lie after lie' in a bid to escape justice. Following the verdict, Varkha's heartbroken mother paid tribute to her 'precious' daughter and told how she knew Ginday had planned the murder all along. Kashmir Kaur, speaking from her home in Nawanshahr, India, said: 'He didn't like girls - he liked boys. 'He had already made his plans to marry a girl from India and kill her. He'd already made the plan and my innocent daughter has been killed for no reason. 'She had no idea what she was getting in to. He could have left her here in India - she could have stayed with us. Scroll down for video . The couple had wed six months earlier after Ginday travelled to India and met 15 women before marrying Varkha in front of 700 guests . 'She was the most precious of my daughters, she was my favourite. She had four degrees, she had a good life here, she was a very dutiful daughter. 'He killed her in such a heartless way and should be locked up for a long time. ' Ginday showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered and is expected to be jailed for life this afternoon. The trial heard university graduate Ginday travelled to India in October 2012 and met 15 women before marrying Varkha in front of 700 guests on March 28 last year. Varkha's mother Kashmir Kaur has paid tribute to her 'most precious' daughter, who she said had four degrees . Ginday said Varkha had threatened to leave him after finding evidence of his sexuality on his phone . The new bride, who had completed a . degree and a master's degree in science and IT in her home country, . came to the UK on August 10. Just . a month later on September 12, Ginday killed his wife in their bedroom . before dragging her body downstairs and dumping it in the burning . incinerator. The jury heard Ginday had only married Varkha because he wanted to hide his sexuality and not bring shame on his family. Ginday had been frequenting gay bars and having relationships with men around the time of his engagement to Varkha in 2012. The jury in the trial were shown CCTV images of Ginday filling up a bottle with petrol just hours before Varkha's burnt body was discovered by police . Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal said Ginday 'tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie' He told the court they began fighting . when she confronted him about his sexuality after she had found . 'material' on his iPad and iPhone. Sentencing Ginday to life imprisonment today, Judge Warner said: 'You suggest in the case going over to India to ask Varkha to marry you was not deceitful... It was clearly a fundamental deception. 'It was a very cruel situation you put her in. She was a vulnerable woman 1,000 miles from her close family. You should not have deceived in her in that way. 'Only two people know what happened that afternoon she is not here to tell us. You have told lie after lie about a number of matters making it impossible to rely on what you say. 'The state of her body was such Dr Kolar, the pathologist, couldn't even determine the cause of her death. Your injuries were caused by her desperate attempts to save herself. At first, he denied killing her but later claimed he had 'lost control' after she threatened to 'expose him in the community' 'It may be that you formed the intentions to do what you did as long as ago as when you bought the incinerator. 'You . are a very devious, controlling man and a meticulous planner in a . number of aspects of your life. By the day itself you had sorted out . what you going to do. 'Killing her was dreadful enough but what followed was horrible even beyond imagining. 'You behaved in an unbelievably casual and callous way with a complete lack of any humanity. 'No . one who was in court to hear that evidence will easily put out of their . minds the image of her body being poked and prodded by you down into . that incinerator. 'Her death and manner of her death has had a profound effect on her family leaving a gap which cannot be filled.' Police noted nothing suspicious when they first visited the couple's home in Walsall, West Midlands but returned when they saw smoke rising from the garden . Neighbours noticed a burning smell,  but Ginday told them he was just 'burning some rubbish' During the trial, Ginday had claimed his wife had threatened to 'out him' to the community. The Royal Bank of . Scotland employee  said he had realised he was gay at the age of 12 but felt . unable to tell his parents the truth because they would be 'devastated'. He told the jury: 'She started saying that she had found out about me. She said ""I have found out that you're gay"". 'I . was shocked, I didn't know how to react. She said ""I'm going to leave . you, I'm going to tell everyone. I'm going to expose you to the . community"".' 'After that everything happened so quickly. We started to fight and I was trying to plead with her not to tell anyone . 'I . didn't want anyone to know about my sexuality because I knew there . would be a lot of issues surrounding that. I still wanted to work the . relationship out. A 22-inch deep incinerator like that Ginday used to burn his wife's body . 'It happened so fast. We ended up on the bedroom floor. There was scratching going on. Then all of a sudden I lost control.' The court heard two police officers found the charred remains of Varkha in the incinerator on September 13. Prosecutor . Debi Gould said: 'A PC Dutton lifted the lid and found herself looking . down on a human skull which was severely burnt.' Pathologists . later confirmed the human remains were Varkha's and that she had died . from strangulation by a metal pole being placed across her throat. During . the trial the jury were shown CCTV images of Ginday filling up a water . bottle with petrol at a service station just hours before his wife's . remains were found. Footage of celebrations held for the . wedding of Ginday's sister Manjit - less than a week before Varkha's . death - were also played to the court. In the videos, the couple were seen having their photos taken together and then joining hands to dance alongside a crowd of people. After the verdict, Varkha's cousin Sunil Kumar said: 'No words can truly express the sadness and hurt my family and I are experiencing at the loss of Varkha, she was loved dearly by all, she had a great passion for life and doted on her family. 'Varkha attained a masters degree and was driven to make her life a success, unfortunately she fell prey to Ginday who had ulterior motives which Varkha would not have appreciated.' Detective Chief Inspector Sarbjit Johal, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Ginday got married as a matter of convenience - he tricked a poor innocent girl into marriage but was living a lie. 'When she uncovered the truth he could not live with it and killed her quickly then tried to dispose of her body and her possessions by burning them. 'Had another day passed before police attended, Ginday may well have successfully removed all traces of Varkha. 'I hope that this verdict brings some comfort to Varkha's family who have travelled from India to see justice is brought for their daughter.'","Jasvir Ram Ginday, 29, married Varkha Rani in ceremony in India last year .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Click here for the latest Augusta leaderboard . Masters champion Adam Scott opened his defence here at Augusta National on Thursday like a man with no intention of letting anyone rip the jacket off his back. All year the pride he felt in becoming the first Australian to win  here was obvious, as he took the green coat — to use the American vernacular — on a world tour  that culminated in a glorious  homecoming Down Under last November. Scott has inspired his Australian peers to such an extent that they have won four of the last seven . Job well done: Adam Scott looks happy after completing round one, finishing just one shot back . Great start: But American Bill Haas leads the way, with a round of 68 at Augusta . Respect: Haas was playing with Miguel Angel Jimenez at the Masters, and both played well . Now . the main man is back, as  he posted an impressive three-under-par 69 . that left him just a stroke off the lead held by  American Bill Haas. ‘I . don’t know how it felt to him but to me it looked like he had the ball . on a string,’ said Scott’s  playing partner, England’s US  Amateur . champion Matt Fitzpatrick. ‘He’s got such a  fantastic swing, it was a . pleasure watching him.’ The . only other player who draws compliments like this from fellow . competitors is Rory McIlroy. All those hoping for the pair to be locked . together come the final nine holes on Sunday will have been encouraged . by the sight of the Northern Irishman also taking his place on the . leaderboard. The 24-year-old finished with a 71, which represented a good start on a devilishly difficult opening day. As . so often this season, his  driving was a thing of beauty but  34 putts . told its own story of a round that was stunted by his work on the . greens. Still, the daunting . nature of the set-up was illustrated by the fact only four players broke . 70, with Bubba Watson and Louis Oosthuizen, the two men who contested . the play-off in 2012, finishing alongside Scott. Watson, the winner on that occasion two years ago, was the only player in the 97-man field to keep a bogey off his card. McIlroy . began by booming drives on the opening three holes that all came to . rest 320 yards from the tee on their respective fairways. Hanging in there: Rory McIlroy is well in contention on one under par . GARY PLAYER (@garyplayer):  ‘An honour to kick off @The_Masters with Jack & Arnie. Only 1 shot. Counting on blasting it long & straight.’ The South African veteran joined Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer to hit the honorary tee shot. TIGER WOODS (@TigerWoods): 'It never gets old watching the honorary starters tee off. One of the oldest and best traditions in the game.' The injured world No 1 had to watch from the sidelines as this year's tournament got under way. GRAEME McDOWELL (Graeme_McDowell): 'Not breaking us in gently with Day One pin positions here @The_Masters. Some tough ones especially 5/10/16.' The Northern Irishman was spot on with his predictions and faced a struggle before finishing level par for the day. SHANE WARNE (@warne888): . The Masters starts today! Good luck to all the players, especially the . Aussies, maybe back to back Scotty? My tip is @JDayGolf!' Former Australian spinner Warne was backing his fellow countryman Jason Day to follow up Adam Scott's win last year. EOIN MORGAN (@Eoin16): Made all my bets for live Masters. I've spread the love this year backing Rory, Bubba and Keegan Bradley. The England batsman will be hoping his tips perform better than his cricket team have done recently. GARETH BALE (@GarethBale11): ‘It’s Masters time! One of my favourite sporting events. Backing @DJohnsonPGA to win it this year’ The Real Madrid star backed American Dustin Johnson, but fellow Welshman Ian Woosnam finished on five over. Decent support: Girlfriend and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki was following the Northern Irishman . Could have been better: It was still a mixed day for McIllroy . At the . par-four third, that left him just a pitch on to the green and he duly . knocked it close to set up his first birdie. Another followed at the . fifth but then came bogeys at the eighth and 12th. He . found the green in two on both the par fives on the back nine to set up . birdies but a three-putt at the 18th stung. Still, as he reflected: . ‘This was a day when the course was set up so hard any score under par . represented a good start.’ McIlroy . thought the test a little different from the past, but the familiarity . of the names at the top of the leaderboard suggested otherwise. After . the monsoon on Monday and unseasonably chilly weather to follow, dawn . broke on Masters Thursday to a Georgia peach of a day. The opportunity . was clearly there to post a score and make a statement but the pin . positions on the first day are usually brutal and here was no exception. Much of the interest  surrounded McIlroy and Scott, of course, who were out in successive groups. Scott . made a spectacular start. A pushed drive at the first left  him with . only a narrow opening to squeeze his approach through if he was to find . the green. Fearless: Scott was showing no signs of nerves as he looked to defend his Masters jacket . Uh-oh: The Australian had to take a drop at the Par 5 15th . What a lesson: Amateur playing partner Matt Fitzpatrick said it was a pleasure to watch Scott's swing . He did that all . right, provoking one of the loudest cheers of the early play when the . ball pitched six feet from the hole and pulled up half that distance . away. Having achieved one . unlikely birdie, Scott managed another at the short sixth, where the . hole was positioned on a treacherous ledge. A more customary birdie for a . man with his prodigious gifts off the tee followed at the long eighth . to take him out in a tidy 33 strokes. A . birdie at the 10th — the hole he also birdied last year to break  the . Aussie curse in the play-off against Angel Cabrera — took him to four . under. The 12th hole at . Augusta is the shortest on the course, known as Golden Bell, and how . often it has tolled for players who appear to be moving through the . gears. On this day the flag . was located on the right, always the most dangerous spot. Never go for . this flag, advises Jack Nicklaus, but Scott gambled — and lost. His . ball  finished in the water and he failed to hole from six feet for a . bogey. Mixed emotions: Brandt Snedeker lead at one stage before finishing on two under, just like Jimmy Walker . Mixed emotions: Brandt Snedeker lead at one stage before finishing on two under, just like Jimmy Walker . Still going strong: Fred Couples impressed beyond his years . Scott also . three-putted the long 13th for a disappointing par, before birdieing the . 14th to continue his curious round where he birdied the holes you’re . supposed to par and parred the holes that offer obvious opportunities. ‘It showed how well I was playing that I only birdied one of the par . fives and yet still shot 69,’ he said. Seven . players shot 70, including Americans Brandt Snedeker and Jimmy Walker, . while alongside McIlroy on 71 was 54-year-old Fred Couples. Evergreen is . exactly the right word to describe him given that every time he puts on . that green jacket and walks through the gates of Magnolia Lane, he . turns into a golfing Peter Pan. Couples hasn’t finished outside the top . 15 since turning 50, a truly remarkable statistic. Scotland’s . Stephen Gallacher  finished on the same mark while Graeme McDowell shot . a respectable 72 — a score matched by the indefatigable Bernhard . Langer, now 56 — but for England’s finest it was another frustrating . day. Shining light: The Englishman struggled on day one, only Westwood really impressing . Struggled: Luke Donald (left) and Justin Rose had a horrific day with the tricky tee positions . Luke Donald found . insult added to injury when he was assessed a two-shot penalty at the . ninth for touching the sand with his club in a bunker before he hit the . ball to turn a poor 77 into a desperate 79, while Justin Rose and Ian . Poulter shot 76s. It was a . popular score among the English contingent with the two amateurs . competing, Fitzpatrick and Garrick Porteous, on the same mark. In this . company, last man out Lee Westwood’s 73 was a  positive beacon. Course specialist Phil Mickelson needs a low one as well on Friday after also shooting 76. Got a chance: Augusta regulars Louis Oosthuizen (above) and Bubba Watson are right in the mix . What . of the two Stadlers, Kevin and Craig, the first father and son to play . in the same Masters? Kevin, on his debut, shot a fine 70. His dad was . surely delighted with that? If he was, he kept it well hidden. Did you watch Kevin tee off, he was asked. ‘No,’ came the reply. He did pretty well today? ‘I’ve no idea what he shot.’ Two under. ‘Did he? Good.’ Craig Stadler, it hardly needs  saying, went round in 82.

The jackpot was well below the eye-popping record of $590.5 million, won in May by an 84-year-old Florida widow.

An off-duty police officer has died after being struck by a tanker truck on a busy motorway. Detective Constable Ian Smollet, 35, stepped out of a vehicle on the hard shoulder of the M8 outside Edinburgh when he was hit by a Leyland DAF tanker truck.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Disgraced Canadian aviator Dellan Millard who was charged in the death of a young husband and father last May is now being accused of murdering his girlfriend and shooting dead his own father. Millard, 28, of Toronto, was charged Thursday with two more counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of Wayne Millard and Laura Babcock. The November 2012 death of the suspect's father was initially ruled a suicide; Miss Babcock disappeared in June 2012. Disgraced scion: Dellan Millard, 28, of Toronto, Canada, has been charged with murder in the deaths of Tim Bosma, his own father and his ex-girlfriend . Victims: Millard's ex-girlfriend Laura Babcock (left), 23, was last seen alive in June 2012; his father, Wayne Millard (pictured right with Dellan as a boy), was found dead from a gunshot wound in November 2012 . Murdered: Tim Bosma, 32, from Ontario, disappeared after taking two men out to test drive his pickup truck - which was advertised for sale online - on May 6, 2013 . Millard was charged with first-degree murder last spring in connection to the killing of Tim Bosma, 32, from Ontario, National Post reported. . Bosma's charred remains were discovered on Millard’s farm in May 2013 more than a week after he had vanished after taking two men out to test drive his truck he was planning to sell. Millard’s new girlfriend, 21-year-old Christina Noudga, has been charged with accessory after the fact in Bosma's slaying. His friend Mark Smich, 26, faces murder charges in both the Bosma and Babcock cases. Millard’s lawyer, Deepak Paradkar, said Thursday that his client is pleading guilty to the charges, suggesting that police are trying to turn the 28-year-old aviator into a serial killer by taking advantage of the notoriety of the Bosma murder. Mr Paradkar also questioned the authorities' decision to reclassify his father's apparent suicide as a homicide two years after the fact. Co-conspirators: Prosecutors believe Millard (left) killed Bosma and disposed of his body with the help of his friend Mark Smich (right), who is also facing murder charges . Gruesome discovery: Bosma's charred remains were discovered on Millard's farm in North Dumfries Township more than a week after he disappeared . Millard and Smich are expected back in court for a preliminary hearing in September, and their trial is set to get under way in the spring of 2015. Millard is the scion of a failed aviation company, Millardair, which was started by his grandfather, retired pilot Carl Millard, in 1954. The charter airline went out of business in 1990. The Millards also owned an airline maintenance venture, which Wayne Millard headed from 2006 until his death in 2012. In his youth, Dellen Millard attended an elite private school in Toronto, where he reportedly shocked his classmates by eating dog treats in the hallways. Tim Bosma, pictured with his wife and daughter, left his home in May 2013 in the company of two strangers who asked to test drive his pickup truck . On his 14th birthday, Millard made international headlines when he became the youngest person in Canada to complete solo flights in both a plane and a helicopter. Aside of his hereditary passion for aircraft, the young aviator also owned a collection of cars, which he souped up and raced. After his father's shooting death, Millard took over the struggling family business, but it went under a short time later. But Millard still had substantial assets by the time he was arrested, with at least four valuable properties registered to his name, including his grandparents' million-dollar home in a Toronto suburb, a $1.4million apartment building, a farm and a condo in downtown Toronto, CBC reported. Dellan Millard, sporting his signature pink Mohawk on his head, was arrested May 11, 2013, just five days after the disappearance of Tim Bosma, who had put up his Dodge Ram pickup truck for sale online. Two men, believed to be Millard and Smich, answered the ad and arrived at Bosma's Ancaster home for a test drive. Bosma never made it back home to his wife, Sharlene, and his young daughter. Trailblazer: On his 14th birthday, Millard became the youngest person in Canada to complete solo flights in both a plane and a helicopter . Boss: Wayne Millard (left), pictured in 1999 with his son, was the owner of an airline maintenance venture . Three days later, police searched Millard's 45-hectare farm and discovered the missing man's badly burned body. Police believe the two suspected killers used a livestock incinerator dubbed the Eliminator to dispose of the victim’s remains. Millard had no animals on his property. In July 2012, Millard's girlfriend Laura Babcock, a 23-year-old graduate of University of Toronto, was reported missing. Her last sighting was June 26, The Toronto Star reported. According to her family, the last person Babcock spoke to was Millard. Her former boyfriend Shawn Lerner has accused police of ignoring Babcock’s missing person case because she was a mentally unstable drug user who also dabbled in the sex trade. Her body was never recovered, but homicide detectives told The Spectator they are convinced that she had met the same fate as Tim Bosma. Four months later, Wayne Millard was discovered dead in his Etobicoke home from what was believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the left side of his head. The death was ruled a suicide and Mr Millard’s body was cremated. On the occasion of his father's passing, Dellan Millard wrote a touching obituary in which he described his late parent as a humanitarian and a passionate animal activist.","Dellen Millard, 28, charged with two counts of first degree murder in 2012 slayings of Wayne Millard and Laura Babcock .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dr Chukwuma Igbokwe is accused of bullying and harassing his junior colleague in his role as director of St Luke's Healthcare group . A former diplomat exposed himself to a colleague during a two-year ‘onslaught’ of sexual harassment, a tribunal heard. Chukwuma Igbokwe, 46, grabbed Vanessa Turley from behind and thrust himself towards her before exposing himself and asking her to perform a sex act, it was claimed. The former Consul to the UK of the Republic of Niger is accused of bullying and harassing his junior colleague in his role as director of St Luke’s Healthcare group. Mrs Turley, 42, was allegedly subjected to an ‘onslaught of sexual innuendo’ and verbal abuse when she worked with Igbokwe at a private hospital in Ebbw Vale, south Wales, between March 2008 and July 2010. She told the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service how she quit her job and took legal action to stop Igbokwe when she realised she may not be his only victim. 'It was just never ending with him,’ she said giving evidence. 'I thought he’s got to stop this. People came to me and said it was happening to them. 'I thought ""when is this guy going to stop"". 'The only person who had enough evidence to go forward was myself.' Referred to as 'Mrs A' during the current proceedings, she told the panel she felt the police did not take her seriously when she complained, but was vindicated when she won an employment tribunal against her former bosses last year. She said: 'It was never about the money. It was about proving to people what he was like as a person and what he put me through.' She added: 'I was trying to stop him doing it to other females because in my eyes he had no respect at all no matter what your position in the company. It was a conquest.' Igbokwe was not present or represented at a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester where he could be struck off the medical register if the string of misconduct allegations against him are proved. Igbokwe, the former Consul to the UK of the Republic of Niger, allegedly exposed himself to his colleague . One of the charges relates to a 'Mayor’s ball' held in his honour in his role as Niger’s Consul to the UK in November 2009 when he made a sexual innuendo towards her. After the incident he then quizzed her in the tea room at St Luke’s about why she had told people what he had said, the hearing was told. On another occasion, on April 9, 2010, Igbokwe is said to have called her into his office and held her hips from behind. He then thrust himself against her, told her to sit down, exposed his privates and gestured to her to perform a sex act. Vanessa Turley, 42, was allegedly subjected to an 'onslaught of sexual innuendo' and verbal abuse when she worked with Igbokwe . 'He touched me on a previous occasion, but the actual grabbing was the same time when he exposed himself and actually grabbed me from behind,' said Mrs Turley. She said he was aggressive and rude to her, asking her to bring him dinner or make his tea. But it was in June 2008 that he is alleged to have called her into his office and said: 'Because I want to f*** you over my desk.' Mrs Turley told the panel: 'I'm from a deprived working area and I was devastated. 'Most nights coming home and on Sundays not wanting to face the next day. 'The harassment started back up again because he was thinking I was going to say something and made my life and working environment unbearable to try to make me finish on my own. 'But when I didn’t report it he started up an onslaught of sexual innuendo and text messages again because he got away with it the first time.' The panel heard Igbokwe would 'make eyes' at her when they were working in the same room and ask her to meet at local hotels. Even when she had left her job and was pursuing legal action against Igbokwe she claims the harassment didn’t stop. She received pornographic emails, which were sometimes opened by her husband and children, and was told by friends they had seen a suspicious silver Mercedes following her. 'It was just unreal, my life. I’m trying to start to get it back together, but it’s still there. I just want to shut the book on it,' she said. 'I feel I have moved on a lot, but to talk about it, when I go into any detail and depth I get upset because I think was there anything that I did,' she added. 'I am a lot stronger person now for what I have done.' The hearing continues.","Dr Chukwuma Igbokwe accused of bullying and harassing junior colleague .

According to eMarketer, an internet market research company, only 889.3 million of the one billion users are real people. Quartz reports that Facebook claims it currently has 1.11 billion users but says that it will not actually reach this number of human users until 2014. Currently the biggest growth in Facebook use is in India, Brazil, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Each of these regions is expected to see a 30 per cent increase in Facebook members this year. In contrast, the U.S., UK and Western Europe are seeing a much slower growth in Facebook membership. Facebook's investors are concerned teenagers are starting to lose interest in the site. They worry people are developing 'Facebook fatigue' so are moving to sites such as Twitter instead. The Financial Times reports that investors fear young people no longer think Facebook is 'cool' and that they are deserting it as their parents join the site. The concerns are based on figures which show that 40 per cent of young Facebook users in the U.S. say that they expect to use the site less this year than they have in the past. It is believed that the biggest challenge facing the social media site is gaining a foothold in the mobile market. However, currently half of the population of the U.S. and the UK actively use Facebook but many of the users are less active than they were in the past. In Western Europe as a whole only 37 . per cent of people actively use the social networking site because . people in France, Italy and Germany are less enthusiastic. eMarketer also predicts that Facebook use will grow from 42.6 per cent of internet users now to 54.7 per cent in 2017. While . 46.6 per cent of people in North America and more than 30 per cent of . people in Latin America and Western Europe will use Facebook at least . once a month this year, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific will . have much lower penetration rates, which brings down the worldwide . percentage of the population using Facebook to 15.4 per cent. eMarketer estimates that 63 per cent of social network users worldwide will access Facebook at least once a month in 2013. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's dog, Beast, has its own page on the site - with 1.5m followers . In recent years, it has been common for users in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Russia to use local social networking sites as opposed to Facebook, which gives the site room for growth. By 2017, Facebook users will account for 69.5 per cent of social network users worldwide. Facebook is about to celebrate the end of its first year as a public company but there are concerns among investors that teenagers are losing interest in it. Facebook now has one billion users but ten per cent of them are not human - only 889.3 million of the one billion users are real people . Some investors are worried that young people are developing ‘Facebook fatigue’ which is causing them to move to other social networking sites such as Twitter. The Financial Times reports that investors believe teenagers no longer see Facebook as ‘cool’ and that the arrival of their parents on the site is causing them to defect.","Facebook currently has more than one billion 'monthly active users'

"By . Snejana Farberov . Bogus: Alberto Nunez, 32, has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and unlawful possession of hypodermic needles . A Chicago man has been charged with illegally practicing dentistry for at least two years, during which time he did everything from teeth cleaning to root canals and surgeries, according to police. Alberto Nunez, 32, was hit with a slew of charges on Friday, including felony practicing dentistry without a license and unlawful possession of hypodermic syringes, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said. ‘This wasn't something where the person was cleaning teeth out of his garage,’ Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told NBC5, adding that Nunez’s makeshift dental office had all the necessary equipment. Although the 32-year-old did not have a dentistry license, police said it did not stop him from setting up a busy practice at a home in Melrose Park serving about 30 patients a week. Police received a tip about Nunez and tried to set up a sting operation, but the pseudo-dentist was so swamped with clientele that an undercover officer had to wait for a week to get an appointment. Once inside, Fox News reported that the officer found a dental chair, syringes, an X-ray machine and other tools of the trade, according to authorities. Fully loaded: Nunez's dental office was equipped with a dental chair and X-ray machine . Impressive haul: Police found syringes, plates, lights and other dental tools inside the fake office . ‘The fire department was just blown away because there wasn't a major fire there because there were so many wires that were running everywhere, in and out of garages and under sidewalks that clearly were done by probably someone with fifth-grade electrician background,’ said Dart. Police stopped a patient who had just left the office and were told that Nunez had performed a root canal on him. Nunez is not registered with the State of Illinois. He told police that he attended dental school in Mexico City, but could not provide documentation proving it, police said. Elaborate setup: The 32-year-old 'dentist' had all the paraphernalia needed to perform anything from a teeth cleaning to a root canal . Busy practice: Nunez would see as many as 30 patients a week at his office located inside a private home in the suburb of Melrose Park . According to Dart, Nunez had seen hundreds of patients over the course of two years, performing bite impressions, teeth cleaning and surgical procedures. Before opening the Melrose Place office, he had reportedly worked out of another location. Investigators told CBS2 they suspect that Nunez’s practice catered toward undocumented immigrants and may have been a cash operation. It remains unknown whether his patients knew their ‘doctor’ was unlicensed. Nunez was issued a $10,000 bond. He is expected back in court on September 6.","Alberto Nunez 'practiced dentistry without a license for two years'

"By . Wil Longbottom . Updated: . 12:46 EST, 20 September 2011 . This Great Dane is a real canine super star after officially being recognised as the world's tallest female dog - standing 5ft 11in on her hind legs. Weighing more than 11 stone 'Super' Nova, who lives with owner Ann Suplee in Addison, Illinois, was only recently given the title by the Guinness Book of Records. Taking her place in the record books after the previous record holder died, Nova still sleeps in Mrs Suplee's queen-sized bed like a young puppy. Keep your paws off! Nova, with owner Ann Suplee, became a world record breaker after the previous holder died . Four inches taller than her father and eight inches taller than her mother, Nova eats up to 30lbs of food a week. Mrs Suplee said: 'It took a lot of paperwork and a lot of footwork to secure the record, but it was all totally worth it and great fun. 'I wanted to get Nova this recognition, because she's such a good dog and she deserves it. 'Now when people comment on her height, I get to reply, ""Yes, you're right, she's the world's tallest female dog!' Stop hounding me: Nova, who weighs more than 11 stone, climbs into the back of her owner's car in Addison, Illinois . Why the long face? Nova perches on the edge of the breakfast bar at home. The giant mutt eats her way through 30lbs of food a week . Inspired to go for the record after the number of comments the dog received in the park from fellow pet owners, she said she was proud of her prized pooch. 'I call her Super-Nova and I even dressed her up in a Superman cape during the last pet parade in Addison. 'Nova knows her own size, but with a simple ""excuse me"" she will move out of the way, and is very careful around my three-year-old grandson who's now at eye-level with her tail.' Mrs Suplee feeds her dog watermelon as a treat. The gentle giant often gets scared by smaller dogs barking at her in fright. 'We don't know whether it was the good food we fed Nova when she was a puppy, or some throwback genes, but I think it's all the love and affection we've given her through the years that made her so big.' Give us a piggyback: Ann goes for a walk with Nova, who has been officially recognised as the world's tallest female dog at 5ft 11in on her hind legs .",'Super' Nova munches on 30lb of food a week .
"By . Joel Christie . They've been banned at some middle schools, with officials deeming them unsuitable and 'distracting' to boys. But a new sales report has determined that leggings have started outselling denim jeans - possibly for the first time ever - among American teenagers, as both fashion and comfort herald them 'the new pant'. Leggings and yoga pants were ranked the most popular trend among female teens this spring, according to a semi-annual study released this week by financial services firm Piper Jaffray. And those figures are not exclusive to you girls, with Nike ranked as the No. 1 brand among teen boys, The Huffington Post reported. The new jean: Young American girls especially are increasingly wearing leggings or tights in lieu of actual pants. Now a new sales report has shown leggings and sweat pants are the biggest-selling pant at the moment . Leggings and yoga pants were ranked the most popular trend among female teens this spring, according to a study released this week by financial services firm Piper Jaffray. Nike was the No. 1 brand among teen boys. Popular: There has been much debate, especially among school staff and parents, whether leggings qualify as proper pants. Traditionally they were considered undergarments . The tried and tested staple of denim jeans were nowhere to be found on the list, after years of consistently ranking as a top 10 trend. Teens now prefer 'Athleisure', with workout wear no longer confined to the gym but considered fashionable for everyday use. Designers have labeled the look 'sports luxe', and it has trickled from international runways into trends spreading across all ages. According to Piper Jaffray, winning the sales war at the moment is Lululemon, a brand centered around yoga clothes. Losing the battle are big teen retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, as well as Levi's and Wrangler. Lululemon athletica has pioneered yoga clothing in the U.S. and Canada. Their sweat pants are now rated as best-sellers . Nike is now the No. 1 brand when it comes to American boys, as fashion continues to lead toward workout wear. Denim staples like Abercrombie & Fitch (pictured) and American Eagle are trailing behind . Losing the jean battle: The big teen retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, along with the old guard of jean-makers like Levi's and Wrangler. The report could be signalling a step away from the style of low-cut jeans, which have been popular for years. Lululemon helped pioneer yoga pants as leisure wear and quickly rose to the forefront of the stretchy pants movement, as yoga became more mainstream. Its success attracted the eyes of both mass-market retailers and athletic clothing companies. Chief executive Laurent Potdevin even admitted last week that his chain is 'not the only game in town anymore'. Gap entered the fray by acquiring activewear seller Athleta in 2008, and it is now exanding aross the country, opening stores alongside Lululemon's. Designers have come to call the high-end athletic look 'sport luxe', as in mixing gym-style clothing with everyday gear. Picutred here in Thor: The Dark World actress Jaime Alexander . Nike, Under Armour and Adidas refused to be left behind, touting their own lines of pliable pants and tank tops that can be worn throughout the day and at the yoga studio. Piper Jaffray also found that teens are now spending more money on food than clothes. Earlier this month Haven Middle School in Evanston, Illinois, barred girls from wearing leggings or yoga pants to school. The school said the clothes are considered undergarments, not proper school wear, and that leggings in particular had become 'distracting' to boys.","Spring 2014 report shows leggings and yoga pants are more popular than denim jeans among American teens .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Sony has delivered another nail in the PC coffin by announcing plans to stop making its personal computers to focus on cameras, smartphones and games consoles. Amid what it described as ‘drastic’ changes in the industry, the Japanese firm has decided to ditch the loss-making side of the business, after more than 30 years, as part of a shake-up which will see 5,000 people lose their jobs. Sony also said it will be putting extra focus into is TV section to bring back profit by concentrating on sales of high-end models. Sony is to stop making PCs and laptops after more than 30 years to focus on cameras, smartphones and games consoles. The plans will see the loss of 5,000 jobs worldwide. The tech giant also announced it was selling its Vaio brand of notebooks, pictured, to to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) The news about the closure of its PC division comes as Sony predicted it will make a loss of 110 billion yen (£665million) for the current financial year.

More recently it has developed a range of slimline ‘notebook’ Vaio devices. Sony said neither its TV nor PC businesses are expected to make a profit in the current financial year, and aims to sell Vaio to Japan Industrial Partners (JIP) by the end of next month. Sony has been challenged by stiff competition from Samsung and Apple, and plans to use its now three core businesses to drive growth in electronics, which include cameras, the Playstation, and Xperia smartphones.

Jenkins-Sellers had no idea how her son would react and jokingly told reporters at KSAT 12 that she was worried her son would be mad at her if he cried because he is 'in front of friends and girls his age.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police in a Maryland suburb made a grisly discovery Friday morning when they responded to what authorities described as a 'very horrific and bloody crime scene' inside a home where they found the bodies of two young children. Two other children were also found seriously injured inside the home, as well as a 21-year-old woman who police described as having superficial injuries. Authorities say that the mother of the children - identified only as a 28-year-old woman - currently is in custody after trying to run from the home after authorities arrived. Scroll down for video . Grisly: Police described the scene inside this Maryland townhouse as 'very horrific and bloody' Bloody: Authorities suspect that this knife found outside of the home could be the murder weapon . None of the children have been identified - authorities will only say that they are siblings and all are under 10 years old. Authorities first were called the Germantown home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive about 9:30 p.m. Thursday when a neighbor called 9-1-1 to report that a child was left alone in the backseat of a car. Before police arrived, two women came outside and retrived the child from the car - and confronted the neighbor who called 9-1-1. The responding officers knocked on the door of the home but got no response, nor did they see or hear anything they deemed suspicious. The officers then left the home and called Child Protective Services, which planned to follow up on the family Friday morning. Before CPS could visit the home, authorities were again called about 9:30 a.m. Friday in reference to blood found in the driveway where the child had been left the day before. The night before the bodies were discovered, police were called to the home after one of the children was left in this blue car . When police arrived on the scene, they found a knife on the sidewalk leading into the home. Officers then had to force their way into the home, where they found the victims and a 'very bloody' crime scene. The children were each found in bedrooms, and may have been asleep at the time of the attack. When police entered the home, a woman - presumably the mother of the four children - tried to flee out a back door. 'She was running, and we caught her,' police spokesman Jim Daly told the Washington Post. After authorities discovered the grisly crime scene, neighbors told authorities that they heard loud noises coming from the home the previous evening, but did not call police. The injured children were taken to Children's Hospital in northwest Washington, where they are being treated for their injuries.","Police were called to the house the night before the bodies were discovered .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As Chris Christie leaves his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flies to Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican, a New Jersey mayor has made more damning accusations against the Governor. Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer has claimed Hurricane Sandy relief aid was withheld from her city in an attempt to push through a redevelopment backed by the New Jersey Governor. Ms Zimmer alleged that two of Christie's aides - Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and community affairs commissioner Richard Constable - leaned on her to gain support for a lucrative deal. Cut off: Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer claims Sandy relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal . Tough week: Governor Christie gives the state address on January 14, as his administration is hit by accusations over 'bridge-gate' 'The bottom line is, it’s not fair for . the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because . he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC. Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of the Hoboken community in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'. But when Ms Zimmer requested $127 million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC  reported. In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Ms Zimmer wrote: 'Please . governor, we need . your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be . treated fairly.' No response has been received from the letter, which was dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for Rockefeller. According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Ms Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans. The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Ms Zimmer was elected as mayor. Wrecked: Huge parts of Hoboken were flooded when Sandy hit in October 2012 . Aid: A Hoboken shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 . The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies. Ms Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place. But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Ms Zimmer claims. According to a diary entry from the mayor, Lieutenant Governor Guadagno pulled her aside during an event in Hoboken on May 13, last year. The diary entry read: 'She pulls me aside with . no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the . Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. ' ""The word is . that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going . to be able to help you. I know it’s not right – these things should not . be connected – but they are"", she says, and ""if you tell anyone, I will . deny it"".' Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Ms Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].' Ms Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to . you.' Claims: Chris Christie with Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable, who allegedly leaned on Dawn Zimmer to support a project in return for more Sandy aid . 'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her . Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations. A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer’s . allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned . Hoboken’s receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development . project is categorically false.' The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor’s Office and the assistance we’ve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.' 'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone’s guess.' A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We . have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If . it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.' Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action. Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.","Hoboken Mayor awarded only $320,000 of the $127m she requested in hurricane relief funds .

"By . Suzannah Hills . A 1965 Aston Martin DB5 built for the James Bond film franchise was today put up for sale for a staggering £3million. The British sports car firm only made four DB5s for the 007 movies Goldfinger and Thunderball which starred Sean Connery as the super-suave spy. And this classic model is one of only two of the four originals to be fully kitted out with all of Q Branch's famous gadgets including imitation machine guns, revolving number plates and even the tyre-slicing device. Scroll down to watch video . Piece of film history: One of only four 1965 Aston Martin DB5s to be built for 007 films Goldfinger and Thunderball has been put on the market for £3m . Kitted out: It is also one of only two DB5s to be equipped with Q Branch's famous gadgets at the time it was built - including a tyre-slicer first seen in the 1964 film Goldfinger . First appearance: The Aston Martin DB5 first appeared in the Bond franchise in the 1964 film Goldfinger starring Sean Connery, pictured next to the classic car, as the famous spy . The DB5 is in pristine condition because it never featured in the films but was instead used for promotion ahead of the release of Thunderball. Surrey-based Aston Martin specialists RS Williams have now put the DB5 on the market for £3million - describing it as 'the most famous car in the world'. This makes it one of the most expensive movie cars of all time and almost ten-times the price of a standard DB5. Under the bonnet of the DB5 is a 4-litre engine which develops around 280bhp - giving the British sports car a top speed of 150mph. Now you see it: The DB5 also boasts revolving number plates - which can change to Swiss, French and English - that were often used to trick 007's adversaries in Bond films . Now you don't: The revolving number plate can show different codes or nothing at all . Undercover car: The extra gadgets - including the revolving licence plates - means the £3 million price tag costs ten times more than the average DB5 . Back to the best: Models replicating the original DB5 cars were made to bring the Aston Martin DB5 back for Skyfall starring Daniel Craig . The main car used in Goldfinger and Thunderball (above) films mysteriously vanishing from a Florida aircraft hangar in the 1990s - making this model the only remaining DB5 that with original gadgets . But next to the impressive 1960s sports car performance and beautiful design, it is the car's gadgets and history which have upped its value. The car boasts revolving number plates, two imitation machine guns, a bulletproof screen to cover the rear window and a radar device built into the dashboard. Its front and rear bumpers also extend and there is a fitted smoke device to fend off villains. Many of the gadgets are operated at the flick of a switch via the arm console which opens up to reveal a control panel. The DB5 was the first ever Aston Martin to feature in a Bond film - 1964's Goldfinger - and was the start of the iconic partnership that spanned 11 Bond films and 50 years of cinema history. Lethal weapon: A gadget hidden underneath a rear light releases oil and smoke to make roads slippery and blur the vision of any drivers behind . Retro: A radar navigation screen is shown in front of the car's gear shift which has a passenger ejector button . Control panel: Switches for rams, guns, screen and oil slick are located next to the driver's seat .

"By . Ryan Gorman . California’s drought problem has brought water levels in . one lake low enough to search for the remains of plane wreck from almost 50 . years ago. Frank Wilcox’s brother Gene Amick was 15-years-old when his . plane plunged into Folsom Lake on New Year’s Day 1965, he was one of four . people who died. A renowned husband and wife sonar team has been brought in to . try to find the remains. ‘I will get him out of there,’ an emotional Mr Wilcox told KTXL while standing on cracked, dry mud that not long ago was underwater. Scroll down for video . Parched: A visitor to Folsom Lake walks his dog down a boat ramp that is now several hundred yards away from the waters' edge . The plane disappeared into the murky lake after a mid-air . collision with another plane, according to KTXL. The plane came to rest more . than 100 feet below the surface. Navy divers originally called in to search for Mr Amick and . his fellow passengers were called off after strong storms swept across the lake . – they never returned. The recent significant drop in the lake, about 25 miles . northeast of Sacramento, has led to hopes the wreckage can now be found. ‘I've never seen such an outpouring of help and these folks . here, this is what they do,’ Mr Wilcox told News 10. ‘I think something . good will come of this.’ Drying out: Folsom Lake, as seen from above, is at only 18 per cent of capacity . Holding out hope: Frank Wilcox is hopeful the receding water will allow searchers to find his brother after almost 50 years . The expert: Gene Ralston and wife Sandy have pulled 80 bodies from various bodies of water with their sonar, including one last week from a nearby delta . Many witnesses, including corrections officers and inmates at . the infamous Folsom Prison, saw the plane go down. Their accounts led officials . to believe the wreckage is in El Dorado County. Three counties intersect the middle of the lake. An El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office detective has joined the . search and been on-board the sonar vessel hoping to find the remains. ‘We would like to recover the three individuals and give . their family the opportunity to lay them to rest properly,’ Detective .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Southwest Airlines pilots who recently landed at the wrong airport in Missouri have told investigators they were confused by the small airport's runway lights, believing it to be a larger airport in nearby Branson, the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday. The pilots of Southwest Flight 4013 from Chicago's Midway Airport said in interviews with investigators that they had programmed the Boeing 737 flight management system for the Branson airport, NTSB said. But as they were approaching to land at night last Sunday, they first saw the airport beacon and bright runway lights of Graham Clark Downtown Airport, located in Hollister, Missouri, and mistakenly identified it as the Branson airport, which is 7 miles away. Investigation: A Crew inspects Southwest Airlines Flight 4013  at tiny M. Graham Clark Airport in Hollister, Missouri on Monday, where pilots accidentally landed while en route to Branson Sunday evening . Uncommon around these parts: A small crowd gathers at the M. Graham Clark Airport in Hollister, Missouri Monday to see Southwest Airlines jet that landed there by mistake. The pilots who mistakenly landed the jet there Sunday were grounded Monday pending an investigation . Whoops: Pictured is the flight path of Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 on Sunday. The flight, carrying 124 passengers and five crew members, was scheduled to go from Chicago's Midway International Airport to Branson Airport but somehow veered 9 miles off course . Grounded: This Sunday photo provided by passenger Scott Schieffer shows the cockpit and presumably the pilots who've now been grounded after the bizarre incident . The captain had not previously landed . in Branson, and the first officer had previously landed there once, and . that was during the daytime, NTSB said in an update on the incident. They didn't realize until the plane touched down that they were at the . wrong airport, the NTSB said. During . the landing approach, the pilots contacted the Branson control tower. They were told by controllers they were 15 miles from their target. But . the pilots responded that they had the airfield in sight. Controllers . then cleared the plane for a visual approach to land on Branson runway . 14. That means the pilots were relying on what they could see rather . than automation to orient the plane. Instead, . the midsized airliner with 124 passengers on board landed on the . Downtown Airport runway, which is half as long as the Branson runway. The runways are oriented in a similar direction. Passengers later . described the plane coming to an extremely hard stop just short of a . ravine at the end of the runway, and the smell of burnt rubber. NTSB said the pilots 'confirmed that they utilized heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop.' Besides . the pilots, NTSB said investigators also interviewed a Southwest . dispatcher, who was on the flight, riding in the jump seat, and listened . to the cockpit voice recorder. Investigators have also begun to analyze . the plane's flight data recorder, which contains about 27 hours of . recorded data from the jet's computer systems. Welcome to Branson? Confused passengers were first told by a crew member they'd landed at the correct destination. A pilot then spoke on the intercom: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to tell you we landed at the wrong airport . Wrong runway:  Flight 4013 from Chicago landed at Taney County Airport instead of Branson Airport. The Boeing 737-700 carried 124 passengers and a crew of five . Here, passengers line up Sunday to board a new flight after being taken to a small Missouri town by mistake . Delay: After a five hour delay, passengers were bussed to the correct airport and re-boarded the plane to continue their journey . The . captain has been with Southwest since 1999 and has about 16,000 flight . hours, including about 6,700 hours as a captain on the 737. The first . officer has been with Southwest since 2001 and has about 25,000 flight . hours. Instances of . commercial jets landing at the wrong airport are unusual, but not . unheard of, according to pilots and aviation safety experts. Usually the . pilots are flying a visual approach in clear weather. The . instances also typically involve low-traffic airports situated close . together with runways aligned to the same or similar compass points. We've arrived: The Southwest Airlines jet landed at an airport nine miles away from where it should have been . The incident in Missouri is the second time in two months that a large jet has landed at the wrong airport. In . November, a freight-carrying Boeing 747 that was supposed to deliver . parts to McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kan., landed nine miles . north at Col. James Jabara Airport. The company that operated the flight . later said in a training video that the crew was skeptical about the . plane's automation after the co-pilot's flight display had intermittent . trouble, and the pilot chose to fly visually when he spotted the . brightly lit runway at Jabara. Last . year, a cargo plane bound for MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Fla., . landed without incident at the small Peter O. Knight Airport nearby. An . investigation blamed confusion identifying airports in the area, and . base officials introduced an updated landing procedure. Where they landed: The jet landed at Taney Airport. The runway is half the length of the one at Branson airport . So near, yet so far: Branson Airport (pictured) is where the plane was supposed to have landed . The M. Graham Clark Airport started as a dirt runway in the late 1960s. The longest of the two asphalt runways there is 3,738 feet.. At the commercial Branson airport, the concrete runway is more than 7,000 feet in length. In December, Southwest Airlines announced it will cease operations at the Branson Airport in June after serving the airport for about 15 months.","The NTSB releases new information on last Sunday's wrong airport landing in Missouri .

"By . Sara Malm . When you spend your days running up and down trees and hunting for nuts, it is important that you get your stretches done properly. This squirrel appears to have taken the advice to heart as it was caught 'doing yoga' in a park in Lyon, France. The ginger climber can be seen stretching high towards the sky - and even practicing some 'anti-gravity yoga' from a tree trunk. Going nuts: The adorable squirrel stretches out on a tree trunk during a snack break in Lyon, France . Reaching for the stars: The energetic little rodent made sure he got his sun salutation right . Stretch and pull: The squirrel has come up with his own version of anti-gravity yoga, preferring to dig his claws into a tree rather than hang from the ceiling in a hammock . Photographer Thanh Ha Bui, who captured the image in his home city of Lyon, France, said: ‘It's uncommon.’ The . red squirrel also demonstrated its acrobatic skills leaping between . trees, and attempted to grab a woman's handbag as she walked through the . park. But it later came over all shy, burying its head in its hands and tucking it towards its chest as it sat on a tree branch. Thanh said locals often visit Parc de la Tete d'Or to feed the squirrels. Yoga-t to be kidding me: You might think this is just the squirrel curling up into a ball - but as a matter for fact, he is prepping for his cat pose .

He added: ‘For many years I have developed a passion about squirrels, especially the red squirrel of Europe. ‘Fortunately, I have had the chance and the opportunity to observe them not very far from my place. ‘I . am not the only one to know about this special place. There are quite a . few people who come regularly to bring them some food. ‘Everytime I go there I ask these people what they know about squirrels and I get to hear many interesting stories and legends. ‘I learned about their morphology, behaviors and movement patterns. ‘I became completely fascinated with the squirrels.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Dr Sureshkumar Pandya undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman's labia - but was accused of female genital mutilation after it went terribly wrong . A doctor whose ‘designer vagina’ operation went so wrong that he was accused of female genital mutilation has been cleared. Dr Sureshkumar Pandya undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman’s labia because ‘it was ugly’, but the 33-year-old was left ‘distraught’ by the results, the Manchester tribunal heard. The GP, who is surgically trained, mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips, but did not cause damage to the clitoris, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found. The General Medical Council had alleged the anatomical result was ‘equivalent to female genital mutilation'. The fitness to practise panel found the anatomical result of the procedure could be said ‘to be equivalent to FGM’, but cleared Dr Pandya of the charge as he did not intend to perform the operation on the woman, known only as Patient A. Chair Dr Anthony Morgan said: ‘The panel has not been provided with any evidence during the course of these proceedings to suggest that you set out to remove all or virtually all of Patient A’s labia minora. ‘It has not been provided with any cultural or surgical reasons as to why you would do this. ‘In your evidence you stated that you were totally against the practice of FGM and would not have any reason to carry it out. ‘In the light of your character and the testimony you gave the panel accepts this.’ Dr Pandya admitted performing labiaplasty on the Muslim woman at London’s Regency Clinic on March 8, 2012. He told the panel that she was unhappy with the appearance and was suffering discomfort and pain from sitting down and wearing tight clothes. ‘There was nothing unusual about this procedure, there was nothing unusual about this patient and there was nothing unusual about this operation,’ he said giving evidence. Asked if he had intended to perform Female Genital Mutilation, he replied: ‘I am very much against it. ‘I have never done it and I don’t think I would ever do it and I didn’t intend to perform it on this patient.’ He . added: ‘Every time when a medical intervention is done by a doctor with . all due care, vigilance and manual dexterity, one may still come across . these events where the outcome of a procedure is something not expected . and contrary and I don’t think any doctor enjoys it. Dr Pandya mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips, but did not cause damage to the woman's clitoris, the tribunal heard . The doctor denied he had removed all of the inner labia, but the panel found against him, determining that it amounted to a ‘serious clinical failure’. Dr Morgan said: ‘Your evidence was that the complete excision of the labia minora did not happen in the course of the operation. ‘On this point it preferred the evidence of the clinicians and the experts. ‘As a result, the conclusion the panel has reached is that the procedure did in fact result in the almost complete excision of the labia minora. ‘Therefore, it has found this paragraph proved on the basis advanced by the GMC, namely that what you did amounted to a serious clinical failure.’ After the operation,the woman contacted her GP and later emergency services because she was ‘distressed and unhappy’, self-harming and suffering from suicidal thoughts. The General Medical Council had alleged the anatomical result was 'equivalent to female genital mutilation' (file picture) Dr Pandya was reported to the General Medical Council later that month on the basis that the woman felt ‘violated and butchered’ and had been ‘railroaded into the surgery,’ the hearing was told. Patient A was examined by a number of doctors over the following months, but was referred to a specialist FGM clinic in July last year, after she became pregnant. With regards to the allgation that the operation amounted to femle genital mutilation, Sean Larkin QC, for the GMC, told the panel it should only find the charge proved if the doctor had intended to perform such an operation. Mr Larkin told the . panel the procedure had lessened the woman's sexual sensitivity, adding: 'Was . this mere negligence? No. Did it amount to serious professional . misconduct? Yes.' But Andrew Colman, defending, argued that a . single clinical error along with admitted recording keeping deficiencies . was not enough for the panel to reach a finding of misconduct against . the doctor. 'I would not want anyone to think I am trivialising . the outcome of this surgery,' he said. 'In considering the gravity it is . important to remove it from the emotive context of female genital . mutilation.' Mr Colman told the panel that an arm operation . resulted in the loss of feeling to the hand it would not constitute . misconduct, and said: 'Neither should you view this isolated function as . such.' He added: 'Coming at the end of a long and distinguished . career, these proceedings have been a painful, extended and salutary . ordeal for Dr Pandya and I can tell you he has no desire to return to . gynaecological surgery either at the Regency Clinic or anywhere else.' It was also alleged that the GP was not qualified to carry out the operation because he had only worked as a gynaecologist for six months, 25 years earlier. But he was cleared of the charge after he told the panel he had worked part-time at the private clinic since around 1994 and took a greater role after the owner died in 2011, although he said he was never paid for his services. He could also still face sanctions over the bungled operation and admitted record keeping errors if the panel finds his errors amounted to serious misconduct. Labia reduction or labiaplasty is the most common type of genital surgery carried out in the UK. Although . widely practised, cosmetic genital surgery or ‘designer vagina’ surgery . has been criticised by experts who say it is risky and often . unnecessary. Dr Pandya is currently subject to an interim conditional GMC order, originally imposed in July last year, which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out. The string of conditions keeps him closely monitored by the GMC as well as banning him from carrying out female genital operations. The hearing continues.","Dr Sureshkumar Pandya performed labiaplasty on 33-year-old woman .

"By . Simon Cable . They are two of our most celebrated actors, notably for their Shakespearean roles. But it seems that Dame Judi Dench and Sir Kenneth Branagh haven’t always seen eye-to-eye over the Bard. The 79-year-old actress has teased Sir Kenneth, 53, for refusing to take her advice when she was directing a stage version of Much Ado About Nothing in which he appeared. Kenneth Branagh receives his Shakespeare Guild Gielgud Award from Dame Judy Dench for introducing Shakespeare to a new generation . She also claims that the actor and director stole her ideas for a film version of the play, which he directed five years later and which became a huge box office hit. Dame Judi made her debut as a director in 1988 while working for Branagh’s Renaissance Theatre Company, which was touring Britain. She directed a version of Much Ado About Nothing, which was set in the Napoleonic era and starred Sir Kenneth and Samantha Bond as the lead characters Benedick and Beatrice. However, she recalled: ‘They went to Brighton and I went down to see the show to give them notes if they needed any, which they did, and Ken Branagh left the theatre because he knew I was coming with the notes.’ She added: ‘Ken Branagh, he stole all my ideas for the film.’ The 79-year-old actress has teased Sir Kenneth, 53, for refusing to take her advice in the direction of The Bard's play . The actress, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Elizabeth I in 1998 film Shakespeare In Love, also revealed that she didn’t enjoy the experience of being a director. Speaking at a fundraising event in London for the Acting For Others charity, Dame Judi recalled her time working for the Renaissance Theatre Company, saying: ‘It was a bit lonely. It’s hideous as the actors gang up against you.’ Sir Kenneth’s film version of Much Ado About Nothing was released in 1993 and starred the actor as Benedick with his then wife Emma Thompson as Beatrice alongside Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves and Kate Beckinsale. It went on to earn more than £20million in worldwide box office sales, making it one of the most financially successful Shakespeare films ever released. Sir Kenneth joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at 23 and in 1987 founded The Renaissance Theatre Company. He first found fame in the TV mini-series Fortunes Of War in 1987 before going on to star in Henry V and Frankenstein, which he also directed. He has been nominated for five Oscars and won three Baftas. He was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours in 2012. Dame Judi trained as a set designer before making her professional acting debut in 1957 in Hamlet at the Old Vic. She made numerous appearances on stage before taking over the role of M in the James Bond films in 1995.","Dame Judi claims that Branagh stole her ideas for film version of a play .

June Steenkamp has admitted she cannot take her eyes from her daughter's killer in the courtroom as she spoke of her daily emotional turmoil listening to the final moments of Reeva's life being put under the spotlight in a South African court. The Paralympic superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial. Scroll down for video . June Steenkamp (left) has said she does not care whether Oscar Pistorius is jailed for shooting her daughter Reeva Steenkamp (right) as it will not bring her back . Mrs Steenkamp has said she watches his every move, wondering if his grief is real. In an interview with the Daily Mirror's Lucy Thornton and Sharon Feinstein she said she does not care whether he is freed or jailed for murder, as neither outcome will bring her daughter back. Yesterday Pistorius, 27, became distraught after the prosecutor demanded that he look at a photo of his dead girlfriend's bloody head wounds while giving evidence at his trial in Pretoria. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel said it was time for the athlete to 'take responsibility' for killing Miss Steenkamp, 29, who died after being shot by Pistorius in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year. Mrs Steenkamp told the Mirror: 'I look at Oscar the whole time, to see how he is coping, how he is behaving. I'm obsessed with looking at him, it's just instinctive, I can't explain it.

She added: 'I think he's just about keeping himself together. I don't know whether he's acting. Most of the time he's on his cell phone or looking down at papers or writing notes.' Mrs Steenkamp, who had never previously met Pistorius, told the Mirror she doesn't care if he is cleared or sent to prison as it won't bring back her daughter, but says 'he has to stand up to what he's done and - if he has to - pay for it.' 180512 . 100288 . 94496 . 131425 . 89049 . 75442 . 223080 . 287812 . 113360 . 177006 . 104320 . 126201 . 110249 . 84916 . 109280 . 144986 . 220637 . 62601 . 108345 . 82272 . 99544 . 150680 . 206565 . 105001 . 82478 . 290412 . 72640 . 126758 . 165628 . 85845 . June Steenkamp listens to Oscar Pistorius give evidence during his trial at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday . Mrs Steenkamp previously criticised Pistorius for failing to acknowledge her on the first day of the trial, but said she didn't answer when he eventually spoke to her, other than to nod. Pistorius will face further difficult questions today as his cross-examination continues. The athlete says he shot Miss Steenkamp by mistake, thinking she was a dangerous intruder behind the door in his bathroom about to come out and attack him. Prosecutors say he killed her intentionally, and Pistorius faces a possible prison term of 25 years to life if convicted of premeditated murder. Pistorius was today accused by Mr Nel of egotistical behaviour in his relationship with Miss Steenkamp before he killed her. South African paralympic athlete and murder-accused Oscar Pistorius arrives at the high court in Pretoria prior to a hearing of his trial on Thursday . On the second day of cross-examination Mr Nel also described Pistorius's courtroom apology to his girlfriend's family as an insincere 'spectacle' that ignored the feelings of her relatives. 'Your life is just about you,' the prosecutor said. Mr Nel's questioning in the court in the South African city of Pretoria was designed to counter earlier evidence in which Pistorius said he loved Miss Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, and was trying to protect her when he shot her without realising she was in the toilet. Two contrasting images of the double-amputee runner have emerged in court: the defence-led image of Pistorius as a contrite man who had been worried about crime and made a terrible mistake on the night he killed Miss Steenkamp, and the prosecution's depiction of him as an overbearing egotist who was obsessed with guns. Mr Nel said he had checked all Miss Steenkamp's text messages on her mobile phone and the phrase 'I love you' appeared only twice. On both occasions, he said, they were written by Miss Steenkamp to her mother. 'Never to you and you never to her,' Mr Nel said, addressing Pistorius. Pistorius, pictured arriving at court today, was accused of egotistical behaviour in his relationship with Miss Steenkamp before he killed her . 'I never got the opportunity to tell Reeva that I loved her,' Pistorius said in a soft voice. He did not look at Mr Nel while replying to the prosecutor's questions, instead directing his gaze to Judge Thokozile Masipa. Judge Masipa will deliver a verdict because there is no jury system in South Africa. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder. Mr Nel also accused Pistorius of ignoring the concerns of Miss Steenkamp's family by apologising to them at the beginning of his evidence this week, rather than seeking to express his condolences in private. 'Why would you create a spectacle in court, in the public domain, in the public eye?' Mr Nel said. 'Why did you put them through this?' Pistorius said his lawyers had been in touch with representatives of Miss Steenkamp's family, and that he had believed the family of his girlfriend was not ready to meet him. 'I completely understand where they're coming from,' he said. 'It's not that I haven't thought about them.'","June Steenkamp admits she cannot take eyes from Pistorius in courtroom .

"By . Rob Davies . and Jason Groves . Anger: David Cameron said the allegations against British oil companies of price-fixing are 'hugely concerning' Oil traders at Shell and BP should face prison if it is proved they conspired to fix prices, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister made no attempt to disguise his anger as both of Britain’s oil giants were named among several firms accused of fixing prices for more than a decade. He said the allegations were ‘hugely concerning’ and that anyone held responsible would face ‘major consequences’ if the claims were proved true. In a statement to Parliament, Ed Davey, Secretary of State for energy, said firms found guilty of price-fixing would ‘feel the full force of the law’ and could face ‘heavy fines’. He told MPs: ‘If it turns out to be the case that hard-pressed consumers have been hit in the pocket by manipulation of the markets, the full force of the law should be down upon them.’ Experts suggested that price-fixing could have cost every UK household £2,000 by driving up prices at petrol pumps. Law firm Stevens & Bolton based its figure on data for household budgets stretching back to 2002, when the price-fixing is alleged to have begun. In January 2002, motorists paid an average of 75.3p per litre, compared to 133.35p per litre so far this month. 'Consequences': Energy secretary Ed Davey said if oil giants, including Shell and BP, are found to have fixed prices they should feel 'the full force of the law' Accused: Experts believed artificial inflation of petrol prices may have cost UK households an average of £2,000 . Gustaf Duhs, head of competition law . at the firm, said it was ‘reasonable’ to assume that cartels push up . prices by 20 per cent. He . also predicted that oil firms found guilty of collusion to fix prices . could face huge legal bills. ‘It wouldn’t be unrealistic to say that . there could be hundreds of millions on the line,’ said Mr Duhs. Speaking . in New York, Mr Cameron said: ‘There is obviously the full force of the . law available... so let’s let the investigators do their work. If this . has been happening it is very, very serious and major consequences will . follow.’ Mr Cameron initially said suspects could be prosecuted under a new offence brought in this year after the Libor interest rate scandal, which carries a maximum seven-year jail term. But Downing Street later issued an embarrassing clarification that the offence does not cover the oil industry and cannot be imposed retrospectively. Mr Cameron said he would reserve judgment on the role of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), which has been accused of being asleep at the wheel. ‘The OFT is involved in this investigation but we have to get to the bottom of what happened first before I think we can pass judgment on the way regulators have worked in the UK,’ he said. But Conservative MP Robert Halfon, a long-time campaigner against high fuel prices, lambasted the OFT over its inquiry this year into oil markets. It concluded that ‘competition is working well’ and said fuel price rises were due to ‘increases in tax and the cost of crude oil’. ‘What really happened was the OFT carried out a limp-wristed, lettuce-like inquiry when they should have done a full 18-month inquiry into what has been going on,’ said Mr Halfon. He called for windfall taxes on companies proved to have been involved in price-fixing, to help pay for a cut in fuel duty.","Oil giants Shell and BP accused of fixing prices for more than a decade .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A teacher has been struck off after uploading 'naked pictures' of celebrities on to a primary school computer by mistake. Robert Adams, 52, 'accidentally' copied the images from his personal memory stick on to the main computer system at Deighton Primary School in Tredegar, South Wales. They included 'full-frontal' pictures of celebrities, such as singer Miley Cyrus and actress Scarlett Johansson, a disciplinary hearing heard. Struck off: Robert Adams, 52, has been banned from teaching for five years after uploading 'naked pictures' of celebrities on to the main computer system at Deighton Primary School (pictured) in Tredegar, South Wales . They were among 80 pornographic images of women - and one child abuse image of a girl aged around 15 - uncovered by police. Adams, a former IT co-ordinator, has now been banned from teaching for five years after being found guilty of unacceptable professional misconduct by the General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW). He will be eligible to reapply to join the teaching register in 2019 - but it is not guaranteed he will be accepted. The pornographic images were discovered after a nursery teacher at the school in Blaenau Gwent logged on to her class computer and came across a folder called 'Glam'. Famous faces: The pictures included 'full-frontal' images of celebrities, such as singer Miley Cyrus (right) and actress Scarlett Johansson (left), a General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) disciplinary hearing heard . She clicked on the folder to uncover an array of images of 'women with no clothes on', the hearing in Cardiff heard. Officers later investigated the folder and discovered several nude photos of female celebrities, including French star Carla Bruni, singer Alicia Keys and actresses Helen Mirren and Isla Fisher. Adams, former IT co-ordinator at the school, had found the images online on his home computer, before saving them on his memory stick, the hearing heard. He claimed he had then accidentally copied them on to the school's computer while trying to download important files from the system during maintenance work. Mistake: Adams, former IT co-ordinator at the school, claimed he had accidentally copied the photos from his personal memory stick on to the school's main computer system (file picture) Nursery teacher, Jayne Edwards, told the hearing she had been looking for classwork when she spotted the 'Glam' folder. 'I could see many thumbnail images in the folder and when I clicked on the first image I saw an adult female with no clothes on,' she said. 'In the next image I clicked on there were three females with no clothes on. 'Obviously I was shocked at what I had seen and went running around the school to find someone.' The hearing was told every classroom in . the school had a computer which both teachers and pupils could access through . personal accounts with passwords. Following the discovery in October 2009, Adams immediately handed his memory stick in to police and was suspended from the school with full pay. Former headteacher, Roger Fawke, said the teacher had seemed 'quite concerned' that there was indecent material on the computer that children could access. 'He is one of the best teachers I have ever come across and was a valued member of staff that I could trust to do the best for pupils,' he said. Detetctive Constable Blair Jones carried out a forensic investigation Adams's memory stick, laptop and school computers. He told the hearing the teacher had uploaded the 'Glam' folder on to the school system just before he took his class to a harvest festival at the local church. He said evidence also showed Adams had accessed a similar pornographic file on his laptop later that night - and had deleted all files from his memory stick. DC Jones said: 'When he handed in the memory stick to police the next day there appeared to be nothing on it - but forensic tools allowed us to see all the deleted files.' He added: 'Mr Adams is the only person who truly knows how the ""Glam"" folder appeared on the school server.' Celebrities: Adams's 'Glam' folder also included photos of Carla Bruni (right) and actress Helen Mirren (left) As well as the pornographic images of women, police discovered a video of the young girl - who appeared to be under 16 and partially clothed - in the recycle bin of Adams's laptop. Steve Powell, chairing the GTCW panel, said the incident was a 'particularly serious' one of 'unacceptable professional conduct'. 'The child abuse image found is fundamentally incompatible with Mr Adams continuing to be a registered teacher,' he added. Adams was investigated by police, but was not prosecuted.","Robert Adams uploaded 'naked photos' on computer at South Wales school .

"By . Emma Glanfield . This dramatic picture shows the moment a reckless roller skater put his life and others at risk as he clung onto a speeding car as it reached speeds of 70mph in a Jackass-style stunt. Dale Powles, 25, was wearing no crash helmet or protective equipment when he clung onto the window of the car as it hurtled along the A16 Peaks Parkway in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. He was arrested after shocked police discovered a video of the dangerous stunt had been posted on Facebook. Dale Powles, 25, was wearing no crash helmet or protective equipment when he clung onto the window of the car as it hurtled along the A16 Peaks Parkway in Grimsby, Lincolnshire . Grimsby Magistrates’ Court heard how pictures and video footage found on Facebook showed Powles being pulled along one of the town’s busiest road, while he was next to the driver’s open window reaching through. The driver was holding onto Powles and the stunt was filmed by a passenger as they drove at speeds of around 70 mph, last summer. It was believed that Powles was on roller skates, although these could not be seen on the video. Powles, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, admitted aiding and abetting William Wraith to drive dangerously. Rebecca Perrin, mitigating, said it was a ‘silly and foolish’ offence and Powles could not explain it. He was not working at the time, ‘had a lot of time to himself’ and was ‘mixing with people he should not have been’. The car reached speeds of around 70mph as Powles clung onto the vehicle in what has been described in court as a 'silly and pathetic' offence . ‘It is not something he is proud of,’ said Miss Perrin. ‘But he was a very different person back then from what he is now.’ The route is governed by a split speed limit of 30mph at the town end, increasing to 50mph after the Weelsby Road junction, and then to 60mph. A consultation is currently underway to increase the 30mph stretch to 40mph. A charge of dangerous driving against Mr Wraith, 19, of Hainton Avenue, Grimsby, was discontinued by the prosecution at an earlier hearing because of a lack of evidence. It had been listed for trial. Powles, 25, pictured leaving Grimbsy Magistrates' Court, was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence, a two-year supervision order and was banned from driving for a year . District judge Daniel Curtis told Powles that he put himself at ‘considerable personal risk’ and, if he had become detached from the car, it could have resulted in an accident. ‘That’s probably one of the busiest roads in and out of Grimsby,’ he said. ‘It’s always a road with traffic on it.’ If Powles had fallen, the car might have swerved or caused an accident in which ‘other people going about their business innocently could have been very seriously injured’. ‘It wasn’t a foolish prank, it was utter stupidity,’ said Mr Curtis. Powles also admitted separate offences of assaulting Jade Dobbs-Chestnut and damaging her door on July 9 as well as assaulting Jolene Stafford on October 7. He headbutted Miss Dobbs-Chestnut, causing her nose to bleed, after an incident at her home when he was ‘messing about’ with her dog. The dog attacked him and he threatened to kill it. During the other assault, he grabbed Miss Stafford by the throat and punched her so forcefully on the nose that she rocked backwards. The incident followed a confrontation with his ex-girlfriend, Leah Dixey, who was a friend of Miss Stafford. Powles, who is now working and lives with friends, was given a 20-week suspended prison sentence, a two-year supervision order and was banned from driving for a year. He must also pay £300 compensation for the assaults, £85 court costs and a Government-imposed £80 victims’ surcharge.","Dale Powles clung onto the window of the car as it hurtled along busy road .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Valerie Trierweiler has avoided the limelight since being dumped by Francois Hollande in January – but stepped back in to it this week with a message on Twitter that has infuriated the president and could derail his state visit to Mexico. On Wednesday France’s former first lady tweeted her support for a French woman embroiled in a custody battle with a powerful Mexican politician, just as Hollande arrived in Mexico on a mission to improve relations between the two countries. The tweet said: ‘I support @MaudeVersini who has not seen her 3 children, held by their father in Mexico, for 847 days.’ Former partners: French President Francois Hollande, left, and Valerie Trierweiler at a state dinner at the Elysee Palace, in Paris, in 2013 . It also urged the French Foreign Ministry to intervene, with the final part of the message including its Twitter handle. It added: ‘We must help her. @francediplo must act.’ The incendiary tweet referred to Ms Versini’s legal battle with former Mexico governor Arturo Montiel. She claims that Montiel kidnapped her children during a 2011 Christmas reunion and has used his political clout to prevent them from leaving Mexico. Anger: Hollande is said to be furious over Trierweiler's tweet . However, Montiel just happens to be a friend and ally of Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto. And Mr Hollande is meeting with Mr Nieto for trade talks, deemed vital in light of France and Mexico’s recently fractured relationship. The two countries have been at loggerheads over the case of Frenchwoman Florence Cassez, who was sentenced by Mexico to 60 years in prison on kidnapping charges in 2005. However, pressure from Paris brought about her release after she’d served seven years, which infuriated Mexicans. A French diplomat told the Daily Telegraph that Hollande is livid about the tweet, which would ‘certainly not help’ his olive-branch strategy. He added: ‘The purpose of this visit is to signal a new chapter in bilateral relations.’","Trierweiler steps into row between French woman and Mexican politician .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A Chinese businessman tried to hide the fact he was building two extra storeys on top of his penthouse suite with a ploy many would describe as barking â€“ by covering up the structure with trees and plants. The unnamed man already had a roof garden on his 18th floor apartment in the city of Guangzhou in Guangdong province, but he added extra vegetation while another two floors were built illegally. The scam was unveiled when one of the residents, worried that the extra illegally built floors might damage the rest of the building, complained to local media. Fooled by foliage: A Chinese businessman hid two illegally built extra storeys on his penthouse suite with trees and plants . Disguise: The penthouse already had a roofgarden, but it was increased in size to deceive neighbours and officials . Brazen: The scheme was a very ambitious attempt at hiding the illegal structure . The journalists in turn confirmed that the building should have only been 18 storeys and had somehow acquired an extra two storeys that were not officially registered. The person that leaked the report, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said they had reported the matter two years ago to local Council officials but that nothing had happened, and complained that the businessman who was also not named was too successful and the well-connected. According to the source, the businessman had purchased the penthouse which covered the entire 18th floor several years ago and people had been been surprised when he had put huge trees and thick bushes on the roof. Tall order: The man even used plastic plants for extra camouflage . Anger: Neighbours complained about the structure to local media . Later he had added camouflage nets that were filled with plastic plant foliage. But under the cover of the mass of greenery, the man had slowly started to build an extension, incredibly hiding it from most of those in the block of flats by saying he was doing renovations on the 18th floor. In reality, he was extending the 18th floor to include a 19th and 20th floor. The local council has so far not commented although building experts interviewed by local media said that the extra illegal building work could well adversely affect the entire structure and added that it would need to be carefully tested to check there was not permanent damage, and then probably removed.","Man in Guangzhou city had an 18th-floor penthouse with a roof garden .

"By . John Hall . These incredible photographs are believed to be among the earliest of their kind in existence and offer an fascinating insight into life in the Far East during the 1860s. The images, which form part of a . captivating magazine, show life in China and Japan during the mid-19th century, and . portray villagers going about their day-to-day tasks. At an auction in Cirencester today, the photographs sold for more than six times their £2,000 guide price, with an anonymous buyer winning a bidding war to purchase them for £12,500. Close shave: A street barber carefully cuts a client's hair in this image from China Magazine taken in the late 1860s. The photographs sold today for £12,000 - six times their guide price . Posed: This image shows three young Chinese men sitting in their home in the late 1860s. As well as previously unpublished photographs, the collection also contains articles describing life in mid 19th century China . Spending: A group of gamblers are pictured betting in the street in this photograph. Auctioneers originally tipped the collection to sell for just £2,000, but a bidding war raised the price to £12,500 . Service: A military mandarin - or bureaucrat scholar - is seen in the late 1860s, while the image on the right shows a Japanese servant, or Kerai, posing for a photograph . One of the most intriguing aspects of the photographs is that they do not show powerful emperors or important military figures, focusing instead on gamblers and weavers going about their business. Among the collection is a picture of . two Chinese fruit sellers, while another shows men scrambling up a . ladder and into a window. Members . of a town or village council are captured in one striking image, while . in another a street barber carefully cuts a client’s hair. A harbour scene in Hong Kong is also represented.

Going about their business: Among the collection is a picture of two Chinese fruit sellers (left), while another shows men scrambling up a ladder and into a window (right) Real life: The image shows shops and houses in Tai Ping Shan Street in Hong Kong. In 1860 Chinese writer Wang Tao said the street was full of brothels with 'brightly painted doors and windows with fancy curtains' The photographs are taken from the 'China Magazine', which . began as a weekly publication on March 7 1868 and continued monthly . until it reached its fourth and final volume in 1870. The volume contains a total of 46 photos of varying sizes, but four of those are duplicates and one is a defective picture. Apart from containing a number of photographs unpublished elsewhere, the magazine contains interesting feature articles which throw light on life in mid nineteenth-century China, with Hong Kong featuring prevalently. Down to business: A Chinese letter writer is photographed in the late 1860's. One intriguing aspect of the images is that they show everyday people, instead of powerful emperors or important military figures . History: A Chinese woman mends clothing in the left image, while the picture on the right shows a village elder and his son photographed in the province of Annam, part of modern-day Vietnam . There is little doubt China Magazine was the inspiration for Scottish publisher John Reddie Black’s influential and far better known ‘Far East’ news magazine, which ran from 1870 until 1878. Historian Terry Bennett, author of a History of Photography in China: Western Photographers, noted the extreme rarity of the photographs. He added: 'It may also be the first publication of any kind in the Far East to incorporate pasted-in photographs.' Port: The photograph shows the sun setting on the famous Hong Kong harbour in the late 1860s. The volume contains a total of 46 photos of varying sizes, but four of those are duplicates and one is a defective picture . During the late 1860s, China was ruled by the Tongzhi Emperor - a member of the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan and the tenth emperor of the Qing Dynasty. Although the Tongzhi Emperor was formally in charge of the country between 1861 and 1875, his reign was largely overshadowed by the rise of his mother Empress Dowager Cixi - a powerful and charismatic woman who effectively controlled China for 47 years, from 1861 to her death in 1908. Internally, . the Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864) - a quasi-Christian religious movement . led by the so-called 'Heavenly King' Hong Xiuquan, raided roughly a third of . Chinese territory for over a decade until they were finally crushed in . the Third Battle of Nanking in 1864. Empress Dowager Cixi was a powerful and charismatic woman who effectively controlled China for 47 years, from 1861 to her death in 1908 . Arguably . one of the largest wars in the 19th century in terms of troop . involvement, there was massive loss of life, with a death toll of about . 20 million. Towards the end of the Taiping Rebellion came the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) - a largely chaotic uprising by China's Muslim minorities on the western banks of the Yellow River. Infighting and the lack of a common cause eventually led to the revolt collapsing, with tens of thousands of Muslims subsequently leaving the Yellow River area and moving to south eastern Russia, as well as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Another dominant feature of the period was the arrival and massive expansion of Western colonial missionaries attempting to spread Christianity following the end of the Second Opium War in 1860. Over the following decades Christian missions were set up in every province and major city in China, with more than 2,500 evangelists working there by the turn of the century.","Images show everyday life in China and Japan during mid-19th century .

"By . Dan Bloom . Shock satellite images reveal how Russia has amassed 40,000 troops, tanks and fighter jets just 30 miles from the Ukrainian border. Nato, which released the photographs, claimed the military forces could invade within just 12 hours if given orders from Moscow. The photos have provoked a furious diplomatic row between Nato and the Kremlin, which claims they were taken last year. But Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insisted the threat was real. Fighter jets: Nato images show some of the 40,000 Russian troops its says are massed on Ukraine's borders . Claims: The same image when zoomed out, which claims to show several types of fighter jet including MiG-31s . Troops had been spotted at more than 100 sites, he said, many of which appeared to be fields and not established bases. 'Russia is stirring up ethnic tensions in eastern Ukraine and provoking unrest,' he added. 'And Russia is using its military might to dictate that Ukraine should become a federal, neutral state. That is a decision which only Ukraine as a sovereign state can make.' Several images dated March 26 and taken around the Russian town of Belgorod, 25 miles from the Ukraine border, showed units of a motorised rifle regiment, Mil Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, supply and transport vehicles, according to NATO. They were taken by a commercial satellite firm called Digital Globe and also showed units of a motorised rifle regiment, a 'probable' anti-tank battalion and artillery on March 27. There are even field hospitals, it was claimed. Ramshackle: Nato said many of the troops were not on official bases and had instead set up in Russian fields . One Nato commander claimed the troops were 'ready to go' and could invade within just 12 hours . British Brigadier Gary Deakin told journalists at Nato's headquarters in Belgium: 'This is a force that is very capable, at high readiness, and, as we have illustrated through the imagery, is close to routes and lines of communication. 'It has the resources to be able to move quickly into Ukraine if it was ordered to do so.' According to state-run news agency RIA, a senior official claimed the images were taken last August. It quoted the figure as saying: 'These photographs that were distributed by NATO depict units of Russian forces of the Southern Military District which conducted various exercises last summer, some of them near the border with Ukraine.' Nato replied the correct dates were clearly shown on each image. The development came as pro-Russian activists remained barricaded for a sixth day inside Ukrainian government buildings in two cities where they declared sovereign 'People's Republics'. Hands off: A pro-Russian in Luhansk today with a barricade bearing a stark warning to the West. Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of bankrolling the unrest by using 'paid operatives' and 'provocateurs' Stand-off: Barricades remain today for the sixth day in the eastern cities of Luhansk, pictured, and Donetsk . U.S. out: Pro-Russians outside the seized security service building in Luhansk yesterday. Russia has accused an American security firm, Greystone, of sending a 150-strong 'private army' to Ukraine. It refused to comment . East v West: Unrest has flared in eastern Ukraine, whose residents have strong ethnic ties to Russia. Last month Russia annexed Crimea - and now separatists in Moldova say they want to join Russia too . The gas pipelines which have always flowed from east to west - and through Ukraine - could see a historic reversal within days. Ukraine is in urgent talks to secure gas from firms in Germany in France, it emerged today. Thousands of miles away on the Arctic tundra, Russia is pushing its exports more aggressively to China. Moscow wants to ship liquefied natural gas from 200 wells on the Yamal peninsula to Asian buyers in tankers, as part of a Â£16billion project. It is a significant departure from Russia's usual business model, which always involved pumping the gas to the EU through pipelines. The scheme has been long in the planning but has assumed special significance thanks to sanctions over the Crimean crisis. Russia's reserves of Arctic gas are thought to stand at more than 30 trillion cubic metres. Car bumpers, tyres, and razor wire . surrounded the buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk, just a few miles from . the border with Russia, as supporters rallied round in bitter cold. Ukrainian . Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk visited Donetsk today where he . promised to hand the Russian-speaking region more of its own powers - as . long as it remains part of Ukraine. But the meeting was only with elected leaders and not the masked separatists behind the barricades. The U.S. has directly accused Russia of bankrolling the unrest with 'paid operatives' and 'provocateurs'. It is feared a crackdown on pro-Russians could prompt Moscow to send in 'rescue' troops and annex the east of Ukraine, as it did with the country's Crimean Peninsula last month. The U.S. has sent a warship, the destroyer USS Donald Cook, to the region and it arrived in the Black Sea yesterday for exercises. American leaders have also threatened tougher sanctions against Russia. Yesterday Nato's top military commander in Europe, General Philip Breedlove, said U.S. troops will be deployed to alliance states in eastern Europe, which do not include Ukraine itself, next week. 'Essentially what we are looking at is a . package of land, air and maritime measures that would build assurance . for our easternmost allies,' he said. 'I'm tasked to . deliver this by next week. I fully intend to deliver it early.' He said he wanted to avoid deploying troops but added Russian's force was 'ready to go essentially at command. We talk . about inside of 12 hours'. Nato's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, said troops from the U.S. could be sent to allies in eastern Europe that feel threatened by the conflict between Ukraine and Russia . Huddling: Pro-Russian activists warm themselves near a fire near the barricades in Luhansk today . Activists: Pro-Russians in Luhansk. Demonstrators have been holed up inside a former KGB building for almost six days where they demanded a referendum on independence and declared a 'sovereign republic' Meanwhile, Moscow has refused to extradite Ukraine's ousted leader Viktor Yanukovich - who fled to Russia after he was unseated - and claims he is the 'fully fledged, legitimate president'. Ukraine's new authorities began seeking Yanukovich's extradition in February soon after he fled the capital Kiev. On Wednesday Ukraine arrested a 23-year-old woman from Moscow who it claimed was a Russian spy stirring unrest. Photos posted online by Maria Koleda showed her in a floral dress clutching a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and in camouflage clothes stroking a kitten. Counter-claims have seen the Kremlin accuse Greystone Ltd, a U.S. security firm which was once affiliated to the infamous warzone contractors Blackwater, of sending a 150-strong 'private army' to Ukraine disguised as local forces. A Greystone representative declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline this week.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Lloyd Walsh, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, died suddenly after complaining of a headache . A rugby player died suddenly after complaining of a headache - just weeks after the birth of his first child. Lloyd Walsh, 20, from Balderstone, Rochdale, was in a car with a friend when he complained of a sharp pain in his head. He then began to look 'a bit funny', an inquest heard. The electrician, whose baby boy Mason was only four weeks old at the time, became unresponsive and an ambulance was called. But by the time paramedics arrived around 10 minutes later no pulse could be found. He was taken to Fairfield General Hospital, where it was recorded he had suffered a heart attack and pronounced dead. A pathology report read out at the inquest said Lloyd died on November 21, 2012, from sudden adult death syndrome. A post-mortem examination revealed no significant abnormalities in any of Lloyd's organs, major arteries, or respiratory system. Recording . a conclusion of death by natural causes coroner Simon Nelson praised . Lloyd's family for the fundraising work they have done for CRY - a . charity which offers support to families who have suffered a loss to . sudden adult death syndrome. He said: 'The family are doing some wonderful work to ensure that people never forget about the qualities that he had. 'He clearly was a very special young man.' Lloyd played rugby league for . Castleton-based Mayfield and Crossfield in Warrington and worked with . his father Declan at the family firm Kells Security. Lloyd's mother Catherine described her son as 'kind and thoughtful'. The father-of-one was driving with a friend in the car when he became unresponsive. The rugby player - described as kind and thoughtful by family - was later pronounced dead at hospital . Lloyd was treated by medics at Fairfield General Hospital, pictured. His son Mason was just four weeks old when the sportsman, who played for teams in Warrington and Castleton, died . She said: 'He was very kind and thoughtful, and very protective of his family and friends. 'He was someone who did everything right. 'He never smoked, he never really drank alcohol, and he never touched drugs or anything like that. He looked after himself.' Speaking after the inquest Ms Walsh said: 'Hopefully this will give us closure. We are going to try to keep raising money for CRY. 'We don't want anyone else to have to go through what we have.' Sudden . Adult Death Syndrome (SADS) is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia' - a . disturbance in the heart's rhythm. It can strike at any age and affects those who are fit and athletic. It mainly affects young men - often when they are asleep. Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells. Some . reports suggest it may be caused by an underlying genetic . disorder which runs in families, while others suggest it may be acquired. Around . one in four cases are thought to be caused by a set of conditions called . ion channelopathies. These affect the electrical functioning of the . heart without affecting its structure, meaning they can only be detected . in life rather than after death. The . prevalence of SADS is not fully known as many sudden deaths are put . down to accidents, but research suggests it claims around 500 lives a . year in the UK. It was . first noted in 1977 among Hmong refugees in the US. It was then reported . again in Singapore when medics looked through records which showed 230 . healthy Thai men died suddenly between 1982 and 1990.","Lloyd Walsh was driving with a friend when he felt sharp pain in his head .

"By . Jessica Satherley . and Martin Robinson . Updated: . 08:16 EST, 22 September 2011 . David Cameron has been accused of sending mixed messages after launching a new publicly-funded international marketing campaign claiming  the UK is 'GREAT' - despite regularly saying that Britain's society and economy is broken. The Prime Minister wants to dispel negativity linked to the country's ongoing economic problems and move away from the anarchic images that were beamed around the globe during last month’s English riots. More than £500,000 has been spent on the new GREAT campaign and a series of posters will be used across the world centred around the 2012 London Olympics to promote Britain the brand. Its aim is to attract an extra billion pounds of inward investment and trade over the next year, giving a lift to an economy that has barely grown during the last 12 months. GREAT campaign: The Government has spent £510,000 developing the GREAT campaign, which will flag up Britain as a place to visit and do business . Mr Cameron is in New York where he is to address the United Nations General Assembly. He said last night: 'We want to extend an invitation to the world to take a fresh look at everything we have to offer. 'Britain today is simply a great place to visit, study and work. A great place to invest and do business.' But only last month, as law and order broke down in cities across England he said: 'In my very first act as leader, I signalled my personal priority: to mend our broken society – that passion is stronger today than ever. 'Social problems that have been festering for decades have exploded in our face. 'The broken society is back at the top of my political agenda.' Critics have said that the Prime Minister should not ignore the riots, and that the campaign may not be suitable could be deemed as 'bragging' by other countries. Mark Leonard, the director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, credited with launching the notion of 'Cool Britannia' told the Daily Telegraph: 'My worry about this campaign is that it comes when David Cameron is speaking about broken society, broken economy, and all of the domestic debates are about how nothing works here,' said Mr Leonard. 'It is slightly ludicrous to go to New York and talk about how Britain is great, because that's not the message they've been getting from British media or British politicians.' GREAT idea: The Government marketing campaign aims to dispel the . negative images of Britain beamed around the globe during last month's . riots . Dave Trott, the creative Director of CST Advertising, which produced the 'Enjoy England' campaign in 2009, 'I don't think anyone pays any attention anyway. 'London should be marketed as ""the most exciting city in the world right now because it is out of control"". The Government should use the riots as a 'selling point', he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: 'Of course. That's what we've got. Don't deny it. Don't pretend we're Switzerland or Singapore. No amount of pretending we're not that will change that.' Meanwhile Patrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at the London Business School told The Times: 'I would certainly be cautious before putting money into a campaign like this because it could be interpreted as bragging. 'The intended effect is for people to think ""British people are the most talented in the world. That's wonderful, I'll come."" But the alternative is they will think: ""Says who? I'm from the United States and I think we're better."" Ministers claim this is not a rebranding exercise, but in fact a chance to put the record straight. GREAT business plan: Its aim is to attract an extra billion pounds of inward investment and trade over the next year, giving a lift to an economy that has barely grown during the past year . ‘It is not about rebranding Britain, we . have one of the strongest brands in the world,’ Jeremy Hunt, Secretary . of State for Culture, Media and Sport, told reporters yesterday. ‘It is about using that brand to create more exports, more inward investment, more trade, more foreign tourists and also to make sure that we can put the record straight after some of the terrible events that happened this summer, which created a negative image,’ he added. ‘It’s based on something that isn’t new - the idea of putting great back into Britain is something that has been around for a very long time, but we think this is the moment to use it next year.’ But an economist suggested a billion pounds was a tiny amount in terms of the overall economy. ‘When GDP is in the trillions, a billion is not a great deal,’ said Scott Corfe, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. In 2009, foreign companies invested £46 billion in the UK, a decrease of £3.2 billion from the previous year and the smallest flow of inward direct investment since 2004, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. The government said the bulk of the billion pounds is expected to come from exports. The billion pounds will go some way to delivering a return on the £9.3 billion it will cost to stage the Games. The government, backed by the Foreign Office and UK Trade and Investment, will host a global investment conference in London on the eve of the Olympics and set up a British business embassy to showcase the country’s innovations, creativity and entrepreneurship. GREAT entertainment: The campaign aims to show off what's great about Britain - from music to shopping - and Downing Street has unveiled a series of postcards that promote these, which will be handed out at business events . Politicians also hope the Olympics and Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee next year, to mark 60 years of her reign, will boost tourism, attracting an additional four million visitors, aided by a further billion pounds of free publicity. The campaign comes at a time when a cash-strapped Conservative-led coalition government looks to the private sector to boost growth, as it embarks on an austerity package to eliminate a record budget deficit. The country also has to overcome the damage to its image caused by this summer’s riots in which cars and buildings were burnt and shops looted in London and other English cities. GREAT ambition: The campaign comes at a time when a cash-strapped Conservative-led coalition government looks to the private sector to boost growth .","Prime Minister says economy and society are broken following recession and riots in English cities .

"By . Chris Hastings . Letters between James Bond creator Ian Fleming and his friend Denis Hamilton have gone on sale for £160,000 . As the creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming was a master of dreaming up death-defying situations from which the super-spy only just manages to escape. But Fleming himself owed his life to the prompt actions of one of his closest friends who spotted he was having a major heart attack. In previously unseen letters, published for the first time today, Fleming also admitted his impending marriage would cause a ‘Fleet Street sensation’ – and reveals that he regards the genteel pastime of gardening as a ‘death trap’. Fleming’s intimate exchanges with his colleague Denis ‘CD’  Hamilton form part of an archive of more than 80 letters now on sale for £160,000. In one note, dated April 19, 1961, Fleming told Hamilton, who was working alongside him at The Sunday Times, that he is now having to behave like an old man following his brush with death during an editorial meeting. He writes: ‘Although neither of  us knew it I am afraid I was in the middle of a rather major heart attack this time last week.’ Fleming adds: ‘One never believes these things so I sat stupidly on trying to make intelligent comments about the thrilling new project about which I long to hear more. However, a thousand thanks for noticing my trouble so quickly and for shepherding me away when the time came.’ The two men had been friends for more than a decade by the time of Fleming’s heart attack. In 1952, Fleming confided to Hamilton his plans to marry Ann Rothermere, the soon-to-be divorced wife of the 2nd Viscount Rothermere, who was then chairman of Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail. He writes from his home in Chelsea: ‘CD – just so you won’t see it first in the public print. This is  to tell you that I am getting married to Ann Rothermere, which will cause something of a Fleet Street sensation I fear as the divorce goes into the lists next Wednesday.’ Revelations: The letters reveal Ian Fleming had a heart attack during a Sunday Times editorial meeting and that he believed his plans to marry Ann Rothermere once she divorced would cause a 'Fleet Street sensation' He adds: ‘In fact this has been on the cards for a long time. We have known each other for years. There are no hard feelings anywhere.’ Ann had first met Fleming in 1936, and had thought him, then aged 28, ‘a handsome, moody creature’. Ann was later one of the most charismatic society hostesses, her house in Victoria Square becoming a renowned salon where  high society, artists and intellectuals mixed. In his letter, Fleming assures Hamilton that Lord Kemsley, the then owner of The Sunday Times, has no problems with his relationship with the former wife of a rival newspaper magnate. He writes: ‘So please calm down excitement at levels other than K [Kemsley] who knows and accepts with an apparent good grace.’ Fleming and Ann eventually married in 1952 and remained together until the author’s death from heart disease in August 1964. Fleming died aged 56 on their son Caspar’s 12th birthday. In a touching letter, Ann tells Hamilton that her son, who later took his own life, was in turmoil. She wrote: ‘I was deeply touched by your letter to Caspar .  .  . Alas he refuses to answer as he says he refuses to owe anything to friends of his parents. Happy couple: Ian Fleming later married Ann, pictured together in 1963, and they remained together until his death from heart disease in 1964 . ‘His present frame of mind is very distressing to me. I can only pray that it will alter. The only sign of grace is his unhappiness which I am powerless to help.’ Fleming, who joined The Sunday Times after serving as a wartime naval intelligence officer, continued as a journalist even when his career as a novelist took off. By the time he formally quit the paper in 1961, he had written nine of his Bond novels, including Casino Royale and Live And Let Die. The letters show also the dividing line between Fleming’s roles of  journalist and thriller writer could become obscured. On July 17, 1960, Harry Hodson, the then Sunday Times editor, criticised his profile of the German city of Hamburg because he thought it was too obsessed with its red-light district. He writes: ‘We have to remember that for a great many of our readers .  .  . prostitution is not even a necessary evil, but something entirely immoral and degrading. Colleagues: Dennis Hamilton, pictured in 1966, worked alongside Fleming at The Sunday Times . ‘Again striptease acts may be alright for callow youths, and frustrated middle-aged men, but are a vulgar .  .  . sort of entertainment for balanced people.’ Fleming’s journalist colleagues were keen to capitalise on the success of the Bond characters, and several letters deal with how the spy may be included in the paper. On September 5, 1961, Fleming lobbies for an article on ‘the guns of James Bond’ even though he accepts it may bore female readers. He refuses Hamilton’s request for a 1,000-word article about 007 himself which the editor feels would be more ‘bonne bouche’ to readers. Just two months before his death, Fleming chastises Hamilton for wasting time in his garden. A letter dated June 15, 1964, says: ‘I am sorry you have been playing the fool in the garden. You must know that all forms  of gardening are tantamount to suicide for the normal sedentary male. For heaven’s sake leave the whole business alone.’ The correspondence also shows that the friends could sometimes fall out. In one undated letter, Fleming criticises his friend for a particularly ‘harsh’ exchange of words. He writes: ‘You were under great pressure so your wrath is excusable. But you should not use such words to a friend. They were unforgivable so I shall forget them.’ The correspondence has been acquired from Hamilton’s family by independent booksellers Bertram Rota. Owner Julian Rota said: ‘We are asking £160,000 for the letters which we do not consider an unreasonable amount. They show that the relationship between the two men became more relaxed and more intimate with the passing of time.’ Andrew Lycett, Fleming’s official biographer, said of the letters to Hamilton: ‘I think it was very much a mutual admiration society. ‘Ian Fleming was certainly a great fan of Hamilton’s and liked the fact that he had served with distinction during the war.’","Letters between James Bond creator Ian Fleming and his friend Denis ‘CD’  Hamilton are on sale for £160,000 .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . An independent report released Friday says the University of Missouri failed to follow parts of the federal law that governs sexual harassment on campus when handling the case of a former swimmer's suicide. The report concludes administrators on the Columbia campus should have investigated 20-year-old Sasha Menu Courey's 2011 death after her parents raised questions about the events leading to her suicide. Menu Courey alleged she was sexually assaulted during her freshman year by as many as three football players, 16 months before she died. The school previously said it didn't act sooner under the 40-year-old Title IX law or more recent U.S. Department of Education instructions because neither Menu Courey nor her parents sought a police investigation and didn't respond to a later request for information. Failed: School administrators learned about the alleged February 2010 incident after Canadian-born swimmer Sasha Menu Courey, pictured, recounted it to a rape crisis counselor during an online chat conversation and a campus therapist . Missouri President Tim Wolfe (left) signed an executive order that requires all university employees to report claims of sexual abuse . The case was referred to Columbia police in late January after ESPN's 'Outside the Lines' raised numerous questions about the university's response. The . report makes no specific recommendations for possible changes but . instead provides a detailed accounting of the university's response. Among its primary findings: The university lacked a policy advising . employees of their obligations to report suspected sexual assault and . harassment, which federal law suggested. University . President Tim Wolfe took action on that very issue Tuesday with an . executive order that requires all university employees other than those . legally bound by confidentiality to report such claims to the . university's Title IX coordinator. 'It became clear to us that we needed a stronger, more transparent policy,' he said at a news conference Friday. Alleged victim: Despite their legal obligation to report possible sexual violence to police, the college didn't tell law enforcement about Menu Courey's claims, according to ESPN's 'Outside the Lines' The . Title IX coordinator and local police should have been alerted to Menu . Courey's claims in November 2012 after a public records request by her . parents produced documents alluding to a possible attack, the report . determined. The Title IX coordinator also should have been told about . the possible assault nine months earlier when athletics department . employees learned about it in a local news story, the law firm . concluded. University . curators received the report, by the Dowd Bennett law firm of suburban . St. Louis, during a closed-door session in Rolla on Friday. After the . meeting, Wolfe apologized to Menu Courey's 'family, friends and . teammates.' 'We're . truly sorry for this heartbreaking tragedy and apologize for whatever . shortcomings may have occurred on our part, and our treatment of her . while she was one of our students,' he said. 'You remain in our thoughts . and prayers as a university community.' Missouri football: Former Missouri football receiver Rolandis Woodland backed up her account and said he saw cell phone video of three of his teammates raping her in a dark room as she sobbed hysterically . Wolfe . also said the report shows that 'our university employees acted in good . faith with the best interests of Sasha Menu Courey and her family in . this matter. There was no attempt to cover anything up.' Other . sexual assault cases have been linked to Missouri's athletic . department, including former running back Derrick Washington's 2010 . conviction for sexually assaulting a tutor in her sleep. Basketball . player Michael Dixon transferred in 2012 after two sex assault claims . against him went public, though he was never charged. The . report's release also follows a turbulent week for Missouri athletics, . in which transfer Zach Price was kicked off the men's basketball team . Thursday after two arrests and star receiver Dorial Green Beckham was . dismissed from the football team moments after the curators' meeting . Friday following an investigation into a suspected burglary. No charges . were filed against either man. Menu . Courey, who grew up outside Toronto, killed herself at a Boston . psychiatric hospital after withdrawing from classes midsemester and . being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, a disease her . family said she struggled with before college but which went . undiagnosed. The . Associated Press normally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual . assault, but Menu Courey's parents have publicly discussed the case at . length, as has the university. In . a diary entry found by her family after her death, Menu Courey wrote . she had told an academic counselor in Missouri's athletic department . about the rape while hospitalized in Boston. The report's five-lawyer . investigative team interviewed the counselor, who longer works for the . school, and determined that 'it cannot be definitively concluded that a . report of sexual assault ... was made to any employee or official of the . university while Sasha was alive, other than medical personnel.' The . ex-counselor told investigators Menu Courey didn't mention a rape, and . that the counselors spoke to her while in a noisy restaurant. 'It . is possible that either because of a miscommunication or an inability . to hear everything, there was an unintentional disconnect' between the two women, the report said.","An independent investigation determined that the University of Missouri failed to follow federal law that governs sexual harassment when it didn't report the alleged rape of swimmer Sasha Menu Courey .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The voice of serial killer Fred West will be heard on television for the first time next week in a chilling new documentary. The House of Horrors murderer’s story is being told in a Channel 5 documentary The Unseen Fred West Confessions to mark the 20th anniversary of the investigation. Actor Charlie Walters plays the builder but lip-syncs West’s actual words from the interviews recorded by the police. Scroll down for video. Killer couple: Fred and Rose West were responsible for nine murders at 25 Cromwell Street, the Gloucester house they moved into eight months after their January 1972 wedding . West, a father of at least eight children, casually recalls how he strangled his 16-year-old daughter Heather, one of nine victims found at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, the home she shared with his second wife Rose who he married in January 1972. Five of their victims at Cromwell Street, which was demolished in 1996, were beheaded and dismembered before they were buried in the cellar. West tells police: ‘I brought my two hands up and grabbed her around the neck. But I didn’t grab her round the neck to choke her or nothing. All I was going to do was to grab her round the neck and shake her.’ Portraits of evil: Rose and Fred West. Despite all the evidence including that now provided beyond the grave from Fred West, Rose West continues to deny responsibility for any of the 10 murders for which she was convicted . Fred West was interviewed 161 times by the police following his arrest in February 1994. He casually told them how his wife Rose cut up their daughter and put her in a dustbin . He confesses that he was too strong: ‘I can undo three-quarter nuts without a spanner.’ West says that his wife was responsible for cutting up their daughter: ‘All the mess that Rose got herself into, I took the f***ing rap for. So anyway, I said: “Look, you’ll have to tell me exactly what happened.” ‘She said Heather was cut up. I never felt so ill in all my life. I said: “What on earth did you cut her up for?” She said she wouldn’t fit in the dustbin. Now the thing that makes it hard, that she cut Heather up and chucked her in a f***ing dustbin. Our daughter in a dustbin.’ Serial killer and his home: Fred West in a police mugshot and 25 Cromwell Street, the Gloucester home, where nine victims were buried in the cellar. The house was demolished in 1996 and replaced by a footpath . On November 22, 1995 Rose West was convicted of 10 murders and sentenced to life in prison. She denies all the allegations. West was interviewed 161 times by the police after his arrest in February 1994 and the show features some excerpts of the man who kept souvenirs – a finger joint or kneecap – from his victims. West never faced justice and hanged himself in his Winson Green prison cell on January 1, 1995, aged 53. Steve Warr, the executive producer of The Unseen Fred West Confessions, said the film’s makers defended the programme against allegations of sleaze and sensationalism. He said: ‘The show is not being made in a sensationalist manner. We are presenting, factually, information which already exists, which is in the public interest.’","Channel 5 show has actor lip-syncing serial killer from police interviews .

"By . Anthony Bond . In charge: Julia Gillard remains Australia's prime minister today following a leadership ballot in which nobody from the government ran against her . Julia Gillard remains Australia's prime minister today after she was re-elected unopposed after calling a leadership ballot. Her predecessor Kevin Rudd, whom Gillard ousted in an internal party coup in 2010, had been expected to attempt to replace her. But at the very last moment he announced he would not contest the ballot. In what some commentators have described as 'farcical' it resulted in no vote taking place and Wales-born Ms Gillard being re-elected unopposed as leader of the Labor Party. It is the second time in 13 months that the prime minister had called and survived a leadership election. It came after Ms Gillard had earlier . delivered a historic national apology in Parliament to the . thousands of unwed mothers who were forced by government policies to . give up their babies for adoption over several decades. More than 800 people, many of them in . tears, heard the apology in the Great Hall of Parliament House and . responded with a standing ovation. Senior minister Simon Crean brought leadership unrest to a head earlier today by calling on his government colleagues to sign a petition to force a ballot if Gillard, who was born in Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, refused to call one. Rival: It was thought that Kevin Rudd, pictured, may stand against Julia Gillard. However, he announced shortly before the vote that he would not stand . Moving: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard, left, is embraced by a woman during the historic national apology in Parliament . The leadership challenge followed months of slipping polls and internal tensions that put her minority . Labor government on course to be swept away at September elections. 'This is not personal. It's about the party, the future of the country,' said senior Labor minister Simon Crean, calling the challenge to break a . deadlock between Gillard and chief rival Mr Rudd. Gillard, who replaced Rudd in a partyroom coup in June 2010, has seen . her leadership under threat for most of the past two years and her . minority government has been unable to turn around a long-running slump . in opinion polls, fueled in part by internal instability, as well as . flagging economic conditions. The conservative opposition led by Tony Abbott is well ahead in opinion . polls and has promised to scrap a 30 percent tax on coal and iron ore . mine profits, and to scrap an unpopular tax on carbon, if it wins power. Touching: Australia apologised for the brutal and often illegal forced adoption of tens of thousands of babies born mostly to unmarried mothers between the 1950s and 1970s . New chapter: The Labour Party leader's victory follows months of slipping polls and internal tensions . Financial markets had little reaction to the news of the leadership ballot. The Australian dollar . was a shade firmer on the day thanks mainly to a surprisingly strong . reading of manufacturing from China, Australia's biggest export market. The currency was at $1.0380 and holding in a very tight range. Government bonds hardly budged, with investors assuming future borrowing . needs would be much the same whichever leader or party was in power. During the historic national apology, . Ms Gillard said: 'Today this Parliament on behalf of the Australian . people takes responsibility and apologises for the policies and . practices that forced the separation of mothers from their babies, which . created a lifelong legacy of pain and suffering. 'We . acknowledge the profound effects of these policies and practices on . fathers and we recognize the hurt these actions caused to brothers and . sisters, grandparents, partners and extended family members,' she said. Breaking with the past: An Aboriginal elder performed a traditional welcome before the politician apologised . National shame: Unwed mothers were pressured, deceived and threatened into giving up their babies . 'We deplore the shameful practices . that denied you, the mothers, your fundamental rights and . responsibilities to love and care for your children,' she added. Overdue: An apology was recommended a year ago . Gillard . committed 5 million Australian dollars ($5 million) to support services . for affected families and to help biological families reunite. A national apology was recommended a year ago by a Senate committee that investigated the impacts of the now-discredited policies. Unwed mothers were pressured, deceived and threatened into giving up their babies from World War II until the early 1970s so they could be adopted by married couples, which was perceived to be in the children's best interests, the Senate committee report found. The seven-member Senate committee began investigating the federal government's role in forced adoption in 2010 after the Western Australian state parliament apologised to mothers and children for the flawed practices in that state from the 1940s until the 1980s. Western Australia was the first of five state and territory governments to apologise for forced adoption. Australia has eight such governments.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Jeremy Salvesen, 51, from Fife who died after hitting his head on a rock while skiing in the French Alps . The family of a British businessman who died after hitting his head on a rock while skiing in the Alps say they will treasure all their memories of him. Jeremy Salvesen, 51, from Elie, Fife, was skiing with his family in the resort of La Clusaz on Thursday when he reportedly fell suffering head injuries. The entrepreneur, thought to be part of the Salvesen business dynasty, was said to have been taken to hospital in nearby Annecy, where he died from his 'catastrophic' injuries. His family today spoke of their loss and said they would take some comfort from knowing he had been doing something he loved. In a statement, they said: 'We are devastated by Jeremy's death as a result of catastrophic injuries in a tragic accident in the French Alps while he was skiing on a beautiful day with a large family group. 'We all take comfort from knowing that he was doing something he loved with a big smile on his face. 'As always, Jeremy was pushing himself to the limit. His life has been a wonderful adventure and we treasure all our memories of him. 'We want to thank everyone at La Clusaz and at Annecy who did everything they could for Jeremy and in particular, we want to thank the expert medical professionals who cared for him.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) confirmed the death of a British national. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national on April 10 in France. The accident happened on Thursday in the resort of La Clusaz (pictured), where Mr Salvesen was skiing with his family . 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.' According to The Scotsman newspaper, father-of-four Mr Salvesen, who owned a chalet in the resort near the Swiss border, was an entrepreneur and business investor involved in several start-up projects in Scotland. It was reported that in 2009 he finished third with his sailing partner in the double-handed class of the Portimao Global Ocean Race - an eight-month adventure which took in South Africa, New Zealand, Brazil and the USA.","Jeremy Salvesen hit his head on a rock while skiing in resort of La Clusaz .

But within 24 hours, Cary Collings bought another scratchcard on the way to cashing in his ticket - and won another $200,000. The 61-year-old can count himself among the luckiest men in America after winning the life changing sum. Cary Collings, 61, says he will continue working despite winning the life changing sum in just one day . Collings bought his first card on Thursday as he filled up his car at the River Road Food Mart on River Road in Puyallup, Washington. He scratched it off at the traffic lights and realised he had scooped $55,555 on the Red Hot 5's. The following day he stopped to try his luck once more. After celebrating with a pizza bought three Bring on Bens scratch tickets and won $200,000 with the first one. Collings has played WA Lottery since it launched in 2004 but those two tickets were the first time he had ever won a significant amount.

"By . Shari Miller . A man employed as a private security guard opened fire in a Russian Orthodox cathedral on the island of Sakhalin, killing a nun and a churchgoer and wounding six others. The shooting occurred on Sunday at a time when Russian security forces are on high alert due to safety concerns about possible attacks on the Winter Olympics in Sochi, thousands of miles to the west. Officials said there was no apparent link to the Games. Shooting: A policeman watches as a churchgoer leaves the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, where a gunman opened fire on Sunday . The gunman was detained at the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, after the shooting, the federal Investigative Committee said. It added that the suspect had worked as a security guard in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, which is some 4,130 miles from Moscow. There was no immediate word on a motive in the attack, which comes just six days after a Moscow teenager killed a teacher and a policeman and held classmates hostage in the first major school shooting in Russia. Most of the wounded in Sundayâ€™s mid-afternoon attack were shot in the legs and their lives were not in danger, according to state news agency RIA Novosti, citing the regional leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Archbishop Tikhon. He said a prayer service for the victims would be held later on Sunday at the cathedral, which is the main Russian Orthodox church in a region that includes Sakhalin and the Kurile island chain. The island is situated in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. The part of the church where the shooting took place would have to be cleaned of victimsâ€™ blood and blessed, he added. Remembrance: Archbishop Tikhon performs a service in memory of the shooting victims . The Investigative Committee said psychiatrists would attempt to determine the suspect's mental condition. There have been a handful of shooting sprees in offices and public places in Russia in recent years, but they are relatively rare and state-run media tend to treat such attacks as a largely American phenomenon. The Feb 3 shooting at a Moscow school, in which a student used his fatherâ€™s rifles, has led to calls for stiffer punishment for gun owners whose weapons are used in attacks.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Since the role of Harry Potter turned him into a child star, he has had his fair share of the limelight. But it seems that Daniel Radcliffe has little sympathy for celebrities who post updates on the internet and then moan about their fame. The 24-year-old actor has hit  out at stars who write about  their personal lives on Twitter and Facebook, saying they should not be taken seriously when they then ask for privacy. Little sympathy: Daniel Radcliffe does not use social media, but said stars who use Twitter should not be taken seriously when they ask for privacy . His comments were echoed by singer Sir Elton John, who said he ‘hates’ celebrity culture and is sick of seeing stars tweeting and posting updates on Facebook. Speaking to Sky News, Radcliffe said he tries hard to avoid the limelight. ‘There’s certain things you can do to make it a lot easier on yourself,’ he said. ‘If you don’t, for instance, go to premieres that aren’t for a film you’re in, or don’t just turn up at other events, then that’s going to help to not fuel the interest.’ Despite having a huge teenage following, Radcliffe does not use social media – a fact he credits with keeping his fans at bay. ‘I don’t have Twitter and I don’t have Facebook and I think that makes things a lot easier,’ he said. ‘If you go on Twitter and tell  everybody what you’re doing moment to moment and then  claim you want a private life,  then no one is going to take that request seriously.’ Since shooting to fame in  the Harry Potter film franchise, Radcliffe has appeared in darker roles on stage – in Peter Shaffer’s West End hit Equus – and on  screen – in horror movie The Woman in Black. This evening, he can be seen  on Sky Arts alongside Mad Men star Jon Hamm in the second  series of the drama A Young  Doctor’s Notebook. It is part of his drive to prove himself as an actor in case people believe he has not earned his success. ‘It’s as much to myself, as to anyone else,’ he said. ‘People say, “Oh he’s got a chip on his shoulder” like it’s a bad thing. It’s a perfectly good thing if you let it motivate you.’ Radcliffe admits that luck played a large part in his early career and he is determined not to rest on his laurels. ‘That’s not what I’m about,’ he said. ‘It fires you up.’ Anger: The actor's comments echoed claims made by Sir Elton John who said he 'hates' celebrity culture . He admitted that he used to resent the attention Harry Potter brought him, but said it was ‘petulant’ to complain about his fame. ‘When I was 18 or 19 there was definitely a level of frustration around,’ he said. ‘I did have to think where I went and you do get a little frustrated, but ultimately it’s childish, petulant.’ But he says it is ‘ridiculous’ to suggest that stardom deprived him of his childhood. ‘Kids who are abused have their childhoods taken away from them,’ he said. In a separate interview on CNN, Sir Elton fired his own broadside at celebrity culture. ‘We focus so much on celebrity  in our culture and we don’t focus on the right things,’ he said. ‘I’m so sick of seeing celebrities on covers of magazines and tweeting and on Facebook and reality shows. It’s disgusting. ‘I hate the celebrity that is around now. The vacuous, talentless, horror show that they get paid millions of dollars for, when there are people who are teaching kids every day that are trying to scrape by and earn a living. It’s a joke.’","The 24-year-old has hit out at stars who write about  their personal lives .

"By . Reuters . A team of approximately 90 U.S. Marines and sailors headed to the Philippines on Sunday. They were part of the first wave of promised U.S. military assistance sent for relief efforts after a devastating typhoon killed at least 10,000 people. The order was made this weekend by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. H ordered U.S. military's Pacific Command to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support in the wake of super typhoon Haiyan. One of the most powerful storms ever recorded, Haiyan was a maximum category-five storm with ground winds of up to 235mph. Authorities say the death toll could be 10,000 in the city of Tacloban, Leyte alone and  approximately four million people are said to have been affected, according to the the country's national disaster agency. A Filipino father and his children wait for food relief outside their makeshift tent in the super typhoon devastated city of Tacloban, Leyte. The typhoon  flattened homes and knocked out communications. An aerial view of the damage in the Philippines following Super Typhoon Haiyan. The death toll from a super typhoon that decimated entire towns could soar well over 10,000, authorities warned Sunday, making it the country's worst recorded natural disaster. Bodies were seen floating in flooded streets and survivors said the aftermath is like the 2004 Tsunami. The team of U.S. forces from the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade left for the Philippines from a U.S. base in Okinawa, Japan. According to Marine officials, teams of Marines boarded two KC-130J Hercules transport aircrafts. Meanwhile two Florida-based Navy P-3 Orion surveillance aircrafts, which had been on a six month rotation to Misawa, Japan, have been sent to the Philippines to assist with search and rescue efforts. Last December U.S. Marines made emergency missions to the the southern Philippines to help the victimes of Typhoon Bopha, which killed more than 230 people. A resident carries his bicycle past houses damaged by typhoon Haiyan, in Tacloban city, Leyte, Philippines. Typhoon Haiyan is one of the strongest storms on record. It slammed into six central Philippine provinces Friday leaving a wide swath of destruction and thousands dead. In December 2012 U.S. Marines and Philippine Army personnel work together to unload relief goods to be transported to regions affected by Typhoon Bopha from the Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules millitary aircraft inside the International Airport in Davao, Mindanao. Typhoon Haiyan is estimated to have killed at least 10,000 people in the central Philippines. Most of the deaths appear to have been caused by surging sea water strewn with debris that many said resembled a tsunami, leveling houses and drowning its victims. The typhoon  is the 30th to hit China this year. As well as the massive numbers feared dead in Tacloban, there are concerns hundreds more have been killed in remote coastal areas.The typhoon is now making its way towards Vietnam and mainland China - with locals bracing themselves for the deadly storm. Chinese authorities have issued a level three emergency response throughout the country, ordering fisherman to shelter their boats to prevent any damage. On Sunday the Filipino government announced that they were considering introducing martial law to combat widespread looting sprees as homeless search for food. Filipinos rush in front of a store in the wake of super typhoon, Haiyan. Government officials have threatened martial law due to widespread looting.

Efforts by aid agencies to deliver food and water have been hampered by plagues of looters attacking emergency convoys and stealing from supply vans, the Philippine Red Cross have said. A TV station reported ATM machines have been broken open.

"By . Meghan Keneally . and Hugo Gye . Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin said lat night's debate moderator was 'tough' on Paul Ryan and allowed Joe Biden to 'run roughshod over the conversation'. Palin, who went up against Biden in the during the last election, told Fox News she was unimpressed with Martha Raddatz, saying: 'Really tough format for someone like a Paul Ryan or anybody else up against Joe Biden, when the moderator allowed one candidate to absolutely run roughshod over the conversation, over the opponent. 'It reminded me... of watching a musk ox run across the tundra with somebody underfoot. And in this case, when it came to style, it was Paul Ryan underfoot because of the moderator allowing Biden to do the interrupting, to kind of take control of the conversation.' The reporter faced conservative . criticism even before the start of the debate after it was revealed that . Obama was a personal acquaintance who had attended her wedding in 1991. Center stage: ABC senior foreign affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz served as the moderator for the only vice presidential debate and was praised for her performance . Backing a winner? Sarah Palin waited until the last-minute until she backed Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan for the White House . Raddatz faced a tough job as . moderator of last night's vice-presidential debate, just a week after . Jim Lehrer's widely derided performance at the helm of the first . presidential debate. Despite . Palin's criticism most commentators praised her no-nonsense demeanour, . after Jim Lehrer's much-derided performance in last week's presidential . debate. According to Buzzfeed, Raddatz spoke 380 more words than Lehrer did last week, as she said 1,940 words during Thursday's debate while Lehrer only said 1,560. Some Twitter users praised the control that she showed throughout the debate. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that she 'makes a strong impression. Knows her stuff'. Taking turns: Paul Ryan (right) reportedly won the debate as Joe Biden (left) was criticized for being too combative and interrupting his rival frequently . Not her forte: Raddatz made her name reporting from war zones and this is her first time moderating a national debate . CNN . reporter Roland Martin tweeted 'Martha Raddatz is not messing around. You hear that Jim Lehrer? She ain't allowing filibustering!' When asked after the debate, Romney . spokesperson Michael Steel told Politico said 'I'm not sure I would say' that Raddatz was fair. 'I . thought she obviously asserted herself more than Lehrer did, but there . was still a great deal of crosstalk, there was still a great deal of . difficulty making points in a reasonable and progressive fashion,' he . told the site. Memories: Palin herself debated against Joe Biden during the 2008 presidential election . Raddatz faced a particular challenge . given that she is the only one of the four debate moderators . who is not a television news anchor. She has spent much of her career covering foreign news and specialising in the Middle East. In keeping with the tradition that the moderators briefly address the audience before taking their seat on stage, the 59-year-old Raddatz said that she isn't used to the fuss surrounding the debate. She also added that, given her experience in war zones, she isn't used to having her back to the action. The role of the moderator was . highlighted following the first debate between Republican nominee Mitt . Romney and President Barack Obama, when veteran Lehrer was . criticised for his lacklustre performance. Predecessor: So-called 'Dean of Moderators' Jim Lehrer was widely criticized after last week's presidential debate because he allowed the candidates to simply steamroll over him . Lehrer . came out of retirement to moderate the debate last week - making it his . 12th and earning him the title of having moderated the most debates in . U.S. history - and tarnished his previously stellar reputation. Romney . steamrolled over Lehrer as he tried to intervene, and the President . alternated between looking on longingly for help or giving a jab at the . PBS newsman. Some conservatives were worried about Raddatz's neutrality in the days leading up to the debate as it was revealed that then-Senator Obama attended her wedding. Obama went to law school with Raddatzâ€™s first husband Julius Genachowski, who is the current chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Enjoying the limelight: Raddatz tweeted this Instagram picture of she and her family onstage after the debate . Different discussion: She posed for a picture with her son and his friend taking the candidate's spots after Ryan and Biden left the stage Thursday night . ABC News, which has employed Raddatz since 1999, issued a statement characterising the allegations that Obama's presence at her wedding proves she is biased as 'absurd'. 'Martha Raddatz is known for her tough, fair reporting, which is why it was no surprise to her colleagues inside and outside ABC News that she was chosen by the Commission on Presidential Debates for this assignment,' the statement said. 'Barack Obama was a law school classmate of Raddatz's ex-husband Julius Genachowski at Harvard. At the time Barack Obama was a student and president of the Law Review. 'He attended their wedding over two decades ago along with nearly the entire Law Review, many of whom went on to successful careers including some in the Bush administration. Raddatz and Mr Genachowski divorced in 1997 and both are now remarried.'","Former candidate Sarah Palin said Martha Raddatz allowed Joe Biden to 'run roughshod' over his opponent Paul Ryan .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . American scientists have created a . wearable computer for dogs that they say could allow man's best friend . to send messages to handlers. The technology might initially sound barking mad, but its creators at Georgia . Institute of Technology believe that it will give crime dogs and other K-9s a clearer and more direct way to communicate with their handlers. The Google Glass-inspired technology for hounds may even let us humans view the world through a dog's eyes. The Google Glass-inspired technology for hounds may even let us view the world through a dog's eyes . While gadget lovers await the commercial release of Google Glass in 2014, Thad Starner, the technical leader on Google's upcoming eyewear, has teamed up with scientists at the Institute to develop a computerised harness to aid working dogs, the MIT Technology Review reports. The project, titled FIDO (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations), could allow a bomb-sniffing, cadaver or other working dog to activate a sensor which would then send information to the dogâ€™s handler, according to the Review. As of now the developers are testing a new device that allows the dog using it to activate a signal which is sent to its handler through an earpiece. The FIDO system works by the dog . activating a sensor on the its vest or collar to transmit a verbal . command, which the handler can hear through an earpiece of see on a . head-mounted display, perhaps like Google Glass. The researchers fitted a dog vest . with an Arduino microprocessor and tested four different sensors that . dogs could activate by tugging, biting or simply putting close to their . mouths. Professor Melody Jackson, who is working on the project has been training assistance dogs for around 18 years, said that working . dogs talking part in the early study quickly learned to trigger the . sensors to set off a tone. The results of the trial will be published in a paper and presented at the International Semantic Web Conference in October. Better communication: The project, titled FIDO, could allow guide dogs and bomb-detecting dogs to activate a sensor which would then send information to their handler . Eventually the technology could transmit video from a dogâ€™s perception to a human viewer, the Review reported. Associate Professor Melody Jackson said that service dogs that tested the gadget quickly got the hang of the sensors, which they were able to activate by using their mouths. She said that the FIDO . technology could help disabled people navigate more effectively and let . bomb-detecting dogs communicate with their handlers from a distance - . even telling them abut a specific type of bomb that they have found. Similarly, the scientists believe that . the system could allow rescue dogs to alert a human team from afar when . they have found an injured person. Of course the technology could be of interest to pet owners too in the future. Professor Jackson said that it could be used to let humans know when a dog is hungry or wants to go outside - perhaps even by a text message. Signaling: The device will allow the dog using it to activate a signal which is sent to its handler through an earpiece .","Scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology have created a .

Their arrival came as it emerged that as few as 400 of Scotland's wildcats survive in the wild, as the species is under threat from inter-breeding. One of two wildcat kittens named Brave and Merida at Highland Wildlife Park, near Aviemore. resesearchers now say there may be just 35 left in the wild. Experts have issued a fresh warning over the future of the Scottish  wildcat . DNA hope: A genetic test is currently under development which, if successful, will show definitively whether individual cats are pure-bred wildcats or hybrids . The new study found that wildcat numbers may have been overestimated . However, a new . DNA test is offering hope that the species might survive. The test, . which could be ready by Christmas, could identify which cats are . pure-bred, and which are hybrid and pave the way for a breeding programme which could save the species. It would allow for the testing of cats . both in captivity and in the wild and for measures to be taken to . protect those pure-bred wildcats that remained from being hybridised . into extinction. The current official estimate of 400 . Scottish wildcats remaining in the wild is an informed guess; the . worst-case scenario ‘that there is none’ is a genuine possibility. Douglas Richardson, animal collections . manager at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: ‘We get our knickers in a . twist because the Indians aren’t doing all they can to protect their . tigers, or the Kenyans their black rhinos, but it’s OK for us to let . this one slip through the net? I don’t think so. Last of its kind? With just 400 thought to remain in the wild and those under threat from inter-breeding these could be some of last pictures of Scotlands wildcats . The animals are one of the big attractions at the park in Kincraig, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland . ‘Here we have this iconic emblem of the Highlands and if we don’t get our finger out, it will become extinct, guaranteed.’ Wildcats are the only remaining large mammal predator and the only surviving cat native to Britain. Persecution and deforestation . contributed to a drop in numbers during the 18th and 19th centuries, but . although suitable habitat has increased again, their numbers have . continued to dwindle, due partly to disease and road accidents, but . mainly to interbreeding with domestic cats. Douglas said: ‘If you let dogs run feral, people would be up in arms for a very good reason. Cats? They think it’s all right. ‘We don’t want to stop anyone having . cats, but we want to shut off the taps of more animals going to live a . feral existence and cross-breeding with wildcats.’ At risk:  The test, which could be ready by Christmas, would pave the way for further, much-needed wildcat conservation work .

"By . Steve Robson . Three mobile phone network is set to spark a price war among providers after pledging to offer customers ultrafast 4G services as a free upgrade. The company promised to make the recently unveiled 4G - said to run five times faster than the current 3G network - a standard feature on all smartprice plans when it is added to the network later this year. The move is a bold attempt to undercut competitors as EE - the only company which is currently able to offer 4G - is currently charging customers at least £5 a month extra for the service. Superfast: Three will be offering the 4G network on handsets including the iPhone 5, left, and the Samsung Galaxy SIII, right . Mobile wars: Three's decision not to charge extra for 4G is likely to spark more competition among providersBritain’s first 4G network was launched by EE in London and nine other cities in October last year. But currently users must pay extra for the service and also fork out hundreds of . pounds for a smartphone that can use the system, such as Apple’s iPhone 5 . or Nokia’s Lumia 920. Three will offer the service as standard with current price plans for an iPhone 5 on a monthly contract ranging from £34 to £44 a month plus up to £99 for the handset. A Samsung Galaxy SIII costs £29 to £31 a month plus up to £29 for the handset on the same type of contract. Dave Dyson, from Three UK, said: . 'As we add the next wave of technology to our Ultrafast network, we’ve . listened to our customers and thought long and hard about the right way . to do it. We don’t want to limit Ultrafast services to a select few . based on a premium price and we’ve decided our customers will get this . service as standard.' The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than the current 3G network. Cheaper? Price plans for the iPhone 5 with Three currently range from £34 to £44 a month on a pay monthly contract . EE customers who have upgraded to 4G packages pay anything from £36 to £56 a month based on the amount of data downloads they sign up for. Many other countries already offer the faster network and most providers charge around 20 per cent more for it. Three’s network covers 55 per cent of the UK population with an initial focus on 50 towns and cities, reaching 80 per cent population coverage by the end of March. Three customers able to benefit from the upgrade include those with the Apple iPhone 5, Nokia Lumia 920, Sony Xperia Z, Apple iPad mini and Apple iPad with Retina display. Device choice is growing rapidly with new ultrafast-ready LTE versions of the Samsung Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II being launched on Three within the next month, and the BlackBerry Z10 launching mid-February.","Currently only available on EE who charge at least £5 a month extra .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Brazilian scientists have developed a vaccine that could potentially prevent against HIV and plan to begin testing it on monkeys later this year. Known as the HIVBr18, the vaccine that could protect people from getting the virus that causes AIDS was developed and patented by a team from the Medicine Faculty of the University of Sao Paulo. The scientists said that, at its current stage of development, the vaccine would not totally eliminate the virus from the organism. This image shows a CGI impression of HIV (purple) within a person's blood stream. Brazilian scientists have developed a vaccine, called HIVBr18, that could potentially prevent against the virus. Researchers from the University of Sao Paulo plan to test it on monkeys later this year . However, it would be able to maintain it at a 'viral load low enough that the infected person will neither develop an immunodeficiency nor transmit the virus.' The Sao Paulo state Research Foundation (FAPESP), which is sponsoring the research, said the monkey trials are expected to last two years. Researchers plan to test their vaccine on a colony of rhesus monkeys provided by  Sao Paulo state's Butantan biomedical research institute. Professor Edecio Cunha Neto said: 'Our goal is to test various immunisation methods to select the one capable of inducing a stronger immunological response and thus be able to test it on humans.' Once the trials on monkeys have been completed, the researchers will then need to acquire adequate funding to support the first clinical trials of the vaccine on humans. Researchers plan to test their vaccine on a colony of rhesus monkeys, like the one pictured, provided by Sao Paulo's Butantan biomedical research institute. Rhesus monkeys were chosen for the test because their immune system is similar to that of humans. They are also susceptible to SIV (Simian immunology Virus) The research team including Cunha Neto, Jorge Kalil and Simone Fonseca began working on the vaccine in 2001. Rhesus monkeys were chosen for the test because their immune system is similar to that of humans. They are also susceptible to SIV (Simian immunology Virus), which is believed to have led to HIV when it crossed the species barrier. Earlier this year, Danish scientists began clinical trials on a new technique which involves . removing HIV from human DNA and then allowing it to be destroyed . naturally by the body's immune system. The scientists, based at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, say the possible cure would be affordable and would represent a dramatic step forward in the attempt to find a cure for the HIV virus which affects 33 million people worldwide.","The HIVBr18 vaccine has been developed by the University of Sao Paulo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Billionaire playboy Stewart Rahr has finally reached a divorce settlement with wife Carol. The jaw-dropping amount: $250 million. Carol will undoubtedly be walking away a happy, and very wealthy, woman. But many believed she would be even richer when news of the divorce first broke in December. The 43 year marriage began before the pharmaceutical mogul made his fortune, so many assumed the riches would be split evenly in the absence of any prenuptial agreement. Better days: Billionaire party boy Stewart Rahr seen here with ex-wife Carol. Carol recently received $250 million in their divorce settlement . 'Stewart always said he’d never get divorced because it would be too expensive,' a source told the New York Post at the time. 'They met when he didn’t have two cents to rub together. She could be entitled to half his $1.6 billion fortune.' That’s not how it went down, however. Though it surely hurts Rahr to peel off such a large chunk of change, he’ll remain in the rarefied ranks of America’s billionaires. The couple’s considerable real estate  assets will be split, however. According to the Post, Rahr will retain ownership of their Hampton’s estate, for which he paid a record breaking $45 million in 2005. Carol will keep their New York City pad, a $30 million unit in the Trump Park Avenue. Rahr, 67, was served with divorce . papers in late 2012 in front of the couples’ own home. Carol Rahr's . decision to launch divorce proceedings against her husband, follows . reports that the couple have been living increasingly separate lives in . recent years. His: In 2005, Rahr forked over the highest sum ever paid for a residence in New York for his 18,000 square foot Hampton's mansion. He kept the house in the divorce . Speculation . over how tempestuous the proceedings would become grew after it was . reported that Carol hired Robert Stephen Cohen, a divorce attorney . dubbed the 'pit bull’ who has previously represented the likes of . Christie Brinkley, Ellen Barkin, and Uma Thurman, and is famous for . playing tough. The Rahr's divorce settlement ranks among the highest of all time, but some even rank above it: . Those rumors were further fueled when . Rahr, in turn, hired attorneys Ben Brafman and David Aronson, whose firm . Aronson, Mayefsky & Sloan represented Katie Holmes in her . high-profile divorce from Tom Cruise. 'Mr . Rahr intends to act honorably and fairly,’ Brafman said when the . divorce was first reported. ‘He is hopeful and confident that the . parties will come to an amicable agreement and that despite ending their . marriage, will remain friends in the years ahead.' ‘I just have so few sunrises left and I want to be happy,’ Rahr explained to Forbes . after the divorce was announced last year. He said he believes . marriages should have clauses allowing them to be annulled mutually once . children reach adulthood. But . if years of reports of Rahr throwing tantrums, threatening violence, . and trying to buy his way into the ‘king of all fun’ title are to be . believed, the marriage may not have ended as mutually as Rahr describes. According to the New York Post, one . incident allegedly stemmed from a dispute between him and professional . gambler RJ Cipriani. Rahr allegedly pulled a gun on an elevator operator . at Trump Tower in New York after an altercation with the man. Hers: Carol gets to keep their palatial unit in Manhattan's prestigious Trump Park Avenue building . High places: Rahr's is a self-professed friend of Trump's and the socialite billionaire and self-professed 'Number One King of All Fun' claims a lot more celebrity connections . When police arrived, Rahr was found to have a gun, which was confiscated by officers. He claimed it wasn't loaded. And . in December, Rahr was banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after . the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he . didn't get his favorite table. Rahr reportedly sent an email complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent. He admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call. Star crossed: Rahr has a wall in his home where hundred of portraits of him with big name celebrities are hung . No bull: Last year, the testy Rahr was accused of threatening to kill the manager of Nobu restaurant in New York and then emailing his celebrity friends about the experience . It was reported that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, which occurred on the night of Carol’s birthday party, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent and CC'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix. It is unknown what, if any response, Rahr got from his celebrity crowd sourcing but his misbehavior did reportedly get him banned from all 25 international Nobu locations. Cheese: Rahr hugs Russell Simmons while wearing his signature glasses. Rahr's misadventures also include an alleged armed confrontation with a poker player in Las Vegas . Sweetheart: Though he's called Stewie Rah-Rah for his partying, he's also called generous for his giving and his philanthropy has even won him connections with the royal family . Philanthropist: Rahr, here with Jessica Simpson at an Operation Smile event, has even hosted charity events with guests like Bill Clinton, Ed Koch, and Mark Wahlberg . But Rahr appears to have a softer side, as well. His philanthropic activities, including large sum donations to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, have helped him to forge friendships with powerful figures such as Bill Clinton and Michael Milken. Singers Alicia Keys and Andrea Bocelli performed at his annual charity dinner. Rahr made his fortune selling wholesale pharmaceuticals. He sold the company he started and still wholly owned, Kinray Pharmaceuticals, for a reported $1.3 billion in 2010.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A seven-year-old boy on his way to school in a notoriously violent district of Cape Town has been shot and wounded, police said. A gunman opened fire on the first grader and a 17-year-old boy who was with him in the Elsies River suburb on Wednesday. They were both wounded and a 27-year-old man has been arrested over the shooting, which took place in an area plagued by gang violence. Cape Town is popular with tourists, but also has a darker side . Police recorded more murders in Cape Town - a popular tourist destination - than in Johannesburg and Pretoria combined between April 2011 and March 2012, according to the Mail & Guardian. In some instances, locals have taken matters into their own hands. Deadly: Armed violence in Cape Town is rife . In December last year vigilantes in Cape Town whipped and stoned to death a local ruffian after he was accused of raping a girl of 15 at knifepoint. A mob from the Crossroads township dragged the 32-year-old from a shebeen just yards from the victim's home after the alleged rape. They beat him with heavy whips before using rocks to finally bludgeon him to death. His body lay in the road for five hours before paramedics came to remove it. Communities in some areas are so unstable that the police have had to create patrolled safety corridors for schoolchildren to walk through, according to 9News. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, meanwhile, has called for the army to be deployed in the most violent Cape Town districts. Last August she wrote to Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, underlining the scale of the problem, the Mail & Guardian reported. She wrote: 'Principals at Manenberg schools say that absenteeism has increased dramatically due to ongoing gang violence... teachers at Sonderend primary school have reported that only about 200 of 900 learners attended school last week.'

This one is neither - and was was spotted in Kenya by wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein who says in all his 25 years in Africa, he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat. He says, unlike most zebra, it has never travelled with a herd and has a nasty temper if ever anyone gets close. Spot the difference: Zebras are normally social animals but appear to have banished this unusual specimen because of his spotty back . Remarkable: The zebra was pictured by wildlife photographer and safari guide Paul Goldstein who says in all his 25 years in the wilds of Africa, he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat . Paul first came across the animal a . couple of years ago whilst guiding in Kenya from Kicheche Camp, a set of . camps he owns, and has tracked its movements ever since. He said: 'This animal was on its own, extremely bad tempered and I could not get a shot. 'No-one . believed me when I told them of this remarkable phenomenon. This time, . on a long game drive in the Masai Mara I saw him again. 'He appears to have no mates and a lot of scars, however the differences are vast.

'Every zebra in Africa has slightly different markings, but this one has taken that to extremes.' Paul guides wildlife photographic holidays for Exodus all over the world, but specifically in the poles and Africa. Experts have come up with a variety of explanations as to why zebra have stripes. The stripey patterns that cover their bodies are as distinctive as human fingerprints and some scientists say they evolved in such a way to make it easier to recognise each other. Others say it is to confuse predators when they bunch into groups to avoid attack. And this year a group of scientists came up with the theory that zebra developed stripes to keep blood-sucking flies at bay after putting out different coloured models of horses in a field - one brown, one black, one white, and one with black-and-white stripes. The model with black-and-white stripes attracted the least number of flies.","The bizarre specimen was spotted wandering alone in Kenya's Masai Mara .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A magistrate has warned that Britain's 'soft touch' justice system will turn householders into vigilantes after his own home was torn apart by burglars. Abid Sharif, 36, said 'every man should have the right to defend his castle' after he returned home from picking up a pair of airline tickets to discover it had been broken into, trashed and looted of valuables including his wedding ring. During the daylight raid, a rear window was torn from off its hinges with a crowbar before the gang climbed into the house, breaking a dining table. Abid Sharif a magistrate from Burnley, Lancashire whose house was burgled in broad daylight said criminals 'just don't care' about offending . They tore doors off wardrobes and cupboards before stealing the gold jewellery, a watch and electrical goods including a PlayStation 3, a Sony laptop, a Samsung mobile phone and a digital camera. Mr Sharif later took pictures of the aftermath of raid which is said to have cost almost £10,000. Today the father of three, a bus driver who sits one day a week at Burnley Magistrates' court in Lancs said: 'The levels of policing have gone down since the cutbacks and that's crazy when you hear about these public service executives being paid thousands. 'People will naturally want to protect their property but I fear they will then become vigilantes and will probably get done in court for it. The street where Mr Sharif lives. The father-of-three said he believed the offenders were targeting his home for gold, following similar burglaries of Asian households . The mess left after the break in. Mr Sharif later took pictures of the aftermath of raid which is said to have cost almost £10,000 . 'If I had been in my house when these people came in and I had knocked one of them out I would be inside for assault and I don't think it's fair. Every man has a right to defend his castle and if we gave powers to the public I think the crime will drop. 'Within my job I see these criminals come before me and they seem to know more law than their solicitors about equal rights and human rights and they can get away with a lot of things. 'They know we can only give them a slap on the wrist, it's very frustrating for me - we want to throw the book at them but prison is regarded a last resort. 'We try fining them but then they say they can only pay £5 a week because they are on benefits. 'The laws have gone too lenient. In some cases everything points to custody but then they say they have medical problems and then they can't do paid unpaid work because they have a bad back. By the end its a conditional discharge. During the daylight raid, a rear window was torn from off its hinges with a crowbar before the gang climbed into the house, breaking a dining table . The other day there were 16 cases and 11 of those where burglary either from a shop or a dwelling. I know when I sit again and a case like this comes up and I will be frustrated. 'Obviously I cannot and will not take my frustrations out on others in court but sometimes we walkaway from court disheartened - especially when you see the criminals go away laughing.' It is thought the burglars had been circling Mr Sharif's neighbourhood in a car before stopping at his property and then knocking on his front door to establish he was not at home. Police are now examining CCTV footage of the raid which was captured by cameras at a neighbouring property. Mr Sharif whose wife was away in Pakistan at the time of the raid said: 'Obviously these criminals are not frightened and don't seem to care - given they just walked into my house off a busy road in broad daylight. 'I was out for less than an hour and when I came home about 2pm all the computer gear was on the floor. When I went upstairs, it was like a bomb had hit the place. 'The room was topsy-turvy, doors were hanging off, the bed was on its side, they had even used a knife and ripped the suitcases apart looking for gold. 'I even found a knife upstairs so they'd obviously been into the property with a knife. I'm just glad my wife wasn't in because they could have just barged past her and threatened her. I'm glad she didn't see it. 'CCTV cameras caught them outside the house in a blue Ford focus. They parked up and then an Asian knocked on the door and waited for about two or three minutes. 'The car was driven around and came back and another camera picked them up going on the backstreet. They were even pictured walking out of the property with the laptop and computer in their hands - it was sickening. 'They absolutely ransacked the place, it's very upsetting. 'I used to see a lot of police presence around here. Police cars would even be around at night time and you would feel safe - but it's not safe around here any more. 'The police presence used to be fantastic and you knew that there were there. Now I can't say that they are not doing their job right if they don't have the funding. 'We used to see a bobby on the beat every day and we used to know him. Now I don't know who the local bobby is. 'I think even the police are frustrated because they have such a high workload and different teams. When they should be out investigating a burglary they are stuck doing paperwork and can't do it. 'Victim support rang me up -but I don't want that. I want the police to find the burglars. I have since been sleeping in the back room since it happened in case they come in again.' Clive Grunshaw, Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire, said: 'Keeping people safe, especially those who are most vulnerable, remains my utmost priority. 'Both the Chief Constable and I remain committed to neighbourhood policing and recognise their vital presence in building safe and confident communities.'

"By . Helen Collis . A father who suffered from a mysterious agonising skin condition for two years has found it was caused by a banned toxic sofa he bought on eBay. William Harrington, 56, was delighted with his new reclining leather armchair, but had no idea it was from a highly poisonous batch of furniture that was also sold by Argos and the now-defunct World of Leather. Argos has recalled all the furniture, and in 2010 contributed along with 13 other companies to paying out £20million to customers who suffered painful burns. Poisoned: William Harrington 56, had been poisoned by a chair he bought on eBay two years ago . But Mr Harrington's case highlights there is a risk some sofas still exist, and are even being resold second-hand. Argos is now investigating to see if the seller had previously received compensation and knowingly resold the toxic sofa. For two years, Mr Harrington suffered painful sores and an itchy rash all over his body, but he had no idea what had caused it. He told his doctor: 'My whole body feels like it is on fire.' Mr Harrington, a father-of-five, was referred to a specialist who told him he had been into contact with a dangerously toxic substance. The property maintenance manager then discovered his armchair was from the batch of toxic chairs. The burns from the sofa were so severe Mr Harrington fell into a depression . Embarrassed: He said he was forced to hide his arms and legs for fear of offending people . The black leather recliner armchair had been withdrawn from shops after complaints of allergic reactions. But the eBay seller had failed to give Mr Harrington any warning when he bought it using the online auction website. Mr Harrington said: 'Every time I sat in that chair it was poisoning my body and I didn’t have a clue. 'The leather chair made my skin go all prickly and hot, I couldn’t stop scratching, it was like someone had set me on fire. 'The last two years of my life have been absolutely horrific. I can’t put into words what I’ve been through because of this chair. 'I’ve been so distressed with non-stop scratching that I ended up on anti-depressants. 'I have my own business and I have to cover my arms with bandages because I am so embarrassed at customers seeing the sores. They look so unsightly. 'I can no longer take my daughter swimming because I wouldn’t dream of letting anyone seem my body looking like this.' Now the sofa has been identified as the cause of his suffering, Mr Harrington has removed it from his house and his skin is starting to improve . Mr Harrington bought the chair off eBay and travelled down to Cornwall to pick it up from the seller. He developed a rash after returning the recliner to his home in Ely, Cardiff, but did not realise his chair was causing it - until solving the mystery after 18 months. No one else in his family was affected because it was his personal chair. Mr Harrington’s GP confessed he’d never seen anything like his rash before. He was prescribed steroid cream and referred to a dermatologist. He then realised his desperate need to scratch got worse when he sat in his favourite black leather recliner armchair. Mr Harrington went online - and discovered the chair was of the same sort withdrawn from circulation after a court action against Argos and other retailers which resulted in a £20million legal action over the poisonous furniture. He added: 'I bought the chair off eBay for £80. I didn’t have a clue this chair was going to cause me untold misery and distress. 'Argos needs to get a warning out there, these toxic chairs are still out there and being sold to unsuspecting victims. 'Thousands of people like me may be suffering terribly, and not knowing why. Just be careful what you buy on eBay.' The settees and chairs sold between £600 and £850 had been treated with a fungicide to stop them going mouldy in storage. They had been treated with Di-methyl Fumarate - a substance that has triggered violent irritant-related eczema in some people.

"By . Deni Kirkova . A morbidly obese veterinary secretary has lost the same weight as a baby elephant on a drastic diet. Kim Stock, 41, from Aylesbury, Bucks, weighed in at 26st 8lb and was too embarrassed about her size to go on holiday. Worried she wouldn't fit on the plane, at just 5ft 4"" in height Kim was a size 32 and had a dangerous BMI of 65. But now, Kim has been on a plane for the first time in a decade after shedding more than 15 stone. Kim Stock was 'super obese' and spent years struggling with her weight (l) and pictured after the weightloss . Kim from Aylesbury, Bucks, celebrated with her first flight abroad for 10 years last year with her fiance, system administrator Peter Nelson, 35. She said: 'The thought of asking for an extension to go around me or touching some stranger next to me because I overflowed the edges of my seat was mortifying, and the looks that this would accompany this stopped me from flying. 'This meant that I never had a chance to say goodbye to my nanny, who lived in Australia, in person - sadly, she died last year. She was my number one fan and followed my weight-loss progress with a keen eye. 'I've just had my first flight abroad to Portugal with my fiance, and it wasn't scary at all. There was loads of room in my seatbelt. I even took pictures to prove it.' Before her weight loss Kim was a size 32 and her BMI was a dangerous 65. But now she has lost nearly 16 stone, weighing 11 stone and fitting into a size 10. Kim said: 'People used to shout at me in the street. School boys would offer me ""more cake"", things like that. Kim was told one of the reasons she was struggling to fall pregnant was because of her weight . She wanted to lose weight to get married and be able to walk the dog without getting tired before he does . 'I was stuck in a vicious cycle. I would hide indoors and eat away the pain of being hated by random strangers. 'I had tried all sorts of diets in my 20s and early 30s but I never had the motivation to really stick with it.' Kim had always been a big child - a size 16 at just 16-years-old - and tried every diet growing up, but nothing worked and her weight continued to go up. She said: 'I tried all sorts - from calorie counting to the cabbage soup diet - and everything in between. 'I had some success but I could never get the motivation to stick with it.' In November 2011 Kim made a list of the reasons she wanted to lose weight, including wanting to get married and walking the dog without getting tired before he does. She went for a chat with her GP and decided to go on the Cambridge Weight Plan. Kim recently won the award for Biggest Loser at the Cambridge Weight Plan awards. Now she is making the most of being able to do simple tasks that others take for granted. Kim boarded a plane for the first time in a decade, pictured on holiday in Portugal after the weightless . Kim said: 'The first time I went into a high street shop at my current size, I picked something up thinking ""there's no way this will fit me"", but it did. 'I had to take it off and put it back on again twice just to believe it. 'It feels great to be buying clothes in mainstream stores that don't cater exclusively for larger sized people. Breakfast - Two bowls of cereal, muesli or porridge . Lunch - Sandwiches, pies, samosas or a jacket potato with chilli and cheese . Dinner - Spaghetti bolognese, lasagne, curry . Snacks - Chocolate and crisps . Breakfast - portion of porridge . Lunch - Soup . Dinner - Chicken with salad . Snacks - An apple . 'It's simple things that other people take for granted, like working on my garden and even just having a bath - I couldn't fit before so always had to have a shower. 'I lost the weight so quickly it look me a while to get used to being this size. I still struggle to pick out clothes that suit me so often a friend of mine will come too and help style me.' She says going on holiday wasn't scary at all, and she had plenty of room in her seatbelt .","Kim Stock, 41, from Aylesbury, Bucks, weighed in at 26st 8lb .

"By . Steve Doughty . Michael Irwin, a campaigner nicknamed Dr Death, claims to have helped at least 25 people who have died at Dignitas. He says an 83-year-old man wants to be the first person to die at the clinic solely because of dementia . An 83-year-old dementia sufferer plans to die at the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic, it was claimed yesterday. The British professional man would be the first to end his life at the Swiss clinic purely because of dementia. His plans were publicised by Michael Irwin, a campaigner nicknamed Dr Death, who says he has helped at least 25 people who have died at Dignitas and advised many more. Mr Irwin, 80, has been investigated in the past  over assisted suicide – an offence carrying a 14-year jail sentence – but has never been arrested. Around 150 Britons are thought to have died at the clinic, which exploits liberal Swiss laws on assisted dying. Among them were a number of people who . were not dying, notably 23-year-old Daniel James who was paralysed . because of a rugby injury, and musician Sir Edward Downes. The decision of a dementia sufferer to use Dignitas will alarm right-to-life and disability campaigners because of the implication that those with Alzheimer’s or similar conditions should consider killing themselves. The individual is said to be at an early stage of dementia and to have a report from a psychiatrist asserting that he is mentally competent to choose to kill himself. Dr Peter Saunders, of pressure group Care Not Killing, said once euthanasia was legalised in any circumstances ‘you inevitably end up widening the category of people to be included. This shows that if we were to change the law in this country there would be pressure to apply it to dementia patients’. The individual is said to be at an early stage of dementia and to have acquired a report from a psychiatrist which gives the opinion that he is mentally competent to choose to kill himself. Mr Irwin, a retired GP who used to be chairman of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, now known as Dignity in Dying, said: ‘This topic of old-age rational suicide should now be openly discussed.’ He said that attempts to legalise assisted suicide have concentrated on allowing the terminally ill to die at their own hands. ‘The severely disabled and the elderly with medical problems should be equally well discussed nowadays, especially with an ageing population,’ Mr Irwin said. ‘The desire to stop being a burden on one’s family and to avoid squandering financial resources perhaps better spent on grandchildren’s further education could become the final altruistic gesture, especially when combined with a wish to stop prolonging a life that is both futile and very unpleasant.’ Mr Irwin has acknowledged both that he has assisted in a number of suicides and that the people involved were strangers. These are factors which should ‘tend in favour of prosecution’, according to guidelines laid down by Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer. Mr Irwin has been investigated in the past, but never prosecuted. His critics believe he is trying to provoke a test case in order to generate publicity for his campaign group and his cause. The Dignitas clinic in Zurich, Switzerland . No-one has yet been prosecuted for assisting in a Dignitas death, and Mr Starmer’s guidelines introduced in 2009 appear to have made any prosecution less likely. Dr Peter Saunders, of Care Not Killing, said: ‘We have seen in European countries that have legalised euthanasia that once you allow it in any circumstances at all you inevitably end up widening the category of people to be included. ‘This case shows that if we were to change the law in this country there would be pressure to apply it to dementia patients - as is already happening in the Netherlands.","Michael Irwin says pensioner wants to die at Swiss clinic .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . One store owner from Georgia was so offended by customers with baggy pants that he decided to rile his patrons even more by posting a homophobic slur on a sign outside. The sign read, 'Pull your pants up or be proud to be a f@$,' and even though the owner Anil Patel is proud to has come up with the controversial catchphrase, many customers say they won't be visiting the PCA Food Store on Hogansville Road again. 'I couldn’t believe they put something like that up,' said customer Joshua Southern to WSBTV, who said he'll no longer visit the store. Owner of the PCA Food Store in Lagrange meant to deter baggy pants wearers from entering his store but he has offended some customers . Anil Patel, manager of PCA, says the sign was not meant to offend anyone. He says he hung it inside and outside the store because he was tired of customers coming in with sagging pants . 'There is other ways to deal with it. You could say, ""Pull your pants up. Nobody wants to see your butt, Southern said. 'I came up with that sign, nobody else did,' said Anil Patel. 'It doesn’t bother me, not a bit. I have a girlfriend and I am gay,' said Kerrie Williams, a clerk at the store who in un-phased by the sign. 'Since that sign went up there, I don’t see no pants down in my store, because they read the sign and they decide what they want to be.' WSBTV reports that late on Thursday night the owner's father pulled the signs down but the owner, who was out of town, said that he would put the signs back up. Some customers supported the owner and said things like '“Ain’t nobody want to see all that. I don’t want to see no grown man with they pants down.' The owner claims that even though his sign includes a gay slur, that he is not homophobic and the sign is not meant to offend gay people. 'It really offends me by them coming in, pants down. So it is not that I’m against them, gay people or anything like that, but just trying to prove a point. If you are going to come in my store, make sure you have your pants on,' Patel said. Patel is so proud of his sign that he plans to make and sell bumper stickers with the same saying. ""If you look at little kids walking around with their pants down, what are you trying to prove? What are you really trying to prove? You're disrespecting people,"" said Patel to WRBL.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A baby-faced teenager is the key suspect behind the software that was used in the massive security breach at Target over the holidays. As many as 110 million Target shoppers had their credit card details stolen after a computer program was written to collect the credit card details of shoppers. The data theft, unprecedented in its . scale, took place over a 19-day period that began the day before . Thanksgiving. Target said that it identified and resolved the issue on . December 15. Whiz kid: Security company IntelCrawler posted these Web images of 17-year-old Russian, Sergey Taraspov. It's believed he may be the architect of the malware that hacked up to 110 million Target customers . Soft target: Experts believe the hackers attacked Target's point-of-sale system, pulling customers' data directly from cash registers . Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking in to Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines. The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip -including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine. All the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks. It . is thought hackers obtained the data by remotely installing software on . 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores . nationwide. It's also thought the malicious software, or malware, has infected the payment systems of six other retailers too. The . firm, IntelCrawler, which has tracked the malware’s architect for . months, believes the main suspect to be a 17-year-old Russian. He’s . a 17-year-old with 'roots' in St.Petersburg, Russia, according to the report and conversations with . executives from IntelCrawler. IntelCrawler . CEO Andrew Komarov didn’t accuse the young man of the Target heist but . said he believes he developed the software used to skim credit card . numbers and other personal data from millions of Target shoppers. The malware, known as BlackPOS, has been downloaded at least 60 times since it was created, Komarov said. A Target investigation into the security breach which took place over the busy holiday period showed that the stolen information included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses . IntelCrawler . has alerted US authorities and Visa of the fresh attack targets, . Komarov said. The firm began detecting large-scale cyber attacks on . point-of-sale terminals across the U.S., Canada and Australia in early . 2013. The company is not aware of any non-U.S. retailers now being . attacked with BlackPOS software, Komarov said. The . CEO began investigating the malware case in March at the request of . banking clients and  pretended to be a 'bad actor' seeking to acquire . the BlackPOS software. The . architect was selling the malware for $2,000 a time, but offered . discounts to buyers who agreed to split the profits they reaped from the . product. After Target revealed that its massive security breach was due to BlackPOS, Komarov went back to track down the architect’s ID. The . Target attack has potentially compromised 40 million card accounts with . some 70 million shoppers’ email and other personal information also . stolen from a separate system during the security breach.

"By . Sara Malm . At least 36 people have been killed in a bus crash in Veracruz, southern Mexico, local authorities report. A passenger bus slammed into a broken-down truck and burst into flames shortly after midnight in the southeastern Mexican state. The victims were local businessmen and women, reportedly shopkeepers, who were travelling from the Tabasco state capital of Villahermosa to Mexico City, the state civil defense agency said. Tragedy: At least 36 people died whena passenger bus slammed into a broken-down truck and burst into flames near the town of Ciudad Isla in the Gulf state of Veracruz, Mexico . Both state and federal officials said that four people survived the crash, and have been taken to hospital. The agency's emergency director, Ricardo Maza Limon, said that all victims appear to have burned to death inside the bus. Pictures from the scene show the vehicle so badly charred that the tires have melted and the markings on its sides are unreadable. The federal highway department, which earlier gave the death toll as 34, said the bus was on a highway in the area of Acayucan when it struck a tractor-trailer owned by a milk protein company that had broken down and was parked along the roadside. 'The trailer-truck was on the shoulder of the highway at [135 kilometres] ... when the bus hit the back of the trailer, which caused this regrettable accident,' governor Javier Duarte told AFP. Accident: A further four people were taken to hospital following the crash, their condition is unknown . Forensic nightmare: The bus reportedly burst into flames shortly after impact, around 1am on Sunday morning . The victims were local businessmen and women, reportedly shopkeepers, who were travelling from the Tabasco state capital of Villahermosa to Mexico City . Struggle: Investigators say the state of the burnt-out bus will make it difficult to identify the victims . 'In addition to crashing, the bus caught fire, which makes the investigative work to identify bodies more difficult.' Federal police concluded that the truck was badly parked, the state government said. Via Twitter, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto sent a message of condolences to the families of those who died. The tragedy was a dark start to the Palm Sunday, celebrated as the start of Easter in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Bus crashes and road accidents occur frequently in Mexico, taking a heavy death toll each year. In 2012, at least 43 people died when a truck hit a bus in Veracruz, and just a couple of months later more than 30 others were killed in a separate accident in Guerrero state.","Bus with 'local businessmen' caught fire after crashing into truck .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Officials have announced improved public safety measures for the final two miles of the Boston Marathon April 21, a year after two explosions near the finish line killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. Mayor Martin Walsh and Police Commissioner William Evans Saturday said more uniform and undercover officers will be deployed along the marathon's Boston route. Authorities also have installed more than 100 cameras along the Boston portion, together with 50 observation points that will help monitor the crowd. Safer city: Boston officials have announced that more uniform and undercover officers will be deployed along the route of the marathon this year . Boston's finest: There will be a large police presence through the week leading up to race, starting with a memorial service Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the attack . Thirteen ambulances will be deployed, together with 140 emergency medical service workers on foot patrol, bicycles, utility vehicles and in medical tents. Officials urge spectators to leave backpacks, strollers and other large items at home. There will be a large police presence through the week leading up to race, starting with a memorial service attended by Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the attack. ‘It will be the Boston Marathon as it has always been,’ Mayor Martin Walsh said during a press conference in front of city hall. ‘Our goal is for everyone to enjoy the race.’ Walsh said the city has prepared extensive security measures for preventing as well as responding to emergencies. The two ethnic Chechen brothers suspected of planting the bombs at the finish line were identified using footage taken from security camera. Watchful: More than 100 cameras have been installed along the Boston portion of the course, along with 50 observation points to monitor the crowd . One of the brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gun battle with police several days after the attack while the other, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is awaiting trial. Officials also emphasized that increased security will be found not just at the finish line, but along the entire course. Though all major marathons are a challenge to secure, given the 26.2 mile spread, the Boston Marathon's route through eight municipalities makes it all the harder for security officials to coordinate protocols. Horror at the race: Two explosions near the finish line killed three people and wounded more than 260 others during last year's marathon . Preparations are also under way to help those affected by the bombings last year cope with feelings that might be triggered by the anniversary, officials said. ‘The first anniversary of a disaster is always difficult,’ said Barbara Ferrer, director of the Boston public health commission.","More than 100 cameras have been installed along Boston portion of the course, along with 50 observation points to monitor the crowd .

"By . Associated Press . As millions of Americans race to meet Tuesday's tax deadline, their chances of getting audited are lower than they have been in years. Budget cuts and new responsibilities are straining the Internal Revenue Service's ability to police tax returns. This year, the IRS will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s. Taxpayer services are suffering, too, with millions of phone calls to the IRS going unanswered. The chances of Americans getting audited is the lowest it's been since the 1980s . 'We keep going after the people who look like the worst of the bad guys,' IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in an interview. 'But there are going to be some people that we should catch, either in terms of collecting the revenue from them or prosecuting them, that we're not going to catch.' Better technology is helping to offset some budget cuts. If you report making $40,000 in wages and your employer tells the IRS you made $50,000, the agency's computers probably will catch that. The same is true for investment income and many common deductions that are reported to the IRS by financial institutions. But if you operate a business that deals in cash, with income or expenses that are not independently reported to the IRS, your chances of getting caught are lower than they have been in years. Last year, the IRS audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals, the lowest rate since 2005. This year, Koskinen said, 'The numbers will go down.' US taxes are due this Tuesday and many are scrambling to finish all of the paperwork . Koskinen was confirmed as IRS commissioner in December. He took over an agency under siege on several fronts. Last year, the IRS acknowledged agents improperly singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status from 2010 to 2012. The revelation has led to five ongoing investigations, including three by congressional committees, and outraged lawmakers who control the agency's budget. The IRS also is implementing big parts of President Barack Obama's health law, including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance. Republicans in Congress abhor the law, putting another bull's-eye on the agency's back. The animosity is reflected in the IRS budget, which has declined from $12.1 billion in 2010 to $11.3 billion in the current budget year. Obama has proposed a 10 percent increase for next year; Republicans are balking. Rep. Ander Crenshaw, R-Fla., chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the IRS budget, called the request 'both meaningless and pointless' because it exceeds spending caps already set by Congress. The IRS also is implementing big parts of President Barack Obama's health law, including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance . Koskinen said he suspects some people think that if they cut funds to the IRS, the agency won't be able to implement the health law. They're wrong, he said. The IRS is legally obligated to enforce the health law, Koskinen said. That means budget savings will have to be found elsewhere. Koskinen said he can cut spending in three areas: enforcement, taxpayer services and technology. Technology upgrades can only be put off for so long, he said, so enforcement and taxpayer services are suffering.Last year, only 61 percent of taxpayers calling the IRS for help got it. This year, Koskinen said he expects the numbers to be similar. To help free up operators, callers with complicated tax questions are directed to the agency's website. 'The problem with complicated questions is they take longer,' Koskinen said. Your chances of getting audited vary greatly, based on your income. The more you make, the more likely you are to get a letter from the IRS. Only 0.9 percent of people making less than $200,000 were audited last year. That's the lowest rate since the IRS began publishing the statistic in 2006. By contrast, 10.9 percent of people making $1 million or more were audited. That's the lowest rate since 2010. Only 0.6 percent of business returns were audited, but the rate varied greatly depending on the size of the business. About 16 percent of corporations with more than $10 million in assets were audited. Your chances of getting audited vary greatly, based on your income. The more you make, the more likely you are to get a letter from the IRS . Most people don't have much of an opportunity to cheat on their taxes, said Elizabeth Maresca, a former IRS lawyer who now teaches law at Fordham University. Your employer probably reports your wages to the IRS, your bank reports interest income, your broker reports investment income and your lender reports the amount of interest you paid on your mortgage. 'Anybody who's an employee, who gets paid by an employer, has a limited ability to take risks on their tax returns,' Maresca said. 'I think people who own their own business or are self-employed have a much greater opportunity (to cheat), and I think the IRS knows that, too.' One flag for the IRS is when your deductions or expenses don't match your income, said Joseph Perry, the partner in charge of tax and business services at Marcum LLP, an accounting firm. For example, if you deduct $70,000 in real estate taxes and mortgage interest, but only report $100,000 in income. 'That would at least beg the question, how are you living?' Perry said. Koskinen said the IRS could scrutinize more returns - and collect billions more in revenue - with more resources. The president's budget proposal says the IRS would collect an additional $6 for every $1 increase in the agency's enforcement budget. Koskinen said he makes that argument all the time, but for some reason, it's not playing well in Congress. 'I say that and everybody shrugs and goes on about their business,' Koskinen said. 'I have not figured out either philosophically or psychologically why nobody seems to care whether we collect the revenue or not.'","Taxes are due on Tuesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Louisiana man whose frantic arrest was captured on a video that has gone viral said he was wrongfully arrested, while authorities maintain he was taken into custody for resisting an officer. Donrell Breaux, 26, of River Ridge, was arrested after refusing to provide identification and then attempting to go inside his residence, according to Col. John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. But Breaux said he feels the arrest was unlawful and questioned the relationship between the responding deputy and the neighbor with which he had a dispute, according to New Orleans newspaper The Times-Pacayune. 'I knew he (the deputy) was a personal friend (of the neighbor) and I thought it was an unlawful arrest,' Breaux said. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The moment a Louisiana police officer pushes into a man's home and arrests a man can be seen on a YouTube video, which has viewers claiming police brutality . The man in the video, Donrell Breaux, 26, can be heard continually telling the officer he is scared and doesn't know why he is being treated in such a way . River Ridge police released a statement over the video, saying they believe the officer involved acted in a correct and lawful manner . 'I don't have to submit to an unlawful arrest.' Part of the encounter was recorded by Breaux's friend, Eric Banegas, and posted on Facebook on April 1 and YouTube soon after. It has been shared than 37,800 times. The incident occurred in the 200 block of Marmandie Avenue in River Ridge. A resident called 911 just before 3 p.m. to report that a man at a neighboring home was cursing at him, Fortunato said. The resident told the responding deputy that he was sitting outside with his wife and children when he overheard people at the residence using profanity. He said a man later identified as Breaux began directing 'profanity-laced sentences' at him and his wife and children after he asked them several times to stop, Fortunato said. In addition to the profanity, the neighbor told the responding deputy that he could smell marijuana coming from the area where Breaux was standing. The deputy went over to Breaux and Banegas' residence with the intention of issuing a misdemeanor summons, Fortunato said. But he, too, smelled marijuana as he approached. The deputy asked for identification and told the deputy he might have I.D. inside and turned to enter the house, according to Fortunato. 'After he refuses to present I.D. and tries to go into the house, now (the deputy's) going to do a physical arrest as opposed to a misdemeanor summons,' Fortunato said. Breaux attempted to close the door on the officer and the two briefly struggled before Breaux was taken into custody, according to the Sheriff's Office. But Breaux said he and Banegas were just cracking joke among themselves when the neighbor came outside and told them to watch their language, prompting a brief verbal confrontation. He said the neighbor regularly calls police over minor issues, such as too many cars in the driveway. Breaux said the officer immediately tried to arrest him and had handcuffs at the ready, which is when Banegas started filming. He was eventually booked at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna with battery of a police officer, resisting arrest with violence, and disturbing the peace by using offensive, derisive or annoying words, according to an arrest report. He was released on a $6,250 bond.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A deadly mosquito that hasn't been seen in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1970s has been detected south of the city, with officials warning residents to eliminate standing water and take other precautions. The county's vector-control agency has again issued a warning that a potentially dangerous mosquito was found, this time on April 10, in the vicinity of the Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery at Santa Cruz and Avy avenues in Menlo Park, San Mateo County. The insect - known as Aedes aegypti - is a tiny black-and-white mosquito that bites during the day and is know to carry yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya and encephalitis viruses, . This species has been detected at 13 locations in 2014, the first time on Jan. 22, and all near the cemetery, officials say, according to local paper The Almanac. The Aedes aegypti mosquito - which was eradicated from San Francisco in 1979 - has been detected once again. The tiny insect, which - unlike other mosquitoes - bites during the day, can carry yellow fever, dengue fever, chikungunya (a fever) and encephalitis viruses . This mosquito is not native to California, but has also been found in Fresno and Madera counties. There have been no reports of illness so far, and the viruses have not been detected in California, the statement says. 'Our goal is to eradicate this mosquito population,' says Robert Gay, the local district manager. 'We are doing everything to help ensure this mosquito does not become established in our communities.' In 1979, district agents eradicated the Aedes aegypti from San Mateo County when it was discovered near San Francisco International Airport. The Aedes aegypti lays its eggs in water in small containers such as pots, pet bowls, bird baths and bottles. 'It's important for residents to survey their yard and (areas) around their house to eliminate even the smallest amount of standing water,' officials say. The tiny insect has been detected at 13 locations near this cemetery in Menlo Park since January this year . Closer view of an Aedes Aegypti mosquito (dengue feverr vector). Dangerously, its sting can be quite painless and often goes unnoticed . To reduce the chances of being bitten, the district recommends using insect repellants containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR 3535; checking window and door screens for tight fits; eliminating any standing water from around the home; wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants; and shielding children with mosquito nets over infant carriers, cribs and strollers. In Brazil, a company has been hired to release counterforces of genetically-modified mosquitos to kill the Aedes aegypti, due to the spread of dengue fever. The mosquitoes are all non-biting males that have been modified to carry two genes that makes them and their progeny dependent on the antibiotic tetracycline, the absence of which in the wild will prevent the next generation from reproducing.","Aedes aegypti is a tiny black-and-white mosquito that bites during the day .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A 16-year-old Detroit boy charged with assault and a hate crime over the brutal mob beating of a motorist last week, is being held on a $400,000 bond. The teenager, who has not been identified, is the only one of five males charged in the April 2 attack on Steve Utash to face an ethnic intimidation count. Utash, 54, is white, and the teenager and four adults charged in his beating are black. Circuit Court Referee Raeigen Woods said at the teen's hearing today that a high bond was necessary given the serious nature of the mob attack which left Utash in a medically-induced coma. Utash emerged from the coma yesterday, but remains in a critical condition. Attacked: Family members said Steve Utash, pictured with wife Starr, is now off the ventilator and is able to breathe on his own following his vicious April 2 beating . Crime scene: Steve Utash was beaten outside this gas station when he stopped after knocking into a child . Fox News reported that defense attorney Sterling Coleman asked the court for a substantially lower bond. 'He is not charged with a capital case and should not be given the same as those charged in a capital manner,' he said at Wayne County juvenile detention center today. 'He is not a flight risk. Both parents are in his life. They presented him to the police.' Prosecutors however argued the teen should be held on a $500,000 bond given to the other four males, particularly as he admitted he was the first to throw punches. Utash was punched and kicked by five people as he stopped to check on 10-year-old David Harris, who was struck when he stepped in front of Utash's pickup truck. Deborah Hughes, a nurse who lives in the . neighborhood, rushed to help the boy and stopped the mob from continuing . to beat Utash, police said. Utash, a tree trimmer, suffered severe . head injuries, while David Harris, the boy he ran into, was treated for a leg and other injuries. Police quickly ruled that it had been an accident. 'It was determined that the driver of the vehicle wouldn't have had any . chance of stopping,' a Detroit police spokesman told Mail Online. Hero: Deborah Hughes helped save Steve Utash's life when she stepped between him and his attackers . Family members announced yesterday that Utash finally came out of an induced coma. His daughter Mandi Emerick, who started a GoFundMe page to cover her dad's medical bills, said Utash is now off the ventilator, but experiences horrible flashbacks. 'Sometimes he can look at me and remember who I am and other times he can't. Today when I asked him how old he is he said ""I'm two years old"" but he did know his name,' she wrote. 'He does keep saying ""I don't want to die I'm sorry"" and ""please don't let me forget you"". He also keeps flashing back to the assault screaming for ""HELP"" and ""PLEASE GET THEM OFF ME"". He didn't seem to know what happened to him or why he was in the hospital.' More than 100 people, including hero Deborah Hughes, gathered at a prayer service for Utash at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday night. 'No matter how long I'm here I will not have a more special day than the day I go with you and your family to talk with your father, Mayor Mike Duggan said, according to MLive. Healing vigil: Deborah Hughes (center) sat with Utash's family members at a prayer service, attended by hundreds of people, at Historic Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday . Vigil: Steve Utash's family members thanked the crowd who gathered at Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit on Thursday for their support and their prayers for racial peace . In relation to the April 2 assault, the 16-year-old was the only one of the alleged attackers charged with a hate crime. 'In the case of the 16-year-old charged . as a juvenile we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of . assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation,' Kym Worthy, Wayne County's prosecutor, said. 'In the case of the four . adult defendants that have been charged, the facts and the evidence does . not support a charge of ethnic intimidation.' Latrez Cummings, 19, was charged Thursday with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm. Bruce . Wimbush Jr., 17; Wonzey Saffold, 30; and James Davis, 24, were . arraigned this week on the same charges and are being held in the county . jail on $500,000 bonds pending preliminary examinations on April 21. Arrests: From left, Wonzey Saffold, James Davis, and Bruce Wimbush Jr face assault with intent to murder charges . In hospital: Steve Utash's family say he is now breathing on his own, can remember some people's names and flashes back to the vicious assault . Loving father: Steve Utash pictured with daughter Mandi Marie. He was brutally beaten by a gang . The Go Fund Me page set up for Utash, who has no health insurance, has already raised more than $168,000. His family, who are keeping a bedside vigil, said on the site: 'It is so hard to see him (Utash) like this...Thank you all so much, your words mean more than you know.' State representative Brian . Banks said Utash did not deserve to be attacked. 'Mr . Utash did the right thing by stopping to help a child in need and, . appallingly, was punished for doing so,' he said. 'People should not be punished for doing the right thing.' On the mend: David Harris, 10, is expected to make a full recovery after being hit by Steve Utash's vehicle .","Five males have been charged with beating Steve Utash, 54, into a coma .
