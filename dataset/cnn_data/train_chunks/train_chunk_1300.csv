"Swansea are set to open contract talks with Ki Sung-Yueng as Aston Villa’s interest in the South Korea midfielder builds. Villa and Sunderland are keen on the 25-year-old, whose current deal expires at the end of the forthcoming season. But Swansea are keen to retain Ki and Sportsmail understands that negotiations over a new contract will take place ahead of the new season. Back in Wales: Ki Sung-Yeung is back in Swansea gear as he prepares for the new season back at his club . A second chance: Ki tries to take the ball from Plymouth's pre season game as part of Gary Monk's preparations . Ki has had a mixed spell in south Wales since joining from Celtic in a deal worth £5.5million in 2012. It is understood that his signing was more the choice of the club than Michael Laudrup, who was manager at the time. Irrespective, he occasionally impressed during his first season, before being sent out on loan in the last campaign where he excelled at Sunderland. A fine World Cup has also increased demand, but Swansea manager Garry Monk wants to keep Ki at the Liberty Stadium. Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said earlier this month that a long-term contract was on the club’s agenda. ‘Ideally, we would like to tie Ki up on a long-term contract,’ he said. ‘There’s no hiding from that. ‘Garry Monk has spoken to him already, but it’s important that they have another chat and we will decide on where we go after that.’ Meanwhile, Pablo Hernandez’s move to Qatari side Al Arabi has been delayed as the clubs continue to haggle over the transfer fee. The move is not thought to be in danger. Loan ranger: Ki spent time at Sunderland where he impressed after an up-and-down year at Swansea City .

"Arsene Wenger has hit back at critics of record signing Mesut Ozil. Arsenal's £42.5million man was poor as they were taken apart by Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in midweek, but Wenger has defended the forward and insists he has every faith in him. 'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent,' said Wenger. Arsene Wenger speaks to the media ahead of Arsenal's weekend fixture against Aston Villa . Mesut Ozil of Arsenal looking dejected during a poor display in midweek in the Champions League . 'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen. 'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help. 'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.' It has been suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the right, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue. 'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. 'If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch. 'Why should be be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1. Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what? 'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game.

He has an exploration of his ankle tonight and they go in and look how the ligament is damaged, and after that we know if he does need surgery.

"FBI agents raided the house of a reputed Connecticut mobster suspected of having information about the 1990 robbery of a Boston museum that remains the largest art heist in history. More than 20 agents in haz-mat suits examined a car in the driveway, searched a wooded area and removed boxes of evidence from the ranch-style suburban home of 75-year-old Robert Gentile, who has been detained since February on federal drug and weapons charges. During the heist of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, rare works from masters such as Rembrant, Degas, and Vermeer were stolen, sometimes cut from their frames. Scroll down for video . The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . No stone unturned: An agent in a haz-mat suit searched Gentile's Buick; . but they found nothing in connection with the art heist, only two guns . Teeming: Both local police and FBI were present at Gentile's home all day yesterday . During the 1990 robbery, thieves disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St. Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet. The stolen art is worth more than a half-billion dollars. Despite a $5million ‘no questions asked’ reward by the museum, countless searches, and intense media coverage, no one has been charged in the heist. A lawyer for Gentile, A. Ryan McGuigan, told the Associated Press that the FBI returned to his client's property in Manchester, just outside Hartford, because the agency had a new warrant allowing the use of ground-penetrating radar to look for buried weapons. Underground clues: Agents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . Thorough: An agent ruffles through the contents of the shed in Gentile's back yard . Mr McGuigan said he believes agents are really looking for stolen paintings but will find no such thing. 'This is nonsense,' he said. 'This is the FBI. Are you trying to tell me they missed something the first time? They're trying to find $500 million of stolen artwork... All they're going to find is night crawlers,’ though he later added that he believes authorities had recovered two weapons. According to the Boston Globe, officials brought in some non-human helpers as well, using two beagles and a ferret to search for possible weapons. Irreplaceable: Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . One neighbour told the Globe that the elderly Gentile lives a quiet life with his wife. ‘They are very nice people, very quiet people,’ they said. A federal prosecutor said in March the FBI believes Gentile had some involvement with stolen property related to the 1990 heist. Gentile has not been charged in the art robbery and Mr McGuigan says his client does not know anything about it. A U.S. attorney's office spokesman declined to comment. A message left with an FBI spokesman was not immediately returned. Heist of the century: The thieves also made off with Degas' La Sortie du Pelage . Dutch Master: The thieves stole two Rembrandts -  The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black (right) Gentile was arrested three months ago on a charge of selling illegally obtained prescription painkillers. Federal agents say they seized three revolvers, numerous rounds of ammunition and home-made silencers during a February 10 search of Gentile's home. Gentile was arraigned last month on weapons charges. He leaned on a cane as he slowly rose before a judge in federal court in Hartford to plead not guilty to three charges. Mr McGuigan called him an ‘old man in poor health,’ according to the Hartford Courant, and accused federal prosecutors of ‘poling’ charges on him in hopes of finding a lead in the missing artwork case. His attorney says authorities first approached Gentile about the heist two years ago and, when he offered no information, they dispatched an undercover witness to buy prescription drugs from him. In progress: Left, Degas' Three Mounted Jockeys, and right, a self-portrait of Rembrandt . Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . The museum continues to offer a $5 million, no-questions-asked reward. Gentile's lawyer says that if he were some type of arch-criminal, he would have figured a way to get the reward money. Prosecutors say Gentile is a member of a Philadelphia crime family. His lawyer denies the mob allegation. However, Gentile was convicted of larceny in 1996. Convicted felons may not possess firearms or ammunition that have been transported across state lines or from overseas. Federal law also prohibits possession of a silencer unless it's been registered. Each of the three weapons charges carries a maximum prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000. Authorities say FBI agents have had unproductive discussions with Gentile about the art theft. The Courant reports that Gentile was deemed a threat to public safety by a federal judge, and will be held without bail while he waits for trial.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes his side's slow start to the Premier League season is partly down to the club having to sign 'a lot of new players' as they look to compete on four fronts this season. The Reds have lost two of their first four Premier League games so far this season, but Rodgers believes it's just a matter of time before his players click into gear. He said: 'We've had to bring in a lot of new players this summer because of the Champions League. Naturally that takes a bit more time but I've been really pleased with the way everyone has settled in. We've got players adapting to different counties.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (centre) orchestrates a game of football tennis during training which Fabio Borini (left) and Martin Skrtel take part in . 'We will just continue to work hard. The players have got great qualities but it will take a bit of time for that to show through. There's no magic formula it's just time.' 'Our form last year was incredible but we were not playing like that this time last year. The players need to settle.' Rodgers also admitted that his side 'weren't at the level' he expects as they crumbled to a 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa last weekend. Liverpool were beaten by a first half strike from Gabriel Agbonlahor last Saturday as Rodgers' side failed to convert a number of chances at Anfield.

He added: 'Last week against Aston Villa we weren't at the level we expect in the final third. 'They defended well and got the result, but we move on. In reflection, beating Ludogorets was a very good result, even if maybe people thought we'd win more comfortably. Southampton's good form has shown how well we did to beat them, and we were outstanding against Tottenham. 'The international break came at a bad time for us and we lost some of our players, which upset our rhythm, but we'll continue to work hard.' Rodgers has also given his backing to misfiring midfielder Philippe Coutinho after the Brazilian's disappointing start to the season. The 22-year-old has started three of the Reds' four league matches but last weekend's defeat to Aston Villa was the first time he completed 90 minutes, while he was also taken off in their Champions League win over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets.

In Liverpool's best performance so far - the 3-0 win at Tottenham - Coutinho was left on the bench throughout and the early part of the campaign has seen him fail to showcase the talent he has displayed intermittently since his arrival in January 2013. However, Rodgers has no doubt about the Brazilian's quality or ability. 'He's a brilliant young player, a fantastic young player,' he said. 'I had planned to leave him out of the game against Aston Villa because he'd had a lot of travelling in the international week, and if we didn't have so many injuries he would have been given a rest on the side and then played in the Champions League game.

We had to play him, but it was great for him and his experience getting back into the Brazilian squad. 'I've got no qualms about him; he's a big, big talent. He has lit up the Premier League since he came to the club. 'He's going to have some games where he won't be at his best, but he always gives his best and that's all I ever ask of the players.

"Photoshopping an image may seem like a modern phenomenon, but the idea of making quick edits to images dates all the way back to the 1940s. Created 68 years ago, a contraption known as Adam’s Retouching Machine was the precursor to current photo-editing tools and involves a retouching pencil and a magnifying glass. It weighs two-and-a-half stone (16kg) and was invented and patented in 1946 to give photographers the opportunity to perfect their pictures with relative ease. The Adam's Retouching Machine (pictured) was invented and patented by Colorado-based Harry LeRoy Adams in 1946. It is used to retouch negatives prior to developing the photograph. The negative is placed on top of the green cloth in the centre of the device and pictures are backlit by a fluorescent tube inside the machine . Instead of uploading images to a computer, photographers would place their negative under the magnifying glass. Blemishes in the picture could then be smoothed out by using the retouching pencil, assisted by gentle vibrations of the machine. The Adam's Retouching Machine was used to retouch negatives before developing the photograph. The negative is placed on top of the green cloth in the centre of the device, and the is backlit by a fluorescent tube. With the aid of an in-built magnifying glass, the photographer can examine the negative and smooth out skin blemishes or alter any imperfections with a special pencil. The machine slowly vibrates to make the pencil work as smooth as possible. The high-end equipment would have sold for $2,300 (£1,435) in today's money. Created by inventor LeRoy Adams, of Denver, Colorado, an example device was recently restored by American photographer and vintage camera store owner John Sargent Barnard. The 27-year-old, from San Francisco, California, purchased the retouching machine for $5 (£3) on an online auction site. He said: ‘I had never seen anything like it and when I researched the machine, not much came up. ‘As a professional photo retoucher myself, I was fascinated by it.’ The Adam's Retouching Machine was used to retouch negatives prior to developing the photograph.

The 27-year-old, from San Francisco, California, purchased the retouching machine for $5 (£3) on an online auction site and only had to replace the light (dimmer switch pictured) in order to get the gadget working again . Mr Adams' patent (pictured) was filed in March 1946 and was it awarded in June 1947 . The machine slowly vibrates to make the pencil work as smooth as possible. The high-end equipment would have sold for $2,300 (£1,435) in modern-day money. Mr Adams filed a patent for the device in March 1946 and it was awarded in June 1947. The filing said: 'This invention relates to a device for use in retouching photographs. 'Photographic retouching is done by highly skilled operators who work over the blemish spots on a negative with a retouching pencil. '[This] consists of a plurality of microscopic, overlapping check marks or loops which must be so small and so uniform that they will not become apparent on an enlarged print from the negative. 'The principal object of this invention is to provide means for automatically forming these small, microscopic check marks so that retouching will require less skill and less time.' Mr Sargent Barnard said: ‘The hardest part when restoring the machine was the amount of dirt and filth. ‘I spent a few hours just removing crud from all over. 'Although afterwards, it still looked like it had been in someone's basement for 50 years. ‘The wiring was all really well done and fired up right away. 'The only thing was the light was busted, and so I had to buy a new one.' Mr Sargent Barnard attempted to use the machine, but admitted he was unable to master the technique required to produce a picture perfect photo. After restoring the Adam's Retouching Machine, Mr Sargent Barnard sold the device (pictured) to a collector in New York for an undisclosed fee . Photoshop (iOS app pictured) is a software used to make edits and add filters to digital photographs . ‘Only speciality retouchers had this machine, and photographers would often outsource this because the process could take up to six hours. ‘I am not sure how popular it was because only retouchers would have it, hence the lack of information that we have to this day.’ Mr Sargent Barnard attempted to use the machine, but admitted he was unable to master the technique required to produce a picture perfect photo. ‘I tried to use the machine myself but I just ended up ruining the negatives and scratching them. ‘I did not have the right pencil to do the job, plus my hands aren't steady enough for it, it seems like you have to be quite surgical with this machine.’ After restoring the Adam's Retouching Machine, Mr Sargent Barnard decided to sell the device, a a collector in New York for an undisclosed fee. ‘Everyone thought I was a bit crazy when I bought the device. 'People said that it looked like a giant paperweight,’ continued Mr Sargent Barnard. ‘I thought it would be a great collector's item for someone's photography studio. 'In the end, a gentleman in New York City bought the piece. 'However, I am not sure what he used it for.’","The Adam's Retouching Machine was invented and patented in 1946 .

"A Pennsylvania newlywed couple who lured a stranger to his death through a Craigslist ad were sentenced to life without parole Thursday. Addressing Miranda and Elytte Barbour in court, a judge said they must be permanently removed from society. Neither defendant displayed any emotion Thursday in Northumberland County Court in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as the victims' relatives expressed anger and pain over the slaying. Scroll down for video . Their fate is sealed: Elytte Barbour, 22, and his wife, Miranda, 19 (pictured outside court Thursday) have been sentenced to life without parole for luring a stranger to his death through a Craigslist ad . Slain: Troy LaFerrara, 42, was stabbed 20 times by Miranda Barbour while her husband choked him with a cord . However, Elytte Barbour, 22, apologized, but said he could not explain his actions. The defendant appeared in court with what appeared to be a new teardrop tattoo on his right cheek - a symbol often used by criminals to signify that they had killed someone. They pleaded guilty last month to second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence, in a plea deal that ruled out the death penalty. Troy LaFerrara was answering an ad offering companionship when he was attacked in 19-year-old Miranda Barbour's vehicle November 11. Police say she stabbed him 20 times while her husband held a cord around his neck. The sentencing comes three weeks after the Barbours pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the November slaying of Troy LaFerrara. New ink: Mr Barbour appeared in court Thursday (right) with a teardrop tattoo on his cheek, which had not been seen during his past court appearance (left) Notorious: Miranda Barbour boasted in April about killing at least 22 other people during her involvement with a satanic cult . The couple married in North Carolina and moved to central Pennsylvania about three weeks before they met up with the victim, Troy LaFerrara, when he accepted her offer of companionship on Craigslist in exchange for money. Miranda Barbour picked up LaFerrara at a mall in Selinsgrove on November 11 and drove in her car to Sunbury, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. After they parked, Elytte Barbour came out of his hiding place under a blanket in the back seat and held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck while his petite wife stabbed the 6-foot-2, 278-pound man about 20 times. They dumped his body in an alley. Elytte Barbour later told police the couple killed LaFerrara, 42, because they wanted to kill someone together. Mother: Miranda Barbour is pictured right in her mug shot and left with her baby son . Natural-born killer: Miranda Barbour said in a jailhouse interview that she belongs behind bars because she does not want to hurt anyone else . Happier times: The killer couple bwith their young son in tow blended into the crowd at a fair last year . Miranda Barbour initially denied knowing LaFerrara, who was from Trevorton, but changed her story when police gathered records that showed the last call to his cellphone came from hers, authorities said. Elytte Barbour admitted his involvement a few days later after police obtained video surveillance recordings that showed him getting out of her car on the night of the killing and buying supplies to clean it. In April, Miranda gained fleeting national notoriety when she said in an interview with Sunbury's The Daily Item newspaper that she had killed at least 22 other people in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California over six years as part of her involvement in a satanic cult. But checks by police failed to substantiate her claims. At a court hearing last month, LaFerrara's widow wept as the judge questioned Miranda Barbour about her plea. His sister, Holly LaFerrara, said the family was satisfied with the double plea deal. Tragic couple: Troy LaFerrara, 41, pictured with his wife, Colleen, on their wedding day in 2011 . In an interview from Muncy State Prison in August, the 19-year-old, who has a young son, told the newspaper she believes she belongs behind bars. ‘I don't want to hurt anyone else,’ she said at the time. When asked during her sentencing Thursday is she wanted to address the court, the 19-year-old mother of one simply said: 'no.' Her husband, however, appeared contirte and begged forgiveness for his role in the bloody slaying, reported The Daily Item. 'There are no words to say how sorry I am for committing this act,' said Barbour. 'I wish I knew what was running through my head that night. 'I don’t know if I ever will know and if I could go back I know I would not have done this. 'I regret taking this man from his home. I hope they can find it in their heart to forgive me for my sins.'","A judge said Miranda and Elytte Barbour must be permanently removed from society .

"As the wife of the Prime Minister, she has undoubtedly stood alongside some of the country’s most powerful and influential women. But last night, Samantha Cameron found herself next to one of the most inspirational. Mrs Cameron honoured mother-of-one Naomi Thomas as she was named the overall winner of the Daily Mail’s seventh annual Inspirational Women of the Year Awards. Scroll down for video . From left, Susan Belgrave, Jeanette Orrey and winner Naomi Thomas with Samantha Cameron and Sir Bruce Forsyth, Janis Feely and Pat Rogers . The 31-year-old, who is terminally ill with secondary breast cancer, was invited to 10 Downing Street before a gala dinner at the Marriott Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square. Mrs Thomas received the award in recognition of her work setting up a charity to plan weddings for the terminally ill. Mrs Thomas, from Somerset, was first diagnosed with the disease in 2009, two days after becoming engaged to her partner, Graham. Just six days after their son was born in 2010, she was told the cancer was incurable. The couple were forced to give up work to cope with the demands of the illness, meaning the wedding they booked had to be cancelled. However, a local wedding planner then offered to help arrange a ceremony as cheaply as possible, inspiring Mrs Thomas to set up The Wedding Wishing Well Foundation. Mrs Cameron honoured mother-of-one Naomi Thomas as she was named the overall winner . Mrs Thomas was joined at Downing Street by Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce Forsyth and the four other finalists in the awards, held in association with British Gas and homeless charity Shelter. After the reception, the women went on to the awards ceremony, where the winner was announced by Sir Bruce. He paid tribute to the finalists as he arrived on stage, saying: ‘This has been one of the most emotional nights I have been to.’ After being named as the winner, Mrs Thomas said: ‘I have worked unpaid for so many hours each week. If I can save one person, I have done my job. I have got my husband and my son, I couldn’t ask for any more.’ Mrs Thomas was joined at Downing Street by Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce Forsyth and the four other finalists in the awards .

"Radamel Falcao is in line to make his Manchester United debut against QPR this weekend following his deadline day transfer. The Colombian striker joined on a season-long loan deal from Ligue 1 side Monaco as Louis van Gaal looks to bolster his attacking options. As the 28-year-old prepares for his Premier League debut, here is a selection of his best goals to whet your appetite. Like our Manchester United Facebook page . Radamel Falcao is set to make his Manchester United debut after a season-long loan move from Monaco . Radamel Falcao only spent one season at Monaco after a big-money move from Atletico Madrid . Porto 1-0 Braga, Europa League final - May 2011 . A scrappy Europa League final at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin was settled by the Colombian's header just before half-time. Falcao adjusted his body by flinging his legs in the opposite direction, and guiding a header into the top corner. Atletico Madrid 4-1 Chelsea, UEFA Super Cup - August 2012 . The next three are in no particular order, but they were all special. Falcao scored a hat-trick to help his team brush aside the Champions League winners. His first was an excellent chipped finish past Petr Cech into the far corner, beyond the reach of a scrambling David Luiz. Radamel Falcao put Chelsea to the sword with a hat-trick in the UEFA Super Cup in 2012 . Atletico Madrid 4-1 Chelsea, UEFA Super Cup - August 2012 . In the 18th minute, Falcao doubled his tally and Atletico's lead on the night. He cut inside Ashley Cole onto his left foot and picked a spot in the top far corner beyond Cech's reach. Radamel Falcao curls in his second goal past Ashley Cole and out of Petr Cech's reach . Atletico Madrid 4-1 Chelsea, UEFA Super Cup - August 2012 . Falcao completed his hat-trick just before half-time with a clinical finish. His first touch left Ramires - who is no slouch - trailing in his wake before slotting the ball home under Cech in front of the ecstatic Atletico fans at Monaco's Stade Louis II. Barcelona 4-1 Atletico Madrid, La Liga - December 2012 . Although Barcelona came back to record a resounding victory, Falcao gave an experienced defence all kinds of problems in the first half. He threathened with a header that hit the post early on before latching on to a through ball and rolling his shot wide of the far post. But, on the half hour mark, Falcao left Sergio Busquets trailing in his wake before an exquisite chip over Victor Valdes to give Atletico the lead. America Cali 1-2 Atletico Madrid, friendly - May 2012 . This goal came on Atletico's mini tour of Colombia at the end of the 2011-12 season. It needs little explaining. A corner came in, and Falcao smashed it into the top corner with a stunning scissor kick. Porto 4-1 Maritimo, Portuguese League, April 2010 . Another one that needs little explaining. The striker shows just how athletic he is by thumping an overhead kick into the far corner. Monaco 2-1 Lyon, Ligue 1 - October 2013 . After soring seven goals in his first seven Ligue 1 games for Monaco, Falcao entered the match against Lyon at Stade Louis II on something of a drought by his lofty standards. He had gone three games without a goal, but scored the winner against Lyon with another brilliant chip that left goalkeeper Anthony Lopes completely stranded. That goal is No 1 on the following video... Falcao's top five goals for Monaco in 2013-14. Porto 5-1 Villarreal, Europa League - April 2011 . Porto trailed 1-0 at half-time in this semi-final showdown, but mounted an excellent response in the second half at the Estadio Do Dragao. Falcao scored four of his team's five second-half goals, including a diving header where he flew through the air and picked his spot in the bottom corner. Atletico Madrid 4-2 Valencia, Europa League - April 2012 . Falcao looked to have lost his way after cutting inside having initially been set free with a through ball. But the Colombian took another touch to get the ball out of his feet before firing into the top corner, with the help of the crossbar, from outside the penalty area.","Radamel Falcao set for Manchester United debut against QPR .

"In 2010 Sister Christine campaigned to have anti-Christmas posters put up in the area by Muslim radicals removed . A nun has torn down a black and white flag similar to one championed by Muslim extremists from the gates of a London housing estate and branded those who hoisted it up as 'naive young hotheads'. The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, three days ago as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign. Sister Christine Frost, 77, a nun who works at a nearby church, said she asked some friends to help take the flag down early this morning using a stepladder out of fear it could be seen as 'aggressive' or 'insensitive'. Anti-extremist campaigners said the raising of the black flag was a 'provocative' act and undermined legitimate anger about the crisis in Palestine. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called it 'extremely inappropriate'. But the Roman Catholic nun, who has worked helping the elderly in the area for the last 40 years, denied the flag was put up to show support for radical jihadists. Speaking yards from the gate today outside St Matthias Church, she insisted there was not any anti-Semitic sentiment on the estate and said the 'issue has been taken out of proportion.' 'There's no way they would have thought it was to do with ISIS,' she said. 'I couldn't believe it had been up for two weeks. I believe it means 'There is no other God but Allah. 'The problem is that it has been adopted by ISIS. 'It's as ridiculous as saying the St George's Cross is a symbol of the BNP. 'It's exactly like with the Union Jack and the BNP supporters. It's nothing to do with being British. They're just young hot heads, naive. 'I'm Irish and its as ridiculous as saying that I represent the IRA.' Sister Christine, who in 2010 campaigned to have anti-Christmas posters put up in the area by Muslim radicals removed, continued: 'The issue is aggression and insensitivity. It could be seen to be aggressive. 'I'm not sure that if I put up a Christian flag it wouldn't be upsetting to some people.' It is not clear who raised the flag on the Will Crooks Estate - named after the  noted Victorian-era anti-poverty campaigner and then Labour MP - but it has caused offence. Scroll down for video . The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign . Scotland Yard sent officers to the estate this morning, although flying a flag of this sort is not illegal in Britain. The black and white flag has the Shahadatayn - the declaration of faith that all Muslims say - written on it, which translates as 'There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God'. But in recent years versions have been hijacked by extremist supporters of the Taliban, Hamas, al-Shabaab, Al Qaeda and ISIS. A local resident, Nijam Miah, 57, said: 'They're young boys who dont know what they're doing. They have hot blood and they're playing with fire.' One man who objected to it says he was confronted by a gang of youths who asked him: 'Are you a Jew?'. When he said: 'Would it make a difference?' they responded: 'Yes it f****** would', according to the Guardian. Patrol: Police have been walking the Will Crooks Estate to calm any tensions. It is not clear who raised the flag on the Will Crooks Estate - named after the noted Victorian-era anti-poverty campaigner and then Labour MP - but it has caused offence . Gone: The local council today visited to remove the black flag hoisted above this Palestinian flag, but it was already gone - taken down by Sister Christine . Mystery: A gang of youths are said to have confronted someone who complained about the flag and asked him: 'Are you a Jew?' As news spread across the estate, Muslim men spilling out of a nearby Mosque rounded on reporters as they spoke to residents about their view on the inflammatory gesture. The group's anger was directed at reports that terrorist-sympathisers had raised the flag similar in style to that used by terror group Isis alongside Palestinian flags. The five journalists said they were threatened by some in the group of Asian men aged between late teens and early forties. Snatching one reporter's notepad a man who had a young boy with him said: 'You better leave here before we do something to you. Go now, we don't want you around here.' Two locals stepped in to calm the men down and one said: 'The people who caused these problems will be explaining themselves. 'It has caused us a lot of trouble, it has made us all look like violent terrorists. 'But the message on that flag and another here now are very similar, they just look different. 'They are just Islamic slogans that are used by all Muslims in praise of Allah.' Speaking outside his flat where a large Palestinian flag hung from a bamboo cane student Mohammad Rasheduzzaman, 25, said: 'I'm protesting for Gaza, they're humans not animals. 'All the people here support Gaza. Muslim and Christians are a family on this estate, we are protesting against Israel. 'Some people call it a jihadi flag or a terrorism flag. It's not, it's just a sign of Islam. It says there is no god but Allah. Sunni Muslim Faisal Islam, 44, lives with his wife and five children on the estate. The shop worker said: 'Until now there has never been a show of any anger, but I think it has been below the surface. 'There is a big Muslim community here, who are all angry about what is happening in Gaza. I'm happy to support that. 'But putting up a flag could cause us trouble, it will give Sunnis a bad reputation. 'It might cause trouble between people here on the estate or it will encourage bad people to come here from somewhere else . 'This is generally a safe place for them, we don't want extreme people talking to our kids'. Controversial: Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman raised the Palestinian flag outside his headquarters but Jewish leaders told him to concentrate on 'potholes and bins' Counter-terrorism think tank the Quilliam Foundation has called the decision to raise the flag 'provocative' and 'worrying'. A spokesman said: 'This is not the flag of the so-called Islamic State (formerly ISIS), but the black flag with the shahadatayn (Muslim declarations of faith) written in white is known as the rayah, a symbol that has been adopted by Islamists in the last 25 years. Since the Bosnian conflict, it has been increasingly adopted by jihadist organisations. 'It is a provocative move by those who have put up the flag as they will well know its significance. 'Many geopolitical conflicts and humanitarian crises in the Middle East get adopted as 'Muslim causes' and subsequently get manipulated by myopic Islamist narratives. 'It is worrying that legitimate grievances surrounding Gaza and the plight of the Palestinian people are combined with jihadist symbols'. Tower Hamlets Council has admitted it received complaints about the flag but when they arrived to pull it down it was already gone. A council spokesman said: 'The council can confirm that following reports this morning of a flag erected on the Will Crooks Estate, council officials took steps to remove it but found it had already been taken down by Sister Christine Frost, a well-known local activist and promoter of community cohesion. The flag was removed following concerns that it could cause community tension. 'The council welcomes the removal of this flag. We have consistently demonstrated that there is no place for hate in Tower Hamlets, whatever form it takes. We take decisive action to ensure people's actions do not affect the strong community cohesion that underpins Tower Hamlets. 'This borough's community is proud to act as One Tower Hamlets and the council and its partners will always act to preserve and promote this united spirit, including removing any unauthorised flag on public space.' The council's controversial mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked a storm of protest last month to after raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall 'in solidarity with Gaza'. Mr Rahman ordered the flag to fly 'in support of a ceasefire and peace'. Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts. Pro-Palestine supporters also blocked the nearby Blackwall Tunnel, waved flags and yelled slogans in a protest days later.","The flag was put up outside Poplar estate as part of pro-Gaza campaign .

"Exactly a year from Thursday, England will line up against Fiji in the opening encounter of a home World Cup which has the potential to profoundly galvanise the sport. The national team are steadily on the rise as a global force, but the All Blacks remain the benchmark for all other countries as they prepare to defend their title, and the balance of power is still in the south, with the European teams continuing their perennial quest to close the gap. Stuart Lancaster will have the pressurised honour of orchestrating the hosts’ challenge and he senses that the primary factor will be the drive and focus among his players, in front of their own people. ‘To win the top games you need a whole variety of different qualities – technical, physical, mental – but ultimately you need motivation,’ he told England Rugby TV. ‘You need to think, “What’s the reason I am going to play for this team? Why is playing for this team special?”. England captain Chris Robshaw leads the charge in the quest to win the World Cup on home turf . Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup . ‘You need to pull that together and create an extra 10 or 15 per cent in a player that can take him to a place where he’ll put his body on the line but also work harder than he has ever worked before. That motivation is not a little part of the jigsaw – it’s a big, big part of the jigsaw. It’s the difference sometimes between winning and losing.’ It's 365 days until the World Cup kicks off . Lancaster is convinced that the English public will inspire his team and that they in turn can inspire the country, adding: ‘The support people have for sporting events in this country now is better than anyone’s in the world. ‘I think the fans feel they are supporting a team that is young and ambitious, that wants to have a go and I think the players respond likewise and it becomes a virtuous circle. The players love playing at Twickenham, the fans hopefully love watching the team play and I think that is hugely important. ‘We have worked hard on talking about the identity of being English. You have to have character to be an England player; a strong sense of purpose, never take a backwards step, always delivering under pressure, a level of commitment that is probably above and beyond what most people would expect and a resilience that means we are a very difficult team to beat. Alongside all that, you need those world- class players.’ With 12 months to go until the World Cup begins, here is how the leading eight nations are shaping up for the tournament… . England . IRB ranking: 4 . Key man: Manu Tuilagi - midfield game-changer . There has been notable progress under Lancaster, but the crucial requirement this season is to fine-tune the primary starting XV and establish tangible momentum. Up front, the pack possess ominous strength in most areas, although Graham Rowntree would still welcome another pedigree tighthead prop. The set piece is largely reliable, but the breakdown work can be hit and miss – captain Chris Robshaw is under pressure on that basis. Manu Tuilagi during June's tour of New Zealand - the marauding centre is England's X-factor . Behind the scrum, there are many half-back options, but midfield and the back three are areas to resolve. Prolific, consistent, reliable wings are in short supply and No 12 remains a conundrum. England wish to play a more expansive game, but they cannot do so until they are settled and confident. Lancaster needs three wins in the autumn and, ideally, a Six Nations title to generate serious momentum, but his team will be combative and fear no-one at home. French prop Thomas Domingo is a scrum menace . FRANCE . IRB ranking: 7 . Key man: Thomas Domingo – master scrummager. A total shambles. Philippe Saint-Andre bemoans the abundance of foreigners in the Top 14 league. But the head coach still has sufficient players of Test quality to call upon, such as the magnificent Thierry Dusautoir in the back row and a pair of sensational centres – Wesley Fofana and Gael Fickou. ‘Les Bleus’ have been abject in the Six Nations in recent years and they were a rabble in surrendering 3-0 to the Wallabies Down Under in June, but – as ever – there is no knowing when they may suddenly ignite. History suggests they can emerge from their dire state to be a threat. IRELAND . IRB ranking: 5 . Key man: Jonathan Sexton – attacking ring-master. Joe Schmidt has been in charge for one season and his team marked it with a Six Nations triumph, to give the great Brian O’Driscoll a fitting send-off. Life after the iconic centre will be difficult – it is not just a matter of replacing the player but also filling the inspiration void. Yet, Ireland’s first assignment without ‘BOD’ led to a 2-0 win in Argentina, which is no mean feat. They must hope that their other veteran talisman has enough left in him to be a force at the World Cup. There are Lions in all areas, an improved scrum and ball-carrying clout, and Schmidt provides astute tactical nous. Ireland fly-alf Jonathan Sexton (right) will be pulling the strings in a largely classy green machine line-up . SCOTLAND . IRB ranking: 8 . Key man: Stuart Hogg – rare ‘X-factor’ back. Kiwi coach Vern Cotter has a huge task on his hands to make the Scots competitive at next year’s tournament. In the last Six Nations, they scored just 47 points in their five games – highlighting a chronic lack of attacking menace. Their 20-0 home defeat against England was the shocking nadir, but Cotter led his side to summer wins over the USA, Canada and Argentina, before a weakened team were routed by the Springboks. Not enough depth, especially in the backs, but positive results for Edinburgh and Glasgow may provide renewed belief. Samoa are a threat to their qualification from Pool B. Stuart Hogg has the capacity to produce something special but his Scotland lack depth under Vern Cotter . WALES . IRB ranking: 6 . Key man: Sam Warburton – groundhog captain. How they need a major southern-hemisphere scalp this autumn. Warren Gatland has turned his team into regular masters of this continent, but against the SANZAR giants they are in a prolonged losing rut. The Welsh issue is a lack of belief – they had South Africa by the throats in Nelspruit in June, but conspired to lose the Test. Doubts remain over best choice at 10 and Gatland can’t afford many injuries due to lack of elite cover in some areas. Veteran props may be in decline, but overall their best XV has ample bulk, pace, power and experience for tough Pool A battles. Wales' fearless leader Sam Warburton is dynamic at the breakdown but they need a scalp from the south . AUSTRALIA . IRB ranking: 3 . Key man: Israel Folau – main running threat. Mixed signals are emerging about the strength of the Wallabies revival under Ewen McKenzie. They managed to prevent a Kiwi world record for consecutive Test wins by drawing with the world champions in Sydney, only to promptly ship a half-century of points in Auckland a week later. Then they beat the Springboks but laboured to dispatch Argentina. Folau is a lethal presence out wide, but their controversial stars are either peripheral – in the case of Quade Cooper and Kurtley Beale – or overseas – in the case of James O’Connor. Up front, they continue to lack set-piece clout and mighty flanker David Pocock is missed. Israel Folau is a destructive runner but inconsistency is becoming the hallmark of Ewen McKenzie's Wallabies . NEW ZEALAND . IRB ranking: 1 . Key man: Kieran Read - world’s best player. Steve Hansen’s All Blacks are imperious. Their dominance of the world game goes on unchecked. England gave them a fright in June, without managing to end their long spell of home rule which now extends to 36 Tests. They have lost just once since the last World Cup and continue to thwart the chasing pack. Despite doubts about veterans such as captain Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Tony Woodcock, new sensations keep emerging. Julian Savea is the try-scoring phenomenon who provides the finishing class to capitalise on clinical counter-attacking and unsurpassed skill levels. New Zealand have a gear no other side possesses. New Zealand's blindside flanker Kieran Read stands among an All Blacks side in a class of their own . SOUTH AFRICA . IRB ranking: 2 . Key man: Eben Etzebeth – rookie enforcer. Seemingly the best equipped of the challengers to All Blacks supremacy, as they are armed with deep reserves of powerful players who believe they are the pre-eminent rugby nation. They have lowered the New Zealand flag at junior level of late and must hope the habit pervades the senior ranks soon. Eben Etzebeth i a young star for the Springboks, who have the weapons to trouble the All Blacks . On their day, the Springboks generate forward fury which no country can handle – as England found out in Johannesburg two years ago, while Willie le Roux is a gloriously unorthodox attacking presence. What they need now is conviction from coach Heyneke Meyer about the best strategic approach. Muddled thinking is hampering the Boks.","A year from Thursday, England face Fiji in the World Cup opener .

"Niko Kranjcar bounced back from two brutal tackles to spoil Mark Hughes’s homecoming party. The Croatian, who Harry Redknapp loves so much he’s signed him four times, embedded himself further in the manager’s affections with an 88th minute equaliser. It will be viewed as a point won for QPR but two points lost for Stoke who led twice and had opportunities to seal victory. Mame Biram Diouf scores his second Premier League goal of the season (the other a spectacular solo effort) to put Stoke City ahead against QPR at Loftus Road . Rio Ferdinand did not enjoy the most successful afternoon at Loftus Road, and was beaten by Peter Crouch in the air as the forward provided the assist for the opener . QPR equalised just before half-time, a corner was met by summer signing Steven Caulker whose header, with the help of a deflection, found the back of the net . QPR (4-3-1-2): Green 6; Isla 5, Caulker 6.5, Ferdinand 5, Traore 6; Mutch 6 (Henry, 49 6.5), Barton 5 (Phillips 34 6), Fer 7; Kranjkar 8; Vargas 6, Austin 5 . SUBS: McCarthy, Phillips, Onuoha, Henry, Dunner, Hoilett, Zamora . Stoke (4-2-3-1): Begovic 6.5; Bardsley 6, Shawcross (c) 5.5, Wilson 6, Pieters 5; Whelan 6, Nzonzi 5; Diouf 7, Adam 5, Moses 8; Crouch 7.5 . SUBS: Sorensen, Huth, Muniesa, Arnautovic, Sidwell, Assaidi, Krkic . Referee: Martin Atkinson. Redknapp was full of admiration as he revealed the 30-year-old took a ‘massive pay cut’ to come back to West London, where he also spent last season on loan. Kranjcar, who played under Redknapp at Portsmouth and Tottenham, is thought to have sacrificed £6million in wages over two years from Dynamo Kiev. ‘He took a massive cut in wages,’ said Redknapp. ‘We pay a third of what he was earning in Ukraine. He had a massive, fantastic contract in Russia and he just wanted to come back here and play football. It’s very rare to see a boy do that.’ There was a sense of justice in Kranjcar’s goal after he was twice brutally and illegally felled, first by Ryan Shawcross, then by Steve Sidwell, whose lunging challenge resulted in a free kick just outside the Stoke area — prime Kranjcar territory. The midfielder, who had come close from range several times, fired into the top right corner. ‘He scores those in training all the time,’ said Redknapp, ‘He’s a class player and it was a great free kick after two bad challenges. He punished them.’ There was a sense of justice in the goal for Kranjcar who was twice bullied to the deck, first by a bruising Ryan Shawcross tackle, then an illegal Steve Sidwell challenge which resulted in a free kick from 20-yards, prime Kranjcar territory. Both Crouch and Charlie Adam attempted to clear Steven Caulker's header but, ultimately, the poor communication led to Crouch poking it into his own net . Crouch again gets the better of former Manchester United defender Ferdinand, losing his marker and sweeping home a Victor Moses cross to restore the lead . Just as QPR seemed to be heading for defeat, Niko Kranjcar's excellently-placed free-kick levelled the score with just minutes remaining . MINS  KM   MILES . QPR total                                     104.8    65.1 . Niko Kranjcar                          90    10.5     6.5 . Steven Caulker                       90    10.4     6.5 .

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . The striker, who had come close from range several times, fired it into the top right corner. Harry Redknapp burst out of his dugout in celebration leaving a stony faced Hughes to rue what could have been. After pulling off an extraordinary victory at Manchester City earlier this season, Hughes was vying to do the double over his former clubs by winning at Loftus Road. It was an intimidating atmosphere for the 50 year old, returning for the first time since being sacked by owner Tony Fernandes in 2012. Some QPR fans perceive the financial and confidence problems the club currently faces as being a hangover from Hughes's 10 month stint here. The game was just two minutes old when chants of ‘stand up if you hate Mark Hughes’ echoed round the loveable old ground. He nearly had the last laugh through goals from Mame Biram Diouf and Peter Crouch. Crouch showed he is defying the calendar better than Rio Ferdinand, who was not as incisive in defence as he is in his recent acerbic autobiography. The 33-year-old striker, not known for his searing speed, outsprinted his former England teammate and minutes later controversially used him as a climbing ladder to assist the opening goal. Victor Moses employed what Ferdinand might call silky skills to wrong foot Mauricio Isla and send his cross arching into the box. Crouch flicked the ball on for Diouf to head home from six yards out. Moses, who wreaked havoc down the wing, set up Crouch with a peach of an opportunity to extend Stoke’s on the half hour mark but his long limbs got in the way and he could not get his shot on target. QPR had the majority of possession in the opening 20 minutes but lacked the nous to make the most of it. Their most significant chance was Kranjcar’s sweet left footed shot from 28 yards out which whistled over the crossbar. Mauricio Isla, the Chilean full-back on loan from Italian champions Juventus, tussles for the ball with Stoke City's Victor Moses, who is on loan from Chelsea . Eduardo Vargas made his home debut for Queens Park Rangers after coming on as a second-half substitute against Manchester United in the 4-0 defeat at Old Trafford . But QPR captain Joey Barton didn't last long, Harry Redknapp subbed him off mid-way through the first half after the former Marseille man picked up an injury . Their breakthrough came on 42mins when Crouch helped Steven Caulker’s goal into the top corner of the net, getting in the way of teammate Charlie Adam who was poised to make a goal line clearance. QPR’s two new imports from Cardiff teamed up for their goal. Caulker, bought from Cardiff for £8m this summer, got on the end of a cross from Jordon Mutch, heading towards the bottom right corner from close range. Moses was again on point for the second goal, opening up the QPR defence like his biblical namesake parted the red sea. The Nigeria international shrugged off Isla and his pinpoint cross found Crouch, unmarked in the box and able to direct into the goal with his right foot. Stoke, who hold the unwanted record of being the team last on Match Of The Day the highest number of times, did everything to ensure a shake up in the running order, with exciting counter-attacking football and QPR contributed with persistent attacking. ‘The overriding emotion is disappointment,’ said former QPR boss Hughes. ‘We allowed them back into the game and it should have already been too far away from them.’ Despite a questionable record that has seen QPR relegated once before under Harry Redknapp, the R's manager revealed he was likely to sign a new contract soon . Peter Crouch demonstrated a rare turn of pace to beat Rio Ferdinand down the line and compound the former Manchester United man's terrible afternoon . Mark Hughes was not given a warm reception upon his return to QPR, he recently described his time there as his toughest period as a manager .

Vargas, on loan from Napoli, failed to impress at Loftus Road with Redknapp admitting that the Chilean does not speak a word of English .

"Nani scored his first goal since joining Sporting Lisbon on loan from Manchester United, but it wasn't enough to beat Maribor in their Champions League clash. The 27-year-old winger thought he'd won it for Sporting but some catastrophic defending from the Portuguese side let their opponents back into the game . Maribor substitute Luka Zahovic pounced on an embarrassing defensive blunder from  to rescue a 1-1 draw in stoppage time against in their  Group G opener. Nani scored his first goal for Sporting Lisbon since arriving on loan from Manchester United . The 18-year-old Slovenian forward headed home a loose ball in the second minute of injury time after Sporting’s centre-back pairing fluffed clearances in a panicked attempt to hold on to a lead given them by Nani’s devastating strike. The Manchester United outcast had cut in from the right in the 80th minute and drilled a left-foot shot into the bottom corner in the game’s one moment of outstanding quality. It looked enough to give Sporting the points before the Slovenian champions hit back on their return to the Champions League group stages after 15 years away. Sporting thought they had won the game but some terrible defending allowed the hosts a late equaliser . Sporting dominated possession and territory but were wasteful going forward - epitomised by Nani’s mixed overall performance - and Maribor will feel as though they deserved something out of the game. Had their finishing been more clinical, especially that of Brazilian striker and captain Tavares, the home side could have emerged with even more at the Ljudski stadium. Tavares was a powerful presence throughout for Maribor, though Nani was also denied by a sharp save from Jasmin Handanovic who kept out his half-volley. Both sides had hit the woodwork in the first period. First Sporting’s Andre Carillo clipped the crossbar with a right-foot curler before Maribor defender Aleksander Rajcevic thundered a header on to the base of Rui Patricio’s post from a brilliant free kick by Dare Vrsic. 18-year-old Slovenian forward Luka Zahovic headed home a loose ball in the second minute of injury time .","Nani scores first goal for Sporting Lisbon since joining on loan .

"Liverpool enjoyed a winning return to Champions League football by beating Ludogorets, Arsenal were comfortably beaten by Dortmund and Real Madrid strolled to victory over Swiss champions Basle. Here, Sportsmail brings you the results from the other Champions League matches. OLYMPIACOS 3-2 ATLETICO MADRID . Olympiacos got their Champions League campaign off to a winning start as they recorded a 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid in the Group A clash at Karaiskakis Stadium. Arthur Masuaku opened the scoring for the hosts and Ibrahim Afellay doubled their lead after 31 minutes before Mario Mandzukic pulled one back for Madrid before half-time. Kostas Mitroglou made it 3-1 midway through the second half before Antoine Griezmann struck for last season’s beaten finalists at the end. Kostas Mitroglou scored his ninth goal in 13 Champions League games to help Olympiacos beat Atletico Madrid . JUVENTUS 2-0 MALMO . Juventus forward Carlos Tevez ended his Champions League goal drought with both goals in the 2-0 defeat of Malmo. The Italian champions had struggled to make an impact until Tevez ended a 14-match wait for a Champions League goal with his eye-catching strike just before the hour mark in this Group A opener. Tevez then made sure of the victory in the 89th minute, curling home a fantastic free-kick from just outside the penalty area. Carlos Tevez scored as Juventus overcame a slow start to beat Swedish side Malmo 2-0 in Turin . VIDEO Allegri delighted with Tevez impact . BENFICA 0-2 ZENIT ST PETERSBURG . Zenit St Petersburg made the ideal start to their Champions League campaign as two first-half goals set them on their way to a comfortable victory at 10-man Benfica. Hulk opened the scoring as early as the fifth minute and the home side’s hopes of getting back into the contest appeared remote when goalkeeper Artur was dismissed for a professional foul. Former Benfica midfielder Axel Witsel then doubled Zenit’s lead midway through the half and although the Russian side could not add further misery to their opponents, they ensured they began Group C with an important away victory. Andre Villas-Boas got one over on his old rival Jorge Jesus as Zenit St Petersburg beat Benfica 2-0 . MONACO 1-0 BAYER LEVERKUSEN . Joao Moutinho’s second-half goal ensured Monaco’s return to the Champions League after a 10-year absence ended in victory against Bayer Leverkusen at the Stade Louis II. Monaco, back in the Champions League group stages for the first time since the 2004/05 season, were second best for much of the contest but Moutinho’s 61st-minute goal settled the match after Leverkusen had wasted a number of chances to take the lead. The 1-0 victory gives Leonardo Jardim’s side an encouraging start to Group C action ahead of a difficult trip to Saint Petersburg to face Andre Villas-Boas’ Zenit side in a fortnight’s time. Monaco overcame a terrible start to the domestic season to beat Bundesliga table-toppers Bayer Leverkusen . GALATASARAY 1-1 ANDERLECHT . Galatasaray striker Burak Yilmaz netted a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Anderlecht a first away Champions League win for nine years in a 1-1 Group D draw in Istanbul. Anderlecht - who have finished bottom in all seven group stage campaigns since they reached the last 16 in 2000/01 - looked to be on course for a hard-earned victory after taking the lead early in the second half through Dennis Praet. Aleksandar Mitrovic missed a great chance to make it 2-0 moments later, which ultimately proved costly. Galatasaray - now under the guidance of former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli - grew stronger during the closing stages and were eventually rewarded when Yilmaz crashed home following a powerful run by Aurelien Chedjou to earn the hosts a share of the points.

"A dog had to be rushed to vets for emergency surgery - after he almost killed himself by eating too many pairs of his owner’s silk thongs. Kaye Banks, 47, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was horrified when her pet Brian was unable to digest his food – so she took him to a vets, who found her underwear in his stomach. Staff at Abbey Vets in Barnsley carried out an emergency two-hour operation to save the four-year-old Samoyed’s life - and after four days, he was deemed well enough to return home.

Unusual appetite: Mrs Banks (right) said that as soon as Brian (left) returned home following his operation, he raided the washing basket and ate another pair of knickers . But within hours of being back at Mrs Banks’s £250,000 four-bedroom detached home, the dog raided the washing basket and ate another pair of knickers. Mrs Banks rushed him back to Abbey Vets, where employee Tony Duffy was able to give him medication to make him vomit, narrowly avoiding further surgery. The mother said: ‘I’d spotted him nibbling on some of the washing and I got really worried when he wasn’t eating properly and he regurgitated his food undigested. ‘We took him to the vet and they could see a big bulge on the X-ray but they weren’t sure what it was.

'We just couldn’t believe that after an operation and four days at the vets he comes home and does it again. It’s a warning to other pet owners to be really careful, because Brian needed major surgery and he’s lucky to come out okay. As for us, it’s underwear straight into the washing machine where he can’t get at them.’ Vet Mr Duffy said: ‘It never fails to amaze me what dogs will swallow, but swallowing three thongs in such a short space of time must beat them all.’","Kaye Banks, 47, was horrified when her pet could not digest his food .

"CLICK HERE to read why Louis an Gaal knew Radamel Falcao was worth the money . Aston Villa  midfielder Tom Cleverley has vowed to put behind him the negativity that marred his final year at Manchester United and prove wrong those who doubt his ability. He said: ‘You don’t turn into a bad player just because someone says it on Twitter. I probably wasn’t the only United player to get it last year. For as long as Man United aren’t winning trophies, players will get criticised. I’m fully aware of that. I’ve still got a league title, 13 England caps. ‘If all the players say they were high in confidence last season I think they would be lying. It wasn’t just me. It was the rest of the squad too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tom Cleverley: I'm motivated to prove people wrong . Tom Cleverley (C) has vowed to prove his Manchester United doubters wrong this season . Tom Cleverley joined Aston Villa on a season long loan after being told his chances were limited at United . ‘I’m sure one season doesn’t turn you into a bad player. That’s football for you. The year before I won the league, played 20-odd games.’ ‘Football is a game of opinions, you can’t please everyone and the main opinion for me is the manager I am playing under.’ Cleverley, 25, was told by new United boss Louis van Gaal that his opportunities would be limited this season, so he forced through a loan move in the final seconds of deadline day by calling Villa manager Paul Lambert after a few fraught hours to explain his desire to play. It appears that his agent, Simon Kennedy, almost scuppered the move, with Villa unhappy that Everton were brought into discussions without a word of notice — and Cleverley admitted he and Lambert gave his representative a ‘bit of stick’. Tom Cleverley was not the only player to suffer under David Moyes' reign at Old Trafford . Louis van Gaal, with Radamel Falcao (L) and Daley Blind (R), told Tom Cleverley chances would be limited . But Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who worked with Cleverley at Wigan, believes United blocked any chance he had of getting the player on a season-long loan. ‘I am a big admirer of Tom,’ said Martinez. ‘That was an opportunity that we explored on the last day of the window but it couldn’t happen for different reasons. I don’t think there was just one aspect. Tom Cleverley can boast a better passing accuracy than his Aston Villa midfield counterparts . ‘It’s the parent club that makes that decision. Maybe they just didn’t want to send a player on loan to a club who are going to be challenging for things and finished above them last season, I don’t know. ‘Our information was that the player wasn’t available on loan full stop. You can look at the table from last season and we finished fifth and they finished a bit lower, so from that respect you can understand. Tom Cleverley arrived at Aston Villa despite late interest from Everton manager Roberto Martinez . Roberto Martinez claims United blocked move because they didn't want to sell to close rivals . ‘But, at the same time, Aston Villa have started the season really well. They are going to be a strong team. But we can’t comment on that, it is down to Manchester United. A situation with Cleverley came up that I was happy to explore. In the end it didn’t work out.’ Cleverley makes his debut on Saturday at Liverpool, where he is expecting a frosty reception after 14 years at Old Trafford. He added: ‘I am happy to get away from some of the negativity that surrounded me at Man United. I want to get Aston Villa back up in the top half where this club belong. My first target is getting in the Villa team, second is playing well and third is hopefully getting back in the England squad.’","Tom Cleverley joined Aston Villa on loan on transfer deadline day .

"Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale was controversially stopped from receiving the biggest prize in county cricket on Friday and could be facing further punishment over his suspension for the rest of the season. Yorkshire’s first title success for 13 years was tainted when their captain was banned from taking any part in the presentation ceremony after their victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. The move by the ECB, which followed Gale’s ban last week for verbally abusing Lancashire’s Ashwell Prince, angered Yorkshire and their captain, who was said to be in tears in the dressing room while his stand-in Joe Root received the trophy instead. Andrew Gale was barred from the official presentation ceremony as Yorkshire wrapped up the County Championship at Trent Bridge - but the captain later came on to the outfield to lift the trophy . Initially, Gale (second left) had been forced to watch the celebrations from the Trent Bridge balcony . Gale was banned by the ECB last week for verbally abusing Lancashire's Ashwell Prince and played no part in the decisive game with Nottinghamshire, which Yorkshire won by an innings and 152 runs . Gale is joined by Yorkshire head coach Jason Gillespie to celebrate the county's first championship in 13 years . Yet the ECB, who came under fire for being too harsh on Gale, were preparing a statement which Sportsmail understands could explain their decision while also causing more controversy over the season’s climax. It was only after the official presentation that Gale, highly regarded for his leadership of Yorkshire, went onto the Trent Bridge outfield and lifted the trophy after being urged to do so by his county’s large travelling support. He also looked emotional while carrying his daughter around the outfield. ‘We only found out he couldn’t lift the trophy last night,’ said Martyn Moxon, the Yorkshire director of cricket. ‘We can’t say anything else because there’s a legal process going on. It’s been hard for Andrew because he’s cherished this win and was looking forward to this moment.’ Gale joins his team-mates for a celebratory picture after winning the County Championship . Gale exchanges words with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince during the Roses clash last week . The champagne flows as Yorkshire celebrate winning the Championship with a resounding win . (Left to right) Tim Bresnan, Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Adam Lyth pose with the trophy . Gale was banned until September 27 on a level Two charge after clashing angrily with Prince on the penultimate night of the Roses match. Sportsmail understands he made reference to the South African’s Kolpak status, which allows him to play for Lancashire as a non-overseas player. In Gale’s absence Yorkshire needed just over an hour of the final day of their match to take the remaining five Notts wickets and win the championship with a match in hand. It is a notable triumph for a county brimming with potential England players and their brilliant coach Jason Gillespie. But it was tarnished by the treatment of Gale and the story could take another controversial turn later on Friday.","Andrew Gale initially barred from joining in with Yorkshire's County Championship celebrations after win over Nottinghamshire .

"America is no longer that world’s fattest major country on Earth. According to a United Nations report, Mexico are the new kings of the calories. The report blames Mexicans' expanding waistlines on a combination of rising incomes and rampant consumption. Vitamin T: Mexicans joke that their Vitamin T food, their tacos, tostadas and tamales, do them good... but they are laden with calories and hard to burn when leading a sedentary lifestyle . With almost 50 percent of Mexico’s population considered poor, it is the malnourished that are becoming obese. Diabetes and cardiovascular illnesses are on the increase, plus sizes clothing fills the racks in stores and Mexicans keep eating. The crisis disproportionately hits the poor and the young. Weight-related diabetes claims the most Mexican lives each year, with nearly one of every six Mexican adults suffering from the disease. Slow-going: Mexicans sedentary lifestyles and rising incomes are all to blame for their expanding waistlines . Source: OECD Health Data. Obesity rates in adults . Heart and related ailments round out the list of the country's top killers. 'The same people who are malnourished are the ones who are becoming obese,' said physician Abelardo Avila with Mexico's National Nutrition Institute. 'In the poor classes we have obese parents and malnourished children. The worst thing is the children are becoming programmed for obesity. It's a very serious epidemic.' About 70 percent of Mexican adults are considered overweight; 32.8 percent are obese. But the U.S. isn't far behind panting to a second place finish with an obesity rate of 31.8 percent. Less than a month ago, the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease. Mexico blames increasingly industrialized agricultural production for a worldwide epidemic of both obesity and malnutrition. Street food: Cheap and tasty - two women preparing blue corn tacos surrounded by happy customers eating on busy street corner in the  Roma district Mexico City . Sally Neiman who has lived in Mexico for 20 years says the new title doesn't come as too much of a surprise. 'Because of a lack of money and food, people go for more energy-intense foods. These are often high in sugar or fat. People drink Coca Cola as if it was water in order to have the energy to carry on - and so many of the foods are rich in carbs, are full of cheese or are fried.' 'There is no control in schools to what kids eat this days, it is normal to see a kid having a soda for breakfast and eating 'comida chatarra' (junk food), it is allowed to be sold in schools.' Experts have been warning about the growing obesity problem for years. President Enrique Peña Nieto has launched a National Crusade Against Hunger, aimed at reducing 'food insecurity' for some 7.4 million Mexicans. Most of the people targeted live in the more impoverished south of the country, where indigenous rural communities have been especially  hit by malnutrition accompanied by cases of obesity. Anti-poverty programs often end up putting cash into rural families' hands that is simply spent on fried snacks and sodas rather than nutritious foods. Much also has to do with what Mexicans wittily call Vitamin T foods — the tacos, tamales and tostadas that anchor their diet. Once reserved for special occasions, the carbohydrate and lard-loaded dishes now get eaten on a daily basis. When most Mexicans lived on the land and worked hard physical labor-intensive jobs obesity was kept at bay. Now with more sedentary lifestyles, combined with the ability to fiesta-like food every day, the country's waistline is expanding. Of course, there are plenty of healthier choices like broth-based soups, fresh fish, salads, vegetables and fruits. Wealth doesn't always bring health: Just because Mexicans are earning more money doesn't mean they make better food choices, especially when it all tastes so good! But for Mexicos' poor and working class, these options tend to be pricier - plus, the stodgy, heavier food already tastes good. Some Mexicans blame the arrival of American fast food chains coming over the border selling their junk food snacks. Such restaurants have spread rapidly since the opening of the local economy to global marketers in the early 1990s. Urban Mexicans stuff pizza, hamburgers and deep-fried chicken with ease. Chips are cheap, cookies and sugary soft drinks pack the shelves of local stores. Wealthier Mexicans have turned to healthier lifestyles. Supermarkets offer fresher and lighter calorie food. Restaurants serving sushi, salads and the like are popular. Gyms that charge individuals as much as $200 a month are opening up. As she sits down to eat her lunchtime tacos Ms. Neiman ponders Mexico's situation. 'There really is no clear information on nutritional facts in this country and people with poor education are not aware of the risks. They believe the energy a Coke or a fatty food will bring to them is beneficial in order to help them get through the day.' Quoting an old Mexican proverb, she smiles: 'In Mexico we say 'Barriga llena, corazon contento' which translates as: 'a full tummy means a happy heart.' If you eat something delicious you will be very happy. I don't think anyone can argue with that!'","Almost 33 percent of Mexicans are now obese and 70 percent overweight .
The poor and young are worst affected, often both malnourished and fat .
Mexican food is traditionally high in calories, fatty and fried .
U.S. restaurant chains opening up in the country aren't helping the problem .

"This is the moment a fearless guard dog took on a giant polar bear more than twice its size and won by scaring it away. The huge bear approached the working dog, who is used to pull sleds through the snow in Churchill, Canada. But rather than running away in fear, the determined dog stood its ground by baring its teeth and growling at the polar animal in a startled frenzy. Scroll down for video . The curious polar bear approaches the guard dog, who is on a chain, and seems to want to make acquaintances with the smaller animal .

The dog, whose job it is to pull sleds through the snow in Churchill, Canada, continues to try and scare off the animal . The curious bear seemed to approach the dog eager to make friends with the smaller animal. But eventually the bear, who is considerably larger than the dog, was forced to make a retreat and trudge away into the distance from the fiery animal. The incredible moment  was captured on camera by photographer Alberto Panizza while he was visiting Manitoba in Canada earlier this month. Despite their differences in size, the dog continues to stand its ground rather than running away from the bear in fear . The dog begins to bare its teeth as well as barking and growling as the polar bear gets closer and the two animals square up to each other . The dog's owner claims that he breeds the strongest dogs in the world and they sometimes do throw themselves at the bears to scare them off . He revealed that the fearless dog was also chained up to stop it from escaping and went into survival mode when he saw the bear approaching. The 39-year-old also said that the dog's owner, a local breeder, claims his pets are the strongest in the world. Mr Panizza, from Parma in Italy, said: 'The dogs live not far from a town where polar bears often pass through. Rather than stay and face the frenzied dog, the polar bear is forced to make a retreat and trudges away into the distance . The moment the dog took on the bear was captured on camera by Italian photographer Alberto Panizza, who visited Canada last month . 'This one seemed to be curious and even though much bigger it was eager to make acquaintances with the dogs. 'Even if they are trained to fight bears, the dogs usually seem afraid.

"Germany and France have launched a dramatic euro power grab, demanding the right to dictate economic policy to other countries in the single currency. France’s Nicolas Sarkozy announced – at a Paris summit with Germany’s Angela Merkel – that the two most powerful nations in the eurozone had agreed on a ‘true European economic government’ to deal with the debt crisis. The 17 countries in the single currency will be ordered to balance their budgets by 2012 and will have their economic policies overseen by a new eurozone body. United front: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and French President Nicolas Sarkozy make their announcement following talks at the Elysee Palace in Paris . EU president Herman Van Rompuy will lead the new body, which will meet twice a year to dictate tax and spending policies. In what amounts to a major step toward a European superstate, France and Germany announced they will adopt a common corporate tax system by 2013, in an effort to signal they are ‘marching in step’ to protect the euro. And they will draw up plans for a financial transaction tax, which will cost the City of London billions a year if it is extended to the UK. The plans were a dramatic bid to reassure the markets that EU leaders are serious about saving the euro from collapse. Side by side: The two leaders appeared in confident mood ahead of their announcement . Chancellor George Osborne, who has been calling for bankrupt countries to cut spending, gave a cautious welcome. Senior Treasury officials said they regarded further integration as ‘the only way to stop the euro from failing’. They pledged to use the reorganisation as a chance to negotiate a better deal for Britain in Europe but vowed that the UK would refuse to join a system in which the EU dictated economic policy. ‘The general direction is what we’ve been suggesting,’ a source said. ‘This is the only way to stop the euro from collapsing. If that were to happen it would allow some people to say “We told you so” but the effect would be disastrous for us.’ Crunch time: President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel meet again this afternoon in Paris to discuss further measures to tackle European debt crisis . Panic: A trader reacts at the bourse in Madrid. Stock markets plummeted last week over concerns about euro zone banks . Forty per cent of British trade is with the countries in the eurozone and UK banks have hundreds of billions of pounds of exposure to their French and German counterparts. The source made clear that Britain would not let Brussels dictate tax or economic policy. ‘We won’t be joining any of this,’ the source added. ‘At every stage we will take the chance to advance British interests.’ Tough times: Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy discussed expanding the European Financial Stability Facility so it could help out Italy and Spain if necessary . Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats suffered a setback when a regional leader was forced to resign over an affair with a 16-year-old girl. Christian von Boetticher, 40, announced on Sunday he was stepping down as chairman of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein state. He had been the designated successor to CDU state premier Peter Harry Carstensen, 64, who is not running in an election in Germany's northern-most state in May 2012. Boetticher's relationship with the teenager was not illegal, but has sparked complaints in the conservative party. After a crisis meeting in the state capital Kiel, CDU officials said he would remain parliamentary floor leader in the state assembly. Deputy CDU leader Angelika Volquartz said: 'Christian von Boetticher said that he had misjudged the moral component (of the relationship).' In a poll published on Friday, Chancellor Merkel's centre-right coalition trailed behind a likely centre-left alliance of the Social Democrats and Greens. If the plans eventually lead to a European treaty change, Britain would have to agree to the shake-up, allowing the UK to demand concessions. David Cameron is likely to ask for guarantees that the EU budget will be restricted and may seek to opt out of some European workplace legislation blamed for harming business. Despite the bold move by France and Germany, it is feared it will not be enough to halt fears over debt within the single currency. President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel stopped short of backing so-called euro bonds, which would effectively mean Germany underwriting the debts of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. And they failed to outline plans to expand the eurozone bailout fund, which is seen as vital to prevent defaults. Mrs Merkel said euro bonds ‘won’t help us now’. Mrs Merkel does not want Berlin to cover for the reckless spending of other countries – a view reinforced on Tuesday when figures showed that the German economy was barely growing. The pair agreed they shared an ‘absolute determination’ to defend the euro by encouraging greater co-operation between its 17 members. British officials said France and Germany have the clout to push through their plans. But they will be fiercely resisted by Netherlands and Finland, whose voters will object to Paris and Berlin dictating their economic policy. Mats Persson, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘The proposals themselves will do little to solve the eurozone’s immediate crisis. 'They do reinforce the desire of Germany and France to seek more control over other countries’ economic affairs, in return for underwriting some of their debt. ‘Reining in public spending in countries such as Greece and Italy is absolutely necessary.’","German economy grew just 0.1 per cent in second quarter this year .

"Manchester City remain an enigma to me. On Sunday they face their main rivals for the title in Chelsea and they have been transformed as a club since Sheik Mansour took them over in 2008. That said, the owners have invested £865million in the club in the six years in which they have owned it yet I still can’t quite grasp their true identity. On their day, they can be something special. Look at their results against Manchester United in the past three seasons. In six Premier League games they have scored 18 goals against them and won five of those games. And in the majority of those encounters they have been absolutely brilliant. Vincent Kompany picks up Yaya Toure after German champions Bayern Munich's late winner on Wednesday evening, as City left-back Gael Clichy fails to stop Arjen Robben passing him at the byline . Man City can dazzle, but they have also showed their weaknesses this season, losing to Stoke at home . The pace of their game, the way they have moved the ball, the speed of their attacks and their strength at the back have been too much for United. They are on a completely different level and those performances have been close to 10/10 displays. On days like that you’re left wondering whether they can challenge Real Madrid and Barcelona. But I don’t see them hitting those heights nearly enough. If you catch City on an off day you can definitely takes points off them, as Stoke did the other week. And there are far too many of those days for a club of their aspirations. When I think about the great Premier League teams such as Manchester United and Arsenal in the 1990s and 2000s, players like Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Cristiano Ronaldo would put in performances that were 8/10 every single week. And if you happened to catch them on a good day, they would be 9/10 or close to 10/10. At City, I think you could say that Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany meet that standard but not enough of their other key players. Too many can have sleepy days when they’re well below their best. Maybe it’s because of the changes in managers over the last six years but their identity in terms of the playing style is an issue for me. They’re not a team that will retreat into a solid shape and defend deep. But I don’t see them as a free-flowing team, as Manchester United were in their heyday; they don’t play with the freedom of wide wingers. I don’t know if they want to be an open team who will go out and play with flair and to win simply because we’ve got better players than you. They’re not a team that will defend deep and make it difficult for teams and then hit them on the break. They want to control games but I’m not sure they have midfielders who are consistent enough to do that. It’s very early days but City’s start to the season has been unsure and stuttering, putting them under extra pressure on Sunday because they don’t want to see the five-point gap behind Chelsea increase. They need to ensure that they don’t fall into the trap of one season on and one season off, as they did after finally winning the title in 2012. They seemed to drop off in their intensity the following season and just at the moment you might be seeing the start of something similar. With the money that has been invested, I would imagine that the owners would want to see back-to-back Premier League titles or a Champions League semi-final or final this season but, right now, I would put Jose Mourinho’s team ahead of them. The likes of Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp would put in 8/10 performances every week . In six Premier League games against Man United, City have scored 18 goals against them and won five . It’s partly why Sunday's contest is so fascinating. City were outwitted in the equivalent fixture last season on another of those all-too-familiar off days, even if they got their revenge shortly after in the FA Cup. But City are Premier League champions. They need to start dominating like champions and asserting themselves. And if they summon one of their better performances, then they can start that process on Sunday. Manchester City have too many 'sleepy' players, and Chelsea are currently looking stronger . City suffered their third defeat of the season at Bayern Munich in the Champions League . Chelsea have won every game this season in the Premier League, having played four . Costa is the missing link for Chelsea . Diego Costa is the real deal as a striker. His attributes look tailor-made for English football. He has a bit of everything about him. He is great at holding the ball up, has enough speed to get in behind defenders, can work the 18-yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents. Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea City last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt . I would put his former Atletico team-mate, Radamel Falcao, just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for Chelsea. They — as Atletico before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best, which Spain, with their short intricate passing, didn’t manage in the World Cup. Together with Cesc Fabregas, he has formed a wonderful understanding and Chelsea look a better side than last season — and that’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer. Fabregas looks to be the perfect replacement for Frank Lampard. He might not score as many but he will create more. I would imagine he’ll play just behind Costa at Manchester City on Sunday, with Ramires and Nemanja Matic sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity. Fabregas has slotted seamlessly back into English football following his arrival back from Barcelona . You might have thought it would take Chelsea three or four months for their new signings to settle in but Costa, Fabregas and Thibaut Courtois have adapted straight away, which is why I have them as title favourites. They don’t need to win on Sunday; a draw would do them fine. Jose Mourinho always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and, so far, that’s looking like a good call. Poor Yaya deserves time to recover . The player who has received the most criticism for his midfield performances and his inconsistency this week has been Yaya Toure. The 31-year-old has been instrumental in the reshaping of Manchester City and been a powerhouse in midfield in their title-winning seasons. Yaya Toure wasn't at his best on Wednesday night as Manchester City lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich . VIDEO We must support Toure - Pellegrini . But behind every dip in form, there is always a back story. We don’t know exactly what the reason is with Yaya but we do know his brother, Ibrahim, died in the summer. Sometimes we simply analyse players as though they are footballing machines but the raw emotion of such a tragedy can’t fail to have an impact in some way. It is something I’ve been through recently. Yaya was not at his best against Bayern Munich and he does look a little detached since the World Cup. I would guess he needs some time and space to get back to his best. Given what he has contributed to City, he’s earned that right.","Manchester City face their main rivals for the title in Chelsea on Sunday .

"Twitter users warn the change is another step towards the 'extinction' of the apostrophe . For 30 years it has been a sight to gladden the hearts of all who like to see punctuation used correctly. Now, however, the bookshop chain founded by Tim Waterstone is dropping the apostrophe from its name. Waterstone’s said it is phasing out . the apostrophe in its logo because it is no longer ‘practical’ in the . age of the internet and email addresses. 'Plain wrong': Angry punctuation experts say the move is grammatically incorrect . But the move sparked outrage among customers and punctuation experts who insist that the apostrophe should remain. John Richards, chairman of the Apostrophe Protection Society said: ‘It’s just plain wrong. It’s grammatically incorrect. ‘If Sainsbury’s and McDonald’s can get it right, then why can’t Waterstone’s? 'You would really hope that a bookshop is the last place to be so slapdash with English.’ James Daunt, who became managing director last year when the chain was sold to a Russian billionaire, said: ‘Waterstones without an apostrophe is, in a digital world of URLs and email addresses, a more versatile and practical spelling.’ But the adjustment also appeared to be a slight to Tim Waterstone who founded the chain with a single store in Kensington in 1982. Mr Daunt said the change ‘reflects an . altogether truer picture of our business today which, while created by . one, is now built on the continued contribution of thousands of . individual booksellers’.

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week sees a Manchester City midfielder and new West Ham signing stealing the headlines . 1. James Milner has made a big breakthrough in Manuel Pellegrini’s thinking after being named to start against both Arsenal and Chelsea. The England midfielder made just 10 Premier League starts last season and not one was against a top four team, but Manchester City’s manager is clearly ready to put more trust in the 28-year-old. He justified his new status, playing in three different positions as City adjusted to having ten men before he then provided the pass for Frank Lampard’s late equaliser. James Milner celebrates setting up Frank Lampard for the equaliser against Chelsea . 2. Alex Song’s arrival at West Ham will give Mark Noble a new lease of life to play a more attacking role in Sam Allardyce’s plans. One club man Noble has been anchored in a defensive midfield position for some time, but having Song behind him meant 24 of the 34 accurate passes he played against Liverpool were in the attacking half. He made the switch count – making one goal and setting up three more chances in the 3-1 win over Brendan Rodgers’ team. Barcelona loanee Alex Song was an imposing presence for West Ham against Liverpool . 3. With a capacity of just 18,360 Queens Park Rangers already have the disadvantage of the smallest stadium in the Premier League – so it must be an additional worry that they can’t fill it. Just 16,163 saw Niko Kranjcar’s free kick rescue a 2-2 draw – and even allowing that Stoke brought only 1,028 fans to go in the 1,900 capacity away end that still leaves 1,325 home seats unsold. Full price tickets started at £30 – but were trading for as little as £17 on the club’s official viagogo site. QPR players celebrate stealing a point against Stoke in front of a less than full Loftus Road . 4. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has mostly been a bit part player for Arsenal this season – he’s appeared in all nine games but the win at Aston Villa was only the second time he’s started a Premier League game. The 78 minutes he completed before getting subbed was the most he’s played in the League since last March but there were signs he could be pushing for more. His neat touch started the move from which Mesut Ozil got the Gunners’ first goal, and he found a team mate with 46 of his 55 passes. Pressure from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain forced an own goal versus Aston Villa in a rare start for the midfielder . 5. Mohamed Diame moaned about not getting more chance to play in central midfield at West Ham and has done his best to make his point since joining Hull. The Senegal international’s brilliant finish at Newcastle proved he’s got a shot in both feet – with a left foot rocket following up his right foot finish against the Hammers last Monday. Maybe if he’d shown more of that quality at Upton Park last season he’d have got more opportunities to play in his favourite role – he got just four goals in the entire campaign. Mohamed Diame has scored two in two since joining Hull from West Ham . 6. Papiss Cisse got the headlines for the two goals that rescued Alan Pardew from another calamity but the player who worked his socks off most to save the boss was midfielder Jack Colback. The free transfer capture from neighbours Sunderland, hailed by Roy Hodgson as the 'ginger Andrea Pirlo' when he was picked for the England squad, covered 7.8 miles against Hull – the furthest run by any Premier League player on Saturday. He gave quality as well as quantity – with a 95.3 per cent passing success rate. Free transfer Jack Colback (left) looks set to be a key player for Newcastle . 7. David Moyes was always a bit old school at Everton when it came to using a minimum of substitutes – and his former number two Alan Irvine has picked up some of the same habits. Irvine, feeling his way into his first job as a Premier League boss at West Brom, stuck with his starting line-up at Tottenham right the way through to the 89th minute when he swapped Victor Anichebe for Stephane Sessegnon to waste a bit of time to hang on to. Every other top flight side sent on three subs this weekend – apart from Stoke and Swansea who both used two. It was a first Premier League win for West Brom manager Alan Irvine . 8. Jose Mourinho’s decision to trust his former Real Madrid assistant Aitor Karanka with the development of young striker Patrick Bamford looks like paying dividends. The 21-year-old, who got 25 goals in 53 games on loan for MK Dons and Derby last season, marked his full Middlesbrough debut by scoring in the 4-0 demolition of Brentford. England Under 21 striker Bamford is due back at Stamford Bridge in January when Mourinho wants him to compete for a place in Chelsea’s first team squad. Patrick Bamford (23) rises highest to head his first Middlesbrough goal . 9. Alex McLeish’s first attempt to rebuild his management career after getting sacked by Aston Villa was a disaster when he walked out of Nottingham Forest after just 41 days – but his next go in Belgium looks more promising. The former Scottish boss is unbeaten in three games in charge of FC Genk and got his first win on Saturday night when his side ended the 100 per cent home record of Mouscion-Peruweiz with a 2-1 win. 10. Keith Curle might have been out of work for 19 months since getting rather harshly sacked by Notts County but clearly hasn’t forgotten how to deliver a half time team talk. The 50-year-old former England defender, who has taken the tough job of bossing Carlisle in 92nd place in the League, watched his new club go 3-0 down by the break against promotion hopefuls Mansfield. A few well chosen words inspired a fight back that got them within a whisker of rescuing a point at 3-2. 'I just said I wanted to see if they could come back in at the end, look me in the eye, and tell me they’d had a go,' Curle explained. It's been a long wait for new Carlisle boss Keith Curle to return to the touchline .","James Milner has started against Arsenal and Chelsea this season, showing greater faith from Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini .

"Hull City have splashed over £5million on the double signing of Harry Maguire from Sheffield United and Dundee United's Andy Robertson. Sheffield United were reluctant to cash in on Maguire, however they chose to accept Hull's offer on Monday after initially refusing to do business with the Premier League outfit. Scotland left-back Robertson has also agreed a deal to sign for Hull. All smiles: Harry Maguire and Andy Roberton have signed on the dotted line at Hull City . Wanted: Sheffield United's Harry Maguire has decided to join Hull . Dundee United accepted Hull's bid for the 20-year-old last week and the player held talks with the Barclays Premier League to see if the move was right for his development. A deal has now been done to continue Robertson's meteoric rise following his move from amateur side Queen's Park to Tannadice last summer. United manager Jackie McNamara earlier revealed that the deal, reported to be worth £3million, would see 21-year-old Hull left-back Conor Townsend move to Tannadice on a season-long loan. In a bizarre chain of events, the Sky Bet League One club released a statement saying they had accepted an offer from their Yorkshire rivals, only for Hull to claim they had withdrawn interest after their final bid was rejected. A club statement from Hull said: ‘Sheffield United rejected an offer from the Club five days (Wednesday) ago for defender Harry Maguire. This was the Club’s final offer and we have since entered into discussions with other transfer targets. ‘In light . of Sheffield United’s statement this morning the board will meet with . manager Steve Bruce this afternoon to determine whether we now wish to . pursue the transfer after the South Yorkshire club’s apparent U-turn.’ Busy man: Steve Bruce has brought in five new faces so far this summer .

"Arsene Wenger has revealed his deadline-day preference had been to sign Danny Welbeck on loan rather than a permanent deal. Gary Neville admitted on Wednesday that he was stunned by Welbeck’s £16million sale from Manchester United to Arsenal. But Wenger confirmed his initial priority was to secure a season-long loan with an agreement to buy next summer. That position is understood to have shifted when United insisted on a permanent transfer, with Tottenham also in discussions to sign the England striker. WATCH Scroll down to see 'Phil Neville: Welbeck was one of best signings this window' Danny Welbeck completed his move from Manchester United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . Aaron Ramsey limped off injured for Wales in their 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier win at Andorra . When asked if a loan move had been his primary intention, Wenger said: ‘With an option to buy, yes.’ Welbeck followed his surprise move with two goals in England’s Euro 2016 qualifying win over Switzerland. Having spent his time at Old Trafford fluctuating between his preferred central role and positions put wide, Welbeck is now set to be played through the middle at Arsenal. Wenger said: ‘He arrived on Wednesday and he’s happy and confident of course because he scored two goals for England in a very important game and that can only boost his confidence. 'Welbeck is young, strong and a great finisher. He can improve here. ‘When you analyse his game you think he has the qualities to play through the middle. At Manchester United, where you had many big stars, and he is a player who is very versatile, he had to make room sometimes for players to play through the middle. Arsene Wenger (left) gets his message across to Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla on Wednesday . Danny Welbeck scored twice to help England to a 2-0 win against Switzerland during the international break . 'But if you analyse in an objective way his qualities, I think he has the perfect style to play through the middle.’ Wenger added: ‘He has been questioned about that (his finishing), but the second goal (for England) gives you a good answer.’ 'Welbeck's best position is through the middle. He is happy and confident' Wenger has drawn criticism in some quarters for being in Rome on deadline day, but he said: ‘If I had not travelled that day, Welbeck would not be here. I'll explain that a bit later but the coincidence made that because I was on my way. Arsene Wenger revealed that Theo Walcott is 'two to three weeks' away from being fully fit . Per Mertesacker (left) takes on Santi Cazorla during Arsenal training on Wednesday . ‘If I stayed at home, Welbeck would not be here today. I will tell you that story one day but that's the truth. We are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel. The advantage of that day was I had to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I was available the whole day.’ When asked if Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a deal, Wenger joked: ‘You should ask him. I met him by coincidence on Tuesday and Wednesday and I would like to keep that conversation to myself!’ Wenger added: ‘We sold Robin van Persie to Manchester United so that's a reciprocity that happened there.

Wenger said: ‘The first news is not bad. He will be assessed today (Thursday), he has a little chance to be available for Saturday. He had an ankle sprain, it's a minor one that's for sure. Will it be enough to be available for Saturday? We'll know today. ‘Mikkel Arteta and Kieran Gibbs are back in the squad and in normal training.

"To many of her women colleagues, she is a heroine for winning a landmark ageism case against the BBC. The efforts of Miriam O’Reilly, however, appear to have been lost on the younger Julia Bradbury. The two women, both former presenters of Countryfile, have become involved in a row after Miss Bradbury disputed that the 57-year-old had been a victim of age discrimination on the show. So furious is Miss O’Reilly that she yesterday called 43-year-old Miss Bradbury a BBC ‘a**e licker’ and ‘arrogant’. Julia Bradbury, left, says Miriam O'Reilly, right, was dismissed as part of changes to the show - and not due to her age. Miss O'Reilly called Miss Bradbury an 'a**e licker' in a rant online . Miss Bradbury – nicknamed ‘the walking man’s crumpet’ for presenting many  outdoor programmes for the BBC – said  in a Saturday newspaper interview  that Miss O’Reilly’s departure from  Countryfile in 2009 was simply a result of planned changes to the show’s format rather than discrimination. Miss Bradbury said: ‘I’ve been through millions of programme changes where they say, “Sorry, love, we’ve changed the slot”. It happened with Watchdog – they brought Anne Robinson back. ‘With Miriam, the decision certainly wasn’t made because she was old. The decision was because they were changing the programme.’ The comments infuriated Miss O’Reilly, who sent Miss Bradbury a series of messages on Twitter. She wrote: ‘So you know better than three judges in a legal case and former BBC DG [director general] Mark Thompson who accepted the tribunal decision? ‘Before you make ill-informed statements I suggest you look at the legal case – one day you might need it. Until then good luck with the a**e licking.’ Miss Bradbury did not respond to any of the tweets, and yesterday friends said she wanted to maintain a dignified silence. Miss O’Reilly told the Daily Mail she believed Miss Bradbury was simply voicing the defiance of senior producers on Countryfile, whom she claims have refused to accept the employment tribunal’s 2011 ruling. She added: ‘It really is a pathetic thing to say. She has just made herself look rather silly. I think it displays a certain arrogance. ‘If she had studied the tribunal judgment, and it is online, she might have a different view. But it was an ill-informed view and not helpful to her or other older women in television. Frankly I feel there was some a**e licking there.’ At the tribunal Miss O’Reilly said she had been devastated when she was told in November 2008 that she was being dropped from Countryfile after eight years of working for the Sunday lunchtime show as a freelance. The programme relaunched in April the following year in a Sunday evening prime-time slot with Miss Bradbury and former Blue Peter presenter Matt Baker, 33, along with long-serving host John Craven, 70. In the wake of her victory against the BBC, Miss O’Reilly was given a three-year deal to return to the corporation. But in 2012 she announced she was leaving to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace. It was that year that the BBC’s then director general, Mr Thompson, admitted there were ‘manifestly too few older women broadcasting on the BBC’ and said he hoped Miss O’Reilly’s age discrimination tribunal would be seen as a ‘turning point’. This month Miss Bradbury announced she was leaving Countryfile after agreeing to do shows with ITV.

Asked this week about the life of a Newcastle supporter, the club’s former defender Steve Howey delivered what appears to be a reasonable assessment. ‘It’s simple,’ he said. ‘They are bitter, angry and confused.’ At St James’ Park on Saturday afternoon, sentiments will again be clear. A protest aimed at dislodging manager Alan Pardew will involve the distribution of 200 banners and 35,000 cardboard signs before the game with Hull City. Newcastle United protest group 'SackPardew.com' have parodied owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct logo . Alan Pardew had this pair of official club pictures taken of him during a photocall earlier in the week . Some supporters have given up on watching their team and decided to not renew cheap season tickets . Newcastle United owner  Ashley (centre) is being encouraged by fans to wield the axe and sack Pardew . Ashley has come under constant heavy criticism from supporters in the north-east . Pardew himself has indicated he may stay clear of trouble, in the dugout. ‘I will just gauge the situation on Saturday,’ he said. Newcastle have taken 15 points from the last 72 in the Barclays Premier League and are bottom. Given this, and the shambolic nature of a 4-0 defeat at Southampton a week ago, Pardew’s days in the north-east may be numbered. At Newcastle, though, the future of the manager is only a small part of the story. No English city mixes beer and football quite so convivially. From the Three Bulls Head on Percy Street to the Trent House on the other side of the ground, football pub crawls are part of life on match day. For some, though, the big bit in the middle of the afternoon has begun to fall by the wayside. Blogger Jacki Smithfield of The Mag website said recently: ‘Fans tell me they keep going because they meet their mates and don’t want to miss out on the pub and having a catch-up. But some groups go to the pub to watch the match. Some have just had enough.’ Disenfranchised by Mike Ashley’s controversial and unpopular ownership, Saturday afternoon at the match is no longer an essential part of the weekend for some. Gates at local non-League clubs such as Gateshead and Dunston are up and it’s no coincidence. Steve Wraith, a presenter on Toon Talk Radio, said: ‘I have given up my season ticket after 30 years and so have others. I’ve got involved at Dunston. We have won two games in the FA Cup already. That’s more than Newcastle will manage.’ The stats show that attendances remain high at Newcastle. ‘Many Newcastle fans would turn up to watch grass grow,’ added Wraith. However, a visit to the club website reveals that season tickets are available in just about every section of the stadium, while a five-game deal beginning on Saturday is on offer for £152 per year. Daryl Jamaat, Fabricio Coloccini model Newcastle's new third kit  before their key clash against Hull City . Newcastle captain Coloccini poses in the new kit, which doesn't carry the club's identity . As author Michael Walker reveals in his new book on north-east football Up There, a visit to one of football’s great cathedrals is not the intoxicating experience it once was. Referring to a home game against Swansea last April, Walker recalls: ‘Up on Level 7 the atmosphere was like a playground. ‘There was a stag party, a hen party, a group of Dutch lads, a group of Scottish lads and a lot of children with parents. There was lots of eating. There were not lots of traditional football supporters and when Swansea won via a last-minute goal there was no outcry.’ Newcastle remains a fervent football city and the club’s core support remains loyal. The edges, though, are becoming frayed and, though Pardew will bear the brunt, Ashley’s critics say it is because of him that the club has become so desperately disconnected from their public. With St James’ Park festooned with 137 adverts for Ashley’s Sports Direct chain at the last count, the accusation is clear. ‘He bought in to football simply to further his sports brand on the back of a famous football club,’ claimed Wraith. ‘The club is a vehicle for his company. Football is about romance and competing and dreaming. For Mike Ashley it’s not. It’s just a business.’ Ashley is estimated to have spent £250m buying Newcastle and lending the club £129m interest-free. However, he admitted at a recent Sports Direct AGM that his company benefits from its connection with the club and a visit to the stadium shop proves interesting. There is plenty of black and white merchandise but there is also a sizeable section where visitors can buy boots, merchandise and kits from all over the world. By the door is a machine that dispenses autographed photographs from other Premier League clubs. On its screen on Friday a montage included a Sunderland player scoring a goal. ‘It’s not a Newcastle club shop at all,’ said Wraith. ‘It’s a branch of Sports Direct.’ Newcastle fans hold up a banner with the words 'Pardew is a muppet' during the defeat at Southampton . More than 200 banners and 15,000 posters have been printed ahead of this weekend's match . To the outsider, these details seem trivial but it does feel crass and brash. It is one of many things supporters would like to talk to Ashley about, but he doesn’t communicate. Newcastle regularly ban newspapers that write things they don’t like while the Supporters Trust has been excluded from a club-run fans forum after a publishing disagreement last year. ‘Fans just want to hear him speak,’ said Howey. ‘That would help and I can understand their frustration.’ When Newcastle sold Andy Cole to Manchester United in January 1995, a judge at the city’s law court adjourned a trial to find out if the bad news really was true. Today, few Newcastle players would be recognisable outside the club itself. Chief scout Graham Carr’s faith in what is seen as a value for money French market has seen an influx of players from across the channel. The good ones such as Yohan Cabaye and Mathieu Debuchy have been improved and sold on at profit. The others appear to make up numbers. It would appear Pardew does not sign these players. He refers to a ‘transfer team’ but his role in it does not seem as central as it might. In the summer he wanted to sign Shane Long from Hull but was alone in his view. The last two players to establish themselves from Newcastle’s youth academy were Steven Taylor in 2004 and Andy Carroll two years later. This is not necessarily Newcastle’s fault. The number of junior leagues listed in the Durham FA handbook has dwindled from 16 to just two since 1983-84. Nevertheless the lack of local lads in the black and white has served only to further strain Newcastle’s affinity with its football team. The wags say the club’s academy is now a breeding ground for future Blyth Spartans players. A 'Pardew Out' banner in the away end at St Mary's as supporters lose patience with the football served up . Meanwhile, fans and former stars accuse Ashley of encouraging foreign players to use his club as stepping stone. ‘Now it’s bitten him on the backside,’ wrote former midfielder Robert Lee in Friday’s Evening Chronicle. ‘That’s why we are bottom of the table.’ The manager talks diplomatically about these issues but the upshot is that his team isn’t good enough. Banned from the club, the Chronicle invite their readers to score players out of 10 via their website. After last week’s game midfielder Jack Colback came top with 4.1. Before the game coach John Carver argued with fans holding a ‘Pardew Out’ banner and invited them to the training ground to ‘talk about it’. One man turned up but was sent away by security. Later in the week Carver apologised. ‘I know JC,’ said Howey. ‘He loves the club and I can see why he got angry. There is a time and a place for protests. They can get to players.’ Pardew has looked haunted at times this season. Some accuse him of being Ashley’s puppet but this week he adopted a more defiant tone. He looked ready for a fight and he will need to be. Ashley has already given thought to David Moyes as a replacement and any new manager would find a club in decent financial shape. Newcastle turned a £9.9m post-tax profit last year and their wage bill of £61.7m represents a relatively healthy 64 per cent of turnover. Ashley, though, would have to prove to a new manager that he was willing to invest in the squad with a view to winning trophies. From that point of view, the evidence is not great. Before this summer’s net spend of around £25m, Newcastle were bottom of last year’s Premier League teams in terms of player investment over the previous five years. The club told their supporters last season that cup runs were not a priority, as research showed them to be of little ‘benefit’ in the long-term. Of all the bleak news to come out of Tyneside in recent times, that was perhaps the most depressing of all. On Friday they were stacking the shelves with their new third strip. It will go on sale in the morning and looks nothing like a Newcastle strip should. Perhaps it’s fitting. Newcastle, after all, no longer look, feel nor play much like Newcastle should.

"Dixie Dean, the Everton striker who scored 60 goals in the 1927-28 First Division season, was once asked whether his record would ever be broken. 'I think it will,' the Englishman reportedly said. 'But there's only one man who'll do it. That's the fellow that walks on the water. I think he's about the only one.' Eighty-six years on, though, and Chelsea striker Diego Costa is on course to surpassing that tally, having already scored seven goals in his first four games. At that scoring rate, the 25-year-old is scheduled to end the season on 66 goals. Diego Costa celebrates one of his three strikes for Chelsea against Swansea on Saturday . The Spain striker now has seven goals in just four games for Chelsea in his debut season at the club . 60 - Dixie Dean (Everton, 1927-28) 59 - George Camsell (Middlesbrough, 1926-27) 55 - Ted Hartson (Mansfield, 1936-37) - Joe Payne (Luton, 1936-37) 52 - Terry Bly (Peterborough, 1960-61) It is all hypothetical, of course. But it still gives hope to those at Stamford Bridge after years of cursed strikers. Fernando Torres, Andriy Shevchenko and many more have failed. Yet with Costa there's never a dull moment. The Spain striker's extraordinary start to life in the Premier League has catapulted him to become odds-on favourite to win the Golden Boot with many bookmakers, according to Oddschecker.com. Costa's nearest challenger is Daniel Sturridge at 10/1. Manchester United's own acquisition, Radamel Falcao, has been made third favourite at 14/1, despite a seven-goal deficit to overturn already. Costa is hoping to join Dixie Dean (left) and Alan Shearer (right) in setting goalscoring records for a season . Also within Costa's sights is the single-season Premier League goal record. Alan Shearer and Andy Cole hold the record for a 42-game season with 34 goals for Blackburn and Newcastle respectively, meaning Costa is 27 shy of that total at present. Shearer also holds the joint record for a 38-game Premier League season (the top flight was reduced from 22 to 20 teams for the 1995-6 term). The former England captain notched 31 goals for Blackburn in 1995-6, a total matched by Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United in 2007-8 and Luis Suarez for Liverpool last season. Costa is now 24 goals short of that illustrious trio. Everton heroes Ian Snodin and Graham Stuart stand next to the Dixie Dean statue outside Goodison Park . Dean runs out for Everton in 1936 (left) and climbs high to head a ball in action for the Toffees (right) In 42-game season . 34 - Andy Cole (Newcastle, 1993–94) - Alan Shearer (Blackburn, 1994–95) In 38-game season . 31 - Alan Shearer (Blackburn, 1995–96) - Cristiano Ronaldo (Man United, 2007–08) - Luis Suarez (Liverpool, 2013–14) There has been no adjustment period needed for Costa and little sign of a supposedly suspect hamstring. Little looks like stopping the predator who scored 36 goals last season as Atletico Madrid won the La Liga title and reached the Champions League final. Costa, rewarded for his super start with the Player of the Month accolade, proved last term was no fluke after netting against Burnley and Leicester City in his opening two games in England. He scored twice - and proved a real menace - in the 6-3 win over Everton at Goodison Park, before clinically putting three past Swansea City at Stamford Bridge to maintain Chelsea's 100 per cent record so far. Jose Mourinho refused to bite after that game, though. The Special One would not confirm Costa as the answer to prayers that so often emerged from Stamford Bridge last season, nor will he expect too much. Nevertheless, Mourinho humoured us. 'If the team plays well, he has to score goals,' said the Blues boss. Cristiano Ronaldo puts the ball past Birmingham goalkeeper Maik Taylor in September 2007 . Andy Cole scores against Chelsea with a brilliant left-footed shot at St James' Park in 1994 . Shearer's trademark celebration was seen a record 34 times for Blackburn in the 1994-5 season . 'Seven in four is maybe too much. It is something that is not normal. We cannot expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals.' But Mourinho added: ‘He is comfortable in the team. The team was built in a way that we were waiting for a certain type of striker and I think now everybody knows that Chelsea did the right thing in waiting for him and not going into the market in the summer of 2013 or January. ‘We waited for the right one.’ Costa has already staked his claim on a number of top-flight records but the striker remains in contention to break the biggest one of them all, which Dean has kept safe for 86 years and counting.

"Rosemary Snell was buried by the landslide, along with a companion . A couple who lay entombed for 10 days . under tons of mud after their car was buried by a landslide were not . found sooner because it was a 'busy weekend', police said yesterday. Rescue services closed a tunnel hit by . a huge landslide unaware that Rosemary Snell and her companion were in . their car crushed beneath the rubble. There were fears that 67-year-old Miss . Snell and her friend, a former hospital consultant named locally as . Mike, could have lain trapped and unable to escape from the Beaminster . Tunnel in Dorset. Local councillor Ron Bond said yesterday he was ‘absolutely disgusted’ that the bodies had remained undiscovered for so long. But Dorset Assistant Chief Constable . James Vaughan claimed the couple’s deaths would have been ‘pretty . instantaneous’ owing to the huge weight of the rubble. Miss Snell, a former social worker and . registered London tour guide, had only recently started a relationship . with Mike, who was in his 70s, after retiring to the picturesque village . of Misterton, Somerset. The couple were seen in his silver . Skoda Fabia on the afternoon of Saturday, July 7. Ivor Herring, 66, was . tending his allotment in Misterton at around 4pm. ‘I recognised Rosemary in the . passenger seat so I put my hand up and waved to her,’ he said. ‘She . waved back at me. It was the last time I saw her.’ The couple are believed to have . travelled to Beaminster and were returning to Misterton that night when . heavy flooding caused an avalanche of several hundred tons of masonry, . mud and trees which flattened their car as it left the tunnel. Emergency services were called to the . scene but left without clearing the mudslide as their heat-seeking . equipment failed to detect any sign of movement. The busy A-road had been closed to . traffic since the landslide and was not cleared because emergency . services and the council said they were dealing with numerous flood . alerts in the area. It was only when Miss Snell failed to . keep a lunch appointment with friend and neighbour Carol Walker two days . later that police began a missing persons inquiry. They discovered that the couple had . used a credit card in Beaminster on July 7 and eventually their . inquiries led them on Monday to the tunnel, still beneath 6ft of rubble. The weight of falling masonry from the bridge structure, soil and debris literally flattened the Skoda. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Entombed: It is feared the couple could have suffocated after being unable to free themselves from the buried car. The vehicle was still under the rubble when this picture was taken . This photograph was taken by 18-year-old Ed Lawrence, from Beaminster, who posted it on Twitter oblivious to the fact there were people trapped underneath . A police spokesman admitted officers had been busy after the public had inundated them with calls during the bad weather. 'There were 150 flood warnings in the . county at that time, 180 homes had been evacuated, and 400 incidents . reported to the police control room,' the officer said. Tragic: Mrs Snell was finally found 10 days after the accident . He added: 'Members of the public may . ask why it took 10 days to discover these bodies. I offer my condolence . to the families of those that perished. 'It was a busy weekend, there are no . obvious signs of a vehicle buried in the mud, there are several hundred . tons of mud and rubble, and there are no reports of missing people in . the area. 'The bridge had been secured safely, . and it was only when concerns from Avon and Somerset Police were raised . yesterday that we began to search, and the vehicle was discovered.' Mr Vaughan said: ‘This was a tragic, . freak accident. It was a chance in a million that they happened to be . driving out of the end of the tunnel when the landslide swept through. ‘Their car was severely crushed – like being caught up in an avalanche of mud. ‘It will be up to the pathologist to . decide exactly what was the cause of death, but I would have thought it . would have been pretty instantaneous. ‘Dorset fire-and-rescue and police . responded about 10.50pm on the evening of Saturday July 7 and the road . was closed. At that time it wasn’t suspected that anyone was trapped. ‘Heat-seeking equipment was used at . either end of the tunnel but nothing showed up. The tunnel was then . closed off as it is an unsafe structure until it has been properly . looked at by engineers. ‘A couple were then reported missing. By the end of last week the level of concern was such that police . started looking at their telephone records and banking details. ‘It became clear the couple had gone . to Beaminster. We brought in heavy machinery and began to excavate tons . of mud and found the vehicle on Monday evening.’ WI stalwart: Rosemary Snell had recently moved from south west London to Somerset and was in a fledgling relationship with her new boyfriend . Hidden: This picture was taken at Beaminster shortly after several hundred tons of mud, water, brick and trees fell at the edge of the tunnel. The car is completely concealed . Flattened: Shocking images show the recovered vehicle, which was crushed by tons of debris . Ron Bond, a member of Crewkerne County Council, said he was baffled how the bodies could have lain undiscovered for ten days. He said: ‘I am absolutely disgusted. On the face of it it seems outrageous that somebody was in there for so . long and that nobody looked. ‘The neighbours of the lady were . concerned that they hadn’t seen her around and the police broke into her . place and found there was no one there. She was a very nice lady and . full of life. It is such a tragedy.’ Police sources say the body of a man has been removed and work is continuing to recover the second . An aerial view of the tunnel, which has been closed since the landslide on July 7 . Debris at one end of the Beaminster tunnel. Emergency services have removed one body from the car and are working to recover the second . Miss Snell had sold her house in . Putney, south-west London, for £500,000 in April and had just finished . renovating her idyllic £325,000 stone cottage in Misterton. She had quickly integrated into village life – becoming vice-president of Misterton Women’s Institute and a parish councillor. With interests in antiques, gardens . and social history, she regularly gave lectures to the WI on subjects . such as the Tower of London. Floral tributes left at the scene. Flowers were placed on the ground along with a card from a local police officer . A view of he landslip taken a few days ago by locals. The car is completely concealed by the debris .

Gruesome discovery: The spot at where a couple were found buried in their car, as seen from the opposite end of the tunnel . Somerset county councillor John Dyke, who . also lives in the village, said everybody was in shock at the news of . her death. ‘She was very outgoing and really warm-hearted,’ he said. ‘Everybody thought she was wonderful – the whole village took her to its heart. ‘We are all in total shock. We just want to know why it took so long for her body to be found. ‘Surely they should have been looking . in the mud sooner? We only pray she died instantly.’  The Beaminster . Tunnel, which cuts through Horn Hill, was opened in 1832 and is the only . pre-railway road tunnel still in everyday use. It was closed for five weeks in 2009 for a major revamp which included strengthening the tunnel walls and new lighting. Engineers discovered that steel mesh . to the brickwork on the inside of the Grade II listed structure had . rusted and the lining had detached. The tunnel has remained closed since July 7.

"Police have formed an unprecedented ring of steel around the Middleton's £5million country mansion to protect Prince George and his parents from intruders. Officers on horseback and a helicopter with heat-seeking technology on board have been patrolling the perimeter around the 18-acre Bucklebury Manor estate in Berkshire, where the royal trio stayed last night. The local council imposed no-stopping regulations on roads near the Georgian home where a team of armed royal guards, who accompany Kate and William everywhere, are also stationed. Scroll down for video . Back again: The couple spent a week at Bucklebury Manor shortly before Kate returned to London to give birth, and the Cambridges were back last night surrounded by police . Ring of steel: A police van parked on Pease Hill near Bucklebury Manor, which had its perimeter patrolled by police on the ground and in the air . Operation: Police on horseback kept watch around Bucklebury Manor while officers also stood guard and prevented cars stopping on surrounding roads as they protect the baby and his parents . Grand: The Manor House owned by Carole and Michael Middleton has 18-acres, and has the two-day-old future king inside today . Experts say that the security detail is much larger than when Kate and William visited before the birth because of the precious prince now inside. It is likely to be because royal children have been targets in the past. In the weeks after Prince William was born in June 1982, Michael Fagan forced his way into Buckingham Palace and then broke into the Queen's bedroom. Eight years earlier, Princess Anne avoided a kidnap attempt by a mentally ill man who shot four people on Pall Mall in the process. 'What you need is a combination of technical and human resources, and the police have done that by deploying people on the ground and a helicopter overhead,' former head of royal protection Dai Davies told the Daily Telegraph. 'The heightened security around the royal baby might seem excessive, but if an incident did happen heads would roll.  In that sense the police are damned if they do and damned if they don't'. Very happy: Kate and William both smiled and waved to crowds outside the gates, but Kensington Palace would not reveal where they were heading . Visit to the in-laws: But the couple arrived in Bucklebury about an hour later to stay with the Middletons . The police cove on the ground and in the air would be to spot foreign photographers or criminals trying to get close to George. It has been estimated that the current security measures will cost £5,000 a day for police patrols and £900 an hour for the helicopter above. Their were clear hints that Kate and . William were off to Bucklebury last night after the heightened police . presence arrived yesterday lunchtime. Shortly afterwards, less than 24 hours after returning to . Kensington Palace from hospital with their baby son, the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge headed to stay with Carole and Michael. Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son George out of hospital for the first time . Happy: Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton leave The Lindo Wing after visiting The Duchess Of Cambridge and her newborn son, and now they have them staying with them . The new parents . drove away in a Range Rover at 1pm yesterday, with Prince George . strapped safely in the back. Earlier he had been visited by his . great-grandmother, the Queen, and uncle, Prince Harry. An . hour or so later the family arrived at the £4.8million Georgian mansion . recently bought by Kate’s parents in the leafy village of Bucklebury. Friends say Carole Middleton has been busy redecorating a . ‘nursery-style’ room for her first grandchild. Yellow . police cones with a 'no waiting' symbols lined both sides of the road . every few yards for around a mile either side of the majesticmanor.

It . was not possible to tell whether the Duchess' parents or her siblings, . Pippa and James, were at the vast estate, set in 18 acres of land and . boasting its own tennis court, swimming pool and library. Palace . officials refused to comment on the couple’s move, saying they were . keen to enjoy some ‘private time together, like any new family’.

"The Hollywood studio behind the Spider-Man and James Bond films says hackers have crippled its computer network and stole the private information of stars including Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie. Staff at Sony Pictures Entertainment have been forced to 'sit at their desks trying to do their jobs with pen and paper' since the attack, by a hacking collective called 'Guardians of Peace', five days ago. And today employees were told they may have to wait up to three weeks for the breach to be cleared. Crippled: Staff at Sony Pictures Entertainment have been forced to 'sit at their desks trying to do their jobs with pen and paper' since the attack, by a hacking collective called 'Guardians of Peace', five days ago . Before Sony Pictures' computers went dark on Monday, the screens displayed an image of a red skeleton with the phrase 'Hacked By #GOP,' according to the Los Angeles Times. The hackers warned the unit of Sony Corp that they had obtained 'secrets' that they would leak on the Web and released a list of files that it claimed it had stolen, including one called 'Cameron Diaz - passport' and another named Angelina Jolie passport'. Other files they claimed they had taken included, 'media budgets', deals' as well as 'security breach course of action'. It is also believed they may have taken production schedules and passwords. 'We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met,' said a message that popped up on the computer screens, according to the L.A. Times. Sensitive: The hackers released a list of files that it claimed it had stolen, including one called 'Cameron Diaz - passport' and another named Angelina Jolie passport' Sticky situation: Sony Pictures is the studio behind the Spider Man and James Bond movie franchises . One security expert told The Times newspaper that Sony may be a target because 'many perceive it to have an attitude problem with their eagerness to sue hackers'. A souce at Sony told The Times: You go to work and there are people sitting at their desks trying to do their job with pen and paper. It's the same all over the world. 'They're pretending its just an IT problem but its 100 per cent not ... The tech guys I know said files were wiped.' Sony Pictures spokeswoman Jean Guerin said the company's network was down as it dealt with 'a system disruption' and that technicians were 'working diligently' to resolve the issue. She did not give any details of the reported cyberattack. Emails sent to Sony Pictures on Tuesday were kicked back with an explanation that its 'email system is currently experiencing a disruption.' The Los Angeles Times said Sony Pictures employees had to resort to using pencil and paper to get their work done on Monday. It was unclear if the problem would affect the company's plans for upcoming holiday films, such as 'Annie,' or regular television programs including 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy!' Sony Corp has been a target of hackers in the past. In 2011, its video game online network suffered a major attack resulting in the theft of data belonging to 77 million users, one of the breaches to date.","Hackers from 'Guardians of Peace' group struck Sony systems on Monday .

"They usually use their keen sense of smell to find a bone or a tasty treat. But this talented dog can sniff out cancer – and even detected her owner’s undiagnosed tumour. Daisy, a ten-year-old Labrador, has now been awarded a medal for her life-saving work. Scroll down for video . Daisy the Labrador, left, has detected cancer in 551 patients since she underwent training as a puppy, right . Daisy, centre, was brought to meet Prince Charles and Camilla to highlight her success in detecting cancer . Her owner Dr Claire Guest began training her to sniff out the killer disease in urine and breath samples when she was a puppy. Dogs have an incredible sense of smell thanks to 300million scent receptors in their noses, compared to a measly five million in the human nose. Medical dogs are trained by sniffing samples of people already diagnosed with cancer and those of people without the disease so they can learn to tell the difference. Daisy has found cancer in 551 patients, an accuracy rate of an impressive 93 per cent. And she discovered Dr Guest’s undiagnosed breast cancer – the first time she has detected the disease actually growing in someone’s body, rather than by sniffing a sample. Dr Guest, 50, chief executive of charity Medical Detection Dogs, said: ‘Daisy seemed to be pawing at my chest. ‘She bumped against my body repeatedly – I pushed her away, but she nuzzled against me again, clearly upset. She pushed me so hard that it bruised me. ‘Her behaviour was totally out of character – she was normally such a happy dog ... I felt the tender area where she’d pushed me, and over the next few days I detected the tiniest lump. ‘The bump was a perfectly harmless cyst.

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was just awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the United States has slammed the court's ruling saying that the $1billion payout she is set to receive is 'inappropriate' and 'not fair.' Sue Ann Arnall has appealed the ruling made last month in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma courtroom, citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in one of America's greatest oil fortunes. The oil fortune she refers to is that of Continental Resources, the company founded by her ex-husband Harold Hamm in 1967, who himself is worth $9billion. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Scroll down for videos . Appealing: Sue Ann Arnall has filed an appeal less than a month after she was awarded $1billion in her divorce from ex-husband Herman Hamm, saying she is worth much more . Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage . Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . This as Miss Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. As for the appeal, Miss Arnall made it clear just days after the November 10 ruling that officially made her a billionaire that she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . All good?: Miss Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce . Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Started from the bottom: Mr. Hamm was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper . Working his way up:  He pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well . Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall. Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was named to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Sue Ann Arnall has appealed the $1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband, oil giant Harold Hamm .

"Hillary Clinton has come under fire after saying that America should 'empathize'' with its enemies. Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. to promote female leadership, the former U.S. Secretary of State also said the country should show 'respect' to those fighting against it. Using an approach she dubs 'smart power' - which women are apparently uniquely positioned to deploy - she urged Americans to use 'every possible tool and partner' to advance peace. This approach means 'showing respect, even for one's enemies; trying to understand and, insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view,' she said.

Within minutes of the 67-year-old's appearance being broadcast, she was being criticized by social media users across America for her 'ridiculous' attitude toward the country's enemies. Many people condemned her comments in the context of the U.S.'s recent airstrikes against the Islamic State (ISIS), which has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria, Fox News reported.

"It is 3am on Wednesday, September 10. Outside the private terminal of Birmingham airport, a fleet of cars are waiting to take England’s weary Under-21 squad home. Their four-hour flight back from the Moldovan capital Chisinau has just touched down, bringing an end to a tiring six day tour of Eastern Europe, and as the players file through the small arrivals building, thoughts are centred around climbing back into their own beds. But as Gareth Southgate’s squad enter the car park, something spontaneous happens. One by one, the players begin to form a group, focusing back on the door they have just come through, to make sure none of their team-mates have been left behind. Nobody wants to speed off. VIDEO Scroll down to watch footage of England U21s in training before the Croatia clash . England's Young Lions have been bonding while on duty and manager Gareth Southgate is pleased to see it . Once the England U21 squad are all together, hugs and high fives are exchanged as the bonding continues . Once they are all together, hugs and high fives are exchanged; they wish each other good luck for the games they will face at the weekend and make promises to call each other. Nobody is left out of this bonding moment before the convoy of disperses to different parts of the country. To watch the scene unfold is fascinating. Such camaraderie is something you would expect from a club team, not an international squad, but the environment Southgate has created over the last 14 months has allowed this chemistry to build and means these young players are ready for anything. ‘It is special, this team spirit we have, and I think the players will look back on this and realise it was special,’ says Southgate. ‘I remember Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand saying how close they were as a team in the Under-21s under Peter Taylor, but I think there is a special bond around now. ‘It gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch,’ says England U21 manager Southgate . ‘They are really close. They all mix with each other and it is quite unique. I come down in the mornings and individuals will be sitting with one person one day and another the next at the breakfast table. The interaction is brilliant and I believe it is very powerful.’ It is also significantly different to how it was for the last Under-21 group that went to the European Championships in Israel 18 months ago. Back then, Stuart Pearce had a number of individuals whose presence was disruptive, distracting and detrimental to England’s ability to progress. Southgate, however, picks his squad as much on character as he does talent and being blessed with skill alone will no longer secure a player England recognition. If the balance in the dressing room is right, the potential to win is enhanced. ‘It gives you a real chance as it transmits itself on to the pitch,’ Southgate continued. ‘We have carefully selected players who buy into it and if it gets tough these are the intangibles that help you get results. The desire to run that extra five yards for your mate to get a block in that stops a shot.’ The willingness to chase lost causes, to fight and battle, was evident in Wolverhampton on Friday night, as England put themselves on the brink of qualifying for Euro2015, and those qualities will be essential on Tuesday when battle resumes with Croatia in Vinkovci. England have a 2-1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can expect to be challenged like never before. Croatia will be physical, intimidating and will look to bully Southgate’s players; the crowd, meanwhile, will be partisan, the atmosphere hostile. ‘It’s just about nailing everything down,’ said England captain Jack Butland. ‘If we don’t win, we miss out on a major tournament. Who knows what’s going to happen out there? They’re not going to make it easy for us. So any way I can help or any experience I can pass on, I will.’ England have a 2-1 advantage to protect from the first leg but they can definitely expect to be challenged . This, more than anything, will be a test of their mental strength as much as their footballing aptitude but it is an examination England must pass. Southgate is adamant the talent pool of young players in this country is deep but he is aware only positive results will convince a sceptical public. ‘We have to play football but we have got to be prepared for what they will throw at us,’ said Southgate. ‘I don’t suppose Croatia will come at us from the first minute as they know 1-0 will be enough but I believe we will go there and score. ‘It would have been easy for them to panic when they went behind on Friday. We have got brave players. I never see them duck out of challenges. In order to progress, they need to handle these games. They handled it on Friday and they have to show they can handle it again.’","Gareth Southgate's England U21 team emerged 2-1 winners against Croatia .

"On a variety of topics, he’s not exactly known for pulling any punches. And Jeremy Clarkson doesn’t hold back when it comes to discussing his own physical condition. The Top Gear presenter admitted yesterday he has let himself go and put on ‘a lot’ of weight – and that a doctor has branded his fitness level as ‘atrocious’. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Jeremy Clarkson pictured looking streamlined in the 1980s, admitted he has let himself go while speaking on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show yesterday . The presenter, who regularly makes headlines for his on-air remarks, spoke on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show. During the interview, it was pointed out to him that, even with his usual paunch, he appears to have to be ‘a bit’ fatter on the latest Top Gear DVD. Clarkson, 54, immediately corrected Evans, saying: ‘Not a bit – a lot fatter.’ Describing his ample stomach as ‘the product of hard work’, he added: ‘I eat a lot but mostly I’ve cultivated it by sitting down all the time. Literally all the time, I’m now exhausted. The Top Gear presenter says he has put on ‘a lot’ of weight – and that a doctor has branded his fitness level as ‘atrocious’ The Top Gear presenter cuts a trim figure in a holiday snap taken while in Sicily with wife Alex in 1987 . Getting to your studio this morning I had to have a 15- minute rest.’ He added: ‘I had to go for a medical the other week. They put me on a treadmill and described my fitness as atrocious.’ The stars of BBC’s Top Gear have been accused of trying to set fire to the cars that embroiled them in a row in Argentina. The country’s ambassador to the UK has written to the BBC threatening legal action and saying Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow crew members could be guilty of criminal offences. The TV team fled Argentina in October after it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, seen as a reference to the Falklands conflict of 1982. The ambassador, Alicia Castro, said they had acted illegally by abandoning and trying to torch the Porsche and two other luxury vehicles. The BBC said: ‘We absolutely refute the suggestion the Top Gear team intended to set fire to the vehicles.’ But Clarkson claims he is not concerned if his weight or outspokenness – he was unrepentant after being drawn into a series of racism rows this year – did lose him the job he has held for more than a decade on the BBC Two show, saying he would simply ‘do something else’. Earlier this year, it emerged that Clarkson did not always cut such a portly figure. Photos from the 1980s showed the presenter as a far skinnier young man, complete with tiny shorts and scrawny legs. These days the father-of-three has painted himself as a man unable to shy away from indulgence. He has claimed he cannot write his scripts without ample supplies of alcohol, cigarettes and caffeine, adding: ‘The amount you drink when you’re writing, that’s the thing that worries me.’ And in a recent newspaper column, he wrote: ‘I get tired pulling on my socks these days. So, if I want to live much past the end of next weekend [my doctor] says I must give up smoking, drink less, walk more, lose weight. But in typical nonchalant style, he said of his role on Top Gear: ‘If somebody decides one day that actually you really have got too fat or you really are awful then you do something else.’","TV star confessed that he has let himself go and put on ‘a lot’ of weight .

"After years of study at elite universities, you could presume that our brightest students would emerge knowing how to apply for a job. But top employers are struggling to fill graduate vacancies due to a glut of sloppy applications. A leading recruiter said students about to leave university take a ‘scattergun’ approach to sending out CVs rather than properly researching each position they apply for. 'Scattergun': Employers attacked graduates for not paying attention in their applications . Some simply cut and paste paragraphs between cover letters, and even mistakenly refer to rival companies. They do not always understand the basic requirements of the job they are applying for or even what the role involves. This is despite the fact that many applications are from final year students at leading universities who are expected to achieve at least a 2:1 degree. Research carried out by the Association of Graduate Recruiters – which represents leading firms including Procter & Gamble, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Rolls-Royce UK – has cast doubt on the calibre of today’s university leavers. The AGR took a snapshot poll of 68 members ahead of its larger annual summer survey. It found a predicted 10 per cent increase in the number of graduate jobs available on previous year. Nine out of ten employers said they still had vacancies for this year’s recruitment round. When asked to explain why the positions remained unfulfilled, more than half said they had increased the number of graduate jobs they had available. Better standard: Employers insisted students needed to research their applications better . But 67 per cent said the applications they had received so far had been ‘of insufficient quality’. One employer said: ‘It is important that graduates take their applications seriously and not just assume they will get an interview because of their grades and the university they attended. ‘They need to make real efforts in researching before answering the application questions. We do sometimes see that an answer might have been copied and pasted from another application, especially when asked the question, “Why have you applied for [this company]?” We sometimes see answers that say “I’m applying to [rival company]”.’ Another employer said ‘better written applications’ were needed. The study found the highest percentage of vacancies were in IT (26 per cent); electrical/electronic engineering (23 per cent) and general management (18 per cent). Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the AGR, said graduates ‘are not taking enough time over their applications’. He advised: ‘There are graduate vacancies out there and making fewer, well targeted applications rather than taking  a scattergun approach to finding a job will pay dividends.’ Young people struggle to learn foreign languages because they don’t have a proper grasp of English, a former Oxford don says. Too many are ignorant of their own language due to ‘deplorable deficiencies’ in the education system which leaves them unable to tell an adjective from an adverb. Professor Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, now professor of history at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, USA, said students’ widespread ignorance of basic English is hampering the learning of other languages such as French. The 63-year-old British-born historian told the Times Higher Education magazine: ‘As university teachers in the UK know, most young Britons are unequipped to wield their own language with concision, elegance, exactitude or power. ‘If you cannot speak or write your own language well, you are never going to be able to manage to master another.’","Research found applicants pasting wholesale from previous attempts .

"Chelsea are fast becoming the new Manchester United. The red which used to dominate the Barclays Premier League for so many years is slowly fading to blue. Chelsea's utter, unbeaten dominance of the league this season has echoes of the bygone era of Sir Alex Ferguson. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Diego Costa (second from right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring at Stamford Bridge . Jose Mourinho (right) is hoping to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and bring trophies to Chelsea . Manchester United last lifted the Premier League trophy in 2013, with Chelsea on course to win it this season . So far a manager and team have failed to fill the vast void he left behind when he retired in 2013. But Mourinho looks to be finally doing just that this campaign. His Chelsea team are sweeping aside the rest and in the process they are becoming the club and manager every other fan loves to hate. The Portuguese has even taken to being unnecessarily prickly and moody in his post and pre-match press conference, despite the team remaining unbeaten. That atmosphere was a common theme of Ferguson's reign, which the Chelsea boss appears to be mirroring. He'll probably be banning the BBC, soon. Will he now forge an empire for many years to come in the blue part of London? Mourinho gestures during his side's convincing 3-0 victory against London rivals Tottenham on Wednesday . Summer signing Diego Costa shows off his physical side with a swipe at Sunderland defender Wes Brown . Manchester United players including Roy Keane (right) crowd around referee Andy D'Urso in January, 2000 . Mourinho has stated he plans to stay at Stamford Bridge for a long time now and they have made it clear they want him to. 'I'm not here thinking about my next move because I don't want to have a next move,' he told the Evening Standard at the start of the year. 'I will have a next move if and when Chelsea decides it's time for that. 'I'm not chasing new experiences, trying to find where I like it more, where I can make new things for my career — no. It's a completely different perspective.' He has an older family now, a 15-year son and 18-year-old daughter, who he does not want to keep moving around to different countries, having lived in Spain, Italy and England over the past decade. 'I'm not a person with a big social life,' he added. 'I just want the simple things in life but even the simple things I lost in Italy, Spain and Portugal. 'I think London is the only place in Europe where I can keep these little things of life. I can go to school and wait for my son and daughter and the parents feel me as another parent.

'I can go to walk on Sloane Street or Old Bond Street and if somebody disturbs me it is not an English person for sure. It's some tourist that sees me and they can't control themselves. The English person is much more polite and respectful in relation to the private life of the person.' All the signs are pointing to Mourinho starting to form his own empire, similar to that which Ferguson built up over 27 years. Chelsea have made their intentions to keep him very clear, too. 'I hope he will stay 10 years,' former Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said at the start of this season. 'Having the security of Jose is great for me - he knows the club, knows me. Jose can deal with the media in a different way from some of the other managers we've had. 'He takes the pressure not only away from the players but also from the club. He allows us to manage and me in particular to drive.' This could be the start of something major – the Premier League could be awash with blue for many years to come.

"Thousands of stargazers cast their eyes to the heavens last night to watch the Perseid meteor shower. Across the UK people turned into amateur astronomers as they looked out for the 'shooting stars', a result of material falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle.

Although the number of visible meteors is always hard to predict accurately, stargazers were expected to see one at least every few minutes. They mostly appear as fleeting flashes lasting less than a second, but the brightest ones leave behind trails of vaporised gases and glowing air molecules that may take a few seconds to fade. Dr Caroline Smith, Meteorites Curator at the Natural History Museum in London, said: 'We are learning more and more about comets from various observations using telescopes around the world and space missions, such as Stardust, which has collected cometary dust particles and returned them for study in labs on Earth. 'Scientists around the world, including those at the Natural History Museum and other UK research institutions are actively studying comets to better understand the birth and formation of the Solar System and the potential (or not) risk of an impact with Earth in the future.

"Prince Charles has sensationally likened Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. In a withering verdict on the actions of the Russian president in Ukraine, he told a woman who lost relatives in the Nazi Holocaust: ‘And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler.’ The prince’s extraordinary intervention is certain to cause international controversy. Scroll down for video . Strained diplomacy: Vladimir Putin is to snub Prince Charles at next month's ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day after the royal likened the Russian president to Adolf Hitler . It is likely to be seen as a criticism of the West for failing to confront Mr Putin over his seizure of Crimea.  The annexation was the first by a major power in Europe since 1945. Observers have compared the crisis in Ukraine with Hitler’s takeovers of Czechoslovakia and Poland. They have pointed to the similar use of disguised special forces to stir up tensions in disputed areas.

The 78-year-old was born in what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, a key flashpoint in the Second World War. A free city under the terms of the Versailles Treaty after the end of . the Great War, it was seized by the Nazis on the first day of fighting . in 1939.

Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, enjoys a cup of tea as she visits Prince Edward Home, a long-term care facility in Charlottetown . Prince Charles, pictured today with his wife Camilla, made the comments during the royal couple's visit to the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia . It was heard by several witnesses. Mother-of-three Mrs Ferguson said: . ‘I had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own . family background and how I came to Canada. ‘The prince then said “And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler”. ‘I . must say that I agree with him and am sure a lot of people do. I was . very surprised that he made the comment as I know they [members of the . Royal Family] aren’t meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt . and honest. ‘I told the prince that while my family . and I were lucky to get a permit to travel, many of my other relatives . had permits but were unable to get out before war broke out on September . 1.

Russia and China were last night frantically haggling over the ‘deal of the century’ on gas and investment. Putin hopes to secure £240billion in guaranteed energy exports to China, making Russia far less dependent on Europe. The two sides were edging towards a ‘significant joint declaration’, including military plans, although Russian sources said they had  so far failed to agree on gas prices. As relations between Russia and the West deteriorated rapidly, China issued a friendly statement on Ukraine to Moscow and the nations conducted a joint naval exercise. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the prince should be 'free to express himself'. 'I . obviously can’t comment on a conversation which was clearly a private a . private conversation and I’m not going to start comparing one period of . European history to another, but Prince Charles is able, I would have . thought, to be free to express himself. 'I . have never been of the view that if you are a member of the Royal . family somehow you have to enter into some sort of Trappist vow of . silence,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'I . think he is entitled to his views, but don’t know whether those were . his views because I just don’t think providing a running commentary on . private conversations is useful to anybody.' Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton sparked uproar in Washington recently when she said very much the same as the heir to the throne. Lashing out at Moscow’s plan to issue passports to ethnic Russians in Crimea, she said: ‘Now, if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 1930s.’ What is unusual, however, is for a senior royal to express an opinion publicly on such a clearly sensitive diplomatic issue. Charles is often criticised for meddling in domestic affairs of state as well as the infamous ‘black spider’ memos – so called because of his scrawling handwriting – that he is said to frequently write to ministers on issues close to his heart. But international issues, particularly one as sensitive as this, are considered taboo. A spokesman for Clarence House said last night they would not comment on a private conversation.

The ex-Baltimore Ravens running back is making his case to return to the field after the league indefinitely suspended him from the game after footage emerged of him knocking his then fiancee unconscious earlier this year.

Scroll down for video . Disgraced former NFL star Ray Rice and wife Janay put on a united front as they arrived for day one of a two day hearing with football bosses in New York City on Wednesday . Rice, 27, claims he has been punished twice for the same offense, a one-punch knockout of his then-fiancee Janay Palmer during a February altercation at an Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is expected to attend the two days of hearings in New York, initially gave Rice a two-game suspension for the fight, but in September after video of the punch went viral, suspended the player indefinitely. Rice says he explained the incident to Goodell, but the commissioner claims his account was ‘ambiguous’ and was brought into focus when the video of the punch materialized. Goodell said he had not seen the video from inside the casino's elevator until it surfaced on the internet. As well as the NFL commissioner, league security chief Jeffery Miller, Ravens President Dick Cass and Rice are among the key witnesses expected to testify at the two-day hearing. Rice's wife, Janay, might also testify. The ex-Baltimore Ravens running back is making his case to return to the NFL after the league indefinitely suspended him after footage emerged of him knocking his then fiancee unconscious earlier this year . Rice says he explained the incident to Goodell, but the commissioner claims his account was ‘ambiguous’ and was brought into focus when the video of the punch materialized . The Ravens cut Rice and his $35 million contract, amid a wave of public criticism that the league had turned a blind eye to domestic violence by players. Other Ravens executives and members of the players union are expected to speak during the hearing before arbitrator Barbara Jones, a former federal judge. The hearing will be closed to the press and public and Jones has issued a gag order forbidding participants from discussing it publicly. Goodell admitted that he ‘didn't get it right’ when he suspended Rice for just two games, and the league has since strengthened its penalties for domestic abuse. The league also hired Lisa Friel, the former head of sex crimes prosecutions in the New York district attorney's office, to help the NFL deal with domestic violence and sexual assault. The player's legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice should only be suspended for a maximum of six games. Back to work? Experts are predicting that Rice's suspension will be dropped, leaving him ample time to find another team to join before the season is even halfway over . 'Wife beater': Rice was put on indefinite suspension on September 8 after surveillance footage was released showing the moment he struck his now-wife Janay in an Atlantic City elevator .

"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has confirmed his interest in signing Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings, with the Gunners set to launch a January bid for £8million-rated star. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel takes a closer look at the 21-year-old who has been watched by every Premier League club this season. He's a new name? Yes, he's only hit the headlines over the past few months following a string of brilliant displays at left back for Ipswich towards the back end of last season and the start of this campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: We are not close to signing Tyrone Mings . Versatile Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings is wanted by Arsenal in the January transfer window . What are his attributes? At 6ft 3ins he has the physical stature to deal with the rigours of Premier League football. He certainly has the pace too, his leggy stride eats up the ground effortlessly. As is a necessity for all modern-day full-backs, Mings is more than adept at joining in attack. Why do Arsenal need another left back; they've already got Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal? Good point. Interestingly though, Arsenal don't see Mings as a long-term left back. They have designs on moulding him into a central defender. He has been known to fill in at right back, too. His versatility is a key selling point for Arsenal. Mings has played most of his football at left back this season but Arsene Wenger wants him to play centrally . Makes a change for Arsenal not to be signing a youngster from Southampton? True. But there is a twist; Mings actually started his academy career at St Mary's joining the Saints in 2001 as an eight-year-old. But he was forced to leave the south-coast club in 2009. He then spent spells at non-league outfits Yale Town and Chippenham Town before joining Ipswich for £10,000 in 2013. How much will he cost? Ipswich are demanding a hefty fee, between £8m-£10m, for Mings next month. Quite a mark up on the £10,000 they paid to bring him to Portman Road. Arsenal have been made aware of Ipswich's valuation. Crystal Palace failed with a £3million bid for Mings during the summer transfer window . Was there interest in him during the summer transfer window? Crystal Palace were very keen on the youngster in the summer and had a £3million bid turned down. The decision to reject the offer looks a very good decision now. Mings' valuation has sky-rocketed, with Ipswich likely to get at least double the £3m offered by Palace. So is it just Arsenal who are interested? No. He's been watched by every single Premier League club - but Arsenal seem the most serious in their interest. Palace remain interested, but know they are fighting a losing battle with the Gunners certain to move for Mings next month. Chelsea have also watched Mings of late. His dad, Adie, is actually a scout for the Blues.","Tyrone Mings has been watched by every Premier League club .

"Public opinion against the Afghan War has topped discontent seen during even the darkest days of the Iraq War. Almost 12 years into the conflict, 67 per cent of Americans responding to a recent poll agree that the war in Afghanistan hasn’t been worth fighting. Only 28 per cent of Americans believe the war was worth fighting, but an unexpected 53 per cent are against removing all troops from the country. In short, acrimony towards the Afghan War now exceeds the most negative opinions seen against the Iraq War in 2007, during which almost 1,000 US soldiers died carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom. Americans tiring of Afghanistan: Soldiers carrying the remains of Sgt. Stefan M. Smith, who was killed July 23 when his unit was attacked with an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan . The two-thirds against the war based their beliefs on examining cost versus benefit, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. This sentiment tops the record 66 per cent of people polled by ABC News/Washington Post to be against the Iraq War in April 2007. Also, unlike in Iraq, the US received overwhelming support invading Afghanistan from countries around the world, which stood in stark contrast to the opposition voiced against the US assault on Iraq led by France, Germany and the United Nations, the latter of which called the military action 'illegal' at the time. Despite only 28 per cent of Americans responding to the poll believing that the war was worth fighting, a surprising 53 per cent are in favor of not removing all troops from Afghanistan, instead supporting the idea that some stay behind to train Afghan forces after the planned 2014 troop exodus. With only 43 per cent of respondents believing the Afghan War has contributed to the long-term security of the United States, sentiment against the conflict is spread across most demographics. It is worth noting, though, that almost 60 per cent of Americans polled in June believed the war did contribute to the long-term security of the US – one month after Navy SEALS killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Weary: Americans are have grown increasingly tired of US troops being involved in Afghanistan . Essentially split on the issue, 51 per cent of Republicans believe the war isn’t worth fighting, according to the poll. An overwhelming 74 per cent of Democrats and 71 pe rcent of independents are also against the war. The United States has seen the deaths of over 2,100 troops since the beginning of the Afghanistan War in 2001, according to military records. By comparison, over 4,400 US soldiers have died since the beginning of the Iraq War.","Sentiment against the Afghan War tops that against the Iraq War despite Afghanistan seeing less than half the US troop deaths as Iraq .

This is a crucial week for Rodgers, as this Group B game is followed by a date with Chelsea, but he is prepared to leave his captain out of the team on Tuesday. Gerrard has played every minute in the Premier League and Champions League this season but that appears likely to end against the holders. When asked if Chelsea was the focus for Gerrard, Rodgers said: ‘In Steven’s case, if he is playing on Saturday I have to look at what is the priority for him and us.’ Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard faces missing out on the Champions League clash with Real Madrid .

Gerrard (left) cracks a smile during a warm-up in training as Glen Johnson (right) stretches off . Liverpool’s manager has admitted the Barclays Premier League is his priority but, even so, it is a shock that he is ready to leave out Gerrard, who has made 127 European appearances in his career. And the surprise may not end with Gerrard, as Raheem Sterling could also be left on the bench. ‘If we want to develop, we need to ensure we are in the top four. But we also want to qualify from this group and we will never know if these players can perform if we don’t put them in the team.’ Liverpool spent more than £100m during the summer and Rodgers is looking to see whether Adam Lallana, who cost £23.7m, and £20m winger Lazar Markovic have what it takes to thrive at Anfield. Rodgers said: ‘We have spent an awful lot of money on players to come in and give them an opportunity. If at the end of this cycle of games they haven’t performed, they can never say they haven’t been given a chance.

Jordan Henderson, who will captain the side in Gerrard’s absence, said Liverpool’s younger players must show they can take the club forward. Henderson said: ‘He said: 'We have got people criticising us, we know we are not at our best but this is a great opportunity to show that we are a top side.

'We feel we are coming to a brilliant stadium and we want to put on a performance.' And, when asked about Gerrard, Henderson responded: 'He is a massive player for us he is our captain, our leader, role model. Hopefully he will be a big player for many years to come.' Despite his likely decision to rest Gerrard, Rodgers is adamant his Reds side are heading to Madrid to win. 'We are certainly not coming here as a team expecting to lose and then look at the other games as games to qualify,' Rodgers said. 'For us, we see it as an opportunity.

'The key, even though we know it is tough, is to make sure we are compact and disciplined in our game. 'I think we showed in the previous game, although the score was 3-0, we can still have moments when we can hurt Real Madrid and that will be the idea (on Tuesday).

"Liverpool fans would never forgive Steven Gerrard if he moved to a Premier League rival, according to Jamie Carragher. But the Kop legend is confident his former team-mate will thrash out a new deal and remain at Anfield beyond the end of the season. Gerrard is out of contract at the end of the campaign and has no plans to retire, with Manchester City and New York Cosmos already linked with a move for the Reds skipper.

Gerrard could be rested for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday . Midfielder has made almost 700 appearances for Liverpool after progressing through the ranks . However, Carragher says the 34-year-old could wreck his legendary status among Liverpool fans if he quit for another English club. 'No, I don't think they would [forgive him],' Carragher told Monday Night Football, 'but I don't think Steven Gerrard would move to another [English] club. 'He's a local lad. If he moved on I think it would be abroad, maybe the States or Europe. I think they will get it all sorted out in the next couple of weeks.'

"FA Cup hero Craig Robinson gave Warrington Town supporters the perfect excuse to get plastered after shocking Exeter City at a bouncing Cantilever Park. Robinson, brother of MK Dons manager Karl who was in the crowd to see his younger sibling play, got the decisive touch to David Mannix's seventh-minute corner and was instantly mobbed by jubilant team-mates.

Subs: Keohane, Davies,Nichols, Hamon, Riley-Lowe, Tillson, Jay. Attendance: 2,400 . Referee: David Coote (Nottinghamshire) At the full-time whistle there was an old-fashioned joyous pitch invasion - and nobody cared. This was an FA Cup first round clash straight out of central casting. Warrington Town's ground on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal normally attract crowds of 200 to watch games against the likes of Bamber Bridge and Padiham. To see it crammed with 2,400 fans was incredible. The day's torrential rain left the pitch wet and muddy - just like the television cameras like it. The BBC had chosen to show this tie to mark the beginning of their new FA Cup contract. They were after an upset and even had a famous cup surname growling on the touchline – Shaun Reid, the Warrington manager whose brother Peter won the trophy in 1984 with Everton. Reid's players – a fitness instructor, plasterer and pizza delivery driver among them – earn an average of £70-a-week out of football and were determined to enjoy their night in the spotlight. This was the first time the club had reached this stage of the FA Cup in their 65-year history and it had already taken them seven matches to get here. They set out the traps quickly and Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym had to rush from goal to save at the feet of Scott Metcalfe. After seven minutes, they scored and the roof nearly came off the stadium's one tiny stand. It was a goal in finest cup traditions. Former Liverpool trainee Mannix thumped a corner into a crowded six-yard box and centre-half Robinson got the decisive touch with his head. The scorer howled with sheer adrenaline and Reid let the Warrington staff and substitutes out of the dug-out for a mini-pitch invasion. An overcome Robinson said afterwards: 'I have been dreaming of this since I was a little kid. I was never lucky enough to play at the top level but to have my family here to see this is incredible. We just believed in ourselves as a team. 'We had to turn the car around in the morning because my nine-year-old daughter Darcy said she'd forgotten to bless me. So we ran back into the house, she got the medals out and the holy water, and she blessed me. And look what it's done!' 'Was it amazing? Was it incredible? Was it unbelievable? No, it was much more than that,' added Reid. Warrington's match at their new Cantilever Park ground was a 2,400 sell-out against Exeter .

"Neil Lennon celebrated success in his first derby match as a manager England as Bolton blew away neighbours Wigan. Lennon knows a thing or two about local rivalries thanks to his four years in charge of Celtic and whatever he said at half-time in Lancashire did the trick. Goals from Max Clayton, Craig Davies and Lee Chung-Yong in 15 second-half minutes gave the hosts three points to heap pressure on Wigan boss Uwe Rosler.

Irish winger James McClean, booed for his decision to again not wear a poppy on his shirt, set up Callum McManaman's consolation goal for the visitors as the pressure increased on manager Uwe Rosler. Rosler has been in charge of Wigan for 11 months and after signs of promise last season, in particular an eight-match winning run in February and March, a better start to his first full campaign in charge was expected. Lennon has now won four of six matches since taking the helm at Bolton last month. What his time as Celtic manager did not prepare him for was being at the wrong end of the table. But Bolton are now above Wigan and out of the relegation – at least until 4.45pm on Saturday. The problem for both sides has been scoring goals and each of these clubs had scored just 17 goals in 16 matches before kick-off.

Shaun Maloney should have put the visitors ahead in the third minute after Callum McManaman's accurate chipped cross to the back post but the former Celtic forward volleyed into the turf and wide. McManaman then went close himself. He drifted in from the left wing and let fly from 30 yards but saw his effort clip the top of the cross bar with Bolton keeper Andrew Lonergan well beaten. It was a breathless first half, punctuated by moments of fleeting quality. Bolton fashioned their first sight of goal midway through it when Lee Chung-Yong's through ball released Max Clayton but Scot Carson was equal to the shot with a solid save. Wigan's early menace faded as the half wore on but they sparked back into life in first-half stoppage time when McManaman was unlucky not to put his side ahead. This time popping up on the right-hand side of the penalty area, the 23-year-old shifted the ball on to his left foot to shoot only to see his low curling effort strike the outside of the post. Wigan were punished within five minutes of the restart. Clayton headed the ball down to Lee, whose return pass sent the striker clear and his finish through the legs of Carson was befitting of an old pro.

Wigan were reeling and the second goal arrived when Liam Feeney's high cross was powered in by Craig Davies' header and Leon Barnett's miserable night got worse when his push on Matt Mills led to a penalty, which Lee converted coolly. The reception was not welcoming for McClean when he entered the fray as a substitute, but the Derry-born wide player provided a rare moment of quality for the visitors. His first telling contribution with the ball gave Wigan's fans something to cheer. The Irishman crossed from the left and McManaman finally added a finish that did not come back off the woodwork.

Rosler issued a damning verdict of Wigan's second-half capitulation, calling the performance 'embarrassing' and accusing his own players of giving up. He said: 'Second half, I have to be honest - Bolton won the game by pure willpower, desire, energy, going to the limit and forcing the issue, forcing the mistakes and forcing the goals - all credit to them. 'We just folded altogether. And for that I have no understanding whatsoever. 'I take responsibility. I'm not blaming anybody but when we analyse the second half, we gave up. I apologise to the chairman, I apologise to the supporters. 'It's very, very seldom in the last 10 years that I had a team who gave up in the way we gave up in the second half. 'I felt embarrassed by the performance that we have given in the second half. 'I'm not sure that meant as much for some of my players as it meant for our supporters and for our chairman. 'In any competitive game of football you never give up, you always fight to the end. To give up at Bolton in the second half in a derby game - it is unforgivable.' Wigan were leapfrogged by Bolton, who began the evening in the bottom three, and there is a very real possibility that Latics, 18 months removed from winning the FA Cup, head into next week's international break in the second tier's relegation zone. When asked whether he feared chairman Dave Whelan could be searching for a new manager over the next fortnight as a result, Rosler replied: 'You'll have to ask the chairman. I am fearless, but there's always a risk when I started (as a manager) 10 years ago and it is still the same.'","Callum McManaman hit the woodwork twice in the first half .

"Almost a century ago, patients young and old suffering from tuberculosis would be sent here to be isolated - so they could not spread their deadly infection. It was then abandoned due to asbestos, leaving Glenn Dale sanatorium and isolation hospital in Maryland a maze of empty corridors, abandoned wards and deserted buildings. It is a large facility, consisting of 23 buildings on 216 acres, that was built in 1934. The first patients admitted were mainly children from poor families in Washington D.C - but additional funding from Congress allowed them to treat adults too. At its peak, it housed around 500 sufferers, but after the TB epidemic had died out in the 1960s the numbers dropped - allowing staff to treat other patients with chronic illnesses.  It was then closed in 1981 . These photos by Pablo Maurer show most of the morgues, wards and horrifying seclusion rooms have been overrun with ivy while the walls in the nurseries and children's rooms have been covered in graffiti. Quarantine and exposure to sunlight and fresh air were two preferred treatments for TB - so nearly every floor has an open air breeze-way or solarium.

"James Wilson was on target but Manchester United missed the opportunity to regain top spot in the Under 21 Premier League as they were beaten by Leicester City on Monday night. Jack Barmby's stoppage time winner inflicted United's first defeat of the season as the Foxes lifted themselves off the bottom of the table. The defeat - inflicted by a former Old Trafford academy product in Barmby - leaves United trailing their Manchester rivals City by a point at the top, though they still have two matches in hand. James Wilson scored for Manchester United's Under 21s but they were beaten 3-2 by Leicester City . Manchester United: Amos; Vermijl, Thorpe, Blackett, James; Janko, Pearson, A.

Scorers: Dodoo 37; Albrighton 45; Barmby 90 . 18-year-old hotshot Wilson, who came on for Robin van Persie late in Sunday's Manchester derby, found the net after only eight minutes at Leigh after a smart one-two with Saidy Janko. His clinical left-foot finish will once again give Louis van Gaal reasons to believe Wilson is up to leading the line in the first team. Leicester, who had shown their class in a 6-2 rout of Man City recently, responded strongly and Ben Amos was required to make saves from Marc Albrighton and Jak McCourt. At the other end, United skipper Tom Thorpe, who could be called upon to fill in at centre-half for Van Gaal's team following Chris Smalling's suspension and Marcos Rojo's suspension, showed his offensive qualities by striking the outside of the post following an Andreas Pereira corner. The visitors equalised on 37 minutes when Joe Dodoo rounded off a slick move that involved Anthony Knockaert by rolling an accurate shot past Amos. Leicester were dominant and Tom Hopper forced an excellent save from Amos with a shot that deflected off Thorpe, before a Knockaert free-kick rattled the crossbar when the United goalkeeper tipped the ball onto it. United manager Louis van Gaal may have to call upon more of his young players in the weeks to come . Manchester United missed the opportunity to regain top spot in the Under 21 Premier League after the loss . A goal seemed inevitable and City led at half-time thanks to Albrighton's unstoppable shot from a half-cleared corner. United needed a response and it arrived eight minutes into the second-half - Ben Pearson initiated a move and found Will Keane, whose powerful shot was deflected in off Leicester's Alie Sesay for 2-2. Both teams saw chances come and go in the second period but ultimately Leicester won it in stoppage time when Barmby's deflected shot from the edge of the box deceived Amos.

"A man who who was fined for refusing to cut back ivy and weeds he let grow on his house for ten years has finally cut them off. Ken Mould, 50, left the plants to grow for so long that the house was virtually hidden from neighbours. It became so overrun that his chimney could not be seen over the foliage. And the wilderness extended so far . forward from the house, in a cul-de-sac in Rugely, Staffordshire, that . the shape of the building could no longer be made out from the pavement. Ken Mould, 50, has finally trimmed the hedge (left) that engulfed his house (right) after ten years . Before: Mr Mould was fined £1,000 by Stafford Magistrates' Court after refusing to trim his home on council orders . After: Ten months on, the house has become visible after Mr Mould cut back the ivy and weeds . But, despite the fact the roof and first-floor windows were entirely hidden under the ivy, Mr Mould continued to live in the house with his wife, Diane, 50. Then, in February this year, he was fined £1,000 at Stafford Magistrates’ Court after ignoring council orders to trim it. Almost a year on, he appears to have finally complied with the order, and the house can now be seen in full. Council . planning officer Mazer Aqbal said Mr Mould had been ordered to get rid . of the ivy from the front of the property, including the windows and . doors. He was also told to remove all vegetation from his garage roof at the back of the house and to clear the front lawn. Despite the fact the roof and first-floor windows were completely covered, the Moulds lived in the house . The family were able to access the house, with the front door visible underneath the foliage . He said: ‘Basically he has been told to make it look how you would expect a house to look - at the moment you can’t tell whether you’re looking at the front or the back of the building.’ The breakthrough will come as a relief to neighbours who have described the 'nightmare' of living next to him and expressed surprise that the couple and their daughter were not embarrassed by its appearance. Neighbours described the nightmare of living on the same street as the father-of-one. James Partridge, 35, said: ‘It’s a relief he’s shaved it off, that was an eyesore to live next to for so long. ‘I don’t know how they lived in there, must have cost a fortune in lighting. ‘The windows were completely obscured, I wonder if he’ll leave it now again or keep it trimmed.’ Then first floor windows in the house are now visible after the plant growth was trimmed this year . One resident, who did not wish to be named, said in February: 'That thing brings down the house prices for all our street - it's an eyesore' One resident, who did not wish to be named, said in February: ‘That thing brings down the house prices for all our street – it’s an eyesore, I don’t know how they can live in there. ‘Whenever I see someone emerge from that mess I do a double take, they must either live in complete darkness or spend a fortune on lighting. They added: ‘It’s crazy how they could let their property get into such a mess. It’s a nightmare to live by. 'Their . daughter has gone off to university - I can’t imagine her coming back, . that’s an embarrassing place to bring your friends or boyfriend back . to.' Another neighbour added: ‘Keith’s a real character, a bit of a rebel without a cause. I do like him, but he lives by his own rules. ‘It would be a bit off-putting for potential buyers wanting to move in next door. He’s been locked in a wrangle with the council for a while now. ‘But he’s a decent bloke really - once that ivy takes hold it’s a big job to shift it. You’ve got to feel for him in a way.’","Ken Mould, 50, left plants to grow so long his house became hidden .

"Manchester City will go head-to-head with Bayern Munich in a £20million-plus battle for Germany winger Marco Reus at the end of the season. While Reus’s club Borussia Dortmund are adamant he will not be allowed to leave in the January window, they are resigned to losing him next summer because of an escape clause in his contract. The 25-year-old’s deal runs until 2017 but has a release clause enabling him to join any club who meet Dortmund’s asking price of £19.5m.

But I do not want to cause unrest in Dortmund.' In response Klopp told Bild: 'In a period where both teams are at the top, it's fun to reply to any questions,' adding that he knows 'nothing of what is going on right now' regarding Reus' contract situation.

"The tale of Neil Warnock interrupting Mark Clattenburg’s drive to watch Ed Sheeran is one that amused the manager of Gosport Borough. Life is different in the Conference South, which is why Alex Pike loves it so much. Pike is the policeman-turned-manager of Gosport, who will make Colchester United ‘giants’ for a day in the FA Cup first round proper. ‘We’re not intimidated but any club who play in League One look big to us,’ Pike said. Gosport Borough boss Alex Pike is looking forward to his side's clash against Colchester United . Premier League official Mark Clattenburg broke strict protocol on travelling to games . Clattenburg had broken another rule by speaking to Palace manager Neil Warnock on the phone in his car . Pike’s is a world of £100-a-week footballers, a place where a Gosport fan cuts his hedges, his assistant manager does the guttering, a former player did his wiring and referees can — unlike Clattenburg — take a phone call from a manager without getting in trouble. ‘That Warnock story was funny,’ Pike (right), 53, said. ‘One of the referees at our level — used to be a player of mine, actually — runs a plastering business. He did the walls in our house. He did a good job. ‘Come to think of it, being a manager has been great in that sense — I’ve had the bases covered whenever I needed work done. Over the years I have had a brickie, roofers, scaffolders, IT consultants, bankers. ‘Mick Catlin, my assistant manager, runs a guttering company. He has done my gutters. It’s a community club and within it we help each other out. Quite nice, that. ‘A fan did my gardening the other week as well. We have these big hedges and it was a two-day job. He stayed the night, watched the FA Cup draw with me and finished up the next morning.’ Pike has players from different occupations such as roofers, bankers and scaffolders . Conference side Gosport are in the first round proper of the FA Cup since their formation in 1944 . It was that draw, featuring Gosport in the first round proper for the only time since their formation in 1944, that had this old navy town looking out to sea. As recently as seven years ago they were in the ninth tier, but Pike’s arrival in 2005 has led to three promotions. They made it to Wembley last season, losing the FA Trophy final to Cambridge United, and will go second in the league if they win their two games in hand. A £125,000 playing surface was recently laid at the 1,000-seat Privett Park and their opinionated manager has been known to have the occasional touchline row. He’s previously been labelled ‘the Jose Mourinho of non-League football’ and admits to channelling the spirit of Brian Clough. ‘When we go to Nottingham I stand by his statue and give him a hug and have a little whisper in his ear,’ said Pike, who was part of the police’s serious crime unit but left in 1991 after a car crash nearly paralysed him. ‘In the last four seasons it’s come true and this year I asked him to get us to the third round.’ Former Southampton striker Matt Paterson used to rub shoulders with Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale . To pull it off Pike will rely, among others, on a squad that includes a hairdresser in midfielder Adam Wilde, a waiter in goalkeeper Nathan Ashmore and Dan Woodward, a scaffolder. Weekly wages vary between £100 and £300 per player. ‘Our playing budget is bottom five in the division,’ said Pike. But there is pedigree. One of his strikers, Matt Paterson, was named player of the year in Southampton’s famed academy in 2008 and once lived with Gareth Bale. ‘All the young players were living together in a big lodge,’ Paterson said. ‘Gareth was really funny, a nice guy. He used to be really good on FIFA — now his face is on the box, which is a bit mad.’ The 25-year-old made the Southampton first team and played almost 100 Football League games across numerous loan spells. He was sent off in a 2009 FA Cup tie against Manchester United for fouling Nemanja Vidic. ‘Hopefully this goes a bit better,’ he said. So far his season has yielded 13 goals in 16 games. ‘Coming down to this level has made me love football again. I couldn’t be happier for Gareth, Nathan Dyer, Adam Lallana and other guys who were coming through at Southampton at that time. ‘For me, I’m happy. I am playing, scoring goals and have a Cup match to look forward to. If I do well, maybe I’ll get another chance at a higher level. ‘Let’s see. It’s the FA Cup and everyone has a dream.’","Alex Pike has stated his side will not be intimidated by Colchester United .

"Shoe trouble: Part of Imelda Marcos' shoe collection, left behind after she and her dictator husband were driven out of the Philippines, has been badly damaged by termites, floods and general neglect . She is famous for amassing a prized shoe collection that most women would kill for. But part of Imelda Marcos' shoe stash, left behind after she and her dictator husband were driven out of the Philippines, has been badly damaged by termites, floods and general neglect, officials said today. The Marcoses fled the Philippines at . the climax of the army-backed 'people power' revolt in 1986 and left behind staggering amounts . of personal belongings, clothes and art objects at the palace, including . at least 1,220 pairs of the former first lady's shoes. Among the damaged shoes are a pair of white Pierre Cardin heels, the sole of one destroyed by termites.  Other shoes have . been warped out of shape or messed by stains. Hundreds of pieces of late strongman . Ferdinand Marcos' clothing, including the formal native see-through . Barong shirts he wore during his two-decade rule, have also begun to . gather mould and fray after being stored for years without protection at . the presidential palace and Manila's National Museum, officials added. Ironically, more than 150 boxes of . clothes, dress accessories and shoes of the Marcoses were transferred to . the National Museum for safekeeping two years ago after termites, . humidity and mould threatened the apparel at the riverside palace. There they deteriorated further as the . fragile boxes were abandoned in a padlocked museum hall that had no . facilities to protect them. Last month the pieces were further damaged . by tropical storm rains from a gushing leak in the ceiling, museum . officials said. Mould: Among the damaged shoes in the former First Lady's collection were these white Pierre Cardin heels . Damage: Ironically more than 150 boxes of clothes, dresses and shoes of the Marcoses were transferred to Manila's National Museum for safekeeping two years ago but were damaged in a flood last month . Lost relics: As well as shoes, long gowns, known as 'Terno', once worn by Imelda Marcos, are among the items to be damaged . Museum staffers, who were not aware the boxes contained precious mementoes from the Marcoses, opened the hall on the fourth floor of the building after noticing water pouring out from under the door. They were shocked to see Marcos' shoes and gowns when they opened the wet boxes, officials said. Workers hurriedly moved the boxes to a dry room and some were later brought to a museum laboratory, where a small team of curators scrambled to assess the extent of the damage, a process that may take months given the huge volume of the apparel. Some items have obviously been damaged by termites and mould beyond repair, according to museum curator Orlando Abinion, who is heading the effort. Impressive: Just some of the 3,000 plus shoes in the former First Lady's collection . Archives: As this 1986 picture shoes Imelda Marcos' shoe stash was stored on shelves in the basement of the Malacanang Palace in Manila before being transferred to the National Museum . 'We're doing a conservation rescue,' Abinion said. 'There was termite infestation and mould in past years, and these were aggravated by last month's storm. 'It's unfortunate because Imelda may have worn some of these clothes in major official events and as such have an important place in our history,' he said. Imelda Marcos, now a member of the House of Representatives, was not immediately available for comment Sunday. Shoe lover: Imelda Marcos' shoe collection became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation. Her love of shoes extended to other objects as well, as this 1999 picture, right, of her shoe-shaped telephone shows . Extravagant: Imelda Marcos, seen left in 1970 leaving Claridges in London to meet the Queen and right dropping off her son at school in England, claimed many of her shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoe-making capital . The 83-year-old's massive shoe collection, said to be in the region of 3,000 pairs, including top U.S. and European brands, astounded the world and became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation, where many still walked barefoot out of abject poverty. After the 1986 revolt, Aquino had Imelda Marcos' shoes displayed at the presidential palace as a symbol of the former first lady's lavish lifestyle. The shoes were then removed from public view and stored in the palace basement when Aquino stepped down in 1992. Imelda Marcos claimed many of the shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoemaking capital, for endorsing their products. Death: Mrs Marcos' husband Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 . Wrecked: Hundreds of pieces of the late Ferdinand Marcos' clothing, including his formal native Barong shirts, have also begun to . gather mould and fray after being stored at the . presidential palace and National Museum . Irreparable: National Museum curator Orlando Abinion called the damage to the Marcoses possessions 'unfortunate' as they had an important place in Manila's history . Marikina officials borrowed 800 pairs of her shoes in 2001 for a shoe museum, which has become a tourist spot. Massive flooding, however, damaged dozens of pairs of Marcos' shoes in Marikina in 2009. About 765 pairs, including famous brands like Gucci, Charles Jourdan, Christian Dior, Ferragamo, Chanel and Prada, survived the Marikina floods. The shoes still look remarkably new due to meticulous museum care, which includes displaying them in airtight and dust-free glass cabinets in an air-conditioned gallery, away from direct sunlight. The shoe collection draws a daily crowd of 50 to 100 Philippine and foreign tourists, who almost always leave in awe, museum manager Jane Ballesteros said. 'The first word they utter is ""Wow,"" followed by the question, ""Was she able to wear all of these?"" 'When I say, yes, look at the scratches on the soles, the next reaction is, ""Really?"" It's amusing. Her shoes never fail to astound people years after.' Ferdinand Marcos . died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 and his widow and children returned . home years later.","Part of Imelda Marcos' famous shoe collection, some of her dresses and husband's clothes damaged by bugs and flood water .

"Victim: Alim Uddin, 17, was stabbed to death in an alleged row over a second-hand bicycle . A teenager has been stabbed to death in an alleged row over a second-hand bicycle. Alim Uddin, 17, was attacked while picking up the bike from a boy he knew from school. The pair are said to have argued over payment. Alim was allegedly dragged up to the top-floor walkway of a block of flats by a gang of youths and stabbed seven times in his arms, legs and chest. A resident raised the alarm and tried to resuscitate Alim before paramedics arrived. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead with his parents at his bedside. Alim, who had gained a string of A and B grades at GCSE, was studying for his A-levels in the hope of going to university. His family said they believed he had been ‘lured’ to his death on the council estate in Brixton, South London, on Sunday. It is understood that Alim paid a boy £90 for the bicycle last week. However the boy refused to hand it over and demanded £50 more. The two agreed to meet on Sunday and Alim took two friends with him including Namitullah Hamid, head boy of his school, Chesnut Grove in Balham. Alim told them to wait for him in a shop but they became concerned when he failed to answer his phone. The pair found him at 5pm being tended to by paramedics  at the top of the eight-storey tower block. He was covered in blood and dust.

You don’t expect this sort of thing to happen. ‘And all over a second-hand bike. It’s such a waste.’ Police have cordoned off Tilford House in Brixton, south London where the fatal stabbing took place .

His parents were in . pieces when they went to the hospital last night. ‘He’s never had issues with other boys and he doesn’t get involved in drugs. He’s not that kind of boy. ‘Alim . was very easy-going, and he was very protective of his younger . siblings. At school he was well liked and had lots of friends. He was . very sociable.’ Alim had apparently told the other boy’s mother that he had been cheated over the bicycle. Tragic statistic: Alim Uddin is the third teenager to be killed in London this year . Absal . Uddin added: ‘We think the reason why he was covered in dust is because . he was dragged up those flats by a group of people. He wasn’t naive, he . certainly wouldn’t have gone up there of his own accord.’ Alim’s . family said he loved computer science and art and wanted to be a . policeman.

"Three times as many young people are needing hospital treatment for Chron's disease today than a decade ago, medics say. TOWIE star Sam Faiers is a well-documented sufferer . Junk food and antibiotics are being blamed by doctors for the rise in the number of young people developing a serious digestive disorder. The latest figures show three times as many young people need hospital treatment for Crohn’s disease today than  a decade ago. Dr Sally Mitton, a consultant gastroenterologist at St George’s Hospital in London, said there has also been a big rise in the number diagnosed with the condition – and  diet is partly responsible. ‘If you have a lot of junk food it actually makes it more likely that you will develop Crohn’s disease,’ she said. ‘And people have noticed those who have lots of antibiotics – particularly in younger life – also seem to be more likely to develop this condition.’ Crohn’s, which is caused by inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, triggers frequent bouts of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and bleeding. Along with colitis, it is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may be diagnosed at any age. However it tends to strike early in life and there is no cure. It is not clear how eating junk food, typically high in animal fat or saturated fats, can lead to the disease, but doctors believe it pushes up the chances of genetically susceptible people developing it. ‘All the centres that get lots of referrals have noticed an increase over the last few decades,’ Dr Mitton said, adding that there are many genes which can predispose someone to the condition. ‘We try to keep patients fit enough to stay at home, but because of the increased number being diagnosed, the actual number needing to be admitted has gone up,’ she said. New data – obtained by the BBC from the Health and Social Care Information Centre – show in 2003/4 there were 4,937 young adults aged between 16 and 29 admitted to hospitals in England for the condition. This rose to 19,405 in 2012/13. Three-quarters of those with Crohn’s, which affects around 250,000 Britons, will need bowel reconstructive surgery at some point in their lives. Scroll down for video . Doctors blame the increase on junk food and antibiotics. Crohn's, which is caused by inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, triggers frequent bouts of diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and bleeding . However, a spokesman for the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK said that while the prevalence of IBD has been increasing in recent years, there are many contributory causes – including genetic predisposition which can be triggered by environmental factors. He added: ‘Dietary issues certainly can play a role, but there is no evidence they are the main cause. The gut bacteria can be radically altered in people with Crohn’s and colitis – with an increase in harmful bacteria and fewer  beneficial bacteria which may also be significant.’ He said that the charity had been contacted by many patients who say they have always maintained a healthy diet, and who would disagree with the idea that junk food is behind the rise in cases.","Three times as many young people being treated for Crohn's, doctors say .

"Las Vegas is currently installing Intellistreet lights to their well-lit city. But Intellistreets are not just any street-lighting system. The wireless, LED lighting, computer-operated lights are not only capable of illuminating streets, they can also play music, interact with pedestrians and are equipped with video screens, which can display police alerts, weather alerts and traffic information. The high tech lights can also stream live video of activity in the surrounding area. But there's one major concern.These new street lights, being rolled out with the aid of government funding, are also capable of recording video and audio. New street lights currently being installed in Las Vegas are capable of recording video and audio. Some worry this is yet another attempt by authorities to potentially invade the public's privacy. Neil Rohleder with the Public Works Department told NBC News 3 in Las Vegas that the main reason for installing the new lighting system is not to record anyone or anything. 'We want to develop more than just the . street lighting component,' Rohleder said.'We want to develop an experience for the . people who come downtown.' But some residents worry that the lights, which are currently being tested in and around Las Vegas City Hall, are an invasion of privacy. Civil rights activist, Daphne Lee told NBC News 3 that she is worried about her freedom as an American citizen. “This technology, you know is taking us . to a place where, you know, you’ll essentially be monitored from the . moment you leave your home till the moment you get home,” said Lee. On Intellistreets website, inventor Ron Harwood explains that cameras for surveillance and recording devices can be installed in the light fixtures. But Las Vegas public works director, Jorge Servantes told News 3 that recording pedestrians is not in the cards in the immediate future. 'Right now our intention is not to have . any cameras or recording devices,' Servantes said. 'It’s just to provide output out there, . not to get any feed or video feed coming back.' That said, the lights are being touted as security devices that can assist with 'Homeland Security' measures by providing applications like video surveillance and motion sensors. Lee wonders who protecting our rights? Las Vegas is currently installing Intellistreet lights to their well-lit city. The wireless, LED lighting, computer-operated lights are not only capable of illuminating streets, they can also play music, interact with pedestrians and are equipped with video screens. They are also capable of recording video and audio. 'At what point do we say this is the land of the free,' Lee told News 3. 'People have a right to a reasonable amount of privacy.' But Harwood defended his lighting system when he spoke with MSNBC in 2011. 'I find that when I have to go to the airport and I have to take most of . my clothes off and walk through a scanner, that's far more invasive . than anything Intellistreets does,' Harwood said. Some cities in the UK and Holland already have street lights that can talk and take surveillance video. They also reprimand people for minor offenses like littering. In addition to recording capabilities the Intellistreet lights are energy efficient. They use far less energy than traditional street lamp systems. With the installation of street lights capable of recording audio and video surveillance in Las Vegas, civil rights activist, Daphne Lee is worried about her freedom as an American citizen. The company website states the 'LED luminaire (lighting) saves more than 50% in energy while the addition of the Intellistreets PTM (Post Top Module) further enables a 25% reduction in energy and an additional 3 year life extension of the light engine.' While the lights are controlled by remote Internet-based module, Harwood told MSNBC that he is not worried about hackers because the system is encrypted. 'If (hacking) ever happened, the systems sends a warning and shuts down,' Harwood said.","Wireless street lights can play music, video, interact with pedestrians and have 'Homeland Security' applications like video surveillance monitors .

"A horrific video has emerged showing puppies and kittens panicking as they wait to be dissected at an animal testing laboratory. The footage was filmed as part of an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) at the government-licensed centre.

The video was taken by an investigator, known as 'Susie', who worked at the laboratory for eight months until December last year, according to the Sunday Express. It shows puppies and kittens shrieking in terror as they are restrained by researchers - just seconds before they are given a lethal injection and cut up for examination. Shockingly, their dissected bodies are later dumped in a bin as waste. In the video, an employee can be seen disposing of a kitten's body - saying: 'That's you done, you can go in our bin'.

What a fuss, what a fuss,' the woman can be heard saying. 'Perhaps . your leg was a bit sore. Was it from all those bleeds? Oh dear, oh . dear.' The employee eventually administers the lethal dose after trying the puppy's other leg - before commenting: 'That's gotcha.' Family: Many of the animals are born at the laboratory for the sole purpose of being dissected for examination at just a few weeks old - with their healthy mothers (including this dog, above) often killed just hours later . She then adds: 'Put up a bit of a fight, didn't you, yeah?' The footage also shows scenes of puppies and kittens lying on operating tables as employees insert needles and cutting equipment into their bodies. In one particularly horrific scene, a researcher lifts a motionless puppy onto a table, saying: 'Yes, . this is where it gets messy. Right, OK. Come on then little fella.

Above, dinner time at the centre . However, the undercover investigator managed to rescue two adult dogs, Bonnie and Billie, and a five-month-old puppy, Oliver, during the project - while two others were rehomed. Many of the animals are believed to have been born at the laboratory for the sole purpose of being dissected for examination at a young age - with their healthy mothers often killed just hours later.

During the eight-month period, the facility also dissected a number of rabbits and chickens, according to BUAV. Today, Michelle Thew, chief executive of BUAV, said the union had released the video in a bid to add transparency to the public debate about animal testing. 'This is a secret the research industry would never want to be . released into the public domain,' she said. 'Millions of families throughout the UK . who share their homes and lives with cats and dogs will be appalled by . these revelations. 'It is unacceptable, not only that these animals are . suffering and dying in this way, but that many of them could have been . released into loving homes instead of being killed and discarded for . convenience sake.' She added that thousands of dogs and hundreds of cats are used in research every year in UK, despite widespread concern about their use. Meanwhile, Home Office minister, Norman Baker, told the Sunday Express his department had carried out 'a number' of inspections at the . facility over the past year - but added that he has now called for a full report into the centre's activities.

"A war of words has begun between a top Russian news station and CNN with the networks trading insults after an American correspondent insulted one of Russia’s  WWII monuments and then a Russian anchor shot back by suggesting that two of the soldiers in the American Iwo Jima monument were simulating gay sex. CNN caused a firestorm when it included a war monument in Brest, a city in the former Soviet republic of Belarus, in an article on the 'world's ugliest monuments' published last month. The piece said the Soviet soldier 'emerging from a mountainous block of concrete looks as if he's about to thump the West into submission before hurling North America at the sun.' Scroll down for video . Made the cut: CNN included this WWII memorial in Brest on a list of the ugliest monuments in the world, saying that the solider looked 'constipated' and 'looks as if he's about to thump the West into submission' It also noted that others think the soldier 'simply looks constipated.' On February 6, CNN edited the story on its website and added a note apologizing for the offense it caused in Belarus and Russia. The county’s role in the second World War is still one of the nation's proudest moments so it comes as little surprise that any slights against the effort are taken extremely personally. The day after the CNN story was published, the Russian Foreign Ministry took the unusual step of summoning CNN's Moscow correspondent for an official reprimand. The journalist was told that 'mocking the memory of Soviet soldiers who gave their lives for the victory over fascism cannot be justified or forgiven,' the ministry said in a statement on its website. The U.S. network then withdrew the article entirely. Striking back: A news anchor on Russian state television said that the Marines in the American Iwo Jima memorial were gay because of the way they are depicted . Inspiration: The memorial is based off the famous photograph of Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi . 'CNN apologizes for the unintended offense caused by an article from a contributor that was intended to be a humorous look at monumental architecture worldwide,' it said in a statement. Taking it personally: This pro-Kremlin protestor demonstrated how ht issue is hurting Russian's feelings . 'We recognize that the Courage Monument carries deep and significant symbolism in honoring the soldiers who gave their lives defending their nation.' That wasn't enough, however, as a controversial news anchor on Rossiya state television then went after CNN during his weekly show, which aired Sunday night following the team skating competition in Sochi that gave Russia its first gold medal of the Winter Games. As pictures of the monumental Brest sculpture filled the screen, Dmitry Kiselyov told viewers how the Americans had ridiculed the Soviet soldier depicted in the war memorial. He then showed a picture of the Marine Corps War Memorial sculpture shot from behind, so that the U.S. Marines raising the flag during the Battle of Iwo Jima were bent over one another. 'It's easy to mock,' Kiselyov said with his trademark smirk. 'A fevered subconscious could ascribe just about anything to it. Take a closer look: A very modern theme, is it not?' Kiselyov has often led the attack on Americans, gays or other groups that top the Kremlin agenda. As international criticism over a Russian law banning gay 'propaganda' reached a fever pitch last year, he said homosexuals' hearts should be buried or burned. In December, Putin appointed Kiselyov the new head of the state news agency RIA Novosti, which after serving as the host agency during the Olympics will be restructured.","CNN included a Soviet-era WWII memorial on a list of the world's ugliest monuments, saying that the soldier looks 'constipated'

"A 16-year-old boy has been arrested after a teenager who became a father just weeks ago was chased down 'like a dog' and knifed to death in the street. Victim: Charlie Burns as a schoolboy. A neighbour said he was growing into a 'lovely young man' The 16-year-old is being held in custody alongside a 19-year-old man at an east London police station after the attack in Hackney, east London, yesterday afternoon. The victim has been named locally as 19-year-old Charlie Burns, who reportedly only became a father to a baby boy in the last month. Witnesses say Mr Burns, who lives nearby, was chased down a street in Hackney yesterday afternoon by a gang of around five men who repeatedly stabbed him. As they made their getaway in a blue hatchback they knocked over a lamp post, the Evening Standard reported.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'We have known the family for a number of years now and it is such a tragic loss.

'I looked out of the window and I saw five or six black lads running down Darnley Road, screaming 'I'm going to kill you'. 'I'd say they was chasing somebody because of the way they were running. They weren't running in a big group, they were sort of in ones or two, and there was definitely at least five of them. 'I had to leave the house because I was visiting my mother in hospital but as I left the police arrived. Investigation: A forensics tent at the scene of a stabbing in Hackney,east London.

"Identical twins who were both diagnosed with breast cancer have become a medical rarity - Kristen Maurer donated skin and fat tissue for her sister Kelly McCarthy's reconstruction on Tuesday. McCarthy, 34, had already received chemotherapy treatment, surgery to remove her right breast, and radiation previously, but this week her operation involved a second mastectomy, and reconstruction of both breasts. He sister, from Crown Point, Indiana, stepped in and essentially had a 'tummy tuck', removing lower abdominal skin and fat tissue, which was transplanted to her twin to create a second new breast. Kristen Maurer, left, and Kelly McCarthy, right, were both diagnosed with breast cancer within months of each other and have both undergone treatment and reconstruction surgery . Maurer had also already had a double mastectomy previously, . recommended because her sister's cancer was so aggressive, but she . didn't need chemotherapy or radiation. She had reconstruction with implants after the birth of her second child last March. McCarthy was diagnosed first, in December 2011, with triple-negative breast cancer, a hard-to-treat form of cancer whose growth is not fueled by hormones. When she was diagnosed with the cancer, she urged her twin to get tested, too, who was diagnosed with the same disease just a few months later. 'You just do everything together, don't you,' the doctor told Maurer before delivering the bad news that she, too, had the disease. When asked about donating her tissue to her sister, Maurer said: 'It wasn't a question, she didn't have to ask me.' Kristen Maurer, left, her husband, Richard, their daughter Finley, Kristen's identical twin Kelly McCarthy, husband Robert, and their son, Grey, at Kelly's mother-in-law's house in Beecher, Illinois . Kristen Maurer, left, holding her daughter, Lane, and Kelly McCarthy as they look at old family photos . The college enrollment counselor said: 'Having a twin is very like having a child. You would do anything for them ... in a heartbeat.' The first successful organ transplant was between identical twins in Boston in 1954 and involved a kidney. Since then, identical twins have been involved in many other transplant operations, involving kidneys and other organs, bone marrow, and stem cells. But breast reconstruction between identical twins has only been done a handful of times; Maurer and McCarthy, a nurse, are among the youngest patients. Identical twins are ideal donors because their skin, tissue and organs are perfect genetic matches, explained Dr. David Song, chief of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center. And that eliminates the need for anti-rejection medicine, he said. Song performed the twins' surgeries on Tuesday and both fared well. Kelly McCarthy at her mother-in-law's house with her niece Finley, left, and son, Grey . Typically, breast reconstruction surgery involves implants and/or a woman's own tissue, sometimes taken from the abdomen, thighs or buttocks. The first successful organ transplant was between identical twins in Boston in 1954 and involved a kidney. Since then, identical twins have been involved in many other transplant operations, involving kidneys and other organs, bone marrow, and stem cells. But breast reconstruction between identical twins has only been done a handful of times; Maurer and McCarthy, a nurse, are among the youngest patients at 34. Identical twins are ideal donors because their skin, tissue and organs are perfect genetic matches . But McCarthy is among women who don't have enough extra tissue; plus, radiation treatment damaged tissue near her breasts. So Maurer offered to be a donor. McCarthy said her sister's sacrifice, 'just so I can feel better about myself... is really humbling.' With their blonde bobs, sparkling brown eyes and easy, engaging smiles, the twins are clearly mirror images of each other. Discovering breast cancer in identical twins isn't unusual because of their exact genetic makeup, Song said. With twins, there's also often a 'mirroring effect', with breast cancer developing in the opposite breast, he said. That's what happened with McCarthy and Maurer. While their mother died from colon cancer last year, there was no family history of breast cancer. McCarthy was nine months pregnant when she was diagnosed and her son was born a week later. Soon after she started treatment, chemotherapy, surgery to remove her right breast, and radiation. Maurer was diagnosed with a very early-stage cancer in her left breast a few months after her sister. 'Kelly was more upset than I was during my diagnosis, and likewise, when she was diagnosed I was a mess,' Maurer said. The twins have always been extremely close, sometimes speaking in unison or completing each other's sentences. But now, McCarthy said, 'I feel closer. Her tissue is over my heart.'","Kristen Mauer and Kelly McCarthy, 34, were diagnosed with breast cancer within months of each other .

"Radio host Alex Jones spent 15 minutes shouting at CNN interviewer Piers Morgan on Monday, but he wasn't finished taking shots at the cable network. Jones took to his own radio program on Tuesday, after returning home to Austin, Texas, and declared that CNN headquarters in New York City looked like 'Hitler's bunker' and that the network was 'in decay.' Before leaving the Big Apple, he recorded a 12-minute diatribe in which he asked his fans to pray for his safety and claimed he was being followed by undercover New York police detectives. 'If something happens to us, we’re killed by crackheads, it was the NYPD or mafia they hired. Period,' he said. Scroll down for videos and transcript of the rant . Threatened: Alex Jones, a radio host and conspiracy theorist, said he was followed by undercover New York police detectives while in the city for his CNN interview . Explosive: Alex Jones, right, spent nearly all of his 15 minutes on CNN shouting at Piers Morgan, left, at the top of his lungs . Morgan, who invited Jones onto Piers Morgan Tonight to discuss gun control, said the interview with Jones was the 'best advertisement for gun control you could wish for.' Gun control has been the focus of Morgan's shows since the December 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary . School in Newtown, Connecticut. In an interview with Politico, though, Morgan said he did little to advance the discourse on the issue on Monday night. 'That kind of vitriol, hatred, and zealotry is really quite scary. I didn't feel threatened by him, but I'm concerned that someone like him has that level of influence,' Morgan told the political news site. 'There's got to be a level of discourse that can rise above what happened last night. It was undignified, unedifying.' Jones, a well known conspiracy theorist, spent nearly all of the interview on Monday night screaming at Morgan at the top of his lungs, calling him a 'redcoat foreigner' and threatening revolution if anyone tried to 'take our guns.' Volatile: Jones ranted for three minutes straight at the start of the interview, without Morgan getting a single word in edgewise . 'Let me say, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms. No matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to be taken. We will not relinquish them,' Jones said. Jones, whose radio show and website, InfoWars.com, reaches millions of Americans, at one point challenged Morgan to a boxing match. He also claimed 'mass murder suicide pills' like the anti-depressant Prozac were the real cause of massacres like the ones at Sandy Hook Elementary School and the late screening of the 'Dark Knight Rises' in Aurora, Colorado. Throughout the exchange, Morgan attempted to foster a debate about gun control, beginning with the fact that the United States counted more than 11,000 gun murders last year while Britain had only 35. Finger pointing: Jones said Morgan is a foreigner who is working to disarm the American people for dastardly purposes . Fiery: Morgan tried several times to calm Jones down and had little success . Angry: Jones clearly had a point to make and was intent on shouting to ensure he was heard . He tried many times to calm Jones down and get him to answer his questions. Most of the time, it was a failed effort and Jones was insistent on getting his own points across. Morgan, a Mail On Sunday columnist and former editor of The Daily Mirror and News Of The World, began one exchange by saying: 'Let's try again. You accuse me of attacking the second amendment... ' Jones responded: 'I wanna get people off pills that the insert says will make you commit suicide and kill people. I wanna blame the real culprit - suicide pills. Mass murder pills.' When asked again about the difference in the murder rates between the U.S. and Britain, Jones responded: 'You're a hatchet man of the New World Order' - referring to the belief among conspiracy theorists that an international cabal is working to break down national boundaries and control the entire world. Argument: Alex Jones refuses to remove his shoes while going through airport security as a police officer allegedly threatens to arrest him . Iconic: These image of police officers and teachers leading children to safety immediately after the Sandy Hook massacre was seen around the world . Morgan was persistent: 'Let's try again. How many gun murders were there in Britain last year?' Jones responded: 'I don't know, how many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin?' James Holmes, who faces multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder for the Colorado theater Dark Knight Rises shooting . Jones is leading a drive to petition the . White House, under its We the People program, to deport Morgan back to . Britain because he 'is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment.' The petition has more than 105,000 votes - more than four times the number required to receive an official White House response. Jones explained the reason for the petition, saying: 'It's to point out that you're a foreigner, a redcoat, here telling us what to do.' 'Redcoat' refers to the red uniforms British soldiers wore as they fought the colonists during the Revolutionary War. Before he had even managed to arrive . for his appearance on Piers Morgan's show, Jones had already been filmed . in argumentative scenes. A known critic of Homeland Security, Jones felt he was being singled out when Austin-Bergstrom airport security made him remove his shoes. In the ensuing argument, Jones claims, he was threatened with arrest by police until he agreed to their request. After Morgan's interview with Jones first aired, the White House press office responded to questions about the petition with a statement saying: 'The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold and we will respond to this one. 'In the meantime, it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy.' Alex Jones starts by explaining his reason for supporting the Second Amendment . ALEX JONES: We did it as a way to bring attention to the fact that we have all of these foreigners, and the Russian government, the official Chinese government -- Mao said political power goes out of the barrel of a gun, he killed about 80 million people because he's the only guy who had the guns -- so we did it to point out that this is globalism, and the mega banks that control the planet and brag they have taken over -- in Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, you name it -- brag that they're going to get our guns as well. They've taken everybody's guns, but the Swiss and the American people and when they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny while the government buys 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, predator drones, armed now in U.S. skies, being used to arrest people in North Dakota. The Second Amendment isn't there for duck hunting. It's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs. Take the woman in India, your piece earlier on CNN earlier, I was watching during Anderson Cooper's show, didn't tell you the women of India have signed giant petitions to get firearms because the police can't and won't protect them. The answer is -- wait a minute, I have FBI crime statistics that come out of a year late, 2011, 20-plus percent crime drop in the last nine years, real violent crime because more guns means less crime. Britain took the guns 15, 16 years ago. Tripling of your overall violent crime. True, we have a higher gun violence level, but overall, muggings, stabbing, deaths -- those men [allegedly] raped that woman in India to death with an iron rod 4 feet long. You can't ban the iron rods. The guns, the iron rods, Piers, didn't do it, the tyrants did it. Hitler took the guns Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms! It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there in the street begging for them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand? He goes on talk about the lower number of gun deaths in the UK . ALEX JONES: I already said earlier that England had lower gun crime rate because you took all the guns. But you have hoards of people burning down cities and beating old women's brains out out everyday. They arrest people in England if they defend themselves, that's on record. My God, you have a total police state. Everybody is fleeing the country because -- you've had to flee, bud. Yeah, you fled here. Why don't you go back and face the charges for the hacking scandal?PIERS MORGAN: Answer this question. How many -- . JONES: Why did you get fired from the Daily Mirror for putting out fake stories? You're a hatchet man of the New World Order. You're a hatchet man! And I'm going to say this here, you think you're a tough guy? Have me back with a boxing ring and I'll wear red, white, and blue, and you'll wear your Jolly Roger.

"Jeremy Clarkson has hit back at a Labour MP's criticism of Top Gear by saying: 'We don't make it for people who wear pink ties.' The Top Gear presenter launched the bizarre attack after Labour's transport chief Michael Dugher said the car fanatic was 'basically an idiot'. He also claimed Clarkson gives drivers a bad name, leading anyone with a car to be wrongly portrayed as a 'petrolhead', when in reality driving is the only way to get around outside London. Scroll down for video . Controversial Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson (pictured trying on a pink tie) has hit back at claims by Labour MP Michael Dugher that he is an 'idiot' who gives drivers a bad name . The presenter tweeted to his 4.4m followers: 'We don't make it for people who wear pink ties' Mr Dugher, who had said Clarkson gave off the impression that all motorists were 'petrolheads', replied saying: 'Obviously I wear red ties a lot. But what's wrong with the occasional pink one?!' Mr Dugher also insisted the BBC 2 show was just 'old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets' are 'not remotely representative' of millions of people who drive. But Clarkson decided to hit back at the comments, telling his 4.4m Twitter followers that he thought it was 'good' Mr Dugher did not like the show. The controversial presenter added: 'Labour's transport spokesman say he doesn't like Top Gear. Good. We don't make it for people who wear pink ties.' Mr Dugher responded just minutes later, seemingly undeterred by the comment. He replied: 'Obviously I wear red ties a lot. But what's wrong with the occasional pink one?! What on earth might someone be implying?' Clarkson later tweeted, rather cryptically: 'I don't like Jupiter. It gives all the other planets a bad name. I mean I haven't been there but...' The online spat came after Mr Dugher took aim at Clarkson, a friend of David Cameron's and member of Chipping Norton set, in an interview with House magazine. He said: 'Jeremy Clarkson – I have no time for him. It's not just his politics. I mean the guy is basically an idiot. 'And the idea that he is somehow the motorists' representative? No he's not, he represents himself. He's not remotely representative of motorists. 'There's a caricature of people like 'petrolheads'. They're not 'motorists'. They're people who have a car. That's a lot of people – it's how most of us move around most of the time. 'We've got to stop that caricaturing of a petrolhead, or a Clarkson. Top Gear, a bunch of old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets? They're not remotely representative.' There are 30million drivers in the UK, but Mr Dugher warned that they are unfairly targeted by politicians and officials working in London where public transport is more popular. The shadow transport secretary claimed politicians spend 'most of their time talking to the minority of people who don't' drive, because Parliament is based in the capital. 'The vast majority of people, their daily journey is by road. Most people have a car, and use their car a lot.' He complained that the perception of drivers was skewed by the popularity of Top Gear, which Clarkson presents with James May and Richard Hammond. But Andy Wilman, Top Gear's executive producer, hit back. He said: 'He must be Mystic Meg if he knows what we do without watching the show. 'If he bothered to watch it, he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £1,500 estate car battling its way across Africa as we do from a Bugatti Veyron running at top speed. I'll take his point on the jeans though.' Mr Dugher tore into the hit BBC Two show hosted by Richard Hammond, Jeremyt Clarkson and James May, insisting 'old blokes wearing jeans and sports jackets' are 'not remotely representative' of millions of people who drive . Top Gear is one of the BBC's biggest global hits, attracting millions of viewers and generating millions of pounds with stunts and regular features like A Star In A Reasonably Priced Car, in which a celebrity drives around a race track against the clock. Former Labour MP Stephen Ladyman once appeared on the show when a transport minister. But Mr Dugher rejected the idea he would join Clarkson, May and Hammond: 'I don't watch the programme, it's not my kind of telly.' Andy Wilman, Executive Producer, Top Gear, said: 'He must be Mystic Meg if he knows what we do without watching the show. If he bothered to watch it, he would know that we take as much pleasure out of celebrating a £1500 estate car battling its way across Africa as we do from a Bugatti Veyron running at top speed. I'll take his point on the jeans though' Mr Dugher signalled that he wanted to end the idea that Labour wanted to wage war on the motorist. Mr Dugher signalled that he wanted to end the idea that Labour wanted to wage war on the motorist. 'I want to shift the tone of the national debate. The vast majority of people, their daily journey is by road. 'Given that most people spend most of their time travelling by road, I've felt for a long, long time – and this is a criticism of all governments – that politicians spend most of their time talking to the minority of people who don't. And that just seems a very odd approach. 'We're sat in the middle of Westminster. So many of the politicians and the journalists and the civil servants, we all work in central London. 'Their personal experience of the transport network is not representative of the rest of the country. So it's a collective failure. Why wouldn't you talk to people about how they choose to travel most of the time?' He stressed that there is a 'whole bunch of reasons' why people choose to drive, including the fact that in many areas bus and train services are expensive and unreliable. 'I'm not going to punish people in those circumstances,' he said. The number of women stories has risen sharply in recent decades. Figures in 2012 showed the number of new drivers is rising twice as quickly among women as it is among men. Mr Dugher said: 'There's been huge growth in women drivers over recent decades. That's been an empowering thing for women. 'And a good thing. But why do women particularly choose to use cars? Perhaps because they've got a greater burden of childcare responsibilities; it's 'mum's taxi', a lot of it. It's also about their access to employment. 'And it's also, in an evening in the winter, when it's dark, it's because they feel safer than on some aspects of public transport. I'm not going to persecute people for making those kinds of absolutely legitimate choices.'","Michael Dugher accused the BBC Two show of misrepresenting drivers .

"Russia's hardline anti-gay President Vladimir Putin hugged the first openly gay athlete to win a medal at the Winter Olympics, it was revealed today. After watching his country's ice dance team take Russia's first gold of the Sochi Olympics, Putin, 61, was seen at an after-party event in town celebrating. It was at the Holland Heineken House that he cozied up to Dutch gold medal winning speedskater Ireen Wust, who was there to be honoured by hundreds of fans for her victory earlier in the day in the 3,000-meter race. Russia's President Vladimir Putin at Austria Tirol House at the Sochi Winter Olympics (left) and (right) the openly gay athlete Ireen Wust . Anti-gay: Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) toasts with members of the Austrian delegation as he visits Austria Tirol House in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia . 'I got a cuddle from him,' Wust told Dutch national broadcaster NOS. 'He congratulated me and asked if everything was OK in Russia and I congratulated him on (Russian speedskater) Olga Graf, of course, for her third place (in the 3,000 meters). 'He was happy to see me, but then he had to leave again. But I cuddled him.' Holland Heineken House is renowned at recent Olympic Games as a great place for a party, drawing thousands of fans with a cocktail of live music, the chance to see a Dutch medal winner and perhaps a couple of beers. A series of incidents have strained relations between the Netherlands and Russia in recent months, including a diplomat being arrested by police in The Hague and Russia's detention of a Dutch-flagged protest ship and its crew. But there was no sign of any lingering tensions as Putin made his way out of the house and spoke to a reporter in English. 'Fantastic,' he said of his brief visit. 'Very good. Good people and good results ... good party.' Putin, left, toasts with beer with King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, center, and Queen Maxima, right, at the Netherlands house in Sochi . Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, speaks with Julia Lipnitskaia after she won gold for Russia . Ireen, 27, has said she will not use the podium to talk about gay rights. She said: 'I want to talk about ice skating. You are not asking (fellow Dutch speedskater) Sven Kramer about how his relationship is going. So why would you ask me? If I would've had a relationship with a guy, you wouldn't have asked me either.' She is one of seven openly gay athletes competing in Sochi, but she more publicly identifies herself as Dutch while on the world stage. She painted her nails the colors of the Dutch flag. Putin was slammed by Elton John ahead of the games after the president said millions of people liked the Candle in the Wind singer 'despite his orientation.' Sir Elton told how homophobia was rife in Russia. He said: 'The people I met in Moscow - gay men and lesbians in their 20s, 30s and 40s - told me stories about receiving threats from vigilante groups who would 'cure' them of homosexuality by dousing them with urine or beating them up. 'One young man was stalked outside a gay club by someone posing as a taxi driver who tried to garrotte him with a guitar string because he was a 'sodomite'.' Putin passed a law to ban homosexual 'propaganda' at the Winter Olympics in Sochi. He has previously argued that there could not be any discrimination against homosexuals in his country, because he has gay friends. He said: 'I myself know some people who are gay. We're on friendly terms. I'm not prejudiced in any way. 'Homosexual people can't feel inferior here [in Russia] because there is no professional, career or social discrimination against them.' The ban on homosexual 'propaganda' will prevent anyone from giving any information about homosexuality to people under the age of 18.","Putin, 61, was seen at an after-party event in town celebrating .

"According to reports in Spain Real Madrid are closing in on £12million rated Cruzeiro midfielder Lucas Silva. Despite revealing Madrid are one of his two favourite teams in Europe - along with Spanish rivals Barcelona - Silva has also been linked for a move to Arsenal. What kind of player is he? A very modern Brazilian – not a flair player but unflappable in the holding midfield role. He can dictate the pace of a game and organize a team. He has a great first touch and good awareness. And he’s only 21 so he has plenty of years ahead of him to adjust to European football. He also has a reputation for being level-headed and willing to learn and improve – essential if he’s to fit in at a big club and learn a new language. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lucas Silva score 35 yard screamer for Cruzeiro! Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Arsenal have all expressed an interest in Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva . The 21-year-old currently plies his trade in the Brazilian top tier for league champions Cruzeiro . And he’s done well in Brazil? Cruzeiro have just won the league there and his consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league’s team of the season at the end of the campaign. Price? Cruzeiro president Gilvan de Pinho Tavares has said he will not negotiate for anything less than £12million. He also knows there are several clubs interested with Real Madrid, Inter and Arsenal all keen. What’s his preference? He has been quoted as saying that his favourite teams in Europe are Madrid and Barcelona. But that answer may well differ according to who is asking. He has also said the European-based player he models himself on is Yaya Toure. After a consistent performances for his club the Cruzeiro man featured in the Serie A team of the season . Modelling himself on Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure Silva could be on his way to the Premier League . Does he get forward as well as Toure? He only scored three times last season for his club but he did score in the Under 20 Toulon tournament for Brazil against England last May. Brazil went on to beat France in the final and he was one of the stand-out performers. He is not as attacking a player as Toure but he doesn’t just sit; he brings the ball out from the back. Has he played for Brazil yet? He has moved up to the Under 23s and will step up to the senior team soon without doubt. He will definitely be part of the Olympic team at Rio 2016. He’s not the finished product though? Not by any means. Cruzeiro’s previous coach Celso Roth wanted to loan him out for experience and it was only when Marcelo Oliveira took over as manager that he became first choice. So another project for Arsenal if Wenger lands him then? Real Madrid seem pretty convinced they have him but who knows? It’s a long road to the first team at the Santiago Bernabeu. Arsene Wenger would certainly be able to offer him first team football sooner so that may persuade him to turn his back on Madrid and move to London.","The 21-year-old Brazilian plays in a holding midfield role for Cruzeiro .

"Wave goodbye: Abdullah Al-Shammari, who spent 30 years on death row, bids farewell to fellow prisoners before his execution . A Saudi Arabian prisoner who spent 30 years on death row for killing a man in a fight was finally executed yesterday after the victim's family refused to grant him a pardon. Abdullah bin Fandi Al Shammari, described by prison management as the 'ideal inmate', was beheaded in the northern town of Ha'il. Shammari was just 23 when he was arrested and jailed for killing fellow Saudi Moojab bin Mohammed Al Rashidi by hitting him on the head with a stick following a row. His trial dragged on for five years until the court ruled Rashidi's death was involuntary homicide. Shammari was then set free and ordered to pay the victim's family diya or blood money. After being released form prison Shammari was married in a lavish wedding. But al-Rashidi's relatives objected to his release and demanded a retrial. Shammari was subsequently rearrested and found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on murder charges in 1983. Under Saudi law, al-Rashidi's sons had to come of age and decide whether or not to accept diya. Shammari was kept from the gallows for 30 years as the court wanted allow his relatives and friends a chance to persuade the victim’s relatives to accept diya again and pardon him, but time and again they refused.

"Gidget is going back to Pennsylvania. A Jack Russell terrier that somehow ended up in Oregon more than four months after she went missing from her home near Philadelphia will soon be flown back to the Keystone State. A microchip implanted in Gidget allowed workers at an animal shelter south of Portland to find the dog's owner. PetLink, the company that manufactured the microchip, will pay for her return flight, said Deborah Wood, manager of Animal Services for Washington County. 'We have no idea how she came from Pennsylvania to Oregon, but we are thrilled that she will be going home safe and sound,' Wood told the Associated Press. Scroll down for video .

Wood said a man also came to the Bonnie L. Hays Animal Shelter and paid for all of its expenses caring for the dog. Wood said the owner of the dog has asked to remain private, but wants everyone to know she's grateful for the outpouring of support.

"The owner of Obie, the formerly obese dachshund, is being investigated by the charitable activities section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office. Obie, who lives in Portland, Oregon, with owner Nora Vanatta, had previously tipped the scales at whopping 77lbs and to get him down to his target weight Vanatta appealed for donations. Money donated online funded specialty diet food for Obie, skin-reduction surgery, an exercise regime and legal bills to fight off a custody battle for the six-year-old. Scroll down for video . Nora Vanatta (pictured), the owner of Obie, the formerly obese dachshund, is being investigated by the charitable activities section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office . The pup, living in Portland, Oregon, with owner Nora Vanatta, had previously tipped the scales at whopping 77lbs and to get him down to his target weight Vanatta appealed for donations . But since January, the agency has been investigating how Vanatta used the funds and where she is donating the remainder. Vantatta, who adopted Obie after he was nearly fed to death by his doting elderly owners, told of the investigation on her Facebook page this week: 'Recently, someone filed a complaint with the Oregon State Attorney General's office because I accepted financial gifts on Obie's behalf. 'The Oregon AG contends that, by stating publicly that I would donate the funds over and above Obie's medical needs and the custody suit to recognized 501(c)3 organizations, I misrepresented myself as a charity and misled the folks who supported Obie with financial gifts. Vantatta adopted Obie after he was nearly fed to death by his doting elderly owners . In her post Vanatta details how the dispute was settled after four months but 'unfortunately, the settlement came at a price: over $15K of Obie's money was used to fight a frivolous lawsuit' 'This, the AG further contends, is proven by the reference to said gifts as ""donations."" 'This saddens me more than I can adequately express.' Soon after Vanatta adopted Obie he became the subject of a bitter custody battle with the Oregon Dachshund Rescue – the agency that coordinated with Vanatta to transfer Obie from the relative's custody to her home. They accused her of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and began fighting for custody. In her post Vanatta details how the lawsuit was settled after four months but 'unfortunately, the settlement came at a price: over $15K of Obie's money was used to fight a frivolous lawsuit.' Obie had to get a tummy tuck surgery to remove several pounds of loose skin from his slimmed down body . Obie could barely move after his owners fed him until he was obese . She writes: 'Many of you have purchased Obie's calendars. 'Again, I am grateful to you because the revenue from the calendar sales helped pay the $11,800 for the attorney who negotiated the settlement with the AG.' She finishes the post: 'The bottom line: the Oregon AG conceded that no wrong doing was found and I may keep a small amount of your gifts to put toward Obie’s future care, but the balance is to be either sent to the State, or to recognized charities that they approve.' Vanatta had hoped to send the money to animal rescue efforts and other owners which need to pay for surgery for their animals. Vanatta put Obie on a strict feeding regimen, which resulted in Obie losing 40lbs by May 2013 . The Attorney General began looking into the matter after receiving complaints and was focusing on how Vanatta was representing her use of the funds, spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson said reports Oregon Live. She said the agency is working on a final agreement and declined to disclose further details as the investigation continues. The story of the grossly overweight six-year-old pooch went viral last year when social media sites lit up with photos of a miserable-looking Obie lying on his back with his enormous belly chaffed from being dragged on the ground. Vanatta put Obie on a strict feeding regimen, which resulted in Obie losing 40lbs by May 2013. But the pup didn't stop there, continuing to shed pounds over the summer to reach his optimal weight. The pooch also had to undergo a cosmetic surgery to remove several pounds of loose skin from his now-svelte physique. In September, the rambunctious canine had to go under the knife again for an unrelated operation to remove cotton Obie apparently had been snacking on. Obie's numerous fans have been following his progress ever since the first pictures of Obie were posted on Facebook. The dog was so overweight that he needed to wear a special harness to prevent injury to his bulging stomach and chest. A dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds and Obie is now down to a healthy 22 pounds.","Obie who now weighs 22 pounds lives with his owner Nora Vanatta .

"President-turned-painter George W. Bush has unveiled his portraits of world leaders - as his wife Laura revealed she encouraged him to unleash his inner artist after he mastered a drawing app. The new collection by the former president, who picked up the paintbrush after leaving the White House, includes Tony Blair, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Dalai Lama. Most striking is a stern-looking Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Bush said his favorite was the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush. The oil paintings, which were shared on the Today show in an interview with his daughter Jenna Bush Hager, show an improvement in Bush's skills since the self portraits of him in the bath were leaked last year.

'I wanted to make sure that the last chapters of my life were full,' he told his daughter in the interview. 'Painting would occupy not only space but open my mind.' But he added: 'I was a little reluctant to put them out because I'm not a great artist and I don't want people to think I'm a great artist. But... I'm a driven person and I want to get better. A whole new world has opened up.' His wife Laura, who joined him for part of the interview, said she had encouraged him to paint after he mastered a writing and drawing iPhone application, Penultimate.

He started drawing images of the family's pets, including their late dog Barney. And last year, a hacker leaked some of his . images, including him in the . bath and him looking in a mirror. 'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out. 'The truth . of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm . still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.' Rendition: He also painted the Dalai Lama, who has previously said he is impressed by Bush .

Featured: A detail, left, shows the portrait of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, right . Speaking to his daughter, who is a special . correspondent on the Today show, he added that the most important thing he . has learned so far is, 'don't paint your wife,' he said. Of his portrait of her, wife Laura laughed: 'Yeah, it still needs some work.' And his mother, Barbara Bush, also had some critique for her son's art. 'That's my husband?' she joked when she saw the image of George H.W. Bush for the first time on the Today show, before adding: 'I really like it.' When asked if she thought her son captured the essence of her husband, she paused before saying: 'I think maybe he did. I like it very much... He's good.' Bush, who began painting when he left the White House, also painted Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf . Getting better: He has captured Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, pictured right this week .

Exhibition: A painting shows the former President of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin . On the wall: There is also a portrait of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, above . But she quipped that she will not allow her son to paint her because 'it might look like me'. As . his paintings of the world leaders were revealed, Bush said he . hopes the leaders will like them. None of them have yet seen . the images, he said. 'I hope . they take it in the spirit in which these were painted in,' he said. 'That was the . spirit of friendship and that I admire them as leaders and was willing . to give it a shot in terms of getting people to see how I felt about . them.' Speaking about the artwork brought back images of his time with the world leaders, especially Putin. He said they had a good relationship, but that he always thought Putin saw the U.S. as an enemy. Budding artist: Bush said he was inspired by Winston Churchill to pick up the paintbrush later in life . Side projects: While his brother is now in the political spotlight, former President George Bush (right, with his wife Laura) unveiled a gallery of his work at his presidential library in Texas last week . Practice: He used the iPhone app, Penultimate, to send messages and drawings (pictured) to the family . He added that the Russian leader once . took it too far when he criticized his beloved Scottish terrier, Barney, . saying, 'You call that a dog?' He . explained that he later visited Putin and met his dog, whom the Russian . leader noted was ‘bigger, stronger and faster than Barney'. 'I didn't react,' he said. 'I just . said, ""Wow. Anybody who thinks ‘my dog is bigger than your dog’ is an . interesting character."" And that painting kind of reflects that.' The . two-term president has led a significantly quieter life since leaving . office - spending much of his time painting and going on mountain bike . rides with groups of veterans like Wounded Warrior. In . an interview with the Dallas Morning News last year, Bush added that . painting gives him an opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what . others think of his work. Outspoken: Former First Lady Barbara Bush, Jeb's mother, has said in the past that she does not think another member of her family should be in the White House . 'Joyous experience': Bush said the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush was his favorite . 'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.' In . March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals . and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a . late-in-life painter. He had spent four weeks in private . lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida . where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic . horizons. 'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood. 'The . Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' will be held at . the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of . Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Work: Some of his paintings, including images of dogs and self-portraits, have previously been seen . Honing his skills: After painting the family pets, he said he then began painting landscapes . Revealed: Some of the images, including ones of him in the shower and a bathtub, were leaked last year . Invasive: Bush said that he felt that much of his artwork wasn't ready for public viewing . The . museum explained the exhibition 'will explore the relationships that . President George W. Bush forged with world leaders to shape . international policy and advance American interests abroad.' 'The . exhibit will feature more than two dozen never-before-exhibited . portraits painted by President Bush,' it said.

"An experienced Canadian skydiver died at after crashing to the ground while attempting a high-speed maneuver known as 'swooping,' authorities have revealed. Michael Ungar, 32, died on Tuesday at Perris Valley Skydiving, about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles. It was the sixth death at the parachuting facility in the last 15 months. Witnesses said Unger's parachute was open as he made the difficult maneuver and landed in a shallow pond. Friends pulled him out of the water, the Riverside County coroner and Perris police said. Tragedy: Michael Unger (top) smiles during a previous sky-dive. He was killed after crashing to the ground during a parachuting accident in California . Accident : Investigators and shocked parachutists gather at the Perris Valley Skydiving center after the tragedy on Tuesday. The death is the sixth in 15 months . Swooping involves a high-speed dive to skim over the ground before landing. Parachutists are often traveling 40 mph vertically and up to 60 mph horizontally just before touching down on the ground. 'It's risky because you are moving so fast,' said Jim Crouch, the safety director for the United State Parachuting Association. 'A lot of jumpers choose to land this way because it's exciting. But it's very unforgiving.' Accidents occur when parachutists start the maneuver too low and the parachute doesn't have the ability to recover, or fill with air, and float the skydiver to the ground, Crouch said. The maneuver has become so popular there are swooping competitions at drop zones around the country, said Crouch, who describes it as 'a sport within a sport.' There have now been four sport parachuting swooping deaths nationwide this year, Crouch added. The highest death count involving the maneuver was seven in 2002. There were six in 2006 and four last year. 'Jumpers are getting safer with this type of skydiving, (but) you can never completely take the risk out of it,' Crouch said. Dedicated: Mr Ungar was a keen sky-diver who had given lessons to others . The 33,000-member United States Parachute Association promotes safe skydiving through training, licensing and instructor-qualification programs. There are more than 140,000 jumps each year at Perris Valley Skydiving, one of the most active of 140 drop zones in the United States. Tuesday's accident marks at least the 14th death at the Perris facility since 2000 and the fifth this year. 'It's been a bad year for them,' Crouch said. 'I know they have been working on getting everybody to jump as safe as possible. 'It's a high-volume drop zone. The percentage doesn't point to them doing anything out of the ordinary.' Perris Valley Skydiving center manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld said Ungar, of Aylmer, Ontario,  sometimes worked as an instructor at Skydive Hollister on California's Central Coast. Ungar, . who had 2,000 jumps to his credit, was visiting the Perris area and had . rarely, if ever, jumped at the facility, Brodsky-Chenfeld said. Ungar's . parachute was open and he was circling as he neared the ground, witness . Jack Nix, of Fontana, told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. But when he . did not pull up or turn his body upright from parallel to the ground, . Nix said he knew the skydiver was in trouble. Adrenaline: Skydiving is popular among thrill-seekers, with many pushing the limits of safety with stunts such as 'swooping' (file picture) Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said the air safety regulator only investigates such deaths to determine whether the parachute was packed properly by a certified packer. Authorities were investigating the Ungar's death. Other recent fatal accidents at Perris include the Jacob Jensen, 32, of Denmark who collided with another skydiver, who suffered critical injuries in April. Two skydivers were killed in March when their parachutes deflated and they fell 300 feet. In February, a 41-year-old Australian woman died after failing to open a backup chute. While in September 2010, a 51-year-old Russian man died after a solo jump. The man's body was not found until two months later by a farmer plowing a field. His parachutes had not been deployed.","Death of Michael Unger, 32, is sixth at the same spot in 15 months ."
"Two pimps who were part of a gang which used university rooms to run a brothel in a major sex trafficking operation have been jailed for more than five years in total. Csaba Safian, 33, was part of a gang that brought 53 women as young as 17 from a poor part of Hungary to work as prostitutes in the UK. A court heard the group ran brothels from various locations, including a room in student accommodation during the holidays at the University of Sussex’s Falmer Campus, East Sussex. Csaba Safian, 33, pictured left, and Sandor Mohacsi, 35, pictured, have been jailed for being members of a gang that brought women as young as 17 from a poor part of Hungary to work as prostitutes in the UK . Safian also operated from a property in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where he put his name to the tenancy. He was jailed yesterday alongside fellow gang member Sandor Mohacsi, 35, after both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to traffic women into the UK for sexual exploitation between March 2011 and October 2012. Prosecutor Amy Packham told Hove . Crown Court that a Hungarian woman travelled with Safian . to Eastbourne to work in the brothel. She . had previously agreed to see ten clients per day for £100. But on . her first day, she had sex with more men than agreed. The . court heard that when the woman complained to Safian, he responded that . she was ‘a newbie, and fresh meat, and things would quieten down'. Ms . Packham said the girl was not physically forced to stay in the brothel, . but could not afford to fly home and was often spoken to in a way that . made it clear she should stay. The Falmer House building, on the Falmer Campus at the University of Sussex, from where part of a sex ring involving more than 50 women from eastern Europe was based . She was even chaperoned by gang members when she went outside, the court heard. The court heard that Mohacsi, 35, helped to drive the girls between hotels and airports. The empire was only uncovered when a . building manager at the University of Sussex received an email . advertising sex services in March 2011. He recognised the distinctive blue and yellow curtains from the halls of residence and uncovered a makeshift brothel on campus. A . spokesman for the University of Sussex said the gang were discovered . using the two-bedroom flat during the Easter holidays. They gained . access without the knowledge of the student who had rented it. He was . away for the break. Hove Crown Court heard the women were advertised as 'fresh meat' on a website and were threatened with exposure if they fled. The defendants were jailed for two years and eight months at the court . Five other members of the gang were jailed in January after a trial. During that trial, it emerged the . group made £20,000 a week from prostitutes holed up in hotels, brothels . and even a university halls of residence. Women as young as 17 were flown to Britain on EasyJet and Wizz Air flights and forced to have sex with up to 15 men a day. Many were recruited from deprived parts of Hungary and told they would be working in the massage industry. They were then put up in hotels around Gatwick, in flats across the South East, Bristol, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow, as well as the halls of residence at the University of Sussex. Women were advertised on sex websites as 'fresh meat' and threatened with exposure at home if they fled. The gang collected £100 an hour but kept most of the money for themselves while refusing to hand back passports until the women had paid off their 'debts', the court was told. The gang moved the brothel from Eastbourne to Woolwich in November 2011, after police visited the seaside address. Mitigating, Safian’s lawyer Richard McConaghy suggested his client had been ‘used’ to put his name on documents and was low in the gang’s hierarchy. But Judge Richard Hayward said the women were tricked after being ‘willing to come to the UK thinking they would better their lives’. He sentenced each defendant to two years and eight months in jail.","Casba Safian, 33, ran operation from a house in Eastbourne, East Sussex .

"The father of Sierra Lamar, the 15-year-old who vanished on the way to her school bus stop in Morgan Hill, California, revealed that he is a registered sex offender. However, Steve Lamar said he loves his daughter and had nothing to do with her disappearance Friday morning. Police, frantically searching for the teen, have been questioning her classmates and teachers after an examination of her phone, which was discovered a mile from her bus stop, gave no new leads. Scroll down for video . Search: Both the teen's cell phone and laptop are now undergoing forensic studies for any further clues . 'I understand the stigma associated with this in my background, and I assure everyone it is not connected in any way to my daughter's disappearance,' Steve Lamar said in a statement to the San Fransisco Chronicle. According to court records, he was charged in March 2009 with 12 felony counts of committing lewd or lascivious acts with three children younger than 14. In September 2009, he pleaded guilty to a single charge of committing lewd or lascivious acts with a child younger than 14 and was sentenced to a year in jail, the Chronicle reported. His daughter was not one of the victims. Police have said they have spoken with Lamar and he has been fully cooperative throughout the investigation. Sex offender: The California sex offender registry entry for Steve Lamar, Sierra's father . Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary . 'Please understand, I am a dad, and I want nothing more than to find my missing daughter,' he told the newspaper. After conducting a sweep of registered sex offenders in the area, police have moved on to speaking with Sierra's classmates and searching Sobrato High School, where she transferred this year, for clues. Deputies had suspended their search of the grounds near her home due to a lack of evidence. 'We have exhausted our search efforts in that area. We have investigators . talking to kids hoping they can lead us in the right direction as far as where . she could be. We are looking for any information period,' Sgt. Jose Cordoza told ABC News. A case of a teenage runaway or an abduction, the investigators say they still are not sure. 'I talked to Sierra on the phone Thursday night,' her father Steve LaMar told ABC News saying there was nothing out of the ordinary. 'She was happy, talking to me . about homework. She was asking me to make an appointment so she could dye her . hair. She was happy,' he said. School: In April sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Miss Lamar's mother, Marlene Lamar, who is divorced from her father but said to be equally cooperating with police, confirmed the same view about her daughter. On Sunday police discovered her cell phone a few miles from her home by its electronic ping. Its charger was found in her bedroom. Her mother had initially called it when her school reported her as not having attended classes but she found that it was turned off, prompting her to notify police that evening. Friends: Agreeing with her parents, her friends said that Miss Lamar showed no clues of running away . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scene at her mother's driveway her cell phone was recovered the Sunday after she disappeared in a field nearby . According to reports from the sheriff's . department her mother is the last one known to have seen her at their . home she moved into last October. She took a photo of her daughter on her cell phone before she left Friday morning, capturing her smiling with her tongue out at the camera. That photo has been submitted to police in help of finding her. At 6am, Miss Lamar had a half-mile walk to the school bus stop ahead of her, but the bus driver claims to have never seen her, nor fellow students. Police dogs also lost her scent at the driveway of her home. Evidence: With that field close to this road, pictured, police suspect it may have been tossed there from a passing car . Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop last Friday morning in Morgan Hill, California . 'We're hoping she's alive and that's . the most important thing right now,' her mother told KTVU while saying . she doesn't believe her daughter would have run away. Her cell phone as well as her laptop are currently undergoing a forensic search. As both of her high schools circulate her picture, posting and distributing flyers, they hope her friends will have more clues toward her disappearance. Suspended: The choice to suspend their ground search was decided by a lack of evidence police said . 'I hung out with her last week and . she was happy,' her best friend Channah Foreman told KTVU. 'We . celebrated my birthday. We don't understand what's going on. It . doesn't make sense.' Authorities said there was no indication she planned to run away, unlike in the cases of most fugitive children. Her sister Danielle claimed that Miss Lamar would never abandon her loved ones, saying: 'She's always in contact with family and friends. She wouldn't leave everyone out of the loop.' Description: Miss Lamar is 5ft 2inches, slim, with long dark hair and was last seen carrying a black and pink bag made by Juicy . Police previously told the San Jose Mercury News . that Miss Lamar did not appear to have a troubled home life . and no witnesses have reported anything suspicious from the time or . location of her disappearance. Miss Lamar is 5ft 2inches, slim, with long dark hair and was last seen carrying a black and pink bag made by Juicy. Her father issued an emotional appeal this weekend for her to return, saying: 'Come home, baby, please come home. You're not in trouble. Everyone wants to see you.'

"Playing under David Moyes brought about embarrassment for Rio Ferdinand, who has revealed the former manager slowly lost the dressing room. In an explosive autobiography - #2Sides - serialised in The Sun, Ferdinand laid bare the difficulties United endured during a turbulent season that undermined the foundations built over two decades. Moyes’ disastrous reign saw the club drop out of all European competition and fall way short of rivals Manchester City. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Rio Ferdinand (right) says that playing under David Moyes (left) at Manchester United was embarrassing . Rio Ferdinand (right) returned to Old Trafford to face Manchester United with Queens Park Rangers . Ferdinand and Manchester United struggled for form under David Moyes' management last season . And the central defender, who was allowed to leave Old Trafford on the Scot’s say-so, felt Moyes’ mentality wasn’t befitting of the club’s stature. ‘He tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be,’ Ferdinand writes. ‘Unintentionally, he created a negative vibe where, with Fergie, it had always been positive.’ Ferdinand’s main grievance was the way in which Moyes went about trying to win games – stark contrast to the free-flowing, attractive style with which Louis van Gaal is beginning to implement again. The now Queens Park Rangers man saw that to his cost on Sunday as Unitedran out comfortable 4-0 winners. ‘He’d slowly lost us. I didn’t enjoy playing under him. Sometimes our main tactic was the long, high, diagonal cross. It was embarrassing,’ Ferdinand added. ‘Moyes’s innovations led to negativity and confusion. It was always how to stop the other side. Moyes set us up not to lose. We’d been accustomed to playing to win.’ Manchester United struggled under Moyes and failed to qualify for the Champions League, finishing seventh . Rio Ferdinand (left) has slammed David Moyes for the Scot's reign as manager of Manchester United . Ferdinand also cited Moyes's decision to prevent United's players from indulging in chips as a big grievance among the players. The former England captain insists that the players always ate low-fat chips on the night before a game under Ferguson's rule. 'We loved our chips,' he writes. But Moyes banned the food after just a week in charge at United leaving the squad 'p***** off.' Rio Ferdinand received a warm welcome from the Old Trafford faithful when he returned with QPR .

Ferdinand highlights Javier Hernandez as one player who felt especially put out by Moyes's management. The Mexican was 'happy for three years', according to Ferdinand, benefitting from Fergie's arm around his shoulder. But Moyes's different man-management techniques meant Hernandez's confidence ebbed away, says Ferdinand. Moyes was sacked shortly after United's Champions League exit to Bayern Munich last April, and Ferdinand says the squad's preparation for that game 'seemed wrong'. United were taken to a public park to practice set pieces, claims Ferdinand, in a decision he brands 'bizarre'.","Rio Ferdinand reveals that David Moyes' Manchester United reign was 'embarrassing' for the players to witness .

"Fernando Alonso upstaged title rivals Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton by posting the quickest lap during the opening practice session for the Singapore Grand Prix. Alonso relished the tight confines of the Marina Bay street circuit, setting a time of 1 minute, 49.056 seconds - a tenth of a second ahead of  Hamilton, with third-place Rosberg only two hundredths of a second off the pace of his team-mate and championship rival. The Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo finished fourth and fifth on the timesheets, but the former suffered an engine problem at the end of the session and was forced to stop on track. Fernando Alonso was quickest under the lights during the opening practice session at the Marina Bay Circuit . Nico Rosberg towels himself down ahead of the first session. Lewis Hamilton is 22 points adrift of the German . Rosberg had an issue with a loose wing mirror during the session and had to remove it while he was driving . Alonso's team-mate, Kimi Raikkonen, put in a competitive showing with seventh place, behind Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne, who performed strongly before his car suffered an electronics failure that briefly saw him block the pit exit. Jenson Button also had technical difficulties that restricted his running but was eighth fastest, followed by Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat and Force India's Sergio Perez. The Williams cars were surprisingly uncompetitive. While this twisty circuit was expected to count against a team that thrived on the flowing Belgian and Italian tracks in the previous two races, it was still surprising to see Felipe Massa down in the 13th and Valtteri Bottas in 15th. Vettel, who has been plagued by reliability issues this season, stopped on track at the end of the session near the pit-lane exit complaining of an engine issue. Sebastian Vettel was hit with an engine issue during the clsoing stages of the opening session in Singapore . Team principal Christian Horner has confirmed Vettel will be lucky to make it back on track for the second session. Horner said: 'It looks like an engine problem, a sudden loss of engine oil pressure, which usually means something pretty nasty. 'The engine changes on this car take around three and a half hours, so there's a lot of work to do. 'It's going to be tough. The biggest loss is the track time and the long run.

"There was something very frightening happening at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Something terrifyingly real, something tremendously ominous. That’s the case if you happen to be in the homes of Mr Pellegrini, Wenger or Rodgers. Looking back on a comeback win against an impressive Swansea City, the residence of Jose Mourinho will be a very serene place indeed. Why? Because two of his summer gems – Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas – are showing more than a fleeting glimpse that they could become the next great Premier League double act. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho praising Diego Costa's goalscoring record . Diego Costa celebrates his second goal against Swansea from yet another Cesc Fabregas assist . The pairing of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have formed a deadly partnership for Chelsea . It was they who dragged Chelsea from their considerable slumber, turning a game on its head and ruthlessly sending the Welsh side packing. These two signings could prove the difference between Chelsea going close – see May for details – and clinching a title. Four years ago, the last time they lifted the crown, there was Frank Lampard supplying Didier Drogba. This duo is different, but threatening something just as devilish. Jose Mourinho congratulates his new star striker Diego Costa after he scored a hat-trick on Saturday . 1. Cesc Fabregas                6 . 2. Gylfi Sigurdsson             4 . 3. Ramires                           3 . First, the numbers. - Costa is the only player in Premier League history to notch seven goals in his first four games, beating Sergio Aguero and Micky Quinn (both six). - The striker has two more already than a certain Fernando Torres managed in the entirety of last year. - Fabregas is the first player in the top-flight to have ever bagged an assist in six consecutive games (including his last two matches for Arsenal). - Costa’s goals have come from 10 shots on target and he is the first player to find the net in his first four games for Chelsea since John Meredith in 1928. It is easy to be blinded by figures, dazzled by the breaking of records. In this case, though, those are merely a pleasing by-product to a blossoming relationship that will only mature with age. Cesc Fabregas' brilliant start to life at Chelsea will also have pleased his manager Jose Mourinho . Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa have played together for Spain but their partnership is still relatively new . The signs at the Bridge were that Fabregas and Costa mean serious business, and Mourinho knows it. The manager dealt with questions about the performances of both with the type of nonchalance a man who expects this type of dynamism on a regular basis serves up. Chelsea have been accused of extreme mechanism under the Portuguese but that is now redundant. The Blues managed to weed out the deadwood and have taken on more exuberance. The golden pair are at the heart of this new-look Mourinho outfit. When Costa comes short, Fabregas threads a ball into feet; when he spins a defender, the playmaker looks to go over the top. The understanding on Saturday was akin to team-mates who had been together for seasons. While they have played together for Spain, the sharpness with which they have engineered lightning intuition remains remarkable. David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy formed a deadly partnership together in their years at Old Trafford . Steven Gerrard provided plenty of assists for Fernando Torres when they played together at Liverpool . David Beckham showed something similar in his final seasons at Old Trafford by providing for the clinical Ruud van Nistelrooy. Robert Pires and Thierry Henry fired Arsenal to two titles in three years, including the famous invincible season, while Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres formed a deadly duo at Liverpool. More recently, David Silva and Sergio Aguero have helped Manchester City to their first two Premier League titles. None of those partnerships showed such early promise as Chelsea’s, though. Fabregas assisted two of Costa’s hat-trick against the Swans – adding to when they combined against Everton – and there is a real belief in SW3 that the boss has hit the right note. Thierry Henry and Robert Pires played brilliantly together to lead Arsenal to their invincible season in 2004 . He spoke of waiting for the ‘right’ striker to come along – reaffirming that Chelsea bided their time in bidding for Costa, instead of jumping head first into a condensed and inflated market last year. They had to watch nervously as Manchester United flirted with Fabregas in 2013 too. Good – or proficient – things seemingly come to those who wait. ‘Those two together are as good a partnership as I’ve seen in a long time,’ was the assessment of Danny Murphy on the BBC. Even at this early stage it’s difficult to disagree. David Silva and Sergio Aguero are the latest partnership for Fabregas and Costa to try and emulate . Mourinho must take more than a portion of the plaudits after this display. He saw that Fabregas was itching to impact the game higher up the pitch – and was actually caught out of position during a timid first half. The Spaniard shone in a more advanced role and it could be that he takes up that station from the start too often – impeccable service into Costa dictates that.","Diego Costa has scored seven goals in his first four games for Chelsea .
Cesc Fabreagas has provided an assist in all of his last six Premier League matches .

"A tourist on a swamp boat in Louisiana has captured on video the spine-chilling moment a guide jumped in the water to feed a pair of alligators, offering the animals treats directly from his lips. The footage shot by Stacy Hicks outside Jean Lafitte Historical Park and Preserve last month has gone viral, racking up more than 108,000 shares on Facebook while drawing sharp criticism from state wildlife officials. While it is not illegal to feed alligators under Louisiana law, Jefferson Parish, where the tour company Airboat Adventures is based, prohibits the risky practice. Scroll down for video . Too close for comfort: A tourist in Louisiana photographed and videotaped their tour guide, a man named Lance, feeding two hulking gators raw chicken and sweets while wading in the water last month . Toothy kiss: The terrifying moment an alligator plucked a marshmallow from Lance's lips . Dangerous game: Louisiana has no law on the books prohibiting people from feeding alligators, but Jefferson Parish has banned the practice . 'This is not a zoo, this is a natural habitat the animals need to be doing their normal things,’ said Aleutia Scott, of Jean Lafitte Historical Park. State wildlife officials are now reviewing the three-minute video to determine if any wrongdoing had taken place. MailOnline reached out to Airboat Adventures Wednesday, but a representative declined to comment on the video. The footage of the feeding frenzy is also not sitting well with some visitors. ‘If I wanted to be entertained like that, I would go and see a circus,’ said Sandy Ewart, from Scotland. Bad precedent: Stacy Hicks, who captured the feeding, was afraid for the guide's life, especially since he revealed he had been bitten recently . Horsing around: The guide frolicked with the reptiles in the water, play-wrestling with them and letting them climb on top of him . Cruising around: Hicks joined a group of 20 other vacationers aboard this swamp boat operated by Airboat Adventures . The video of the alligator feeding was captured by Stacy Hicks, a kitchenware company consultant from Clatskane, Oregon, who traveled to Louisiana last month for a book lovers' convention. On May 16, the woman joined 20 other vacationers for a swamp tour in Jean Lafitte led by a guide with Airboat Adventures named Lance. Mrs Hicks recalled how at one point Lance stunned the group by jumping from the boat into the alligator-infested waters and telling them to have their cameras ready . In the video recorded by the Oregon resident, two large reptiles swim up to Lance, who begins feeding them raw chicken, which he reportedly had stuffed in his pockets. Viral sensation: Stacy Hicks was in New Orleans last month for a book lovers' convention when she decided to take a swamp tour; the Oregon resident's video has racked up more than 108,000 Facebook shares . The guide continues to pet and frolic with the gators, even hugging one of them. The footage culminates with Lance placing a marshmallow thrown to him from the boat by one of the tourists between his lips, which an alligator then gently plucks up. Hicks later told The New Orleans Times Picayune that she was concerned for the tour guide’s safety, especially since he told the group that he had been bitten a few days earlier. Colonel John Fortunato, with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, told MailOnline over the phone Wednesday that officials are now in the process of reviewing the video. The sheriff’s office spokesperson explained that they only recently received a formal complaint about the feeding incident, allowing them to launch an official investigation.","Stacy Hicks, from Oregon, recorded a video last month showing a guide with Airboat Adventures feeding two gators in Jean Lafitte, Louisiana .

"Rubble and dust, pigeon droppings, abandoned manuscripts and a lonely mud-splattered grand piano are all that remain beneath the high arches of Christchurch's grand blue-stone Cathedral. Haunting new photographs from inside the cathedral provide an eerie reminder of the devastation caused by the earthquake that rocked the city in February 2011. They are among the first photos taken since that day the earth opened-up on New Zealand's south island, bringing down the cathedral spire and ripping a hole in its façade. The cathedral, at the heart of Christchurch's CBD, was among 1000 other buildings destroyed by the earthquake, which also claimed 185 lives. But as the rest of the city rebuilds, the abandoned house of worship -  built between 1864 and 1904 - stands untouched. The Anglican Church wants to see it demolished, while many in the city are lobbying for the structure to be repaired.

"A senior Conservative backbencher has said the return of David Davis to Cabinet would help strengthen the party against Ukip . Tory MP and former leadership contender David Davies could be the Conservative party's secret weapon to beat Ukip, it has been suggested. A senior Conservative backbencher has said the return of the politician to Cabinet would help strengthen the party on its stance on Europe. Speaking to the Sunday Express, the backbencher, said: 'Appointing David Davis to the Cabinet would be a Mandelson moment for the leadership. 'There are people who don't believe the party is serious about holding an in/out referendum. 'As Minister without Portfolio Davis can say to the electorate 'Trust me, we are going to hold a referendum' and people would believe him.' A full Government reshuffle following the Euro elections has been mooted. David Cameron has been urged by Mr Davis to bring forward his promised EU referendum by a year to 2016 in a bid to persuade defectors to Ukip he is serious. Mr Davis said the policy lacked 'both clarity and credibility' and should be speeded up to allay the fears of voters who have defected to Ukip. 'The Conservative Party has to decide pretty soon where its blue lines are and make them very clear,' he wrote in the The Sunday Times. 'If we do not grasp this nettle, I can see the Ukip resurgence carrying all the way through to the general election. 'As it stands we appear to be moving crab-like towards a referendum in 2017, without a clearly articulated set of strategic negotiating aims that might make it worthwhile to stay in the EU, or a clear vision of what we will do if the people decide they want to leave. 'Bringing the date forward will signal a greater sense of determination to our European partners.' He said if Britain decided to leave in the first half of 2016, it will take two years to negotiate and another two years for the new strategy to work. It has been suggested that David Davies could be the Tory party's secret weapon to beat Nigel Farage's Ukip . European votes were cast on Thursday at the same time as local elections in which Ukip gained 128 seats and made serious inroads into Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat support. Opinion polls suggest the Ukip vote will be stronger in the European election after a bitterly fought campaign dominated by immigration and contested allegations of racism against Mr Farage. A victory will intensify questions facing other party leaders as they battle to reassure MPs and activists that the Ukip surge will not derail their campaigns for the general election next year. George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage . Meanwhile, George Osborne flatly ruled out an electoral deal with Nigel Farage, even as he vowed never to ‘belittle’ Ukip voters. The Chancellor sought to silence talk by worried Tory MPs of an electoral deal with the Ukip leader by insisting the only real choice at next year’s General Election was between David Cameron and Ed Miliband. Speaking to Tory activists in London, Mr Osborne declared: ‘There will not be a pact. 'For a Conservative Government at the next  election, you have to vote Conservative.’ But the stern warning was coupled with a clear bid to reach out to Ukip voters and win them back to the Conservatives. Mr Osborne stressed how he ‘respected’ Ukip voters and Mr Farage even if he did not agree with the party’s leader. He said: ‘The modern Conservative party will never dismiss or belittle the views of the people we aspire to represent. ‘We should show the highest respect for those who go out and cast their vote – and respect too for those who cast their vote for another party, and that includes those who voted foBut Mr Osborne insisted that Mr Farage did not have ‘the answers to the country’s future’. Despite Mr Osborne taunting Labour over a ‘miserable’ result in last week’s local elections, a new survey by former Tory vice-chairman Lord Ashcroft last night claimed Labour was still on course for a clear General Election win. The survey of key marginal seats put Labour at 41 per cent – way ahead of the Tories on 29. The poll found there was an average 6.5 per cent swing to Labour – enough to oust up to 83 Tory MPs and secure what some observers said could be a Labour majority of 70. Ukip was on 18 per cent with the Lib Dems scoring just eight per cent, based on 1,000 voters in each of  the areas.","Senior Conservative backbencher said return of the politician to Cabinet would help strengthen the party on its stance on Europe .

"These dramatic images show the moment thieves sliced a rectangle in a jewellery shop window and snatched £400,000 of valuables in just one minute. Two men can be seen using what is thought to be a chainsaw to cut out a large part of the display window before reaching inside to grab the merchandise - as staff watched from inside the store. The raid saw three men riding motorbikes carry out the heist at Griffin Jewellers in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, on November 10. Scroll down for video . A CCTV still shows two men using what appears to be a chainsaw to cut out a large portion of the window . After removing the glass, they reach inside Griffin Jewellers to grab an estimated £400,000 worth of valuables .

After the thieves fled with their haul, shards of glass, rings and other jewellery were left scattered on the pavement. Customers at a nearby pub were said to have given chase to the three perpetrators following the incident. Witness Dave Sims, who owns nearby Cosy Times Yankee Candle Shop, said: 'I was driving past Griffins and I could see a man with a chainsaw cutting the window.

"This is the moment the carer for an elderly woman with Alzheimer's Disease was caught on a hidden camera stuffing stolen £10 notes into her bra. Sarah Leacy, 33, of Putney, London, was secretly filmed stealing the money from her 90-year-old client, Monica Flanagan, earlier this year. The victim's children Annemarie Key, Eileen Flanagan and Stephen Flanagan, had installed a small camera in their mother's home after they noticed money going missing from a secure cash box in the kitchen. Sarah Leacy, 33, was secretly filmed stealing two £10 notes from her client, 90-year-old Monica Flanagan . The box was kept locked with a key that was hidden in a separate location. During both incidents, on June 13 and July 7 this year,  a £10 note was taken by Leacy. The carer denied everything in her police interview, swearing on her 'nan and granddad's ashes' she had never taken cash out of the box. However, Wimbledon Magistrates' Court heard Leacy completely changed her story when police told her she had been caught taking the money on film. She then claimed she had bought milk, bread and toilet cleaner for her client and gave Mrs Flanagan the leftover change to put in her purse. In the video Leacy is seen taking the box out of a cupboard and unlocking it with the key while making small talk with someone in another room. She then puts the box back in the cupboard and turns away from the camera, stuffing something into her bra before resuming her conversation. Giving evidence Mr Flanagan said: 'I left £30 cash in there, on June 11. A couple of days later, on June 13, I found £20 in the box. 'On July 7, again I checked the box. There was £35 in there and when I checked the box later that day £10 was missing. 'Quite a lot of material we were buying for her went missing at the time as well.' Her children kept receipts in the box and all knew exactly how much was in there and when things had been bought for their mother. Mrs Flanagan's children set up the secret camera in the kitchen after money started to go missing - she is pictured here taking the box out of the cupboard before she unlocked it and stole £10 . Prosecutor Philip Sutton said: 'The prosecution would like to draw your attention to the fact that when Leacy was taxed about the matter she had no recollection but when she saw the CCTV there was an admission and indeed the extent of detail. 'No note was left inside the box to say 'I had to take money' or change. 'It is unlikely on both occasions that exactly £10 was spent.' Leacy had been Mrs Flanagan's regular carer since October 2013. She would spend 45 minutes with Mrs Flanagan, make her a sandwich and a cup of tea and give her medication. She told the court she only took the money to buy things for Mrs Flanagan. When asked by magistrates why she initially denied taking money,  Leacy began crying. She said: 'I was frightened. I was scared. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what I was saying.' Wimbledon Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Leacy completely changed her story when police told her she had been caught taking the money on film - she was found guilty of stealing the two £10 notes . She said she had been humiliated when police arrested her in the street and added: 'I was there to help a client out. I'm not some kind of thief. I would never do that.' Leacy was found guilty of two counts of theft on Thursday. District judge James Henderson said: 'It seems strange to me that if the money had been taken and used quite legitimately that it would be so dramatically forgotten. 'I'm driven to conclude and I'm driven to infer it really isn't possible for the [police] interview to have progressed in the way that it did with flat denial and acceptance. 'It cannot be that was genuine forgetfulness and I'm driven to conclude Miss Leacy did steal the two amounts of £10. I find both charges proved.' Leacy will be sentenced on Monday morning.","Sarah Leacy, 33, was caught after patient's children became suspicious .

"A stunning waterfront property in one of Sydney’s most affluent suburbs has sold  for a staggering $27 million in an off-market deal. Located on Dumaresq Road in Rose Bay, the beautiful three-storey home delivers an outstanding beachfront allotment with spectacular views of the city and the Harbour Bridge. The sale comes after the previous owners - technology innovator Kevin Bermeister and his wife Beverley - purchased a $9.5million luxurious clifftop property in Dover Heights back in August. Scroll down for video . One of Sydney’s most affluent suburbs has sold a waterfront property for a staggering price in an off-market deal for $27 million . The Sydney entrepreneur was born in South Africa before living in the Rose Bay mansion with his family near the water for the past few years. Bermeister, who created the file sharing service called Kazaa, reached a $150 million settlement in 2005 after being sued by the music industry over his business. Although it's not traditionally one of the more glamorous rooms in any home, this property's stunning bathroom could surely compete with any in Sydney. It offers panoramic views from the tub across to the city and Harbour Bridge - perfect for the new owners to kick off after a long day. The stunning three-storey property features waterfront views - overlooking the city and Sydney Harbour Bridge . Experts believe the new home owners could be from overseas. The sale follows after the new owners missed out on the Point Piper oceanfront property when it sold in October for a cool $30 million, according to Domain. While the sale tops an impressive run of pre-Christmas sales, the real estate agent has been kept under wraps but McGrath Estate Agents' Ben Collier might be the man behind the deal. The 789 square metre modern property has had a major overhaul by architect Bruce Stafford since it was last traded in 2006 for an asking price of $14.2 million, Domain reports. The whopping sale has broken the Rose Bay record after a contemporary waterfront home on Bayview Hill Road sold for $18.2 million in 2006.

"Leo Santa Cruz, the vaunted US-based Mexican who defends his WBC world super-bantamweight title on the Floyd Mayweather-Marcos Maidana undercard in Las Vegas, is offering to fight Belfast’s new folk hero Carl Frampton next. As he prepared to enter the Las Vegas ring against long-time friend and fellow Mexican Manuel Roman, Santa Cruz passed appreciative judgement on Frampton’s brilliant winning of the IBF title from Kiko Martinez last Saturday night. Santa Cruz said: ‘I am really hoping for a unification fight against Frampton next. I was impressed by his win over Martinez and he is a very good boxer but I am confident I can beat him.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mayweather ready for title defence . Leo Santa Cruz, pictured here fighting Cristian Mjares in Las Vegas back in March, has been impressed by Belfast fighter Carl Frampton and hinted they could meet in his next contest . Santa Cruz was impressed by the manner in which Frampton beat Kiko Martinez in Belfast last weekend . So confident that he adds: ‘Yes, I am willing to fight in Belfast even though Frampton has all that home support there.’ Santa Cruz then sees himself going on to England to relieve Scott Quigg of the WBA ‘regular’ belt he defends against Belgium’s Stephane Jamoye in Manchester this Saturday night. All that would be by way of preparation for a duel for the undisputed super-bantam crown against Cuban maestro Guillermo Rigondeaux. The WBO champion’s brilliant defensive style has been criticised as unexciting in the US and Santa Cruz says: ‘We need to build a meeting between me and Rigondeaux into a super-fight because on his own he does not attract a big audience.’ Santa Cruz has also set his sights on fighting England's Scott Quigg (left), seen here against Tshifhiwa Munyai . Santa Cruz is fighting on the undercard of the Mayweather-Maidana rematch in Las Vegas on Saturday night . Wins over Frampton and Quigg would help him in that enterprise but there may be a delay if the Belfast Jackal is forced first to make a mandatory IBF defence against America’s little-known Chris Avalos. Meanwhile, Golden Boy promotions are willing to offer David Haye a comeback route to boxing if he wants to fight again. Oscar De La Hoya’s matchmaker Eric Gomez, who is leading Golden Boy’s participation in Floyd Mayweather’s Saturday night with Marcos Maidana, noted Haye’s presence in Vegas and said: ‘We’ve worked with David before and we would be interested in doing so again. We would find him a place on an undercard. ‘He just have to start boxing again. He keeps fit.’ Golden Boy promotions are offering David Haye, seen here in his heavyweight fight with Wladimir Klitschko back in 2011, the chance of a return to the ring . Haye has not fought in the two years since beating Dereck Chisora at West Ham’s Upton Park football ground, since when he has twice pulled out injured from scheduled heavyweight fights with Tyson Fury. London’s former cruiserweight and heavyweight world champion has just split from his long-time trainer Adam Booth and entered into talks with US boxing facilitator Al Haymon.","Leo Santa Cruz has offered to fight Belfast's Carl Frampton next .

'I want them to enjoy and experience Australian life, as well, so when they grow up they can make their own choices in life where they want to be.'

"Louis van Gaal says that Danny Welbeck was sold to Arsenal because he was not good enough for Manchester United but denies that the club have ditched their vaunted youth policy. United’s £150million summer spend on six new players, including Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, has led to concerns that they are turning their back on homegrown talent – especially after England striker Welbeck was sold to Arsenal for £16m. But at a press conference to unveil Falcao and Daley Blind on Thursday, Van Gaal claimed that United remain as committed as ever to promoting young players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Danny Welbeck wasn't good enough for Man United . Danny Welbeck (2nd right) laughs with team-mate Jack Wilshere (2nd left) during an Arsenal team photo shoot . Arsenal's new signings (from left) Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers, David Ospina, Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez at London Colney on Thursday . Danny Welbeck gets down to work at training with Arsenal after his £16m move from Manchester United . He explained the reason behind selling Manchester-born Welbeck, who has been at the club since childhood, pointing out that the England striker’s record of 29 goals from 142 games was not nearly as good as Wayne Rooney or Robin van Persie. ‘I have given all the players a chance to convince me of their qualities,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When you ask about Danny Welbeck, he was here since the age of nine and after Sunderland (on loan) he played three seasons at United but he doesn’t have the record of Van Persie or Rooney and that’s the standard. That’s why we let him go. ‘Falcao, okay, but also the youngsters who will fit in. That’s the policy and that’s why I’m here. The transformation is in this new process. ‘We spoke with Danny Welbeck and also Chicharito [Javier Hernandez] before we got the chance to sign Falcao. We have to be fair about that. In that part (area of the team) we had a lot of youth who can fit in. They have to take their chance to play football. I have to put them in the squad.’ Louis van Gaal says Danny Welbeck's record isn't as good as that of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie . Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney are the standard for Manchester United, says Van Gaal . Former United favourites Gary Neville and Paul Scholes have questioned United’s transfer policy, while Sir Alex Ferguson’s former No 2 Mike Phelan has claimed that the club are losing their ‘identity’ by selling Welbeck. I can’t work it out and I know I worked with Danny Welbeck last week [with England], but it’s odd,' Neville said. 'I have to admit I thought the Danny Welbeck sale was a strange one, but that’s just me. ‘Of all the prices paid this summer, there are right backs and left-backs galore who have been bought for £14m, £15m, £16m? ‘How have Arsenal got him [Welbeck] for £16m? I can’t work it out. It has helped out a competitor because Arsenal are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly. ‘I am struggling to work out the logic, I can’t understand it. It’s odd in two or three ways. But Van Gaal was quick to point out that having let 14 players go this summer and signed six, United have created the possibility of eight vacancies for young players at the club. James Wilson will be in contention for Welbeck’s place and Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett have made the first-team debuts already this season.

Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (centre) with Radamel Falcao (left) and Daley Blind (right) He added: ‘We let go 14 players so how to fit them all isn’t so difficult when you let go 14 and only six come in. We need the youth education, that is the policy of Manchester United also. ‘I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can’t do that for them. The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that. ‘There is a new hierarchy in the dressing-room so there is a new process. It’s not so easy, and that’s why I have asked for time because I knew in advance that this would happen. ‘When you don’t let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a chance. ‘The question is if they take the chance. It’s of course more risky but it’s the only way to do it, and United have always grown players in the squad.

VIDEO Falcao wants long-term United stay . ‘I hope so because they have to perform our philosophy, and that is not so easy to perform. You have seen that already. ‘I think the players we have selected will do that better, otherwise we wouldn’t have to buy these players.’ Van Gaal paid tribute to Falcao and described how the Colombia striker – who could cost United a total of £52m if they make his £6m loan from Monaco permanent next summer – had demonstrated his class in his very first training session at Carrington. ‘When you can hire or buy a player like Falcao then I don’t have doubts because he is for me one of the best strikers in the world. When you see his record it’s unbelievable. ‘Today at training he got one ball and it was in the goal. He confirmed it in his first training session with me.

"Julie Coade, 71, was crushed to death by a ride-on mower as she was cutting her lawn in Trallong, Brecon . A grandmother was crushed to death by her ride-on mower while she was cutting her lawn in preparation for a church fundraiser. Julie Coade, 71, was killed in the freak accident while trimming her back garden lawn in Trallog, near Brecon, in August this year. The keen gardener had been tidying up her lawn just one day before the fundraiser when the mower toppled over on a steep bank, crushing her underneath. One of her neighbours rushed to help and heaved the machine away from Mrs Coade, but she could not be saved. At an inquest into her death, the court heard how Mrs Coade was planning to open up her garden the next day to help raise money for the village church. Neighbour Paul Crowhurst told the inquest: 'I was horrified to see her underneath the lawnmower. 'I just grabbed hold of the mower, heaved it off her and screamed for help.' Mr Crowhurst also told the inquest that the pensioner regularly used her lawnmower for 'whizzing along in her garden'. He said: 'She looked very happy and very confident with it. I'd seen her mow the lawn on several occasions.' Despite Mr Crowhurst's efforts to revive his neighbour, paramedics could not save Mrs Coade, the court heard. Powys coroner Andrew Barkley recorded an accident death verdict. He said that Mrs Coade had suffered a compression of the chest and died from traumatic asphyxia. The open garden event was cancelled as a mark of respect to Mrs Coade. Mrs Coade was a community councillor in Trallong until 2013. She was also a member of the village Women's Institute, the Trallong Ladies Choir and a keen fundraiser for Cancer Research. Friend Peter Thole said: 'She was a tireless fundraiser with a heart of gold.' The garden where Mrs Coade was killed after being crushed by her ride-on lawmower .

"Police failed to answer more than a million calls to their non-emergency 101 phone lines in the last year - while some callers waited more than an hour to speak to someone. Shocking statistics which emerged today show 1,085,829 calls were abandoned or dropped by the service over the last year, an increase of more than 25 per cent on the year before. The figures show that more than a third of people calling the lines in some areas either hung up or were cut off before they managed to speak to anyone. Data shows the percentage of calls to police 101 numbers which are being dropped  has risen. File photo . The 101 number was introduced across Britain in 2011 and 2012 to replace individual police station numbers and cut the number of time-consuming 999 calls. But the new figures show that, despite the number of calls to the line falling by more than 100,000 over the last year, the percentage of calls answered is falling. A person calling the line in Lancashire waited an hour and 18 minutes for an answer, while someone ringing Greater Manchester Police waited one hour nine minutes, a Freedom of Information request by the BBC found. Home Office data obtained by MailOnline also shows that more than a third of those calling Lancashire police's 101 line in April and May this year were either cut off or hung up before their call was answered. And the average time taken to answer a call to Sussex Police's 101 line in June was nearly four minutes, figures show. Nearly half of forces  failed to meet internal targets of answering calls within 30 seconds, according to the most recent figures. Five forces failed to provide figures for either their call abandonment rate or average answer time. 101 calls to some forces took over an hour to answer. A third of callers in some areas got no response . John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It was claimed the 101 line would save money and reduce pressure on the emergency services, but the service is simply not performing and the promised benefits won't appear as a result. 'Each call centre costs money, and right now taxpayers aren't seeing value for money. We need to improve 101 service significantly by finding inefficiencies in the system, or look at whether it is worth continuing.' The police forces with the quickest average answer time were in Wiltshire, North Wales, Lincolnshire, Essex and the City of London, where calls were answered after an average of seven seconds. Sussex Police stated: 'The Communications Department is undergoing significant change in merging three centres into one single site. This was due to be live on the 1st of April 2014, however due to issues with technology this has been delayed until November 2014. 'The impact of this delay on performance has been significant as we are operating with the reduced staffing levels required for one site but remaining operational across three sites. Performance is expected to significantly improve from November 2014 onwards.' Lancashire Police stated: 'While it is clear that a number of factors have contributed to the performance challenges that Contact Management has experienced over recent months we are now starting to move towards a position where the benefits of a single Force Control Room will begin to emerge, providing the residents of Lancashire with the high level of service they have come to expect.' 1.

"Tamir Rice, 12, was shot dead by cops in Cleveland on November 22 while carrying a pellet gun . The family of a 12-year-old boy who was carrying a pellet gun when he was shot by a Cleveland police officer have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit. The federal lawsuit filed on Friday against the city and two officers said the police acted recklessly when they confronted Tamir Rice outside a recreation center. Surveillance video, released by police, shows Tamir being shot within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near him at a park on November 22. It showed the boy reaching in his waistband for what police later discovered was an airsoft gun, which shoots non-lethal plastic projectiles. Tamir died the next day. Police have said rookie officer Tim Loehmann believed the boy had a real firearm. The shooting has sparked several protests across the city. Tamir was laid to rest on Wednesday. Two hundred mourners, many wearing white 'R.I.P. Tamir' t-shirts, paid their respects to the young boy at his funeral service at Mount Sinai Baptist Church. The boy's mother, Samaria Rice, hid behind sunglasses as she took her seat next to the boy's father, Leonard Warner, and their daughters, while mourners pored over photographs of Tamir. During the service, the boy's great-uncle called for people to fight for change through peaceful protest and called for the congregation to give Tamir a voice. Scroll down for video .

Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home on Wednesday . 'Tamir can no longer speak for himself. This is why Tamir must live through us. We must now be his voice,' Michael Petty said. 'Through us, Tamir will be heard from the grave. Through us, Tamir will prevent further senseless shootings... not only in Cleveland, but in this nation.' He added that police need to change how they train officers and take a closer look at how they communicate with dispatchers after messages were apparently not properly relayed to the officers in Tamir's case. 'We must now be his advocate for change and reform,' Petty said, NBC reported. 'Through peaceful protest, civil disobedience, and legislation, Tamir will be heard.' A teacher who taught Tamir at Marion C. Seltzer Elementary School also spoke at the services and said he was 'well liked' and 'would laugh and talk with students he didn't even know'. She said that while he loved to draw and play basketball, he was sometimes challenged by school work. She then turned to Tamir's mother. 'I thank you for your son's life,' she said. 'He will be greatly missed.' Loved: A mourner hold a program showing the  boy, who was shot dead by the officer on November 22 .

The boy was remembered ten days after 26-year-old rookie cop Timothy Loehmann fatally shot him in a city park following a 911 call saying the boy was 'waving around a gun' and pointing it at people. It has since emerged that the 911 dispatcher did not rely the caller's comments that the weapon might be fake, and the officer shot the boy less that two seconds after he arrived on the scene. Footage of the incident shows the officers pulling up beside the boy in a park and yelling at him to put his hands up, authorities say. But rather than raise his hands, the boy apparently reaches towards his waist band and Loehmann shoots the boy. He died the following day. After the shooting, it emerged that the boy was just 12 and was carrying a replica 'airsoft' gun. Airsoft guns fire non-lethal spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator, making it indistinguishable from a real firearm. Following his death, protesters demonstrated in the street and blocked up major intersections. Final moments: In footage released by the Cleveland Police Department, a police car pulls up alongside the boy. But rather than raise his hands, his reaches for his belt line, they claim. He was then shot . The rallies came a day after a grand jury announced they would not indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead Michael Brown, another black, unarmed youth. Loehmann had only joined the Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in suburban Independence. Personnel files released on Wednesday that showed police supervisors in Independence decided he lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of indiscretion and of not following instructions. 'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said. Loehmann resigned from the Independence police department in December 2012 after meeting his supervisors about their concerns. A grand jury will now consider whether charges are merited. Sadness: After the 12-year-old's death - and in the wake of the grand jury's decision not to indict Michael Brown's killer in Ferguson - protesters took to the streets in Cleveland to call for change .

"Newcastle assistant boss John Carver and goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman have apologised for their behaviour towards fans at Southampton last weekend. Carver objected to a 'Pardew Out' banner in the away end at St Mary's and was involved in a verbal altercation with a fan. Woodman, meanwhile, sent an 'ill advised' message on Twitter to a supporter who he says had abused him. Newcastle United assistant manager John Carver has a got at Newcastle fans who had unveiled a 'Sack Pardew' banner prior to last weekend's Premier League match at Southampton . There were a number of anti-Pardew banners and placards in the away section at St Mary's . Carver looks dejected as he sits next to Pardew during the 4-0 defeat to Southampton . Newcastle were beaten 4-0 to leave them bottom of the Premier League. In a statement released by the club on Thursday, Carver said: 'My sole focus on Saturday, as it always is, was on trying to gain three points for Newcastle United and preparing the players to the best of my ability. 'This included keeping them focussed on their roles and duties in the upcoming 90 minutes. In the warm up, I was disappointed to see banners that could, in my opinion, distract the players and take focus away from the job in hand - namely winning the match. 'I went over to our fans to ask them to help us and requested that they take the banners down. The vast majority of supporters back the team through thick and thin and I am very proud to be one of them. Saturday's match at home to Hull City has become a must-win match for under-fire Pardew . Thousands of 'Sack Pardew' posters have been printed ahead of the weekend's match with Hull . Mike Ashley applauds prior kick-off at Southampton. He is under pressure from fans to sack Pardew . 'I was met with abuse from one supporter and I regret that I responded inappropriately. I sincerely apologise for any offence caused by my reaction. Every fan is entitled to an opinion, positive or negative, and I respect that. I hope fans will understand that I, like them, only wanted what was best for the team. 'I am proud to work for my home town club and would ask every supporter to back the players and all staff, as they really can make a difference.' Woodman added: 'I am very sorry for the ill-advised comment I posted privately on Twitter on Sunday morning, which was subsequently made public. 'It was never my intention, of course, for my response to enter the public domain. 'My response was a reaction to significant personal abuse I received from a number of fans which I felt exceeded that which was fair and balanced. 'That said I understand my response was unacceptable and I regret my actions and apologise for any offence caused.'","Newcastle assistant manager John Carver apologises for remonstrating with fans who unfurled a 'Pardew Out' banner at Southampton last weekend .

"Arsenal and Manchester City could not be separated in a highly entertaining four-goal thriller at the Emirates Stadium. Premier League champions Manchester City scored with just seven minutes on the clock to come away from north London with a point. Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow gives his verdict on the performance of both sets of players. VIDEOS scroll down to watch . Jack Wilshere scored a neat chip past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in the 63rd minute . ARSENAL (4-1-4-1) WOJCIECH SZCZESNY: Some reasonable saves, notably one from Silva before half-time but unable to exude authority when Arsenal really needed him to. 6. MATHIEU DEBUCHY: Better going forward than in defence. Suffered a nasty twisted ankle near the end which may rule him out for some time. PER MERTESACKER: Rarely pretty but he and Koscielny managed to contain City for long periods. As captain and defensive leader will be disappointed to concede second from a set-piece. 6.5. Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker struggled to get to grips with Manchester City's Sergio Aguero . LAURENT KOSCIELNY: Read the game well and made important blocks and interceptions. Hit his own post in stoppage time. 7. NACHO MONREAL: Defensively frail, not helped with Ozil ahead of him. City were ever dangerous when breaking down his side. Booked. 6. MATHIEU FLAMINI: Beaten by Aguero in build-up to the opening goal. Strong and aggressive without the assurance of Arteta. Booked. 6. JACK WILSHERE: Dragged Arsenal back into the game with aggression and spirit. Splendid first goal and key role in the second, but lucky to escape two wild kicks and a handball in his penalty box.8. Jack Wilshere levelled the scoring in the second half after lobbing England team-mate Joe Hart . AARON RAMSEY: Seemed jaded by his recent standards and off the pace, perhaps the result of his ankle injury playing for Wales in Andorra. Quality slipped. 6. ALEXIS SANCHEZ: Excellent on the ball. Full of energy, power and flashes of skill. Sublime volley for Arsenal’s second. Booked for ripping shirt off. 7. MESUT OZIL: started left, moved to the right, ineffective in either position and his defensive limitations are exposed when asked to play wide. 5.5. DANNY WELBECK: Positive first half. Good simple link-up with those around him. Struck the post post with a cool chipped finished, but he should’ve scored. Suffered cramps and faded late on. 6.5. Alexis Sanchez thought he scored the winning goal until Martin Demichelis' late goal . Danny Welbeck missed a golden chance to open his Arsenal account on his debut . SUBS: Chambers (for Debuchy 81), Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Welbeck 88), Arteta (for Flamini 95). NOT USED: Ospina, Gibbs, Cazorla, Podolski. ARSENE WENGER: Happy with the draw after last season’s problems against the big teams and with the offensive power from his team. Showed enough character to haul themselves back into it when they seemed ready to overwhelmed. Unable to close the game out and ultimately left to cling on for the draw. 6.5. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be pleased with his side's second half display . MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-1-1) JOE HART: Coped well in a busy first 30 minutes. Clean hands and decent saves but beaten twice too easily for the goals. 6. PABLO ZABALETA: Reliably strong in defence and capable in attack. Great challenge thwarted Welbeck early in second half. Booked. 7. VINCENT KOMPANY: Imposing physical presence and soothing figure of authority for all but the 11-minute spell when Arsenal scored twice. 7.5. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany remains a vital component in Manuel Pellegrini's team . MARTIN DEMICHELIS: So much more plausible with shorter hair. Made mistakes, beaten regularly by Welbeck in the air. Made amends with a vital equaliser with header from corner.6. GAEL CLICHY: Sharp in tackle, quick to break forward and even went close to a rare goal. A return to the Emirates to be proud of. 7. JESUS NAVAS: Showed his pace and intelligent cross for Aguero’s goal. City will regret not getting him on the ball more. 6.5. FERNANDINHO: Often careless in possession but a destructive force who swarmed and smothered Arsenal’s creative unit. Booked. 6. FRANK LAMPARD: Fleeting reminders of passing range but heavy-footed in comparison to all else around him and replace at half-time. Booked. 5. Frank Lampard, pictured receiving a yellow card, struggled to adapt to the pace of the game . JAMES MILNER: First half on the left, second half in the centre. Industrious and combative in both roles. 6. DAVID SILVA: Sophisticated and inventive on the ball as usual, but for one horribly stray pass almost let in Welbeck. 6.5. SERGIO AGUERO: Robust and well-balanced. Opened scoring with a neat finish. Arsenal will have been relieved to see him go off. Booked. 7. Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scored the opening goal of the game after 28 minutes . SUBS: Nasri (for Lampard 46) goal disallowed 7. Dzeko (for Aguero 67) good chance late on 6. Kolarov (for Fernandinho 77) hit post. NOT USED: Caballero, Mangala, Sagna, Sinclair. MANUEL PELLEGRINI: Angrily blamed the referee for more dropped points. His team were strong at the back under pressure from Arsenal, and sought to do their damage on the break. Nasri for Lampard gave City more attacking verve but decision to take off Aguero was odd. His team has maturity and know-how and were pressing for the winner at the end. 6.5. REFEREE: Mark Clattenburg: Both managers had their complaints but not an easy game to control. Tried to let it flow and helped contribute to the entertainment. 6. ATTENDANCE: 60,003 .

"Johan Cruyff has reiterated his view that new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has a 'militaristic' approach to tactics, while he likes his teams to keep the ball. Cruyff, a footballing icon as both a player and a coach, is considered the founding father of Barcelona's attacking, possession-based, tiki-taka football. The Dutch pair famously do not get on well and in an interview with the Guardian's Donald McRae, Cruyff has once again highlighted the contrast between their philosophies. Johan Cruyff says Louis van Gaal (right) has a militaristic approach to tactics and the pair are nothing alike . The Dutch Johan Cruyff legend introduced 'tiki-taka' football to Barcelona as manager in the 90s . Asked if he had a similar view on the game to Van Gaal, Cruyff said: 'No. Not much. Of course we’re both Dutch and that is always a [shared] basis. But I always think of being in charge of the speed and of the ball. 'Maybe he knows more than me but I always want control of the ball. When I don’t have control of the ball what do I do? I press to get it back. It’s a way of defending. But more important is that I like to have the ball.' In an earlier interview, former Barcelona and Ajax star Cruyff said: 'Van Gaal has a good vision of football but it is not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I want individuals to think for themselves.' Asked by McCrae if he still shares those views, Cruyff answered: 'Yes. But I’ve always been an individual who likes to create something himself within a team performance. So I am happy if my players start thinking.' Louis van Gaal has struggled to adapt early on in his Manchester United career . On United, Cruyff added that he thinks Van Gaal will have a tough time gelling his squad of superstars together. The Old Trafford club spent £147million on new players including Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria, to add to a squad already boasting the likes of Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. 'They are all famous,' said Cruyff. 'They earn a lot of money both on and off the field. How can you create a team and bring all these egos together?' He added: 'You can’t arrange the chemistry of the team in two weeks. It needs time.'","Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal famously do not get on .

"Christmas is now just three weeks away and many of us who are hosting will have our shopping list sorted and our recipes planned. The smoked salmon blini - a fish starter on a bed of cream cheese topped with lemon - is a staple festive canapé. A new variety of smoked salmon on the market hopes to take centre stage on British platters come December 25 - but at £25 for 250g, is it really worth it? Scroll down for video . FEMAIL's Deni Kirkova taste tests the most expensive smoked salmon in the UK against Lidl, M&S and Tesco Finest . Quinlan's Irish Wild Smoked Salmon ranked highly - but at £25 per 250g, how much is the perfect bite worth? Irish company Quinlan's Kerry Fish pride themselves on their  wild salmon, which is now one of the most expensive varieties on the British market. The Quinlan family has specialised in hand curing fish since 1963. using traditional methods, natural ingredients, oak chippings and lots of manpower. Founder Michael Quinlan developed a unique smoking technique and he and his three sons, Liam, Fintan and Ronan (who is the current Master-Smoker) are the only four people in the world to know the secret recipe. The process involves salt, smoke, and brushing back the natural fish oils into the salmon during the smoking. This helps to give the unique taste and texture that Quinlan's, Kerry Fish has become famous for. Their smoked salmons scooped two prizes at this year's Great Taste Awards - the wild was one of them. Tesco Finest Hickory & Oak was a little too oaky, with an overpowering flavour . Marks & Spencer Oak and Applewood smoked salmon (l) and Lidl Laschinger Drycure salmon . Wild salmon is a rare product because fishermen have to comply with EU pre-set quotas and the ultra-short window the wild salmon are in the appropriate area. The family source it from nearby shores and the salmon is then prepared for hand smoking in the original family smokehouse. They started shipping to the UK two weeks ago - just in time for Christmas - and promise to have your order to your door from Ireland within 24 hours. Prices for Quinlan's Irish Wild Smoked Salmon start from £12.50 for a small 125g portion - more than double the regular high street price for smoked salmon - through to £79 for a whole side. As a smoked salmon enthusiast I had no qualms about taste testing four varieties. The others were Marks & Spencer , Lidl and Tesco Finest. None were wild. Quinlan's comes in at almost three times the price - £12.50 for 125g. My colleague made a little canape using each variety and I tried them all on camera. Fourth place: Lidl Laschinger Drycure Scottish, £2.66 per 200g . Lidl didn't impress compared to the others. It has crunchy little bits in it and the colour was pale. However, it's fantastic that you can even get smoked salmon at this price, and it does taste okay. Third place: Tesco Finest Hickory & Oak, £4.80 . This smoked salmon from the Shetland Isles was a little too overpowering on the oak flavour, quite unusual. A lovely smoked uniform colour though, so it would look good for a dinner presentation. Second place: Marks & Spencer Lochmuir Oak & Applewood, £3.69 per 100g . M&S was actually a close second, and considering the price, it is incredibly good value. The texture was smooth and silky with little fat to cut through. It's worth paying an extra few pounds to get your hands on this. First place: Quinlan's wild, £12.50 for 125g or £25 for 250g . My favourite was actually Quinlan's. It tasted healthy, firm and lean, and it was succulent with a rich, deep flavour without being overpowering. Makers say it tastes 'as natural as possible', nodding to the way the fish is caught - swimming through the Atlantic on its migration route as nature intended. It's almost 10 times the price of Lidl salmon per gram. But Quinlan's careful selection, curing and smoking processes, artisan skills, age-old recipes and fine fresh ingredients reflect in the superior taste. The high price mark up from farmed to wild smoked salmon is a product of the strict limit in fishing and difficulty in sourcing. But why did it taste so much better? Regular smoked salmon - the farmed kind seen on most supermarket shelves - has a particularly high in fat content because the fish have usually been reared in small confined areas where they cannot swim freely and put on muscle weight. Wild smoked salmon, on the other hand, have naturally swum hundreds of miles through migration to spawning grounds and contain just a third of the fat of farmed version. Don Staniford, director of the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture, has described the two types of smoked salmon - wild and 'flabby' farmed - as virtually two different foods. He said: 'The farmed salmon is a couch potato compared to the majestic and iconic wild salmon.' Smoked salmon recipes for a festive platter .

"Sumatran tiger triplets born two months ago have gone on public display Friday at a zoo in Washington state. The Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma says the triplets are a cause for celebration for the endangered species. Only about 300 remain in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. About 400 live in zoos worldwide. Scroll down for video . Making their debut: Jaya walks out with Kirana, Dari, and Indah at  the Sumatran tiger enclosure at the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium on Thursday, December 4 . Kirana, Dari and Indah had been behind the scenes with their 11-year-old mother, Jaya, while they put on weight. The three female tigers each weighed about three pounds at birth and now weigh about 15 pounds each. Their births, on October 8, were part of a managed breeding program at the zoo to ensure a genetically diverse population of Sumatran tigers. 'With fewer than 800 Sumatran tigers remaining on the planet, every one is precious,' said Karen Goodrowe Beck, the zoo’s general curator. 'We want visitors to the zoo to see these magnificent animals and we hope they will take action to help their wild counterparts,' she added. Members of the public were asked to help name the cubs, choosing from a selection of monikers. In total, 7,140 votes were cast. The names are derived from Bahasa Indonesia, the Indonesian language. Kirana translates to 'beautiful sunbeam;' Dari is short for Ndari, which means 'full moon' and Indah means 'beautiful one.' Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is home to four Sumatran tigers and one Malayan tiger in addition to Jaya and the cubs. The adult tigers rotate daily around several exhibit spaces in the park.","Kirana, Dari and Indah had been behind the scenes with their mother, Jaya, while they put on weight .

"Reality TV star, fashion face, fake tan ambassador, PETA campaigner and style blogger... is there anything Lucy Watson can't do? Apparently not. The Made In Chelsea star has unveiled the latest items in her jewellery collection, Creature, which she says is her absolute passion - and already has an army of famous fans. Animal lover Lucy was inspired by nature and her surroundings growing up on a farm in Surrey. Fittingly, she called on her pet pooch, Digby, who also stars on Made In Chelsea, to model the range. Businesswoman: Lucy Watson, of Made In Chelsea fame, has unveiled her latest jewellery collection . Who needs models? Animal lover Lucy was inspired by nature when designing her range and called on her pet pooch, Digby, who also stars on Made In Chelsea, to show off the range . Involved in a number of activities for the prevention of cruelty to animals, including a recent global PETA campaign, Lucy, 24, wanted to create a brand that stayed true to her ideals and allowed people to share her passion for animals. The collection is made from sterling silver and gold plate and features a range of products, including tiger teeth shaped earrings, a snake fang motif ring, and Lucy's favourite: earrings that look like shark jaws. Speaking about her latest project, which ranges in price from £40-£150, she said: 'I wanted to invest my time into a brand that I truly believed in. Model pooch: Digby showcases the new designs, which range in price from £40-£150, with the help of a female model . First time around: The collection is made from sterling silver and gold plate and Lucy, seen modelling her first collection, said this venture is her absolute passion . 'It was really important for me to feel passionately about this project, as I am committed to making it a successful range, that I will endeavour to work on for the foreseeable future. 'I have always been an animal lover, and I thought it was the perfect way to bridge the gap between fashion and animals, making high quality, affordable jewellery, inspired by something I am legitimately interested in.' Speaking at the time of launch, Lucy's management said: 'Lucy has been planning Creature for over a year now. She re-did the designs again and again, and has used local manufactures in London to ensure quality and control. Dream come true: When Lucy first unveiled the range earlier this year, she said it was really important for her to feel passionately about this project because she wants it to grow and grow. She can already count Rita Ora, right, as a fan . 'Lucy has been involved in every process, and has invested money she has saved into the business. At heart, Lucy is a savvy business woman, and she wants to create a viable business for her to run, as she knows that the opportunities she has now may not always be available to her.' Lucy's career has sky-rocketed since joining the hit show. She was recently unveiled as the face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Skinny Tan, as well as Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game. The Made In Chelsea regular - whose sibling Tiff has recently joined the E4 cast - looked glamorous as she attended the launch of Very.co.uk's Christmas pop-up shop on Thursday night.","Lucy, 24, unveils latest products in jewellery line, Creature .

"A Liberal Democrat bid to make it illegal to cut aid spending from present levels was a step closer last night – despite noisy opposition from some Tory MPs. The Commons approved legislation to enshrine in law the principle that spending on international aid must never fall below 0.7 per cent of national income. The controversial bill to gold plate Britain’s annual £11.5billion aid budget now goes to the Lords and could become law within months. Scroll down for video . Foreign aid will cost British taxpayers £1billion more than expected by the end of next year because the national income has risen. Pictured, British soldiers checking aid packages bound for Iraq this year . One Tory MP spoke for 75 minutes in an attempt to stop the private members’ bill being passed, but in the end a promised rebellion of Conservative backbenchers never took place. Just five voted against the legislation. The bill was proposed by Michael Moore, the former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary, and was supported by the front benches of all three main parties. Britain has already reached the Coalition’s 0.7 per cent target, and Tory ministers have said there was no need to enshrine it in law because the target has already been met. But, during yesterday’s debate, Tory backbencher David Nuttall said the law would mean that people would not give to charity – as they would see it as the government’s job. He said: ‘This country and the people of this country have a long and proud history of giving generously to charity and long may that continue. ‘But there is a danger, is there not, that some, not all, but some might think that by enshrining the 0.7 per cent figure in statute that the Government is doing their job for them. ‘I'd like to see people feel that it is their responsibility, as well as a matter of charity and an act of charity, to give to international aid charities.’ A series of votes were won during report stage by majorities of more than 140 as just a handful of MPs dug in and attempted to frustrate the Bill's progress. But following a closure motion to halt the final debate, third reading on the Lib Dem MP's Bill was agreed by 146 to five, majority 141. The Bill will now be sent to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. If it is amended and returned to MPs, there are five more days before the election to agree a finalised Bill. If peers make no changes and pass the Bill, it will become law. The Bill legislates to make the aim of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development a legal requirement. Speaking during the third reading debate, International Development Minister Des Swayne reiterated the Government's support for the Bill and said it was a ‘timely Bill in the face of an enormous humanitarian crisis across the world’. Prime Minister David Cameron backed the bill, but did not take part in today's Commons vote . Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh said Britain's international development spending was not only ‘morally right’, but in Britain's national interest. She added: ‘Few votes in this place can with certainty be said to save millions of lives. This one will.’ Introducing the debate, Mr Moore said: ‘By enshrining this commitment in law, the parties represented in this chamber honour the election commitments of 2010, the Coalition honours the Coalition Agreement. ‘But perhaps more importantly than either of those, we give predictability to our aid expenditure, critically for our partners and the recipients of the assistance. ‘We show leadership internationally which can be used to press other rich countries to join us, the first G7 country to reach the UN target and we move the debate on to focus on how we allocate our overseas development aid, not how much we spend on it.’ Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, said: 'Overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries' The Bill was bitterly opposed by a handful of MPs on the Tory backbench, producing a stubborn minority of between four and six votes on a series of divisions during the day. Mr Nuttall, MP for Bury North, began proceedings with a report stage speech that ran to almost an hour, arguing there was no reason for international development to be uniquely protected. Shipley MP Philip Davies spoke for 75 minutes and said: ‘For lots of people around the country, they feel that overseas aid is the taking of money from poor people in rich countries and giving it to rich people in poor countries. ‘What they see is millions of pounds siphoned off by dictators around the world for a new fleet of Mercedes or whatever it may be and think the Government may as well include a Mercedes catalogue with the aid they are giving to some of these countries. ‘My concern about overseas aid spending... is that first of all it doesn't actually work. We have been pouring billions and billions of pounds into countries in Africa which are no further on than when we started pouring billions and billions of pounds into them.’ Conservative commitment to the legislation – promised in the party's 2010 manifesto and included in the coalition agreement – has been undermined by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond who described it as a ‘bizarre idea’. With experts warning that the Government's latest economic blueprint will mean spending cuts in the UK ‘on a colossal scale’, David Cameron is under mounting pressure from many Tory activists, as well as Ukip, to remove the ring fence protecting aid from cuts. Dissent over the scale of spending will be further inflamed by the need for the Government to find more money than expected to meet the target because of a recent recalculation of GDP that pushed the UK's national wealth higher. Downing Street said the Prime Minister supports the Moore bill, but was not intending to take part in the Commons vote. ‘He will be in his constituency,’ said a Number 10 spokeswoman. ‘It is usual practice for the Prime Minister to spend Fridays in his constituency. ‘He thinks this is an important commitment, it is right that we help the poorest people in the world and it is right that we stick by the promises made to them to do it. ‘He believes that there should be support for the Bill and he is confident that it will probably go ahead.’","Backbench bid to enshrine in law target to spend 0.7% of GDP on aid .

"Five young boys sit in a hospital waiting room in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the expression on their faces range from fear to curiosity and determination. They are all set to take part in a traditional mass-circumcision at the Tuanku Mizan Army hospital in the capital. Circumcision, a rite of passage in the mainly Muslim country, is a major event in the lives of these young boys. Waiting game: A group of Malaysian boys wait for their turn during a mass-circumcision ceremony at the Tuanku Mizan Army hospital in Kuala Lumpur . During the mass-circumcisions, dozens of young boys of similar age undergo the ritual surgery together, and are often carried  out during school holidays. In this instance, 112 boys participated in the event organised by the Ministry of Defence for children of defence personnel. The boys were given a red-carpet welcome as they arrived at the hospital, with family watching as they went inside. After the mass-procedure, the boys and their families gather to celebrate their 'passage into manhood'.

"Arsenal are exploring the free transfer market in a desperate attempt to ease their defensive problems. The Gunners’ lack of depth in defence was apparent on Tuesday night when Arsene Wenger was left with just three senior defenders for their 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund. Arsenal are considering signing former West Brom defender Diego Lugano . Joseph Yobo played for Everton for nine years before leaving in 2012 . Former West Brom defender Diego Lugano is available on a free transfer . Joseph Yobo - formerly of Everton - is another option for Arsenal . The club are looking for a central defender to provide cover for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. Clubs can still sign free agents despite the transfer window closing on September 1. Scouts have been asked to examine short-term options Diego Lugano and Joseph Yobo, who are both available and have been discussed at the club’s London Colney HQ. The pair have Premier League experience — Yobo for Everton and Norwich and Lugano with West Brom — which is key for the Gunners. Any moves, though, are a way from fruition with the club still considering their options. Uruguay defender Lugano could be a short-term option as he has Premier League experience . Former Everton defender Joseph Yobo is a free agent after finishing last season at Norwich . There was at least some good news for Wenger on Wednesday when scans on the right ankle of Jack Wilshere, injured in Germany, revealed no serious damage. Also, Mathieu Debuchy who came off against Manchester City, confirmed he has avoided a broken ankle. ‘No fracture but one broken ligament,’ the Frenchman posted on his Facebook account. ‘I have to wait until Friday in order to know if I must have surgery.’ Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, admits Arsenal have no chance of winning the Champions League if they cannot solve the problems which led to their defeat in Dortmund. ‘We have to react,’ Arteta insisted. ‘If you make errors like we did against the top sides, we know there is no chance to win the Champions League.’","Arsenal were left with just three senior defenders for their 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund .

"An abandoned dog in Massachusetts got VIP treatment as she boarded the private plane of Vice President Joe Biden last week. Peggy, a nine-month-old Labrador mix, has been taken in by Biden's eldest son, Beau. The 42-year-old and his wife, Hallie, decided to adopt the pooch from a shelter while spending Thanksgiving in Nantucket and airlifted it more than 390 miles back to their home in Delaware. Rehomed: Indi (nee Peggy) ascends the stairs onto Air Force Two . Pet owner: The nine-month-old Labrador mix, has been taken in by Biden's eldest son, Beau (pictured) The couple have since renamed the dog, Indi. The dog was originally found in Mississippi by Barb Mauller who runs a small animal shelter from her home. She says she regularly drives dogs 1,500 miles to Nantucket Safe Harbor for Animals because they're easier to place than in Mississippi. The Biden family traditionally spends Thanksgivings in the resort town of Nantucket. Four-legged friend: Beau's children, Hunter and Natalie (pictured, apparently fell in love with the dog when they spotted her out walking over Thanksgiving . Smiles: The family of Beau  poses for a picture with their new dog Indi, who was left abandoned in Mississippi . Beau, who serves as Delaware attorney general, and his wife spotted Indi while they were out walking with their two children, Natalie and Hunter. The family apparently fell in love with the animal, who was wearing an 'adopt me' scarf at the time. Nantucket shelter president Pamela Murphy said she only learned who the family was when they went to fill out adoption forms on Saturday. Star outing: Vice President Joe Biden posed with workers from the Nantucket Safe Harbor for Animals before flying away with son Beau’s new dog . Shelter workers were even more surprised when Beau's father showed up to wave Indi off. The pup flew on  Air Force Two, an aircraft used by the 72-year-old Vice President, with her adoptive family. She  joins one-year-old yellow Labrador named Liberty at her new home. Barb Mauller, who originally found Indi, told The Clarion-Ledger that she thought it was 'pretty cool' that the Bidens were the ones who took her in. 'I think it’s just wonderful that people open their hearts and homes to these dogs,' she added.","Beau Biden and his wife Hallie decided to adopt the pooch from a shelter while spending Thanksgiving in Nantucket .

"More than 600,000 Filipinos abandoned their homes yesterday as a powerful typhoon made landfall on the eastern coast, felling trees and knocking out power lines. Typhoon Hagupit – which means ‘smash’ or ‘lash’ – struck parts of the country where a typhoon left 7,300 people dead or missing in November 2013. Although Hagupit is not expected to match that storm’s unprecedented ferocity, the head of the Philippines’ 120,000-strong military, Gregorio Pio Catapang, said: ‘We’re on red alert, the entire armed forces are being mobilised.’ Scroll down for video . Typhoon Hagupit – which means ‘smash’ or ‘lash’ – struck parts of the country where a typhoon left 7,300 people dead or missing in November 2013 . A satellite image taken from miles above Earth shows the typhoon moving across the Pacific Ocean towards the Philippines . Families sought refuge in churches, town halls and sports stadiums as the typhoon closed in, with Filipinos better prepared for the storm than last year . Troops have been deployed to major roads and supermarkets to prevent looting and clear debris, both of which slowed the government’s response last year, Catapang said. Forecasters said Hagupit’s sustained winds of 109mph and gusts of 130mph were enough to set off deadly storm surges and landslides, and cause severe damage to communities and agriculture. The storm is now heading towards the city of Tacloban, which was devastated last year. One resident, Jojo Moro, said: ‘I’m scared. I’m praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven’t recovered from the firs . Coastal villages and areas prone to landslides were left deserted as people made their way to safe zones, such as Tacloban city (pictured) Children and babies, such as two-month-old Ivan Lecciones (pictured), took shelter in a temporary evacuation centre in a church . A woman prays with rosaries inside a makeshift evacuation centre as the Philippines braces for Typhoon Hagupit to strike . Villagers abandoned houses on the coast as clouds began to form over eastern areas of the Philippines, with residents heading to safer areas inland . More than 600,000 people moved into evacuation centres dotted around the country as the storm neared the eastern coast. Families with young children and babies were seen taking cover in churches, town halls and sports stadiums yesterday as they prepared for Hagupit to arrive, fearing it could wreak as much havoc as Haiyan, which destroyed a million homes and displaced more than four million last November. Earlier in the day, social welfare secretary Corazon Soliman said: 'Over 100,000 families are already in evacuation centers. Multiply it by five (people a family), that's 500,000.' Mayor of Manila Joseph Estrada added: 'We have alerted the people of Manila and we're ready. These typhoons change direction all the time.' More than 2,000 people were left stranded in the city as ports closed across the nation. Some Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights in the south of the nation were shut as the storm closed in. Ealy forecasts showed the typhoon was expected to travel across central Philippines, with some suggesting it could veer north towards Manila . Families left their homes behind, in the knowledge that last year's typhoon destroyed a million houses and left four million people displaced . Thousands were left stranded as ports closed across the nation, with flights in the south of the nation also cancelled as the storm approached . Armed policemen stood guard outside a shopping centre in an attempt to stop people from panic-buying in the lead up to Saturday's typhoon .

Families queued up outside town halls as they waited for relief to arrive, with people stocking up on what they can before the storm arrives . An elderly woman sits while other family members gather their belongings as they arrive at a stadium to seek refuge . Dr Steven Godby, expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'No other country is struck by as many tropical cyclones each year as the Philippines. 'For these storms to form, warm sea surface temperatures of at least 26C are needed and these conditions are found in the western parts of the main ocean basins, away from cold water currents. 'Isolated island groups like the Philippines are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones.' Hagupit was forecast to tear through central Philippines along the same route where Haiyan levelled villages and left more than 7,300 dead or missing. In Manila, President Benigno Aquino yesterday led an emergency meeting of disaster-response agencies. The government put the military on full alert, workers opened evacuation centers and transported food packs, medicines and body bags to far-flung villages, which could be cut off by heavy rains. The Philippines appears to have learned lessons from last year's devastation, evacuating thousands to safer areas, including the eastern city of Tacloban, where the typhoon has triggered panic-buying in shops and petrol stations. Joho Moro, a 42-year-old businessman whose wife, daughter and mother were killed in Tacloban by Haiyan last year, said: 'I'm scared. I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first.' He added that he had stocked up on essential supplies and water in preparation for the storm. Teresita Aban, a 58-year-old housewife from Santa Rita in Samar province, said: 'We're prepared but still fearful. We haven't finished repairing our house. It still has tarpaulin patches -- and here comes another storm.'

Hundreds of people still living in tents following Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, were among the first to be relocated to safe zones in Tacloban, which has run out of hotel rooms as wealthier families booked ahead for the weekend. Rita Villadolid, a 39-year-old taking refuge inside a stadium, said: 'We've learned our lesson from Yolanda. Everyone here is gripped with fear.' Disaster response official Blanche Gobenciong said nearly 12,000 residents in Tacloban, where entire settlements were wiped out by the storm, have so far been moved from high-risk villages to emergency shelters. She said: 'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated. Their trauma is still so fresh. 'We have a zero-casualty target. Just one loss of life will really sadden us all and make us wonder what went wrong.' International relief teams are already positioned in the Philippines, ready for the worst. Kevin Noone, executive director of International Medical Corps UK, which has workers on the ground prepared for the storm, said: 'Coming just one year after Typhoon Haiyan, this storm has the potential to cause widespread damage and human suffering. Our teams are on the ground and prepared for whatever the next 48 hours has in store for the people of the Philippines.'","Thousands flee coastal villages and landslide zones as 150mph Typhoon Hagupit hits the Philippines .

"At a time when racial tensions are running high, students at a Texas college are upset because a controversial assignment called 'White Privilege' given by a professor at Lone Star College - Tomball campus. The assignment was a 'White Privileges' worksheet given in an online course, KPRC reports. 'I was shocked, I thought it was a joke,' one student told KPRC. The student refused to complete the assignment and filed a complaint. Scroll down for video . 'White Privilege': Lone Star College-Tomball campus students are upset because a professor gave them a 'White Privilege' worksheet assignment (photographed) asking them to put a check mark next to any statement they believe applied to them and their 'white privilege' Alienated: One student filed a claim and refused to complete the assignment saying the professor's aim was to make him 'feel bad' Students were asked to read the 22-statement checklist and put a check mark by any statement they believe applied to them and their 'white privilege.' Though the assignment was given online, the student said he didn't even feel comfortable completing the assignment alone, behind a computer because it made him feel uncomfortable and singled out. 'There was a white privileges handout, and a white privileges checklist, and a white privileges quiz to see how privileged you are as a white person,' the student told KPRC. The student said the assignment was aimed to make him 'feel alienated' and 'bad.' Another Lone Star-College student, Brady Adams, told KPRC that, if had been given the assignment, he would have refused to complete it as well. 'If it's an assignment,' Adams said, 'I'd be like, I'd take a zero because that's kind of racist.' College: The college (photographed) released a statement saying the assignment was a 'supplemental' exercise with no point value . The worksheet included statements like: 'I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed,' 'If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven't been singled out because of my race,' and 'I can turn on the television or open the front page of the paper and see people of my race being well represented.' The student did not want to be identified for fear of backlash from the professor and told KPRC that he hopes the professor will re-think the assignment. Zero: Student Brady Adams (photographed) said if he had been given the assignment he would have taken 'a zero' because the assignment is 'racist' The professor has not commented publicly about the assignment but the college released a statement saying the assignment was a 'supplemental' exercise with no point value. The college stated: 'Diversity is an important topic covered in the Lone Star College Student Success Course. In addition to its importance, it can also be a very difficult topic to teach, facilitate, and even discuss with students... 'The purpose of this lesson is to encourage students to not only explore the rich dimensions of diversity that are contained within each person, but to also take time to reflect on the aspects of diversity that make up who they are as individuals.'","Lone Star College-Tomball campus students are upset because a professor gave them a 'White Privilege' worksheet assignment .

"The incoming president of the Massachusetts Senate is already having his leadership abilities called into question. Openly gay Democrat Stanley Rosenberg, 65, of Amherst, Massachusetts, is set to take the top seat in the Massachusetts Senate next year after serving for 24 years, and it seems that this promotion has gone to someone's head - his 27-year-old boyfriend. Bryon Hefner, who began dating the Senator when he was just 21 after he interned for him, has reportedly taken to social media to brag about the influence he now has thanks to his other half. Under fire: Bryon Hefner (above) the 27-year-old partner of the incoming Massachusetts Senate president bragged about his influence on Twitter . Called into question: Now, Stanley Rosenberg, 65, (above) has had to assure his fellow Senators there is a divide between his personal and private lives . And while Hefner may be content to celebrate and gloat, this behavior is not sitting well with both Rosenberg's friends and coworkers. The Boston Globe reports, 'Mocking tweets attributed to Hefner have sparked anger, as have his reported boasts about the influence he would wield when his partner takes over next month.' The tweets are said to have come from both Hefner's own account (@BryonHefnerMA), which is private, and another account he created, General Hooker (@24Beacon), which has not been active since June of this year. The General Hooker account is described as a , 'A candid & non-partisan look @ the pacesetters, game changers, & backbenchers that stalk the halls of the hub of the universe.' There, some politicians are heralded, while others are maligned, such as Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, who was made to look like Star Wars villain Darth Sidious in one tweet, and current Senate President Therese Murray, photoshopped to appear as the Wicked Witch of the West. This despite the fact that both, like Rosenberg, are Democrats. On his private account meanwhile, it was said that Hefner was endorsing Charlie Baker for Massachusetts Governor in the last election over Martha Coakley, despite the fact that Baker is a Republican. Under fire: Hefner reportedly made Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin (above), who was made to look like Star Wars villain Darth Sidious in one tweet . Childish: Another tweet portrayed current Massachusetts Senate President Therese Murray (above) as the Wicked Witch of the West . Rosenberg, who was raised in foster care, put himself through college and worked behind the scenes in the Democratic party until he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1986 and later the Senate in 1991, has refused to comment directly about the tweets. He is however said to have spoken with his coworkers and assured them he will be certain to put up a 'firewall' between his personal and private lives, as well as with the media. 'Very clearly, very specifically, [Hefner's] not involved in making any of the decisions,' Rosenberg said. 'All personnel decisions, all the chairmanships, are going though the normal internal processes.' That does not matter though to some of Rosenberg's friends, who are said to be both 'furious' and 'perplexed' that Hefner would do something like this, and possibly jeopardize a lifetime of hard work. Others however have nothing but praise for the young whippersnapper, noting how 'bright' and 'articulate' he is, and what a great couple he and Rosenberg make. 'He had a very troubled childhood, which he survived, and is very smart and articulate, and I don’t really understand at all what’s happened around the State House,' said Phil Johnston, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party and founder of the Robert F. Kennedy Children’s Action Corps, which ran the residential facility in Lancaster where Hefner lived from age 11 to 14. 'He has been a success.' More important than all of this however may be the support that Hefner provided Rosenberg when he was diagnosed with cancer, with the young man being called 'unflappable' and a 'tremendous help' by one person close to the Senator. Hefner, who has been a PR Account Executive at Regan Communications Group since May, has yet to speak publicly about the comments made on social media or address any of the accusations and claims being made about him. It was while in college that Hefner met Rosenberg, taking a summer job at his office in between his sophomore and junior years Lesley University. The two began dating a few months later when Hefner's job was over, and, from the sounds of it, Rosenberg became the happiest he has ever been, unfazed by the 37 year age gap. 'It was very difficult getting to this point in my life, frankly, to actually have relationships, and he actually brought me to the dance, if you will,’' Rosenberg previously told the Globe. 'I would not have come out if he had not come into my life. It was the greatest gift anyone has given to me.' Rosenberg, who still appears to have all the votes necessary to be elected president, will be formally elected to his new post in January.","The partner of Stanley Rosenberg, 65, the incoming president of the Massachusetts Senate, has been bragging about his influence on Twitter .

"Measuring up: Aldi is selling its Scottish-grown Nordman Fir at £19.99, around half the price of a similar real tree at some other stores (File image) Aldi has taken an axe to the spiralling cost of Christmas trees, with a bargain price that appears to undercut all its rivals. The retailer’s Scottish-grown Nordman Fir is just £19.99, around half the price of a similar real tree at some other stores. With the addition of a box of decorations for £1.99, Aldi is promising customers a completed Christmas tree for £22.00 – just 70p a day if they have it up for a month. A similar 5 to 6ft tree of the same variety at Homebase comes in at £35, while one from John Lewis would set you back £65. The move is likely to trigger an all-out price war, as other shops and tree farms struggle to compete. Furniture giant IKEA is offering a 6ft Nordman Fir for £25, along with a £20 gift voucher for the store. But the vouchers can only be used between January 19 and February 8 2015 – too late to pick up any of this year’s decorations. Each year more than £1billion is spent on Christmas trees, which are now sold everywhere from farms and street corners to garden centres and supermarkets. More than 90 per cent of real tree sales take place during the first two weekends of December. Charlie Reynolds, 19, who owns and runs the Keele Christmas Tree Farm in Staffordshire, said his team expect to have sold more than half of their 7,000 trees by the end of tomorrow. But he said that while he sells 5ft Nordman Firs for £35, prices can vary in different parts of the country. ‘I’ve got friends who work on tree farms further south and they charge mad money for it, sometimes double what we sell them for,’ he said. Scroll down for video . ‘We’ve sold 2,000 trees already this year and I expect to do another 2,000 by the end of this weekend. That will mean that by Monday we’ll have sold more than 4,000 trees and it will only be December 8. It’s very unusual.’ Nordman Firs account for around 80 per cent of the 6.5million Christmas trees purchased in the UK every year. Bargain: Aldi promises customers a completed Christmas tree - including decorations - for £22.00 (file image) Festive: More than 90 per cent of real tree sales take place during the first two weekends of December . They are popular due to the fact they hold their needles for weeks and have a pleasant fragrance. The Norway Spruce was once a traditional favourite because it grows faster and can be harvested earlier – although it has a reputation for dropping its needles quickly if not kept properly watered. Its decline in popularity is reflected in this year’s prices, with Homebase offering 5-6ft Norway Spruce trees for just £15. Nordman Firs – the UK’s most popular Christmas trees – originate from the mountains on either side of the Black Sea, primarily in Turkey and Georgia. They have dark green, glossy needles and tend to grow into a neat, conical shape. Needles are flat, gently rounded and slow to fall compared with other firs, even as the tree dries out. They grow between 3 and 8 inches a year and if left in the wild can reach more than 100ft. Most Christmas trees sold in the UK are between 5 and 6ft tall. It takes a Nordman Fir about seven years to reach this height. Christmas trees first became popular in England in 1841 when Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert, brought one over from Germany for Windsor Castle.","Bargain retailer is selling Scottish-grown Nordman Fir at just £19.99 .

"Paul Whiteley of West Yorkshire Police is pictured leaving Scarborough Magistrates Court after being found guilty of the assault . A shamed murder squad detective who tore off his shirt before drunkenly attacking a holidaymaker while boasting 'I'm a copper, I will do what I like', has been sacked. Award-winning police officer Detective Sergeant Paul Whiteley also hurled shocking abuse at the mum of an autistic girl, telling her 'f*** your f***ing disabled child'. Whiteley who worked on the homicide and major enquiry team at West Yorkshire Police, had been suspended from his job since being charged with assault over the unprovoked incident, during which he brawled with a man in a pub. The 41-year-old had been drinking in the Fylingdales Inn near Whitby, North Yorkshire for seven hours, sinking two and a half bottles of red wine with his partner, 43-year-old Claire Hughes. During his trial, Scarborough Magistrates Court heard that electrician Carl Sarsfield, 41, who was holidaying in the seaside resort, had been asked to have a word with the Whiteley and his partner when a barmaid spotted them heading for their car. They were followed by Mr Sarsfield, of Oldham, Greater Mancester as they left, still carrying an open bottle of wine. Mr Sarsfield told the court: 'I went out there and asked him politely 'You are not drinking and driving are you?' He claimed Whiteley, who was getting in the passenger side, replied; 'I'm not driving - she is.' The electrician said he objected, saying: 'She is legless as well.' The court heard that Mr Sarsfield then rejoined his girlfriend Miss Crossley and her 19-year-old autistic daughter in the pub, while a taxi was ordered for the Whiteley and his partner. But when Whiteley and his partner then came back into the pub, things became 'heated'. Mr Sarsfield claimed the detective had attacked him, slapping him in the face. He then defended himself, with the police officer ending up on his back. He said: 'He was absolutely legless. He could hardly stand up. He was falling all over the place. 'I could have burped on him and he would have fallen over.' Giving evidence, Miss Crossley said: 'He ripped his shirt off after the slap and slung it towards the bar. He shouted at Carl - ""Come on then - outside you bald headed b******.  I'm a copper - I will do what I like."" 'He was paralytic. My initial reaction was to get my daughter away from what was going on. I told them to calm down and there was no need to behave in that way.' The award-winning detective, pictured with his Divisional Commander's Certificate of Commendation left, has now been sacked from his position after 22 years with West Yorkshire Police's murder squad . The full-time carer said her daughter had been 'hysterical' during the attack. 'I saw Carl and the man fighting,' she added. 'The man was very drunk and fell over.' Police were called and Whiteley told the people in the pub: 'Let them come. I'm a police officer. I will sort it out,' the court heard. Miss Crossley said as they waited for police to arrive Whiteley shouted abuse about her daughter. She added: 'My daughter was absolutely beside herself. It affected her for weeks afterwards.' Whiteley, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire was fined £550 and ordered to pay £850 in costs after being convicted of assault at his trial in July, and subsequently lost an appeal. Now West Yorkshire Police has confirmed his position has been terminated. Whiteley had been drinking in the Fylingdales Inn near Whitby, North Yorkshire (pictured) for seven hours, sinking two and a half bottles of red wine with his partner, 43-year-old Claire Hughes, before the attack . Detective Chief Supt Clive Wain, of the forces professional standards department, said 'Following a recent conviction for assault, an officer was dismissed on Tuesday, December 2, without notice, for gross misconduct. 'West Yorkshire Police expects the highest standards of professionalism from all officers and staff and will take appropriate disciplinary action against anyone who fails to meet those standards.' It is understood the force wanted to deny Whiteley the opportunity to resign following a number of cases in which disgraced officers have left voluntarily and then found jobs with other forces. Ms Hughes was charged with assaulting Miss Crossley but she was found not guilty. The homicide and major enquiry detective worked on several major murders during his 22 years with the West Yorkshire Police. They include the case of brothers John and David Kinsella who killed their sister's boyfriend Ross Keenan, 39, in 2007. Both brother were given life sentences with John told he must serve at least 21 years and David, known as Micky, a minimum of 15 years, for the brutal attack in which a meat cleaver and carving knife were used.","Det Sgt Paul Whiteley had been found guilty of the 'unprovoked' assault .

The Office for Budget Responsibility this week said it expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year, then 2.4 per cent in 2015, 2.2 per cent in 2016, then 2.4 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent in subsequent years. Getting more people into work and improving productivity will help boost tax revenues and cut borrowing, but up to £30billion of savings will need to be found to eradicate the deficit as planned. Now it has emerged that part of the growth will be fuelled by a boom in personal debt over the next five years. If the spending fails to materialise, it means growth could come in lower. The OBR now expects an extra £360billion in unsecured loans by 2020, which is £41billion higher than its forecast in March this year. It means families’ unsecured loans will account for 55 per cent of total household incomes by 2020. Even before the financial crash the peak was only 44 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne is hoping a boom in mortgages and personal debt will fuel growth . The OBR also forecasts a sharp increase in the value of secured loans, such as mortgages, by 2020 . Matthew Whittaker, of the Resolution Foundation think-tank said: ‘The idea that households are either willing or able to take on so much new debt at such a rapid pace is questionable at best and highlights significant imbalances in the shape of the economic recovery. ‘The apparent reliance of economic growth in the coming years on another surge in private debt should worry economists and politicians alike,’ he told The Independent. The warning came as Mr Osborne was told he will have to impose spending cuts ‘on a colossal scale’ to meet his targets. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor would have to slash welfare or put up taxes by £21billion just to keep cuts down to the same level as Britain has seen in the past five years. Without this, £55billion in cuts will be needed after next May’s election if the Tories win, compared with the £35billion made since the Coalition came to power in 2010. The respected think-tank suggested cuts on this scale would mean a ‘fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state’. It urged Mr Osborne to spell out before the election what the cuts would mean for public services such as transport, policing and defence. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ‘It is surely incumbent upon anyone set on taking the size of the state to its smallest in many generations to tell us what that means. 'How will these cuts be implemented? What will local government, the defence force, the transport system look like in this world? ‘One thing is for sure. If we move in anything like this direction, whilst continuing to protect health and pensions, the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond all recognition.’","By 2020 total unsecured household debt will hit almost £800billion .

"Data has revealed one police officer in London used stop and search 54 times, almost entirely against young black men, but made no arrests (file image) Police stop-and-search powers are often blamed for causing racial tensions in communities, but now the true scale of the problem has been laid bare. In London, one police officer used stop-and-search powers 54 times in just six months, almost entirely on black men aged between 10 and 19, but didn't find enough evidence to make a single arrest. A second officer with the Metropolitan Police used the same powers 33 times, with 29 stops targeting young black men, but again none of the searches lead to an arrest. Nine officers with the London force were responsible for 312 searches between them, but again failed to arrest anyone, figures released under Freedom of Information laws to Channel 4 show. Of those 312 searches, almost half were on young black men, while another 44 per cent were on black or ethnic minority Londoners. The figures seem to suggest that a small but persistent number of officers are using stop-and-search legislation to disproportionately target ethnic minorities. Nationally black and ethnic minority members of the public are up to six times more likely to be searched than white people. The data was revealed after Home Secretary Theresa May launched an overhaul of the controversial powers this week. Across the UK 35 police forces have opted in to the voluntary code of conduct with immediate effect, with the remaining eight phasing it in over the coming months. The new system means that officers must have a specific reason for searching an individual, whereas under the previous system police only needed 'reasonable suspicion' that a crime had taken place . Forces will also have to record the outcomes of all stop and searches, and reveal whether the ground for the arrest and the reason for the search are linked. The aim is to drive down the use of stop-and-search powers, which are seen by detractors are largely ineffective. Nine police officers were responsible for 312 uses of stop and search powers in just six months, but none of them made a single arrest. Almost half of those stopped were black (file image) Dianne Abbot, Labour MP for Hackney, told Channel 4 News: 'There is not a black family in London who cannot tell you of these stories happening to them or someone they know. 'I give credit to Theresa May for being the first minister in 20 years to tackle the problem of stop and search powers.' Stop and search has long been accused of causing racial tensions in communities, especially in London where they were one of the main catalysts for the 1981 Brixton race riots. As part of Operation Swamp 81, around 1,000 people were stopped and searched in Brixton in just five days, with just 82 arrests made.","Nine officers carried out 312 stops without making one arrest, data shows .

"In a stadium holding no fans, Manchester City will face a player who made little noise during an 18-month spell at rivals United. But Zoran Tosic has proved he is worth shouting about since establishing himself at CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini, in desperate need of victory, should be wary of the danger he poses. Tosic joined United aged 21 in January 2009 when Sir Alex Ferguson agreed to pay Partizan Belgrade £7million. He arrived as an exciting talent having scored 18 goals in 61 games for one of the biggest teams in his native Serbia. Midfielder Zoran Tosic, 27, played just 79 minutes for Manchester United after signing for £7million . But his career at Old Trafford never really sparked into life. There were only five appearances, all from the bench, totaling 79 minutes in a United shirt. Tosic made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup . He should get more in CSKA’s Champions League clash against City at the Arena Khimki alone. There were promising spells for United’s reserve team but the Premier League was initially too great a step up. Cristiano Ronaldo also presented a sizeable blockade to first-team progression. Having made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup, Tosic went on loan to Cologne in Germany. He enjoyed his time so much he wanted regular football immediately. When that was not on offer at United, he decided to leave for CSKA. He has been a tremendous success. Now into his fifth season, he has scored 33 goals in 150 games and is a trickery winger of great threat to City’s defence. Tosic is reveling in his role as a key figure in CSKA’s side, but admits to feeling he may have left United too soon. ‘It all happened really quickly as I played for just 18 months with Partizan Belgrade,’ Tosic said. ‘We won the league and the cup and there was a period when it seemed like I was scoring in every match. ‘It was at that point I signed for Manchester United. It was such an exciting moment to go there and to meet Sir Alex. Tosic played against City last season in CSKA's Champions League defeat at the Etihad Stadium .

Serbia 59 caps, nine goals . ‘I had grown up as a United fan so to be working for the man who had brought so much success to the club was just unbelievable. ‘However, there is a big difference between the Serbian and English league and when I arrived in Manchester I discovered I was not yet ready for that level. ‘I spoke with Sir Alex many times and he kept telling me I had quality and just had to keep working hard. But I wanted to play more games so went to Cologne in Germany on loan and had a great six months there. ‘When I came back to Manchester I was expecting to play more games for United but it didn’t happen. In the end I wasn’t sure I was going to get the chance I felt I deserved so decided to change club. ‘Even now I am always thinking about that moment. Maybe I shouldn’t have been so quick and should have worked longer to show Sir Alex. ‘Maybe I should have stayed and fought for my place.

"Barack Obama says voters in the United States are going to want 'that new car smell' when the 2016 presidential campaign comes along to choose his successor . He is pledging to do everything possible to help that nominee succeed.. Obama's former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is strongly fancied to run on the Democratic ticket for the White House, although she has repeatedly refused to confirm she wants to do so. 'I think the American people, you know, they're gonna want, you know, that new car smell,' Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC News. Scroll down for video . Ready to leave? 'When you've been president for six years, you know, you've got some dings,' Obama said in an ABC interview . 'You know... they wanna drive somethin' off the lot that... that doesn't have as much mileage as me.' Obama, whose 40 percent job approval rating was a drag on Democrats in the November 4th midterms elections, said he doubted he will be asked to campaign much for the eventual Democratic nominee in 2016. 'You know, they're probably not gonna be looking at me to campaign too much,' Obama said. 'One of the things about our society which is great is that we don't have real long memories. And, you know, we get impatient for the next thing.' He continued, 'I think at the end of two years if they want me to do some selective thing, I'll be happy to do 'em, but I suspect that folks will be ready to see me go off to the next thing.' Video from ABC News . Remember when he had that new car smell? President Obama says he believes that the Democratic party won't want him to campaign for them in the 2016 election . Obama, in the interview conducted in Las Vegas on Friday, described Clinton as a friend and said they speak regularly. He believes she would be 'a formidable candidate' and 'a great president.' 'And she's not gonna agree with me on everything,' he added. 'One of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions.' You have a clean slate. A fresh start. You know, when you've been president for six years, you've got some dings.' Obama stopped short of endorsing her campaign, however, and said other Democrats would also be 'terrific' successors. New car smell or an old banger? Does Hilary Clinton have what it takes to be the next President. She has said that she will announce her decision to run at the start of next year . 'She hasn't announced so I don't wanna jump the gun. I can tell you a couple things. Number one, she was an outstanding secretary of State. Number two, she's a friend,' Obama said. 'Number three, I think she and a number of other possible Democratic candidates would be terrific presidents.' Obama acknowledged that he expects  Clinton to stake out positions that may be different from his if she runs for president in 2016. Clinton, who lost to Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination race and served as his secretary of state in his first term, is considering a run in 2016. Clinton has said she'll decide whether to run early next year.","Obama says Americans wants a candidate that 'doesn't have as much mileage as me'

"Ford recently recalled about 98,000 vehicles due to faulty airbags. But it was one wayward air balloon that was causing the motor giant some strife on Thursday night. A blimp of a Ford SUV came crashing down into the fan section of the game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Indiana Pacers at the Moda Center in Portland. The promotional floating car, which game go-ers are used to seeing soar around the stadium, lost some of its inflation - likely due to a puncture - before falling into Section 209 of the arena. Scroll down for video . Crash: The blimp came crashing down into the fan section of the game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Indiana Pacers at the Moda Center in Portland on Thursday night . Deflate: The balloon floated down from the rafters after apparently suffering a puncture . 'Now what do we do?': Puzzled staff surround the SUV wondering how to fix the situation . 'Will it fit?' Staff attempt to squish the blimp down a staircase to get it out of the arena . Almost there: Many audience members took to Twitter to make fun of the situation . Luckily there were no injuries as the soft structure - usually filled with helium, nitrogen or hydrogen - came crashing down. Hilariously, stadium staff who seized the blimp attempted to squish it into a staircase. The move made for a series of mocking social media posts. And considering the point of the balloon was publicity for Ford, the incident wasn't exactly positive. It didn't affect the fame though, with players not even really noticing what was going on. The Trail Blazers went on to beat the Pacers 88-82. Winners: The Trail Blazers went on to beat out the Indiana Pacers 88-82 . Earlier this week, Ford expanded its recall on Takata-issued passenger side airbag inflators at the request of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA), according to CNBC. The recall targets the 2004-2005 Ford Ranger and 2005-2006 Ford GTs.

"Arsene Wenger’s defensive injury crisis deepened on Monday night leaving him to consider plunging untried teenager Hector Bellerin into Arsenal’s Champions League game at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night. Right back Bellerin, 19, has made only one appearance for the club, as a late substitute in a Capital One Cup tie against West Brom last season, but may be asked to start in Dortmund’s intimidating Westfalenstadion. Nacho Monreal did not travel to Germany because of a back problem, Calum Chambers is suffering from tonsilitis and is rated ‘50-50’ and Mathieu Debuchy faces two months out after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester City on Saturday. If Chambers is not fit to start, Wenger can turn to Spain Under 19 international Bellerin, who spent last season on loan at Watford, or switch Mathieu Flamini from midfield. Kieran Gibbs will come in for Monreal at left back. Hector Bellerin shakes hands with Per Mertesacker in training, and could be in line for a start in Dortmund having played for Arsenal Under 21s only last week at Aston Villa . Danny Welbeck (centre) has shrugged off cramp and is available for Arsenal against Borussia Dortmund . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger ponders his options during training ahead of the Champions League match, as Bellerin trains at London Colney before travelling to Dortmund . Wenger said: 'I don't feel we are stretched. The Debuchy injury put us in a position where we do not want more and hopefully we have good news after the scan today that he can be back soon. 'We have Chambers who can play in different positions, Monreal who can play centre-back and (Hector) Bellerin, who I think now is ready to play. 'He (Bellerin) is a boy with personality. He's not fazed by the pressure. That's important when you're a young boy. His transitional game is fantastic. 'He's quick and his final ball is good. He lacks a bit of experience but he's very dangerous.' Alexis Sanchez has scored in his last three games for the Gunners and looks likely to start on Tuesday . Jack Wilshere played exceptionally against Manchester City and will be hoping to continue that form . Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund side are the obvious threat to Arsenal in Group D of the Champions League, and Wenger believes German and Spanish sides will be strong in the competition once again this season. 'The main threats will be the German and Spanish team,' he continued. 'Look at the times Bayern has been in the final. There's no obvious reason why they should not be there again. 'Dortmund have been a regular participant and the two big clubs in Spain will be main contenders again. 'I have great respect for Mr Klopp. He rose up very quickly in his career and inspired Dortmund. What does he do better than me? Maybe a lot of things. But I love to see his squad playing dynamic and attractive football. I like it.' Arsene Wenger hands out instructions to his players as they prepare for Tuesday's clash with Dortmund . Following a 2-2 draw with Manchester City at the Emirates on Saturday, Arsenal can take positives into the clash with Dortmund. Danny Welbeck had a promising debut despite being unable to find the net and Jack Wilshere was particularly impressive. But Wenger is cautious about using all his German World Cup-winning players from the start, believing Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski are not yet fully match fit. Wenger said: 'The (World Cup) final in Rio was July 13. They came back on the August 11. That means I gave them one month of holiday. 'It was important for me that they would recover. They have been training for one month and haven't reached 100 per cent physically yet but they're close.'

"British warplanes blasted an Islamic State terror network in Iraq yesterday killing jihadists operating underground. RAF Tornado fighter bombers dropped 500lb Paveway IV laser guided bombs on a huge bunker and tunnel complex used by fighters avoiding coalition airstrikes. The dug-in position was only discovered when US aircraft wiped out a vehicle belonging to militants – leading to smoke to billow from holes in the ground hundreds of metres away. Scroll down for video . RAF Tornado fighter bombers attacked the huge bunker complex in Iraq where ISIS fighters were hiding . The aircraft were equipped with Paveway IV 500lb laser guided bombs, pictured, from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus . This led intelligence analysts to believe there was a much larger complex underground and they would need significant back-up. They returned with some 30 aircraft from seven different countries and blasted the site so nothing was left behind. Defence sources told the Mail: ‘We are not sure what they were doing under there, but they are not doing it now. ‘It was quite an extensive network, perhaps a hundred metres by a hundred metres. It was a sensible tactic to start digging underground – it was using common sense.’ The Ministry of Defence said the attack early yesterday was launched to back an offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters northwest of the oil city of Kirkuk. A statement said reconnaissance had spotted a ‘well concealed network of fighting positions and underground facilities, and confirmed that the site was well removed from any civilian communities.’ It continued: ‘Given the significance of the target, and the obstacle it posed to further peshmerga advances, aircraft from seven coalition nations conducted a comprehensive and closely coordinated attack on complex early on Wednesday.’ Fighters faced with an onslaught of hundreds of strikes against their vehicles have begun changing tactics and reducing their use of convoys. Charlie Winter, a researcher for Quilliam Think Tank said: ‘They have been known to change tactics to try and avoid airstrikes but I hadn’t heard of them digging underground before.’ Islamist jihadists had previously ditched convoy for motorcycles, bicycles and camouflaged cars in order to avoid being targeted by airstrikes. They also warned their fighters to stop using mobile phones so their location could not be pinpointed by western intelligence. Earlier in the week, unmanned RAF Reaper drones discovered a bulldozer in Iraq and used Hellfire missile to destroy it. Further details were not released for security reasons. Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, said: ‘The strike will have dealt a blow to the ISIL network in a key location, thus limiting their ability to pursue their brutality against the civilian population of Iraq.’ Elsewhere in Iraq attacks continued as Islamic State jihadists fight to spread their control over large swathes of the country. Yesterday a suicide attack has left at least five people dead in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region. The attacker tried to drive his vehicle into the governorate building and was cut short by guards’ gunfire. The attack, which was the first to target the city’s centre in seven months, also left dozens of people wounded. The suicide bomber - along with three civilians and two police officers - was killed.

"Each year the European Commission does its bit to help out holidaymakers when it comes to mobile charges when travelling abroad. But it seems we are still scared, if not unaware, of the costs we may incur while using our phones abroad. What is certain is that most holidaymakers are not making the most of their smartphones or tablets abroad despite over 70 per cent owning an iPhone, iPad or similar devices, according to a recent study. Scroll down for video . Say 'cheese': We are being urged to take advantage of mobile technology while abroad . The study found that 60 per cent of travellers are not aware of rule changes in EU countries, including France, Spain and Italy, which capped roaming charges on mobile devices. A further 83 per cent either over or under-estimate how much it would cost to use their mobile devices, and only 30 per cent who understand the changes are more relaxed about undertaking internet searches as a result. A few adventurous souls have downloaded apps, videos or searched the internet on a snow-scooter in Finland, while walking the Great Wall of China, out in the Sahara Desert, or even in a French brothel. Others have successfully scoured the web while diving off the Great Barrier Reef, scaling mountains, or on safari. Seventy five per cent however stick to the hotel when it comes to looking things up online. Many of us are still confused as to just what we will be charged for 'roaming' while abroad . The tariff is per Megabyte to download data or browse the Internet whilst travelling abroad (charged per Kilobyte used). As you can see, the amount is going down year on year. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Ashley Scott, media relations manager at Virgin Media, said: 'Customers have to be aware that the roaming cap applies just to data, but it is within the whole EU. 'This is set at €50, which was set by the European Commission back in July 2012. Once this amount has been reached, you then have to ""opt in"" to spending more than that amount. 'When you arrive in another country in the EU, you will get a text from a partner company to your network, which will explain what the charges are for calls and texts, as well as how much data costs. 'It's important to stress that the cap is only set on data.' Once the cap has been reached, the cost per megabyte would be charged at 16p in the EU plus VAT. 1. Turn off push notifications in apps . 2. Use data bolt-ons or data cap usage . 3. Switch off video auto play . 4. Disable weather apps . 5. Preload Google Maps with wifi . 6. Switch on aeroplane mode . 7. Use a pay and go SIM . 8. Switch off your voicemail . 9. Switch off high volume email accounts . 10. Connect to wifi . Guy Hibbert, managing director of FrenchEntree, the specialist property website that conducted the research, added: 'Despite most of us taking our devices away with us, many are simply not taking advantage of adhoc events or amazing restaurant offers abroad, because of our lack of understanding and misperceptions about roaming charges.' Virgin customers, for example, have to purchase a 'travel pass' when they are in the EU, which enables roaming. A 10MB travel pass costs £1.50, a 50MB pass costs £6 and a 250MB pass is £20. Virgin also has a Smartcall service, which allows customers to use their home phone talk plans when they are abroad when connected to wifi. The new caps only apply when you use a mobile within the EU, the rest of Europe is exempt. But statistics also show that just half of travellers realise the new rules are limited to European Union countries. Endsleigh Insurance has researched the exact cost of using the most popular mobile apps outside the EU and in the rest of the world. Based on O2 data roaming charges, the results make for some scary reading. It costs 3p per megabyte of data roaming in Europe, but a whopping £6 in the rest of the world. Based on a photo taken from an iPhone 5 camera (which has an average size of 2MB) it would cost 76p to upload a photo onto Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. With the cap on data and more transparency with call and text calls, panic over your phone bill should be a thing of the past . This estimate also does not include being on Facebook itself, which would use data, especially if the user scrolls through friends' status updates, which can be text, images or videos which all require data to load. Facebook also now auto plays videos which can push the cost of browsing up further if this feature isn’t turned off. Streaming a 30-minute episode of a television programme abroad could cost up to £540, the equivalent of a flight to Mauritius with Thomas Cook. Chatting to friends on Whatsapp will set you back up to £12 and browsing the Internet for 30 minutes could cost up to £60. Sara Newell, gadget sector manager at Endsleigh Insurance said: ‘We are so accustomed to using our phones every day for entertainment, keeping up to date with news, and staying connected with friends: everyday apps we take for granted in the UK, if used in the same way abroad, can rack up unexpected bills that can exceed the actual cost of a holiday. 'We’ve seen bills rack up into the thousands, so would advise on planning ahead to avoid a nasty surprise when you get back. 'Check data roaming charges with your provider, get prepared with a data bolt on or usage cap, or switch off data roaming on your phone altogether.'","There is a cap of €50 (£39) for data before users 'opt in'

"Louis van Gaal admits that he would love to have Cristiano Ronaldo back at Manchester United but does not think Real Madrid would sell the Portugal star. Ronaldo spent six years at Old Trafford before moving to the Bernabeu in a world record £80million move in 2009, and the current World Player of the Year would cost a similar fee to buy back if he decided to leave Real. The 29-year-old has been linked with a return to the Premier League amid speculation that he is unhappy at the European champions for letting a number of top players leave this summer – including Angel di Maria, who joined United for a British transfer record of £60m.

"Doctor Nazim Mahmood, 34, fell to his death from a penthouse in West Hampstead, London . A Harley Street doctor killed himself by jumping from his penthouse flat after his Muslim mother told him to cure himself of being gay when he told her he was engaged to a man, an inquest heard. Nazim Mahmood, 34, was seen standing alone on the balcony of his £700,000 apartment in West Hampstead, London, before falling four storeys in front of shocked passers-by. An inquest heard Dr Mahmood had hid his sexuality from his Muslim family in fear that they would refuse to accept it on religious and cultural grounds, it has been reported. But he decided to tell his mother he was gay and in a 13-year relationship with with his fiancé Matthew Ogston  in July, according to the Evening Standard. He had returned to the family home in Birmingham to celebrate Eid but days later Dr Mahmood, who ran Face Clinic London which provides wrinkle treatments like Botox, was found dead. Long-term partner, Mr Ogston, told the inquest yesterday: 'She had suggested to him he needed to see a psychiatrist to see if he could be cured. Together I think they agreed they would get through it.' He wept in court as he described Dr Mahmood as his 'soulmate' and said his fiancé had given no indication that he had intentions of killing himself. 'He always wanted to help other people, always put other people first and wanted to care for people. He was quite simply the most amazing man I'll ever meet in my whole life,' he added. The court heard Dr Mahmood, who had never suffered from depression or any other mental illness, had taken drugs mephedrone and ketamine shortly before his death. Coroner Mary Hassell, hearing the case at St Pancras Coroners' Court, ruled that Dr Mahmood took his own life. Floral tributes on the pavement where his body was found. A coroner ruled he had taken his own life . She said: 'It seems incredible that a young man with so much going for him could have taken his own life. But what I've heard is that he had one great sadness which was the difficulty his family had in accepting his sexuality.' Dr Mahmood graduated from the University of Birmingham medical school in 2003 and moved to London a year later. Dr Mahmood was one of the doctors behind Face Clinics, a chain offering treatments in three locations across London. The clinics, which employed five specialists, offer treatments including Botox, skin fillers, exfoliation, sweat treatments and semi-permanent makeup. Prices for Botox treatments begin at £200, with cheaper procedures from £75 and offers for going with friends. Earlier this week the chain posted a message online enticing customers to mimic the look of model Cara Delevigne by indulging in a semi-permanent eyebrow treatment. Customers writing on the site named Dr Mahmood as part of the 'friendly and inviting' clinic who 'put me at ease' before a Botox treatment. He worked in a number of teaching hospitals in different specialities including, accident and emergency, HIV medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics, before completing his specialist training as a GP. In 2009 he founded Face Clinic London with a colleague, Dr Anita Kapoor, and was due to unveil another new clinic just yards from his home after success with his Soho and Harley Street clinics. Dr Mahmood fell naked from the building at about 5.35pm on July 30 this year, in front of shocked passers-by, including children. A passing doctor attempted to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. After the fall, Dr Mahmood was left covered in just a blanket - in front of the mansion block and a busy Barclays Bank - for more than three hours. Police said at the time there were no police tents available to 'shield the body' and apologised for any distress caused. Mr Ogston has since set up the Naz and Matt Foundation, which provides free support to LGBT individuals and their friends and family going through a difficult time because of their sexuality or gender identity.","Nazim Mahmood fell four storeys from London flat in front of passers-by .

"Real Madrid galactico Cristiano Ronaldo, the sports darling of social media, will sometime on Tuesday become the first athlete to have 100 million Facebook followers. This puts him nearly 30m fans in front of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, his rival for world No 1 footballer. The commercial power of Ronaldo, who also has 30.5m Twitter followers, was demonstrated when he posted six messages over two days advertising the Tag Heuer watch brand. Cristiano Ronaldo, playing for Portugal against France at the weekend, is football's king of social media . Lionel Messi, pictured against Brazil on Saturday, is 30 million behind Ronaldo on Facebook . These received 34.9m Facebook hits and 2.4m likes, valued at more than £300,000 by the watch company. Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney earlier this month became the first Premier League footballer to reach 10m followers on Twitter. The England captain, who thanked his fans after reaching the landmark, is the fifth most-followed footballer, and the sixth most-followed athlete globally. Predictably, Ronaldo tops the list of most-followed athletes on Twitter, too. Wayne Rooney scored for England against Estonia and is the top Premier League player on Twitter .

"An eminent hospital consultant died at a luxury care home where staff lied about making checks on residents, a coroner said. Dr Rhys Tudor Williams was found dead on the floor of his room by paramedics in the early hours of the morning. The 86-year-old, who had devoted his life to caring for others, should have been monitored every two hours. 'Downright lying': Staff at the Sunrise Senior Living home in Bramhall (pictured) - which charges fees of up to £50,000-a-year – admitted filling out time sheets recording when they looked in on patients in advance . But instead, in what the coroner branded ‘downright lying’, staff at the Sunrise Senior Living home – which charges fees of up to £50,000-a-year – admitted filling out time sheets recording when they looked in on patients in advance ‘to save time’. Dr Williams, of Didsbury, Manchester, had worked as a consultant physician at the city’s Royal Infirmary, and was an honorary lecturer. He was moved to Sunrise Senior Living in Bramhall, Cheshire, after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. His body was found trapped between his bed and the wall during a routine check in the early hours of March 4 – almost three hours later than he was supposed to be monitored, the court heard. A post mortem examination found he had cardiac disease, and a pathologist said it was likely he had suffered a fatal heart attack and then slumped out of bed, rather than dying as a result of the fall. Staff were supposed to check residents every two hours, but a care manager admitted filling out the records in advance. Respected: Dr Williams, of Didsbury, Manchester, had worked as a consultant physician at the city’s Royal Infirmary (pictured), and was an honorary lecturer. He was found dead in the early hours of March 4 . Stockport coroner John Pollard said that was ‘downright lying’ and added: ‘This is not a fair and true record of what has happened. In fact, it’s a total fabrication of what has happened.’ The inquest jury ruled that Dr Williams’ death was accidental but ‘aggravated by neglect’, as falling out of bed had ‘more than minimally’ contributed to his death. A Sunrise spokesman said a staff member had been dismissed following an investigation into Dr Williams’ death, and a new management team and additional training had been introduced.","Dr Rhys Tudor Williams was found dead at Sunrise Senior Living home .

Ronaldo bags a hat-trick, Bale and Hernandez net two each with Rodriguez hitting a stunner. Thanks for joining us, see you next time! Real Madrid are in dreamland and Hernandez has his second of the game. He struggled to score from outside of the box for United but he's bagged to stunning efforts here. The second was a lovely right-footed shot that flew past Lux from 25-yards out courtesy of a slight deflection. It's raining goals in Deportivo and it's substitute Chicharito with a stunning volley into the top corner. What a way to grab your first goal as a Galactico, control with his left and volleyed home. Cuenca has deserved a gola this afternoon, but it's the substute Toche who heads into the bottom corner. The comeback is on! 78mins: Chicharito replaces Bale . And he has his hat-trick! Ronaldo adds to Depor's misery by knocking home his third goal of the game with a left-footed finish from just inside the box. The way Depor have been defending, you'd think they were down to nine men! The last three Madrid goals have been all too easy. Bale bags his second of the game and it's almost a carbon copy of his first. Hewas given far too much space on the left of Depor's box and sweeps the ball home once again. 74mins: Ronaldo, in search of his hat-trick, fires towards goal only to be stopped in his tracks by Diakite. Deportivo make their final change of the afternoon as Farina comes off for Toche. 71mins: Modric is replaced by Isco . Pete Jenson: With Benzema off, Bale and Ronaldo are now up-front in a 4-4-2. There really is no sign of Ancelotti moving Bale further from goal as has been suggested to him... and Bale has responded with Real's fourth goal. Isco on for Modric. Bale gets in on the act after a delightful assist from Marcelo. The Brazilian played Bale down the left side of Depor's box, he held off his man before guiding a low effort past Lux. Ancelotti will be pleased with that has his team were going through a slight second half wobble. 63mins: Kroos knocks a pass into Ronaldo, who looking to get around Sidnei. The Depor defender brings Ronaldo down as his shown a yellow card.

The Spaniard received a yellow card for his troubles. And we're back underway in Deportivo. Can the home side make anything of the second half or will Madrid continue to run riot? Find out here... Deportivo ring the changes as Juanfran and Cavaleiro replace Dominguez and Postiga. Pete Jenson: Deportivo have been reading to many 'Madrid in crisis' stories - throwing men forward at will and leaving huge space at the back. Not to mention goalkeeper German Lux's decision to charge 20 metres out of his area and bring down Benzema. Had Ronaldo not scored immediately he would have been sent off. Solid from Ancelotti's team, silly season from the home team. Both teams now back out for second half. The half-time whistle blows and it's all but over already. Two Ronaldo goals either side of a Rodriguez stunner ensure Ancelotti's side go into the break with a commanding 3-0 lead. It's three and Ronaldo has his second of the game. It was all too easy for Madrid as Benzema race through the middle before Lux runs out in a failed attempt to tackle the Frenchman. The loose ball ends up at Ronaldo's feet and his whips in his second of the game. Awful goalkeeping from Lux. And it's two! Rodriguez doubles Madrid's lead with a brilliant left-footed striker from the edge of the Deportivo box. The Colombian received the ball from Benzema before unleashing a piledriver of a shot past Lux. It's there! Ronaldo powers home a brilliant header to put his side into a deserved lead. The Portuguese star leapt brilliantly to power an Arbeloa cross into the net from the penalty spot. 26mins: Ronaldo fires off another shot after latching onto a Marcelo throw-in, but the Ballon d'Or winner fails to connect with the ball properly. 22mins: Madrid, as you'd expect, are enjoying the lion's share of possession but they haven't tested Lux enough. 19mins: Marcelo works his way down the right and feeds Ronaldo, but the Madrid star can only drag his shot well wide from a promising position. 17mins: Lux keeps his side in the game with a brilliant save from Benzema. The Madrid forward found himself in the right place at the right time after a jinking run from Ronaldo but the Frenchman's snapshot is save well. 12mins: Ronaldo sees his first bit of action as Rodriguez sails out to the right wing before whipping in a delightful cross to the Portuguese forward. Ronaldo's header, however, is easily gathered by Lux. Pete Jenson: Gareth Bale seeing plenty of the ball in the opening stages in the rain at Riazor. Just dropped a perfect right footed cross on Ronaldo's head but no finish from the Portuguese who has never scored here. 9mins: Deportivo come dangerously close to taking the lead as Cuenca unleashes a rasping 25-yard strike which forces Casillas into a fingertip save. The former Barcelona man looks up for it today... 5mins: At the other end, a Modric free-kick is cleared well by Diakite. Ancelotti's side have been firing the crosses in during the last minute or so but Bale and Marcelo's efforts have come to nothing. 3mins: Deportivo enjoy their first attack of the afternoon as Ramos and Varane fail to clear a Cuence cross. Fortunately for the away side Postiga is adjudged to have committed a foul and Madrid can clear. And we're underway at the Estadio Riazor.

"George Groves is a 'fraud' who does not deserve a shot at the WBC world title, according to the current champion Anthony Dirrell. Londoner Groves makes his return to the ring on Saturday when he faces Christopher Rebrasse at Wembley Arena in his first fight since being knocked out by Carl Froch in their record-breaking clash on May 31st. On the line is the European super-middleweight title as well as the nominal WBC silver strap – but most importantly, the winner will become the mandatory challenger to American Dirrell. Anthony Dirrell says George Groves is a 'fraud' who does not deserve a shot at the WBC world title . But the 29-year-old, who won the belt by beating Sakio Bika in California last month, says Groves is not a worthy challenger even if he takes care of little-known Frenchman Rebrasse on Saturday. Talking exclusively to Sportsmail, Dirrell said: 'Who is this French guy? Seriously I've never heard of him. How can Groves fight him and then be my mandatory? He's a fraud. 'He wants a fight with me? He's just lost twice to Froch. Tell him he needs to fight someone in the top 10. He's fighting a bum. Groves fights Christopher Rebrasse this weekend with the winner due to fight WBC champion Dirrell . 'I won this belt the hard way and now he thinks he's going to get a shot without fighting anyone. It's not going to happen.' Groves, meanwhile, has been sent a letter from the WBC stating that the winner of Saturday's bout at Wembley Arena, just across the road from the Stadium where he was brutally stopped by Froch, will be guaranteed a shot at Dirrell. That means 'The Dog' will have to either face 'The Saint' or vacate the title. Groves and his promoters, Team Sauerland, will do all they can to get any world title challenge on home soil, but Dirrell insists he will not be crossing the Atlantic to face Groves. Dirrell says Groves' defeats to Froch, who also beat Dirrell's brother, means he doesn't deserve a title shot . Dirrell's older brother, Andre, was beaten by Froch on a split decision in Nottingham back in 2009 – incidentally for the same WBC belt currently held by his sibling. And it's a decision which still rankles with the younger Dirrell. He added: 'Everyone saw what happened to my brother, he got a bad deal in the UK. It's in the past now but that doesn't mean I'll let the same thing happen to me. 'There's no way I'll be going to the UK. I'm the champ. If they make Groves the No.1 contender then he's going to have to come here and try and beat me. And he won't do it. 'I won't be giving him a shot in his own country. Everyone knows what happens over there - I won't be going over there to fight.' Champion Dirrell said that if he does have to fight Groves the Eglishman is going to have to cross the Atlantic . And in a further taunt to Groves, Dirrell revealed he would rather try to avenge his brother's loss and set up a super-middleweight unification fight with WBA and IBF king Froch, who is still yet to decide his next move following his victory at Wembley. Dirrell said: 'The Froch fight would be an option. I want to fight the best - and George Groves is not the best. 'Froch though, he's one of the top guys, a good fighter who has beaten Groves twice in a row, he's more deserving but we don't know what he's doing yet. 'We got to wait and see. Anthony wants another shot at him but if the money was right then I would love that fight.' Dirrell's last WBC Super Middleweight World Championship fight was against Sakio Bika last month .","George Groves is a 'fraud' who doesn't deserve WBC world title shot .

"A photographer in Chicago has managed to capture some remarkable footage of a great horned owl swimming. Yes, swimming. Steve Spitzer told WGNTV that he was taking pictures at Loyola Park Beach in Rogers Park when he noticed something stirring the water in Lake Michigan. He was with a birdwatcher at the time, who identified the animal as a great horned owl. Neither could believe their eyes and Spitzer started filming. Scroll down for video . You can swim?: Amazing footage has been captured in  Loyola Park Beach of a great horned owl swimming across Lake Michigan . Remarkable: Chicago area photographer and birder Steve Spitzer captured the most unusual sighting . Graceful: The owl used its huge wings to move in a breast stroke-like fashion . Drying off: The raptor easily made it to shore, where it took some time to rest after the swim . Fluff: The owl can be seen drying off on the shore of Loyola Park Beach . Survivor: Despite appearing a little tired, the owl did seem injured following the attack . Spitzer said the group witnessed the magnificent creature come under attack by two peregrine falcons. In order to escape the raptor headed for the water and dived right in. The group called a local bird rescue group, but the owl was long gone by the time they arrived. While highly unusual, this is not the first time such a bird has been swimming. Around the same area in 2011, another case was documented. Scene: Spitzer was taking pictures from Loyola Park Beach when he noticed the owl in the water . A bird rescuer, Dawn Keller, was responding to a call at the Chicago Botanic Gardens. But Keller said once she approached the injured animal, it got scared and hopped into a nearby creek. She started undressing, preparing to wade into the water to save it, but was shocked to see that it could swim and stay afloat on its own. 'It kept its head above water and seemed to be moving its feet, almost as if it was kicking or paddling.,' Keller wrote in a piece for North America Birding. 'The owl was making a direct path to the opposite shoreline – quite honestly, swimming better than I could have.' Magnificent: The great horned owl - also called a tiger owl - is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas .

"Japanese police investigating a so-called ""Black Widow"" who could be behind the deaths of six partners have found traces of cyanide in soil from her pot plants, reports said Friday. Chisako Kakehi, 68, who was arrested last month on suspicion of murdering her 75-year-old spouse, received one billion yen (£5.4million) in insurance and other payouts over 10 years following the deaths of husbands and lovers, media have said. Police believe she killed Isao - her fourth and most recent husband - with cyanide in December last year. Japanese woman Chisako Kakehi has reportedly received £5.4million over the last two decades -- in the form of insurance payments and other assets she received after the deaths of her seven partners . Investigators who tested plant pots she had taken to a recycling centre about six months after her husband died discovered a bag at the bottom of a planter. Lab results showed the presence of cyanide compounds, according to Kyodo News. Since the death from illness of her first husband in 1994, Kakehi had reportedly been involved with more than 10 men, six of whom had perished. Reports say that most were elderly or ill and she was deliberately targeting unattached wealthy men as part of a plan to get insurance payouts or to inherit their assets. Kakehi has denied murder. Cyanide was found in the body of at least one of the men she was involved with before her recent marriage. Police who earlier raided her home in Kyoto found traces of cyanide in the rubbish, media said. They also found paraphernalia for administering drugs and medical books at an apartment she kept south of Kyoto. Japanese police probing a so-called 'Black Widow' who could be behind the deaths of six partners have found traces of cyanide in soil from her pot plants.","Chisako Kakehi was arrested last month on suspicion of murder .

"A Connecticut swim coach is charged with enticing a minor and risk of injury to a minor after the mother of a 13-year-old girl caught him sending sexual text messages to her daughter. Police say texts from Alan Marcel, 28, to one of his swimmers were 'explicitly sexual,' according to the Hartford Courant. Marcel is the head coach of the Park City Wolfpack, a swim team at the Wheeler Recreational Center in Bridgeport. Charged: Alan Marcel, 28, is charged with enticing a minor and risk of injury to a minor after the mother of a 13-year-old girl caught him sending sexual text messages to her daughter . The young girl was a member of the swim team and Marcel was arrested at the center Wednesday on $20,000 bail. He appeared in court Thursday where he bail was reduced to $10,000, the Courant reports. The girl's mother found multiple text messages between the coach and her daughter on her daughter's phone. She reported her findings to the swim team's board of directors, according to NBC Connecticut. Swim: The young girl was a member of the Park City Wolfpack; Marcel was head coach of the youth swim team . The young girl told police that she and Marcel had been texting for almost two weeks, and police say that Marcel asked the girl what specific sexual activities she would be interested in having, according to ConnecticutPostings. Police say one of the texts from Marcel read: 'Is it bad I wanna to about (sic) that stuff with U.' The youth swim club told WFSB that it has cut all ties with Marcel. In a statement, the team's board of directors said they are 'deeply disturbed' by the incident and they are extending their full cooperation in the investigation. Applaud: A local student praised the action of the girl's mother saying she protected the young girl from a potentially dangerous situation . In an interview with WFSB, a local student applauded the girl's mother. 'Good job on mom for that one,' Olivia Stewart, a University of Bridgeport student, told WFSB. 'Even checking the phone, [she] saved her daughter from a potentially dangerous situation.' The recreation center is operated by the University of Bridgeport, but school officials say Marcel is not affiliated with the university, the Courant reports.

The heavily armed soldiers stood their ground at the top of a gravel road while the protesters waited down on the outskirts of the village, shouting and gesturing while holding their slingshots. Israeli security forces also used a foul-smelling weapon, known as 'skunk' to clear activists as they drove trucks through the village. The smell is said to resemble rotting sewage and can take up to five years to clear.

Jawaher Abu Rahmah, 36, died on New Year's Eve in 2010 after she was seriously injured in a tear gas attack, however some reports say she was not present at that day's protest.

"Louis van Gaal has challenged £43million misfit Radamel Falcao to prove himself — and took a swipe at the on-loan striker’s agent in the process. The Manchester United manager also claimed there will not be a January purchase to boost his side’s chances of Champions League qualification. Falcao, 28, has struggled for fitness and form since his deadline-day switch from Monaco, scoring just three times in 13 appearances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Few good players available to buy in January . Radamel Falcao has only managed three goals for Manchester United since his arrival .

Falcao is given a tough welcome to England by Stoke City defender Marc Wilson at Old Trafford . 604 - Minutes played for United so far . 3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions . 201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33 . £40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages . £1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages) Van Gaal dropped him ahead of their home defeat to Southampton last weekend — Falcao did not even make the bench — a move that prompted agent Jorge Mendes to claim his client would walk into any other team in the world. But Van Gaal responded: ‘He has to prove himself. We have made a deal and everything is clear. It’s not the end of the year so he has a chance.’ United have a clause in the £6m season-long deal that would allow them to sign Falcao for a reported £43m, but Van Gaal said that when it came to making the squad the player’s value counted for nothing. ‘If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it’s not any different for me,’ Van Gaal said. ‘You have to prove yourself.’ Van Gaal declined to comment on how Falcao, who is earning about £265,000 a week, had handled his omission but the striker travelled to London with the squad yesterday for the Barclays Premier League clash with QPR today. Louis van Gaal refused to answer questions about whether Falcao and Van Persie would start at QPR . Van Gaal says United will not be active in the transfer window despite being linked with several defenders . Van Gaal (left) was pictured watching United's Under 18s beat their counterparts at Hull earlier this week . ‘That is not for you or the media,’ he said. ‘It is between the player and the manager. I’m sorry.’ When asked if Mendes’ outburst was unhelpful, Van Gaal said. ‘Of course, but it does not interest me’. Van Gaal, who spent £156m in the summer, has been linked with two full backs, Seamus Coleman of Everton and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne. But he insisted he was not expecting to spend big. ‘I don’t think we shall be very active,’ he said. ‘Not many players at a certain level are available. ‘I have also said when we have to buy a player he has to be better than our players who are playing now and that is a difficult job.’ Seamus Coleman has been linked with a move to United and wore their kit as a youngster (right) Van Persie (left) hobbled out of Manchester United's defeat at home to Southampton last Sunday . Ander Herrera replaced Van Persie during the second half of the defeat to Southampton at Old Trafford . Former United midfielder Paul Scholes has criticised Van Gaal’s preference for a 3-5-2 system, claiming it means possession but creates few chances. Despite his side not having one shot on target against Southampton, Van Gaal disagreed and pointed to his side’s draw at Tottenham as proof it could work. ‘You pick up a match like that but I can pick up a match like Tottenham Hotspur away,’ he said. ‘A top-six club, and we played fantastic, were creative and could have scored a lot of goals.’ Robin van Persie is United’s only injury worry against QPR but he should be fit to play. The 31-year-old’s contract expires at the end of next season but Van Gaal refused to reveal whether a new deal was in the pipeline.","Radamel Falcao has scored three goals since his £6million loan move .

"British holidaymakers are drinking about 50 alcoholic drinks during their stay on board a cruise ship. Beer is the most popular drink, according to research, with an average 46,000 bottles or cans consumed over a two week break - or about three per person per day. Those cruising the waters of the Mediterranean were found to be the biggest drinkers, and worked out the findings based on an average of 2,200 passengers per cruise ship. Having a good time: Beer is the most popular drink among cruiseship passengers, according to survey . Cocktails were the second most popular drink for cruisers, with the average passenger confessing to drinking at least one a day - or 16 over the two weeks - a total of 35,200 per ship. Passengers also confessed to glugging half bottle of wine a day - meaning around 15,400 bottles of vino are consumed in two weeks. And barmen poured some 828 bottles of whisky as passengers gulped down 16 shots each on average in two weeks, Bonvoyage's research found. Relaxing time: Cocktails were the second most popular drink for cruisers, with the average passenger confessing to drinking at least one a day . Steph Curtin, cruise development manager at the cruise travel agency, said: 'A cruise is one of the most relaxing holidays out there and it is evident from our research that passengers are certainly relaxing with a few alcoholic beverages! 'The majority of cruises have several different bars offering a variety of alcoholic services and it is great to see passengers taking advantage of this.' Champagne was the least popular drink, with 734 bottles consumed - or just two glasses per person over the average two-week trip.","Champagne was found to be the least popular drink on board cruise ships .
Passengers glug about 16 cocktails over a two-week break .
Beer was revealed as the favourite tipple for holidaymakers ."

"Russian prosecutors are studying a horrific video showing a train driver deliberately running over a bear while shouting 'squash him'. The sickening 20 second-long footage, which has gone viral on the Internet, appears to show the animal running away from the engine down a stretch of railway track in Siberia. But instead of slowing down and stopping, the driver speeds up and excitedly shouts expletives before seeming to enjoy the moment of impact. Scroll down for video . Running away: The sickening 20 second-long footage, which has gone viral on the Internet, appears to show the animal running away from the engine down a stretch of railway track in Siberia . 'Squash him! But rather than slow down for the animal, a voice in the train cabin says 'squash him!' Moments later, the bear disappears under the train . The Siberian Times reported that two male voices can be heard in the cabin, with one saying 'squash him' and the other adding 'f***ing squash him'. The video attracted the attention of transport officials in Siberia after it was found online, and it is certain to anger conservationists around the world. It is unclear what happened to the animal, as no body has been found and no traces of blood were found on the track, on the outskirts of Norilsk, an industrial city 1,800 miles from Moscow. The scene: It is unclear what happened to the animal, as no body has been found and no traces of blood were found on the track, on the outskirts of Norilsk, an industrial city 1,800 miles from Moscow . Officials with the Norilsk Transport Prosecutors Office say the incident took place at about 2am on December 4, near the Golikovo checkpoint. The single stretch of track is only operated by the Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Company, which is the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium. The single stretch of track is only operated by the Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Company, which is the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium . Oksana Gorbunova, a senior aide for the Prosecutors Office, told the Siberian Times: 'We watched the video and it gave the impression that the train brigade deliberately sped up and didn't try to avoid the collision. 'We began an investigation - and not because we feel sorry for the bear - as first and foremost we have to investigate the actions of the train crew.' Police have yet to find the animal so there are hopes that it somehow managed to escape at the last second. However it is more likely it limped away injured and will be found dead in the coming days. The Govorit Moskva radio station yesterday reported the bear is still alive, albeit quoting the head of the Moscow-based mining company's press service Petr Likholitov. Mr Likholitov said: 'We got in touch with our colleagues in Norilsk. They said the animal was alive. 'They said that the front spade on the engine used to clean up snow simply lifted the bear and threw it to the side of the railway. 'Patrols found no traces of blood, so most likely the animal didn't get any serious traumas.' Earlier reports from the local media suggest it is the same bear that residents have spotted around the city, in Krasnoyarsk Krai region of Siberia. Where is it? Police have yet to find the animal so there are hopes that it somehow managed to escape at the last second. However it is more likely it limped away injured and will be found dead in the coming days . Normally bears hibernate at this time of the year but one has been seen a number of times, with armed police patrolling parts of the city. Many parts of the Urals and west Siberia have faced a growing problem with bears in recent years, with increased incidents of people being attacked as the animals seek food. Mr Likholitov added that the train drivers 'violated their code of conduct as they should have stopped the train'.","Footage shows the bear lolloping away from train speeding towards it .
Voices in the train cabin are heard saying, 'F****** quash him'

"Sen. Rand Paul announced today his plans to introduce a resolution in December that would formally declare war on ISIS and give the president limited authority to use American ground troops in the battle against the extremist group. 'I believe the President must come to Congress to begin a war and that Congress has a duty to act,' Paul said in a statement this morning. 'Right now, this war is illegal until Congress acts pursuant to the Constitution and authorizes it.' If accepted by Congress Paul's resolution would mark the first time since 1942 that the U.S issued an official declaration of war. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul,  pictured here speaking to the Chase Federalist Society at Northern Kentucky University on Friday in Highland Heights, will introduce a resolution in the Senate calling for a formal declaration of war on ISIS . Presence: American troops are already present in Baghdad as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. Last week General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed some who are in the Iraqi capital . The one-year resolution would specifically authorize the president 'to use the Armed Forces of the United States to protect the people and facilities of the United States in Iraq and Syria against the threats posed' by ISIS, and only ISIS, alternatively known as ISIL or the Islamic State. U.S. ground forces would only be allowed to engage in combat under strict conditions 'as necessary for the protection or rescue of members of the United States Armed Forces or United States citizens from imminent danger posed by' ISIS, 'for limited operations against high value targets' or 'as necessary for advisory and intelligence gathering operations'. The White House has claimed it already has the jurisdiction it needs to continue striking ISIS beyond the already expired 60-day window outlined in the War Powers Resolution of 1973 through a decade-old Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) agreement passed by Congress after 9/11. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have said that the outdated agreement doesn't apply to the current fight overseas and Congress would need to pass a new AUMF for the White House to continue bombing Iraq and Syria. While the White House has said it work with legislators to come up with a new arrangement, Republican Sens. John McCain and Bob Corker, the likely chairs of the Armed Forces and Foreign Relations committees in the Senate next legislative session, told Roll Call on Friday that the executive branch has yet to follow through on its pledge. Paul has taken the debate a step further, telling the New York Times that a new AUMF isn't enough. 'War cannot be initiated without Congress,' he said, and it cannot be conducted without a formal declaration. In action: An airstrike in Kobane, which has become one of the key battles with ISIS. Among the US military assets already deployed are drones, fighter-bombers including F-16s and B1B heavy bombers . Stronghold: An ISIS fighter in Raqua, which has become the de facto capital of the Islamic state. The town has been in the fanatics' grip all year after they defeated the Syrian government's forces . Show of force: ISIS have made propaganda images one of their most powerful weapons, with this parade through Raqqua inteded to show . The Kentucky senator said his Republican colleagues who are concerned about the president overstepping his powers through the use of an executive order to end the threat of deportation for millions of illegal immigrants and in other areas ought to be on board with his calls for proper war documents. 'Conservatives are mad at him about immigration. And they're mad about him using executive authority on Obamacare,' Paul told the Times. 'But this is another example where he doesn't have much respect for Congress, and some conservatives don't quite get that.' Paul's resolution would terminate a 2002 AUMF authorizing military force in Iraq and introduce a one-year sunset into another one, issued in 2001, that the Obama administration has been chaining the legal authority for its current campaign in the Middle East on to. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told the Times that he too plans to rally his colleagues to adopt a one-year resolution authorizing the fight against ISIS, but his bill would does not call for the formal declaration of war. It also doesn't nullify the 2001 AUMF like Paul's, the news publication said. 'Rand and I, we see very closely on this issue,' the Virginia Senator told the Times. 'We both feel like you can't have a war without congressional authorization of some kind. Congress cannot just let this power rest down at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue.' In an interview with Politico, Kaine said he believes some forces that can act as 'spotters' will be needed on the ground in Iraq to confirm the coordinates of suggested airstrike targets. 'I've become convinced that this notion of having folks to help with spotting and targeting is probably appropriate,' Kaine said at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada. Fellow Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff concurred. 'Congress may be willing to endure small numbers of spotters or Special Forces,' he told Politico. 'I'm open to that.' In September Paul told the Daily Beast, 'I don't think there need to be any American soldiers over there on the ground. 'The people on the ground fighting these battles, going hand-to-hand with ISIS, need to be their fellow Arabs and those who, I think and hopefully do, represent civilized Islam.' Vote? : New Senators and members of the House together for a group shot on the steps of the Capital. They would be asked to vote on war if Rand Paul's plan  doesn't come to fruition until the new Congress convenes . However he said, 'I don't mind helping them through technical support, through sophisticated intelligence, drones, Air Force, etc.' Paul's resolution leaves the option open for boots on the ground in restricted circumstances while not explicitly endorsing it. 'He doesn't believe we should send a bunch of troops in to start a ground war,' Doug Stafford, a senior aide to Paul told the Daily Beast on Monday. 'But he has always said we have an obligation to defend people in the region. The declaration is tailored to allow for this. Stafford later told the Daily Beast, 'It has always been a given that American troops could be required to secure the people and property of our embassy and consulate. 'Senator Paul believes that boots on the ground beyond those limited number as outlined in the declaration should come from allies in the region, as he has previously stated.' President Barack Obama has promised that no U.S. forces would be put into combat during the mission in Iraq. However the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, indicated during a congressional hearing this fall that a situation could arise in which he would advise the president to rethink his position.","'Right now, this war is illegal until Congress acts pursuant to the Constitution and authorizes it,' Paul said in a statement .
One-year resolution would authorize the president to engage ISIS militarily, including the limited use of U.S. ground forces .
They would fight under strict limits, including 'limited operations against high value targets' and 'intelligence gathering'
Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine plans to introduce a similar one-year resolution but it would not formally declare war .
Last formal declarations of war were as part of Second World War with presidents since then using authorizations for military force ."
"When filmmaker Heidi Lee Douglas travelled to Tasmania in 2001 to document the struggle between the controversial logging industry and the local community, she never expected that her footage would be used to take her, and 19 others, to court. Heidi was asked to come on board as the in-house filmmaker for advocacy group The Wilderness Society, and continued her own independent filming, capturing the broader environmental issues facing Tasmania at the time. Faced with backlash from the local community, logging corporation Gunns Limited sued Heidi and 19 other activists known as 'the Gunns 20', including lawyers, campaigners, elected politicians, students, doctors, a writer, and a dentist, on charges of conspiracy to undermine their company's image. Heidi spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the documentary, Defendant 5, which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life . While the charges were thrown out of court two times before a third and final attempt by woodchipping industry giant Gunns failed, which contributed to the collapse of their company, Heidi described the whole experience as intense and quite traumatic. Having become involved in telling the story of the logging industry's impact on the state as an individual, she found herself swept up in a much larger issue between Gunns and the local community. In Heidi's documentary about the experience, she said, 'My life was changing and I had no control over it anymore… I was a player in this massive chess game between this almighty powerful corporation and really, a bunch of community members who’d been standing up for their backyards.' Heidi spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the documentary, Defendant 5, which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life. 'The whole process of filming and editing was intense. It made me relive what had happened, and lots of moments I wondered why I was doing it, there was some awful memories dredged up,' Heidi said. Logging corporation Gunns Limited sued Heidi and 19 other activists known as 'the Gunns 20 . Heidi released footage of the company dropping a napalm-like substance on the remainder of a wood-felling site and burning the area . 'The uprising was coming from middle class, mainstream communities. It wasn’t extremists as other people might say, it was a widespread community conflict,' said Heidi . Being both a filmmaker and a defendant, Heidi was in a unique position to explain the ordeal, and felt that the issues that had plagued Tasmania and the wider Australian public remained relevant today. 'When I went to university I was exposed to documentary film making, and I felt like it was what I wanted to do. I became very passionate about telling underdog stories, human rights stories, ones that you don’t see a lot of in the mainstream media,' she said. 'I already had an interest in this and had covered issues in East Timor and South Australia and had visited other forest campaigners to learn what they were doing, and in Tasmania in particular I heard about a real uprising.' 'It was coming from middle class, mainstream communities. It wasn’t extremists as other people might say, it was a widespread community conflict.' During legal proceedings, Heidi realised that her documentary footage was one of the ties between the defendants, who were an otherwise disparate group. 'I never expected for the prosecution to use my footage as evidence to prove a conspiracy. I was devastated because I thought I’d been doing something to help wider community,' Heidi said. Being both a filmmaker and a defendant, Heidi was in a unique position to explain the ordeal, and felt that the issues that had plagued Tasmania and the wider Australian public remained relevant today . 'I realised during the legal process that there was no constitutional protection of free speech. I thought we had free speech protection, like in the US, but after doing some more research I discovered that we didn't, which still concerns me,' she said. 'There was no legal precedent for a case like this, where Gunns were re-framing a campaign to raise public awareness as a conspiracy. There's no real protection for whistleblowers, whether that be journalists or filmmakers.' Heidi felt incredibly isolated throughout the trial, and began a series of confessional video diaries as a form of releasing the pent up anguish and anxiety she was feeling. 'It's really hard when you're the one being persecuted because as an individual you don't have the resources and protection that the corporate giants do, and while you're being sued you can't speak out.' 'I was all alone, and it stopped me from doing what I'd been doing for five years. Even now my life is still absorbed by the impact of it.' Heidi felt as though she had been gagged, silenced, and without a voice, unable to interact with the world through film as she had for so long. It was because of this sense of disempowerment  that made the creation of Defendant 5 very healing, because even though it was painful at times to make, it gave her back her agency. 'What people will see when they watch the documentary is a deeply personal story of how it feels to be targeted by a giant corporation and to be denied freedom of speech,' she said. Heidi released a film showing images of the company dropping a napalm-like substance on the remainder of a wood-felling site and burning the area. As major Australian banks withdrew support from the company's industrial plans, Gunns Limited was unable to source financial backing from overseas after pressure from environmental agencies, and folded as a company. The documentary will air next week, coinciding with the ten-year anniversary of the defendant's receiving the first legal document regarding the case . During legal proceedings, Heidi realised that her documentary footage was what tied all the defendants, who were an otherwise disparate group, together . They really shot themselves in the foot with their behaviour, because it was not just an environmental issue, it was now a human rights issue. They drew more attention to themselves through their bullish behaviour and ended up in collapse,' said Heidi. Heidi said that she hopes people will understand that activism isn't the dirty word many think it is, and she wants her film to be part of breaking down misconceptions about what it means to have a sense of social responsibility. 'We all should have social responsibility, to each other and the world we live in. Being an activist doesn't make you an extremist, it just means you're someone who cares,' Heidi said. The documentary will air next week, coinciding with the ten-year anniversary of the defendant's receiving the first legal document regarding the case. 'Our democratic rights are very tenuous and we can't take them for granted. If we value having a fair and just Australian society then we need to partake and protect our democratic rights,' she said. '20 people were sued and the other defendants were able to walk away, and I totally understand why, but I can't just walk away. I need to tell this story.' Defendant 5 is screening as part of the Opening Shot series of documentaries by up and coming Australian filmmakers. It will air on Monday, December 8 at 9.30pm on ABC2 and will then be available to view on ABC iview. It was because of this sense of disempowerment that made the creation of Defendant 5 very healing, because even though it was painful at times to make, it gave her back her agency .","Heidi Lee Douglas travelled to Tasmania in 2001 to film community protests against the logging industry .

"Chelsea players believe Andre Schurrle will agree his return to Germany over the weekend. The 24-year-old is the subject of an offer from Wolfsburg, as reported by Sportsmail, and is keen to join them and kickstart his career. Schurrle has contributed to Chelsea during his time under Jose Mourinho but wants regular starts and more game time. Mourinho rates the World Cup winner but believes he needs to be more physical to handle the Premier League. Andre Schurrle could be waving goodbye to his Stamford Bridge career as he closes on a Germany return . The 24-year-old winger has been used mostly from the bench by Jose Mourinho this season . Chelsea hope to agree a fee close to £27million for a player they signed for £18m from Leverkusen in 2013. Schurrle has given the impression to senior players that he is ready to go. Fiorentina coach Vincenzo Montella has said he expects Juan Cuadrado to stay but that is reflective of Fiorentina's stance in their demand for his release clause or nothing. Real Sociedad have stepped into the race to sign Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah. Intermediaries spoke to Real Sociedad officials in San Sebastian and the Egyptian is keen on the move. The proposed loan also has the blessing of Mourinho who was keen to help out David Moyes as he strives to make an impression on La Liga. Mourinho is expected to speak to the player further on Thursday. The 22-year-old Salah wants to play and likes the idea of testing himself in Spain. Roma have made their offer of a £1m loan fee and £11m permanent fee to follow. A meeting between Chelsea, Roma and Salah's representatives began on Thursday while Monaco are also showing an interest. Salah is in dispute with his former agent Oliver Kronenberg, a Swiss lawyer, and has had Italian agents acting on his behalf also. Real Sociedad have joined the race to sign Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah (right) QPR and Spartak Moscow have also expressed an interest but Salah is not overly keen on moving to Russia and has concerns about QPR's form. Moyes also remains hopeful about signing Joel Campbell on loan from Arsenal and Etienne Capoue from Tottenham. Campbell though does have a lot of interest including that of Villarreal who have Arsenal target Gabriel Paulista. Georgios Samaras will leave West Bromwich Albion for Al Hilal and pave the way for Tony Pulis to bring in Callum McManaman. Talks are ongoing with Wigan who value McManaman at £6m but the offer so far is understood to be £2.25m up front with another £2m to follow in add-ons based on appearances and bonus upon Albion's survival. Greece international Samaras, who joined the Baggies in August last year, is expected to head to the Middle East on a six-month loan with a view to a permanent deal. He arrived in the summer as a free agent after leaving Celtic but is one of a host of summer signings who have failed to make an impact at The Hawthorns, playing just eight times for the first team without scoring. Georgios Samaras (left) will leave West Brom as they line up a move for Wigan's Callum McManaman (right) Back-up goalkeeper Luke Daniels has joined Scunthorpe on a free transfer, Silvestre Varela has completed a loan move to Parma and Sebastian Blanco is returning to Argentina with San Lorenzo. Wigan, meanwhile, have had a £350,000 offer from Chicago Fire for Shaun Maloney. The 31-year-old rejected a £1m move to Leicester in favour of the MLS but so far the teams have yet to reach a compromise on the fee. Swansea plan further talks over a move for Jordan Rhodes after Saturday's FA Cup tie with Blackburn. Swansea have made initial enquiries about the valuation of the 24-year-old and his wages and will resume talks after the sides face each other. Blackburn rejected £11m from Hull for Rhodes last summer and manager Gary Bowyer stressed the value placed on his strikers by his board when discussing the merits of Crystal Palace's £3.5m offer for Rudy Gestede on Wednesday. Rovers are determined to hold out for £5m for Gestede and value Rhodes even more highly. Swansea plan further talks with Blackburn over a move for striker Jordan Rhodes . Swansea are looking to replace Wilfried Bony, who joined Manchester City for £25million . Swansea are flush with cash from the sale of Wilfried Bony to Manchester City and are braced for the departure of Bafetimbi Gomis. They have considered Newcastle's Papiss Cisse but have now made an approach over Scotland international Rhodes. Rhodes has scored nine goals in 26 appearances this season as Blackburn have toiled for form. That is a relatively average return for a player who has been prolific throughout his career. He scored 25 in all competitions last season and 33 the season before. All told he has scored 62 goals in 116 games for Blackburn since signing from Huddersfield for £8m. Queens Park Rangers and Southampton have also considered Rhodes over recent months. Wigan FA Cup hero Ben Watson is wanted by Watford. The 29-year-old, who scored Wigan's FA Cup-winning goal against Manchester City in 2013, has made 10 appearances this season and scored one goal but is out of contract in the summer. Brighton and Reading have also shown an interest and Watson is understood to be keen on returning south. He began his career at Crystal Palace and impressed under the coaching of Roberto Martinez. He has also developed into a dead-ball specialist, notably being brought on to take a high-pressure penalty against Stoke in 2011. Wigan's 29-year-old midfielder Ben Watson is wanted by Watford . Watson scored the winning goal in the 2013 FA Cup final for Wigan against Manchester City . Reading  have signed Slovenian left-back Juve Travner after missing out on Hamilton's Stephen Hendrie. Manager Steve Clarke was poised with a move for 20-year-old Hendrie but thought he was joining West Ham. That move now looks in jeopardy after Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald branded West Ham 'shambolic' after they delayed sending an official offer for the Scotland Under 21 international. MacDonald's argument is that delay has cost Hamilton potential deals elsewhere. Crystal Palace, Everton and Swansea have all been to watch Hendrie but have yet to make offers. Bournemouth and Celtic are also interested but West Ham could yet sign the player if issues can be resolved. Derby, meanwhile, are interested in Hamilton's Spanish defender Jesus Garcia Tena. Fulham hope to convince Robert Huth of joining them on loan from Stoke City when he returns from the Premier League club's break in Dubai. The German remains keen on a Premier League move but Stoke like the idea of having a 24-hour recall on him if he goes to the Championship. Watford and Reading have also made enquiries for the Berlin-born centre-back, who has been linked with West Bromwich Albion, but former boss Pulis is reluctant to deal with his old club Stoke. Fulham also retain an interest in West Brom midfielder Graham Dorrans and defender Chris Baird. Millwall have made a move to sign Jos Hooiveld on loan from Southampton. The 31-year-old has been on loan at Norwich. Fulham will try to convince German defender Robert Huth to join them on loan from Stoke . Ipswich town forward Cameron Stewart is being considered by Championship rivals. The 23-year-old former Manchester United and Hull winger could be made avaialble on loan in the coming days as Mick McCarthy weighs up his options. Stewart missed he start of the season with a broken jaw but made his debut as a substitute in the 1-1 FA Cup draw against Southampton and came on again as a late sub in the replay at Portman Road. Manchester United defender Marnik Vermijl is wanted by Belgian side Lokeren. The 23-year-old has been with United since 2010 after joining from Standard Liege but has failed to make an impression on the first team. The Belgium Under 21 international right back spent most of the 2013-14 season on loan in Holland with NEC Breda. Luton held talks with Andrew Johnson on Thursday about proposed deal and are waiting for the free agent striker to decide whether he wants to join.","Andre Schurrle is close to agreeing a move away from Chelsea .

"A Pizza Hut job advert which said it was looking for 'decent, good-looking girls' to work a part-time reception role in its Leatherhead store has been pulled following complaints it is 'sexist' A Pizza Hut job advert which said it was looking for 'decent, good-looking girls'  to work in one of its stores has been pulled after complaints it is sexist. The advert for the chain's Leatherhead eaterie was posted on website Gumtree but was removed after it was reported to Pizza Hut's head office. The advert said: 'Pizza Hut Leatherhead looking for full and part time drivers. Need to have your own car. 'We are also looking for a decent good looking girls for Reception.

'I'm sure it's a one-off error, someone's done it without thinking but it doesn't make it right. 'I think it's a shame, the company has let itself down.

"Mesut Ozil wants to quit Arsenal as soon as January and the Gunners are ready to do business. Bayern Munich are lining up a bid of around £30million for Ozil, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid last summer for a club record £42.5m. The Football Grapevine understands the Germany star has grown increasingly unhappy at the Emirates, not least because he is not being played in his preferred forward floating role by Arsene Wenger. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mesut Ozil take part in Arsenal tyre challenge . Mesut Ozil may have played his last game for Arsenal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last Sunday . Ozil returned to Germany last week only to discover what was thought a minor knee injury could in fact rule him out for up the three months. It might even mean he has played his last game for the Gunners. Wenger doesn’t usually like to do business in January but could see the opportunity of offloading Ozil and bringing in his compatriot Sami Khedira from Real Madrid. Arsenal may also move for two other Germany stars in Mats Hummels and Julian Draxler. Lionel Messi’s run-in with the Spanish tax man could alter the destiny of his club career. Instead of playing out his days with Barcelona, Messi could finally consider a move elsewhere if things get heavy. Inevitably Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are monitoring the Argentine's current complicated situation. Barcelona's Lionel Messi (centre) challenges for the ball with Rayo Vallecano's Morcillo last week . Manchester United owners, the Glazers, could be gearing up for the potential sale of the club within two years for up to $3billion. Sources in Florida say there has been wrangling within the family over the future of the club since the death of Malcolm earlier this year. I understand that some within the family feel the time to optimise their investment in the club is drawing close. Joel Glazer (right) and brother Avram chat during a Premier League match at Old Trafford in 2011 . Singapore businessman Peter Lim is the current owner of La Liga club Valencia . Last year the club announced record revenues but the future is not so certain given failure on the pitch last season. The huge spend on new players - with more to come - will make a dent in profits over the next year. And given the massive loans the Glazers have out then a predicted rise in US interest rates could have further impact. But who would buy the club at the kind of level the Glazers want? I understand one potential buyer could be Peter Lim. Singapore businessman Lim currently owns La Liga club Valencia. But intriguingly Lim also has a stake in Salford City, the non-League club backed by ex-United ‘Class of 92’ stars Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville. Could it be that Lim plans a takeover of United with the backing of those players? They could woo back the hearts of those United fans who despise the Glazer ownership. Cray Wanderers will be hoping for FA backing as they seek to build a new ground. Non-League Cray are London’s oldest club and claim to be the second oldest in the world behind Sheffield FC . They have just won their battle to acquire a new site within the borough of Bromley, close to their original ground, after years of being 'homeless'. But they now need planning permission. Given they intend to build a 3G pitch and offer many other sports facilities - the sort of thing recently championed by FA chairman Greg Dyke - then the club will seek the help of English football's governing body to put pressure on the local council to flag through their progressive plans. I am hearing . Petr Cech is a target for several top clubs in the transfer window but the interest of PSG would suit him best. Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech in action during the match against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge . Libero . The FA keep talking up the importance of properly grooming young players through the ranks, especially at Under 21 level. But talk is cheap. England’s C team, the national non-League side, could have beaten San Marino this week so it seemed a waste to play Under 21 players in a stroll in the park  when they could have benefited for a much sharper test against Croatia on Friday night. Yes, England U21 sealed a 2-1 win over the Croats but it could have been more impressive had Jack Wilshere, Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers all played. As it is, England go to Croatia on Tuesday having to defend that slender lead to secure qualification for next summer’s finals. It would certainly have made a statement that playing for the U21s is not a ‘step down’. England's Jack Wilshere (right) holds off the challenge from San Marino's Matteo Vitaioli on Thursday . Wilshere could benefit from being skipper and leader of that side all the way through the finals next summer, when it is hoped the FA have the guts to insist that every player who qualifies is made available by their clubs. That way England WOULD have a serious chance of winning the tournament. The senior side can only benefit if a wave of players come through having coped with the pressures of tournament football, albeit at Under 21 level. That approach has certainly worked for Germany. Four of their World Cup winning side - Manuel Neuer, Hummels, Khedira and Ozil - were the spine of their 2009 Euro U21 winning side which thrashed an understrength England 4-0 in the final. But, as it is, England could now fail to even make the finals for the first time in five tournaments. It’s a big game for the U21s on Tuesday, so why hasn’t Roy Hodgson backed up his promises and let Gareth Southgate have the best players available ? After all, an England B team should be capable of winning in Estonia. Germany players celebrate victory over England in the UEFA U21 Championship final in June 2009 . UEFA should follow the lead of the African Football Association and make minnows like San Marino play in a pre-qualifying group. What is the point of a supposedly competitive international that everyone knows the result - and pretty much the scoreline - before the start? I was talking to a South African football reporter and he can’t believe countries like San Marino, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar and the like play in already bloated groups. I-Say . Mon: Arsene Wenger says he doesn’t regret shoving Jose Mourinho on the touchline. That in itself should have prompted FA action. Last season Alan Pardew got a stadium ban for a side line set-to. Why not Wenger? Tues: In Harry Redknapp’s new book he argues why Matt Le Tissier makes one of his starting XIs from the last six decades ahead of David Beckham. It’s that sort of strong judgement that would have made Redknapp such a good England manager. Wed: Sol Campbell says Gary Neville should be removed as England coach, allowing him to take his place. A bit arrogant from Sol, but he does raise the question of why Neville is allowed to carry on as a major Sky pundit and hold a key role with the England set up. There is a clear conflict of interests. Gary Neville (left) talks with England manager Roy Hodgson during a training session on Tuesday . Thu: England beat San Marino 5-0… they would have had bigger problems if NFL star Dan Marino had come out of retirement at Wembley. Fri: England U21s do well to overcome Croatia but can’t help feeling Roy Hodgson has let Gareth Southgate down by not letting him have the best players to secure qualification for the finals. ******************** . Back Heel . Wayne Rooney failed to fill his boots in the 5-0 sleepwalk over San Marino but his goal from a penalty edges him close to overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s England record of 49 international goals. He should move even closer in Estonia. As it stands, only Jimmy Greaves (44), Gary Lineker (48) and Charlton stand ahead of Rooney. Without taking anything away from Rooney, there are more cheap international goals about than there were in Lineker’s day let alone in the Greaves and Charlton era. That said, for some of his faults Rooney is the only current England player who would have got close to making England’s 1966 World Cup-winning side, or indeed the Italia 90 team which reached the semi-finals and with a bit more luck could have won it. England captain Wayne Rooney scores from the penalty spot against San Marino on Thursday . Given that Hodgson has made him England captain there seems little doubt Rooney will surpass Chartlon’s record perhaps by the end of this season. No doubt Sir Bobby will salute Rooney but anybody who thinks the record books and statistics tell the whole story are misguided. Indeed, while Sir Geoff Hurst eventually took the goalscoring plaudits with his unique hat-trick in the 1966 final after he took the place of Greaves - the best ever instinctive English striker - and Bobby Moore was the inspiration of the team, in many ways it was Charlton who was the talisman. Sir Bobby Charlton (left) scores for England against Austria in an international at Wembley in 1965 . Certainly, Charlton was the England player who football fans around the world viewed with most awe. He scored two routine but crucial goals when England overcame Portugal in the semi-finals - Rooney has only managed one World Cup goal in three tournaments - but the strike that summed Charlton up best was his spectacular effort in the group stage win over Mexico.","Mesut Ozil has grown increasingly unhappy at Arsenal and wants to leave .

"A bungling jihadi hacker has targeted a small part-time football club's website to declare that 'I am not Charlie' after mistaking it for a Premier League team. The Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, targeted Chatham Town Football Club's website on Saturday ahead of its clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63. The website was shut down for 12 hours after an image of a machine-gun wielding man wearing a gas mask was posted with a message asking: 'Where is the security?' Supporters of the tiny Kent club in Ryman League Division One  were left baffled by the message which also said: 'I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be. A Muslim hacker, who called himself Abdellah Elmaghribi, posted a message on Chatham Town FC's website saying: 'I'm not Charlie. I'm not a terrorist. I am a Muslim and proud to be' 'A little respect for other religions. Allah is One.' The hacker also declared 'I am not Charlie' in reference to the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris which claimed the lives of 11 people. Bosses at the club apologised to fans, saying its website had been hacked. Steve Archer, who looks after the website for the club, said the cyber attack 'made no sense' and that the hacker was probably thinking he was 'targeting a Premier League club'. 'It makes no sense - we're a part time football club so I'm pretty sure it's just a random attack - I hope it was,' he told Kent Online. 'Someone told me about 11pm. It must have been quite late as I had been working on it that evening. The website of the small club which is in Division One North of the Isthmian League was shut down for 12 hours ahead of a clash with Tilbury FC - which attracted a crowd of just 63 . 'I'm just hoping I've not lost too much information. It's taken me two years to put it together, and I've spent a lot of time on the history section. I've got results on there going back to 1990.' The average attendance at club's home matches at The Sports Ground, a 5,000 capacity stadium in Chatham, Kent, is just 143. Chatham FC supporter John Hendry, 38, said: 'There is no way this guy would want to waste his time attacking a website that only a handful of people look at. 'He must have thought he was targeting a Premier League team or at least a Championship team - poor old Chatham must be low on the radar when it comes to cyber terrorism.' Another local, calling himself Kentishman, said: 'Today Chatham Town FC. Tomorrow the world. Mwahhahahaha. 'I bet MI5 are putting their best people on it right now. These people know how to strike at the very heart of society. The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk . 'I'm inconsolable now I can't get access to the Chatham Town FC website. There's no point in carrying on.' Another, calling himself Billbo, wrote: 'Hahahahaha. Literally the worst hack I've ever seen.' The hacker, based in Morocco, has attacked websites across the globe, including Nigeria's number one music site, NotJuskOk. He is believed to be part of X-AMZ Team along with fellow hackers ViRusx.EL, Nasser Eddine, Moroccan Wolf and AlFeRox. In a previous message he has said: 'If you are asking why your website got hacked by me, it's basically because i want to share my message . So, The Sahara is a Moroccan, Free Palestine. Viva Quassam And Hamass & F*** Israhell.'

"If you're not going to sell Grand Theft Auto (GTA) because of its 'adult' content then prepare for a backlash of biblical proportions. Furious gamers are demanding that if Target and Kmart are going to pull the R-rated game from their shelves then they should do the same to the Bible as well. Target decided to scrap sales of the popular game after an online petition slammed it for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women'. The petition, authored by former sex workers, has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it. But the gamers have argued that the Bible's content is much, much worse. Scroll down for video . 26-year-old gamer Kiley McDonald diputes claims the game incites violence towards women . An online petition slammed R-rated video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women' Gamers have now started their own petition on Change.org website – the world's largest petition platform – claiming that the Bible has more misogyny and gratuitous violence than GTA, and there were far more reasons for it not to be sold. The petition page headline reads: ‘Withdraw The Holy Bible – this sickening book encourages readers to commit sexual violence and kill women.’ So far the petition has 22,359 supporters, and in the petition the Bible is described as a book that 'encourages readers to murder women for entertainment.' 'The incentive is to commit sexual violence against women, then abuse or kill them to proceed or get 'god' points – and now Target are stocking it and promoting it for your Xmas stocking,' reads the petition. 'This is The Holy Bible. This book means that after various sex acts, readers are given options to kill women by stoning her unconscious, Setting them on fire, cutting off their hands, and killing their children! 'This misogynistic book literally makes a game of bashing, killing and horrific violence against women.' However the former sex workers petition made it clear why they were against GTA being sold. 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell the game. 'We've been speaking to many customers over recent days about the game, and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. 'We've also had customer feedback in support of us selling the game, and we respect their perspective on the issue. Kiley is an avid fan of the game and even has her own GTA character called 'SHADOWKiiLLA' 'However, we feel the decision to stop selling GTA5 is in line with the majority view of our customers.' Manager of Facebook site Grand Theft Auto Tips & Tricks Kiley McDonald says the move is 'ridiculous' and disputes claims that the game incites violence towards women. 'I remember playing it as a 10-year-old, my parents got it for me,' She told Daily Mail Australia. 'It never offended me, it doesn't offend me now and I grew up alight. 'I don't go out and mow down people or pull a gun out and spray them or anything, so I just think it's a little bit over the top.' McDonald claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women  are in short supply. She said she was 'speechless' as to why GTA had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who won't let their kids play the game, would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of Game of Thrones, or read a chapter from 50 Shades of Grey. 'If I don't like someone's clothing, I'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts,' she said. 'If I don't like it, I don't look at it,because I've got better things to do.' McDonald believes the campaigners against the game are 'misinformed' and 'threw a tantrum' when they didn't get what they wanted. 'I'm all for feminists and women's rights but this is going a bit too far.' she said. 26-year-old McDonald believes big retailers such as Kmart and Target should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition. 'I don't know why gamers should be punished for something that's not our fault, or the retailers fault because they've gone through all the standards and checked the game,' she said. The petition, authored by former sex workers, has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it . McDonald said she understand the anger from former sex workers who launched the online petition, but believes GTA gamers do not play out these acts in the real world. 'It's up to the gamer to choose,' she said. 'I've played the story from start to finish, I'm 26-years-old, I'm a female and I was not once offended, I was not once appalled by the content,' she said. 'There are prostitutes in the game, there is a strip club in the game but very few of them that you see.' Reports that the game depicts women as bimbos and prey for men has angered McDonald. 'Most of them are actually dressed quite normally.' she said. 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said . 'These people actually look like they're going to work, they've got the content that perfect that some people are in uniform or they're in work clothes or summer gear.' McDonald said little children are the worst offenders in online forums. 'They're the ones that taunt you on the microphone, saying 'I'm going to f**k you mum' and 'F you this', and 'F that', it's insane and they shouldn't be playing it' she said. 'Most people have grown up playing video games like that and we're fine,' 'We don't go shooting up people and punching cops' McDonald said there are other children's games available that are much more dangerous. 'There's also another game which a lot of children play called World of Warcraft and  a lot of sexual predators are on that game.' she said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V . The young gamer worries that this ban will effect future sales of Grand Theft Auto as there will be a monopoly on who will be able to sell the game. Ultimately, she said it's really going to effect gamers who are keen on playing the game. 'My worry is that it's  going to be banned so it's going to be a problem for future games,' she said. Mr Cooper said Target would continue to sell other R-rated DVDs and games. 'While these products often contain imagery that some customers find offensive, in the vast majority of cases, we believe they are appropriate products for us to sell to adult customers,' he said. 'However, in the case of GTA5, we have listened to the strong feedback from customers that this is not a product they want us to sell.' GTA5 is an award-winning game which set a sales record for entertainment products, passing the $1 billion sales mark after three days.","General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V .

"Chelsea's highly rated midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah has joined Championship strugglers Reading on loan until the end of the season. Reading are 18th in the league and but manager Steve Clarke knows more about Chalobah's potential than most, as he was an assistant to Jose Mourinho during the Portuguese's first tenure at Stamford Bridge. The England under-21 international's versatility means he  also offers cover in defence and Clarke believes Chalobah can help guide The Royals further away from the drop zone.

"Victim: Three police officers and PCSO will be prosecuted  following the murder of Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, who was burned to death by neighbours who wrongly believed he was a paedophile . Three police officers and a PCSO have been charged with offences linked to the murder of a man  beaten and burned to death by neighbours who wrongly believed he was a paedophile. PCs Kevin Duffy, Helen Harris and Leanne Winter of Avon and Somerset Police are accused of 'failing to respond to allegations and calls for help' by Bijan Ebrahimi. PCSO Andrew Passmore is accused of lying about the contact he had with the murder victim. It was also revealed today that a further 12 officers from the same force now face misconduct proceedings over claims Mr Ebrahimi had six years of contact with police before his murder. Disabled Ebrahimi, a keen gardener, died after he was beaten, burned and left to die on a patch of grass near his home. The 44-year-old, originally from Iran, had taken photographs of youths vandalising his hanging baskets and intended to hand them to police as evidence. But someone on his Bristol estate saw him with the camera and told police that he had taken pictures of children. Instead of tackling the vandals officers took Mr Ebrahimi, originally from Iran, away for questioning, as other residents on his estate gathered in the street and chanted, 'Paedo, paedo'. He was interviewed at a police station but officers soon realised he had been taking photographs only in an attempt to help catch the local yobs. Two days after his release Mr Ebrahim's charred body was found burning in the road. Lee James, 24, admitted murder and Stephen Norley, 24, admitted assisting him. The Independent Police Complaints Commission submitted a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service in October 2014 into how officers responded to events and contact from Mr Ebrahimi. Today, the Crown Prosecution Service announced three police constables and a police community support officer will be charged with misconduct in a public office. And it also emerged thatMr Ebrahimi's family said in a statement: 'We are relieved by this decision and trust the officers will now face the full rigour of the law'. Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of special crime at the CPS, said: 'PCs Kevin Duffy, Helen Harris and Leanne Winter, all of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, are to be charged with misconduct in public office for allegedly failing to respond to allegations and calls for help from Mr Ebrahimi. Horrific crime: Police officers pictured investigating the scene in Bristol where Bijan Ebrahimi was found burned to death in July last year. Four officers, not pictured, now face court over the case . Innocent: Mr Ebrahimi was attacked and set alight outside this building in Bristol, where neighbours falsely accused him of being a paedophile . 'PCSO Andrew Passmore is to be charged with misconduct in public office for allegedly giving false information to the 999 operator that he was outside Mr Ebrahimi's home at an important time. He will also be charged with perverting the course of justice for allegedly giving different accounts to the police murder investigation and the IPCC investigation'. All four will appear in court in January. Mr Ebrahimi, had been attacked by Lee James, who lived in the same street in Brislington, Bristol. During the fatal attack, father-of-four James, who believed his victim had been filming his children, repeatedly stamped on Mr Ebrahimi's head, telling him 'have some of that'. Father-of-two Stephen Norley, who worked for a fruit and vegetable wholesaler, helped James drag Mr Ebrahimi's body from the scene of the attack and obtained white spirit to burn it. Jailed: Lee James, pictured left, pleaded guilty to the murder of Bijan Ebrahim while Stephen Norley, pictured right, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . James, was jailed for life after he admitted murder, and Norley, 24, denied murder but admitted assisting his friend, and was jailed for four years. Speaking after the case, Mr Ebrahimi's sister Manizhah Moores said her brother suffered racial abuse while living in Bristol. 'We hope that nobody else ever has to witness an innocent disabled man being abused, taunted and tortured in the way that Bijan suffered,' Mrs Moores said. After the hearing, Avon and Somerset Police spokesman Martin Dunscombe said Mr Ebrahimi was an innocent man.

"Elephants are known for their impressive memories, but they are also adept meteorologists, a new study claims. Researchers say the large animals can detect an approaching rainstorm up to 150 miles (241km) away. And they think elephants’ forecasting abilities could be used to help conservationists monitor herds to keep them safe from poachers. Scroll down for video . More accurate than weathermen? Elephants can detect an approaching rainstorm up to 150 miles (241km) away, scientists say. They think elephants’ forecasting abilities could be used to help conservationists monitor herds to keep them safe from poachers . Unsurprisingly, considering the size of their ears, elephants have good hearing and can detect very low frequencies, PopSci reported. Scientists believe the creatures can hear low rumbles of thunder and the sound of heavy rain miles away to predict when wet weather is approaching. They came to this conclusion after studying herds of elephants that suddenly migrated in Namibia. The behaviour has previously not been explained, according to the study published in the journal Plos One. Excellent listeners: Scientists believe the creatures can hear low rumbles of thunder and the sound of heavy rain miles away to predict when wet weather is approaching.  A rain front approaching in Namibia is pictured . Three years ago, scientists found that older elephants are best at making decisions about predators, because they remember similar situations they have encountered before. When families were played male or female lion roars from a loudspeaker - simulating their presence - those with older matriarchs correctly focused their defensive reactions on male lions that are the more adept killers. Dr Karen McComb, of the University of Sussex, and colleagues said the ability to make this subtle distinction highlights the importance of age in leadership and the advantage of longevity in large-brained, social mammals. During 72 playbacks of lion roars among 39 family groups in Boseli National Park in Kenya over more than two years, the oldest matriarchs listened intently for longer periods and led their group into more defensive positions when it was a male roar. Oliver Frauenfeld, a geology professor at Texas A&M University said: ‘They’ve been observed to change the places they go and the speeds they go rather quickly. To uncover what prompted such movement, Professor Frauenfeld and his team potted the movements of nine elephants wearing GPS trackers belonging to different herds – for a total of seven years. They found that the elephants constantly changes course during the rainy season in Namibia, between January and March. The experts observed that the elephants could ‘sense’ that were hundreds of miles away to predict and move towards the rainstorms. Professor Frauenfeld said: ‘They need the rain. After a prolonged dry season, once the elephants hear the rain, they start moving towards it and it allows them to get the water sooner.’ He thinks that knowing how elephants chase storms will help conservationists predict their movements and guard them from poachers.

"Five prisoners released Thursday from the U.S. Navy prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba included hard-core al-Qaeda members who traveled and worked closely with terror leaders Osama bin Laden and Abu Zubaydah. The move is being seen as part of the Obama administration's effort to shutter the military detention center, a promise the president made during his 2008 campaign but which he has yet to fulfill. Although an administration task force found in 2009 that they no longer posed a great enough threat to keep behind razor wire indefinitely, classified documents  demonstrate that only a year earlier they were deemed high-risk and likely to re-engage in hostilities against the United States and its allies. In an April 2008 evaluation report, the Department of Defense determined that one of the men, 36-year-old Yemeni citizen Abdel Ghaib Ahmad Hakim, was 'a member of al-Qaeda who reportedly accompanied Osama Bin Laden throughout Afghanistan.' SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE INTELLIGENCE REPORTS . The U.S. Naval detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba is a political hot potato, with President Barack Obama insisting it should be closed and congressional Republicans saying there's nowhere safe to send hardened al-Qaeda terrorists . Former Guantanamo Bay detainees Hashim Bin Ali Bin Amor Sliti (left) and Husayn Salim Muhammad Al-Mutari Yafai (right) have been released to the government of Slovakia . Abdel Ghaib Ahmad Hakim (left) and Abdul Khaled Al-Baydani (right) were sent to the nation of Georgia . Intelligence agents learned that he went with the 9/11 mastermind as he toured Afghanistan to receive 'bayat' – declarations of allegiance – from terror cell leaders. Less than a year before the Obama administration first reclassified him as a detainee who could leave, the Pentagon ruled that Ahmad Hakim was a 'high risk' prisoner, 'as he is likely to pose a threat to the U.S., its interests and allies.' He was also described in the report as having 'high intelligence value' to the United States. That assessment was based on the conclusion that he was 'a member of Abu Zubaydah's Martyrs Brigade, a Faisalabad [Pakistan] cell intended to conduct IED attacks against U.S. and Coalition forces. A second released terror suspect, 37-year-old Husayn Salim Muhammad Al-Mutari Yafai, also from Yemen, was an al-Qaeda forger. Another April 2008 Department of Defense report referred to him as 'an al-Qaeda facilitator located in Iran providing travel and false travel documents to Arab extremists attempting to enter Afghanistan.' He, too, was deemed 'a high risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests, and allies.' Yafai, his assessment concluded, 'is an assessed al-Qaeda member who has information on al-Qaeda associated guesthouses and safe houses in Afghanistan and Iran.' In January 2009 before Obama's task force met, the Pentagon declared in a supplemental report that he was 'a probable recidivist candidate.' 'If released without rehabilitation, close supervision, and means to successfully reintegrate into his society as a law-abiding citizen,' the addemdum read, 'it is assessed detainee would seek out prior associates and reengage in hostilities and extremist support activities at home and abroad.' The reports covering Hakim and Yafai recommended 'continued detention under DoD control' for both men. Yafai was released to Slovakia. Akim went to the former Soviet nation of Georgia. Sliti, a 48-year-old Tunisian, was a member of an Islamist extremist organization called the Tunisian Combatant Group. His classified assessment revealed that in 2004, he was convicted in absentia on terrorism-related charges for his role in suicide attacks – 'including a foiled attack against U.S. military personnel at the Kleine Brogel Air Base in Belgium.' His jailers considered him a high-risk prisoner, writing in 2008 that he had 'holds anti-US sentiment and on more than one occasion has threatened to kill members of the guard force.' An older assessment on another inmate released this week, written in 2004, concerned the 52-year-old Al-Dhabi, a Saudi- born Yemeni man. He was trained to use rocket-propelled grenades and small arms at the Sadeeq terrorist camp in Afghanistan, the Pentagon found. And 'in Kandahar, the detainee and his family stayed in an apartment provided by the Taliban.' 'This detainee is a member of Al-Qaeda and/or its global terrorist network,' the report concluded, adding that he 'has demonstrated a commitment to jihad, has links to key facilitators in Al-Qaeda's international terrorist network, has participated in terrorist training, likely participated in direct hostilities against the U.S. and coalition forces, and maintains the capability to continue to do so if released.' The report's author, U.S. Army Brigadier General Jay Hood, wrote that Al-Dhabi's specialized terror training suggested that the only safe way to release him would be to transfer him to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where he could be monitored intensely. 'He is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies,' Hood wrote . The Defense Department reports, classified as 'SECRET,' were first released by the controversial Wikileaks website in 2011 but have since been lost in the Internet's staticky coverage of America's war on terror. EMPTYING: The Obama administration has released nearly 100 Guantanamo Bay prisoners . Leaving for what? Many released Guantanamo Bay detainees have returned to the battlefield in the Middle East, including one who is now in the ISIS leadership structure . California Republican  Rep. Buck McKeon, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said Thurdsay that 'as long as detainees are rejoining the battlefield, these transfers must stop.' “I have written to Secretary [Chuck] Hagel expressing my frustration and great concern over a new swell of recidivism. If just one U.S. soldier loses their life over these transfers, we will have failed in our duty to the American people.' 'What the Obama Administration is doing is dangerous and, frankly, reckless,' McKeon said. 'They have chosen many times to put politics above national security. It’s time they stop playing with fire and start doing what’s right. Until we can assure the terrorists stay off the battlefield, they must stay behind bars.' Georgia Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss, likely to be the next chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also slammed the White House for its latest move. 'For years, we’ve seen the president put politics over America’s national security by releasing Guantanamo Bay detainees and transferring them to other nations,' he said in a statement. 'Dangerous and, frankly, reckless': House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon blasted the White House . 'These are dangerous terrorists who will continue to plot ways to harm and kill Americans, just like previous detainees released to foreign countries who have reengaged in terrorism.' Obama, he said, 'seems more occupied with efforts to fulfill a campaign promise than ensuring these terrorists cannot rejoin the fight.' Guantanamo Bay now holds 143 prisoners, about 100 fewer than the number when Obama took office. Congress had repeatedly prohibited the release of any inmate to domestic American prisons and put tight restrictions on other releases as well. But those limits were mostly lifted in December 2013, and more of what the White House and the Pentagon call 'resettlements' are expected before the end of the year. Another 74 prisoners at Guantanamo have already been cleared to leave. Fifty-five got the green light from an Obama-appointed task force in 2010. 'These men were approved for transfer by consensus of the six departments and agencies comprising the task force,' the Pentagon said Thursday in a press release. Overall, 620 detainees have been released from the prison camp; 107 have returned to the battlefield and another 77 are suspected of doing so, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. One of the confirmed terrorist fighters who returned to the Middle East, Abdul Raheem Muslimdost, was determined to no longer be an 'enemy combatant' in 2006, during the George W. Bush administration. A Pakistani newspaper reported this year that he is now among several Pakistanis with leadership positions in the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. The Associated Press reported Thursday that U.S. State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners from Guantanamo. Three were sent to Georgia and two to Slovakia. Those countries now hold a total of 16 former terror detainees once held at the prison. 'We are very grateful to our partners for these generous humanitarian gestures,' Sloan said in a statement. 'We appreciate the strong support we are receiving from our friends and allies around the globe.' 2014-Nov-20 GTMO detainee releases uploaded by MailOnline .","One former detainee toured Afghanistan with bin Laden as he received pledges of obedience from terror cell leaders .

"Two emaciated fishermen were recovering in a Pacific hospital today after enduring a five month ordeal drifting helplessly in an open boat. The Papua New Guinea fishermen told officials in the town of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands that they had survived by eating raw fish and drinking rainwater. Their ordeal finally ended when they were picked up by a fishing boat called Yap Seagull, about 120 miles south of remote Kapingamarangi Island. Badly sunburned and suffering from hunger, they were described by hospital officials as being in 'reasonable' condition considering the many weeks they had spent drifting across the ocean. Michael Bolong (left) and Ambros Wavut (right) finally make it to dry land after their ordeal . Officials named the rescued men as Michael Bolong, 54,  and Ambros Wavut, 28. A third man who had been on the tiny open boat had died, said the men. They claim that the man, Francis Dimansol, 48, died from 'severe health conditions' while they were adrift in the Pacific. Mr Dimanbol died just two weeks before his companions were found by the Yap fishing boat. No details have emerged about what happened to his body, but it is known that in similar dramas on the high seas survivors have lowered those who have succumbed to the elements over the side of the boat as their bodies started to decompose. It was also emerged that Mr Bolong is the uncle of Mr Wavut - and their survival story was made even more remarkable because they were not fishermen but construction workers who were sailing from one small island to another. But somehow they managed to catch fish and eat them raw, while scooping up rainwater that had gathered in the bottom of their boat. ‘We were convinced that everyone had given up looking for us,’ Mr Bolong told the crew of the Yap Seagull fishing boat which picked them up. ‘We know from other instances of boats being lost that after a while searchers give up, convinced that no-one can survive after many weeks in an open boat,’ he said in broken English. ‘We managed to sit out storms without being overturned, but that might also have led to people thinking we had no chance of surviving. ‘There is no doubt that after weeks, which turned into months, we were forgotten, except by our families.’ Mr Bill Janes, editor of the Kaselehlie Press in Pohnpei said that when he saw the men step ashore from the Yap Seagull he noticed how thin they were, but thought that they were otherwise in 'great shape'. What might have helped their recovery, he noted, was the fact that they had been on the Yap fishing boat for four days after being picked up and brought into port. While the rescued men have still to tell their story in detail, it is believed they drifted helplessly for at least 1000 miles after setting out on a fishing trip in early July from their village in the province of New Ireland, which comes under Papua New Guinea administration. The amazing journey of 1,000 miles that the two men from Papua New Guinea survived . All was going well until the engine on their boat broke down and they became victims of the ocean currents. 'They saw passing ships but could not get the message across that they were in trouble,' said an official on Pohnpei. According to a report from the Federated States of Micronesia government information service on the island of Yap, the men's boat had been carried out to sea by a strong current. The report said they had managed to survive a number of severe storms. Michael Bolong (left) and Ambros Wavut (right) were in surprisingly good condition when they were rescued . Radio New Zealand reported that the men were admitted to hospital for observation, although authorities claim the men are in good health, and that work is now underway to repatriate the men. The men's survival comes after another astonishing feat when Mexican fisherman Jose Alvarenga drifted across the Pacific for 13 months before his boat was washed ashore in the Marshall Islands earlier this year.","The Papua New Guinea men drifted helplessly in an open boat .

"Two Dutchmen have been jailed for a total of 36 years after being convicted of a 'James Bond'-style plot to smuggle £16.2million of cocaine into Britain using underwater vehicles. Henri Van Doesburg, 68, and Arnold Van Milt, 49, helped to transport 240lbs (108kg) of the class A drug to the UK in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship Cape Maria. While the ship was moored in Scotland, the pair planned to use underwater Seabob vehicles to dive down and collect the drugs, which were hidden behind a hatch that could be opened from outside. Henri Van Doesburg, 68, has been jailed for 20 years, while Arnold Van Milt, 49, has been jailed for 16 years, after police uncovered a plot to smuggle £16.2million of cocaine into the UK using underwater vehicles . Police found 50 packets, totalling 240lbs (108kgs) of high-purity cocaine, stored in the rudder compartment of Colombian ship Cape Maria while it was moored off the coast of Scotland . Officers arrested Van Milt near to where the ship was moored, and when they searched his car they found Seabob underwater vehicles (pictured) which could be used to smuggle drugs off the ship . Van Milt was caught after customs officials discovered 50 packages of high-purity cocaine on the boat and arrested him in Seamill, near to where the boat was moored. Officers then searched his car, where they found a ribbed motorboat with a powerful engine, Seabob underwater vehicles, wet suits, and other scuba equipment. Van Doesburg was arrested in Aalsmeer, in the Netherlands, the next day after officers seized an encrypted Blackberry mobile that Van Milt was using to contact him. Officers also found Van Doesburg had been tracking the ship on his home computer, and used this information to locate him. Van Milt was jailed for 16 years and Van Doesburg for 20 years after being found guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine at Leeds Crown Court. Van Doesburg's son Roderick, 23 and grandson Darryl-Jay, 22, were also both arrested in Seamill, but were acquitted of similar charges after a four-week trial. Officers began tracking Van Doesburg in May, when he was seen meeting to two English men in a bar in Amsterdam, where the group were heard discussing 'diving'. After officers arrested Van Milt they traced Van Doesburg via an encrypted Blackberry mobile. He was arrested in Holland the next day, and information on his laptop connected him to the drugs . Investigators searching Van Milt's car also found a ribbed boat (pictured) along with wetsuits and scuba diving gear which formed part of his 'specialist drug retrieval service' Prosecutors likened the plot to a James Bond-style heist which had been planned for months in advance . Officers then managed to get hold of papers from the meeting that were covered with calculations and telephone numbers. Van Doesburg was picked up again alongside Van Milt when the pair arrived in the UK on April 29 on the Rotterdam to Hull ferry, driving a car that was towing a ribbed boat. They then visited a B&Q in Grimsby to buy tools before booking into a hotel in Cleethorpes. When police arrested Van Milt and searched his car, they found a ribbed boat with a high powered engine, a Seabob underwater vehicle, and scuba gear. The drugs were stored in a hatch underneath the Cape Maria near the rudder, which could be opened from the outside. Prosecutors said the scuba gear and Seabob would be used to dive down under the ship using the cover of darkness. Once there, Milt could have retrieved the 240lbs haul of cocaine, worth £16.2million. In the style of James Bond, the Seabob vehicle would be used to make a speedy underwater getaway. The ribbed boat could have been used to transport Van Milt to a location near the Cape Maria, but out of sight, before he switched to the Seabob. On May 1 the pair picked up Roderick and Darryl-Jay from Leeds Bradford Airport. RNLI lifeboat officers saw some of the men regularly going out to sea in their boat. After dropping Van Doesburg back at Leeds Bradford Airport on May 5, the others headed for Scotland and stayed in hotels in the Largs area. CCTV showed them visiting a Halfords store in Greenock to buy camping equipment and C&C Marine Services in Largs to enquire about hiring diving equipment. The trio were arrested on May 9 after border officials found the drugs hidden in a rudder compartment of the Cape Maria which could be opened from the outside. The team also found cut ropes hanging from the hatch, suggesting it had been used before. When officers caught up with Van Doesburg in Holland the following day they seized his laptops and found information linking him to the Cape Maria. From documents on his computers, they discovered the Cape Maria on two previous occasions in January and March this year. Officers were also able to link Van Doesburg to two other ships, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, which were also discovered to be carrying cocaine. Sentencing the two men, Judge James Spencer QC said: 'It seems to me, despite your mature years, the two of you were out to make money, the two of you played for high stakes and the two of you have lost. 'Now you stand, the two of you, convicted of a very serious offence involving the agreement to import class A drugs into this country, into the UK. Prosecutors revealed the drugs were hidden in a rudder compartment of this ship which could be opened from the outside. The Seabobs and diving equipment were to be used to go down and extract the illicit haul . As well as the Cape Maria, information on Van Doesburg's laptop linked him to two other boats, the Indian Friendship and the Florentina, that were also stopped while carrying cocaine . 'It was on a scale which can readily be said to be commercial for the quantity was well over 100kg with a potential street value of over £16million. 'The evidence, it seems to me, is clear that you Henri Van Doesburg and you Arnold Van Milt were involved in this scheme in a leading role because the two of you went to Columbia and no doubt there organised the sourcing and also the stowing of this material.' David Norris, National Crime Agency branch commander, said: 'The underwater scooter was like something out of a Bond movie. 'These criminals were going to use it to dive beneath the ship under the cover of darkness and recover the cocaine worth tens of millions of pounds. 'Van Doesburg and Van Milt provide a specialist drug retrieval service for organised crime groups, and we have linked them to other ships that have been intercepted carrying cocaine. Jailing Van Doesburg and Van Milt (pictured) at Leeds Crown Court, Judge James Spencer QC said the pair had 'played for high stakes and lost' Judge Spencer also noted that both of the men were clearly leading the plot, as they had both traveled to Colombia, with the likely aim of sourcing the cocaine to be transported . 'Van Milt posed as a tourist while in Scotland and bought camping equipment as part of the cover story. 'By preventing them providing more of their services, the NCA and its partners have disrupted criminal activity beyond this one operation. There will be some very frustrated criminals out there today.' Sir Charles Montgomery, director-general of Border Force, said: 'This was an excellent seizure that stopped millions of pounds worth of harmful drugs making their way on to the streets of this country.'","Henri Van Doesburg, 68, and Arnold Van Milt, 49, jailed for total of 36 years .

"The bizarre architecture that has sprung up along China's skyline over the past few years could soon become a thing of the past, after Beijing announced a crackdown on 'weird buildings'. The capital city's vice mayor Chen Gang announced that Beijing would be taking a greater role in influencing building aesthetics by specifying standards in size, style, color and materials. He said that by managing urban design, Beijing will demonstrate its modern spirit without abandoning its local characteristics as a historical city. Chinese President Xi Jinping insisted buildings such as the CCTV headquarters - nicknamed 'Big Pants' due to its design looking like a par of trousers - should no longer pop up in the city . A night view of the Galaxy Soho in Beijing, a 370,000 square meter complex of shops, offices and restaurants by Zaha Hadid Architects . According to China Daily, Mr Chen added that the next step is to pay attention to the design of public areas, providing habitable spaces for residents as well as creating a better cityscape. China's cities have become well-known for the bizarre buildings that adorn the skyline, including space-age eggs, a phallic-shaped newspaper tower, a giant golden doughnut and a tea-pot shaped structure. Fed-up with the garish, novelty shapes, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an end to 'weird architecture' during a two-hour speech at a literary symposium in Beijing in October. Mr Xi, who took over as China's Communist Party leader nearly two years ago, called for morally-inspiring architecture that should 'be like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste and clean up undesirable work styles'.

He insisted buildings such as the CCTV headquarters - nicknamed 'Big Pants' due to its design looking like a par of trousers - should no longer pop up in the city. But Dutch architect and Pritzker-prize laureate Rem Koolhaas, who designed the CCTV building, told CNN that he is unconcerned by the prospect of a crackdown in Beijing. 'There have been periods (in China) where ordinances existed, there were mayors who insisted (to put) Chinese roofs on modern buildings but it's like a pendulum,' he said, while attending a design conference in Hong Kong.

Mr Koolhaas added that he did not believe the 'weird buildings' remarks were aimed at the iconic CCTV building. 'The media has made that connection,' he said. 'No more weird buildings, it's understandable if you look around and I don't feel that CCTV is a weird building so that's my comment.'

"The Jacksonville Jaguars are the NFL's youngest roster. It showed, too. An error-strewn performance saw missed tackles galore and three turnovers, one from a muffed punt inside their own 10-yard line. Arguably it turned the game. The Jags were 7-3 up and had reduced Tony Romo, playing with two fractured vertebrae, to a field goal from his opening two drives. Ace Sanders muffs Chris Jones' punt in the first quarter to hand the ball back to Dallas and sap momentum . The hardened veteran was not in the mood to return the charity. He looked calm in the red zone, gingerly rolling to his right on third down, finding Jason Witten with a two-yard pass. The score was the first of 28 unanswered points, and the game was over as a contest by half-time. Punt returner Ace Sanders was honest in his appraisal, saying: 'The ball slipped through my fingers. You need to secure the ball first and then worry about what comes next. And I didn't do that. It was very out of character. I need to make some adjustments. 'It definitely happens, but at the same time, you never want it to.' Gus Bradley focuses on the game but Jacksonville suffered their second defeat in two years in London . Coach Gus Bradley appeared frustrated at seeing the same mistakes, week-in, week-out. 'I don't have any real concerns with our effort, with our courage, with our toughness. It's just those self inflicted things, and it's just focus, concentration, whatever the case is. Those things, I think are what causes some frustration,' A particular problem is the inability to tackle, as Bradley continued. 'Well, it wasn't very good right away in the first half. I don't know how many we missed, but it disappeared. We had some sloppiness.' Tony Romo was protected by his offensive line magnificently, with Jags recording just one sack . Dez Bryant burned the Jags' defense on two long touchdown passes, beating man coverage, finding space at will and skipping hapless attempts to stop him. For his second score, a 68-yarder just before the break, he carried safety Johnathan Cyprien for the last 10 yards. 'Yes, I took a bad angle. I took a bad angle, and instead of just trying to get him out of bounds, I reached for him, kind of put the ball this way. It doesn't matter, I missed him, and that can't happen,'  a dejected Cyprien said. With rookie quarterback Blake Bortles under center, it is bound to be a year of ups and downs. He started the game excellently, finding Allen Robinson and Cecil Shorts III before Denard Robinson went over from 33 yards. Bortles spoke of the undulating nature of his youthful side. 'I mean, the first drive we went down was a really good drive. The offensive line did well. We ran well. Cecil had a play and Denard broke a big run. We came back the second drive and hurt ourselves with the penalty and kind of shot ourselves in the foot for two or three drives after that and never really could get it rolling again.' As they fly home to Florida, the Jags are 1-9 for the third straight season. And with their propensity to shoot themselves in the foot, it is tough to see where their next victory will come from.","The Jaguars lost 31-16 to the Cowboys in a one-sided affair at Wembley .

"A British businessman branded a lying ‘gigolo’ was yesterday jailed for 20 years for the savage murder of his fiancée in a Paris hotel room. Ian Griffin, 45, remained impassive as a French judge sentenced him for the killing of millionairess Kinga Legg, 36, at the five-star Bristol. Her body was found in the bath of the couple’s £1,000-a-night room, after Griffin, who claimed it was an accident, fled to England in his Porsche 911. Scroll down for video . Tracy Baker (left), 34, who had a child with Ian Griffin (right) after he was controversially released on bail last year and has stood by him, was also there when the jury verdict was read out by Judge Didier Safar . The couple had been on their way to Monaco where they planned to marry. But Griffin was seeing another girlfriend, Tracy Baker, at the same time. Miss Baker, 34, who had a child with the businessman after he was controversially released on bail last year and has stood by him, was also in the Paris Assizes when the jury verdict was read out by Judge Didier Safar. She was overcome with emotion as she saw the frail Griffin, who was on crutches, led to the cells. A few hours earlier, he had told the court that he wanted to apologise to Miss Legg’s parents for her death – which he claimed he could not remember as he had blacked out. ‘To think I could do that to the girl I love, that’s killing me,’ he said. ‘I have been through every regret, every emotion. I would give my life for her’s tomorrow.’ But prosecutor Philippe Courroye said he did not believe any of Griffin’s versions of events, saying the case was a classic one of ‘violence against women’. The body of Kinga Legg (pictured) was found in the bath of the couple’s £1,000-a-night room at the five-star Bristol Hotel in Paris, after Griffin, who claimed it was an accident, fled to England in his Porsche 911 . He also dismissed suggestions that Griffin, a confessed love cheat, was a successful businessman, saying he had ‘no official income’ and lived off his girlfriends and wealthy parents. Pointing to Griffin sitting a few feet away, with his crutches beside him and claiming to be seriously ill, Mr Courroye said: ‘He is trying to fool you. He lies to everyone. ‘Through his lies, he kills for a second time.The intention of homicide is obvious’. Griffin, originally from Warrington in Cheshire, said he had gone into a ‘black hole’ of memory loss caused by alcohol and anti-depressants. But Mr Courroye said on the final day of his murder trial: ‘There were more than 100 bruises, 17 on the skull, 33 on the chest. They ranged from the face to the feet. Griffin, who is originally from Warrington, Cheshire, said he went into ‘black hole’ of memory loss caused by alcohol and anti-depressants . Griffin has been living freely on bail for the past year-and-a-half with Miss Baker, herself an entrepreneur who appeared on the Dragon’s Den TV show this year. Above, the couple outside court before sentencing today . ‘If there were so many injuries, it is because he wanted to kill her. The autopsy revealed the power of the blows. It was a martyred body.’ Griffin has been living freely on bail for the past year-and-a-half with Miss Baker, herself an entrepreneur who appeared on the Dragon’s Den TV show this year. Both have portrayed Miss Legg, a wealthy Polish businesswoman who was earning more than a quarter of a million pounds year, as a violent alcoholic who regularly attacked Griffin. Miss Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald’s, Tesco and Carrefour. Mr Courroye said there was ‘ongoing violence’ between Griffin and Miss Legg. He said Griffin was a ‘kind of gigolo’ who relied on his wealthy parents for money, as well as his girlfriends. A tearful Miss Baker (left) was also in court, saying she ‘broke into a million pieces’ when she heard the businessman’s fiancée had been found dead – but her main concern was for Griffin (right) Mr Courroye rubbished claims that Griffin’s memory had ‘disappeared into a black hole’ at the time of Miss Legg’s death. ‘It is impossible to believe this state of amnesia, this savage aggression,’ said Mr Courroye. Referring to Griffin trying to clean up the crime scene, before booking another two nights in the room, and then escaping, Mr Courroye said: ‘Is Ian Griffin mad? Is he incoherent? ‘Is he panicking? No, he wants to buy time, he wants to put distance between him and the crime scene. This organisation shows coherence to his thoughts.’ Mr Courroye said there was no possibility of Griffin’s heavy drinking being used as an excuse for the murder. The five-star Bristol Hotel in Paris, where Griffin murdered Kinga Legg in May 2009. The couple had been on their way to Monaco where they planned to marry, but Griffin was seeing another girlfriend at the time . ‘Alcohol is not a reason for excluding criminal responsibility,’ he said. ‘On the contrary, in law it is usually an aggravating circumstance.’ The prosecutor called on the jury not to reduce Griffin’s sentence due to his vulnerable image, saying it was all a show. A tearful Miss Baker was also in court, saying she ‘broke into a million pieces’ when she heard the businessman’s fiancée had been found dead – but her main concern was for him. She portrayed her love rival as a violent, jealous, depressive who had once tried to stab Griffin with a knife, and punched him in the head while wearing a ring. After fleeing the scene of the crime in May 2009, Griffin reached Britain and then he went into hiding for five days before being arrested. He was finally extradited to France in 2011. Then, in a controversial move which infuriated Miss Legg’s family, Griffin was released on bail in March last year, and renewed his relationship with Miss Baker. Griffin’s parents, Bernard, an architect, and Janet, an interior designer, were in court for the sentencing.","Ian Griffin was tonight sentenced to 20 years in prison for savage murder .

"China plans to finally end the controversial practice of systematically harvesting the organs of executed prisoners for use in transplant operations, it has been reported. The Government has over the last year flagged plans to end the practice, which has drawn criticism from rights groups, who have accused authorities of taking many organs without consent from prisoners or their families, a claim Beijing has denied. The official China Daily said that human organ transplants . will rely on voluntary public donations and on donations from living relatives from January 1.

'Donations by the public should be the only . source of organs for transplants.' Supply of human organs falls far short of demand in China, . due in part to a traditional belief that bodies should be buried . or cremated intact.

"Reeva Steenkamp never had sex with Oscar Pistorius during their three-month relationship and was about to leave the disgraced athlete on the night he shot her dead, her mother has claimed. Pistorius previously told his murder trial that the couple were planning a life together, but June Steenkamp says she has 'no doubt in her mind' that her daughter wanted to end their romance. Mrs Steenkamp also believes the model refused to sleep with the Paralympian because she had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'. 'They'd shared a bed, but she was scared to take the relationship to that level … She wouldn't want to sleep with Oscar if she wasn't sure,' she said in an interview with The Times Magazine yesterday. Scroll down for video . June Steenkamp, pictured with her husband, thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts' about her compatibility with Pistorius before she was shot dead . She said: 'I believe their relationship was coming to an end. In her heart of hearts, she didn't think it was making either of them happy.' In her book, titled Reeva: A Mother's Story, Mrs Steenkamp describes Pistorius, 27, as a 'pathetic figure'. She writes in her book: 'Her clothes were packed. There is no doubt in our minds: she had decided to leave Oscar that night. 'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that.' Mrs Steenkamp said she he did not believe Oscar Pistorius' story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed he shot Reeva (left) thinking she was an intruder . They have sat through an agonising seven-month trial, but June and her husband Barry said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as the 'Blade Runner' could be out in 10 months. Mrs Steenkamp, 68, said she did not believe the athlete's story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed  he shot Reeva thinking she was an intruder. In a separate extract serialised in The Times2 Magazine today, Mrs Steenkamp describes her shock and disbelief when the judge found him not guilty of murder. 'My heart continued to beat, but I didn't feel alive,' she wrote. 'It was the worst of double whammies - to lose our daughter and then to see her violent death deemed an accident.' She also told how her husband Barry suffered a stroke one morning after breakfast while reading a newspaper article about their daughter's death two months after she was shot. She said: 'He became delirious. He couldn't speak and one side of his face collapsed. We rushed him to the doctor, who discovered a blood clot on his brain.' But she says she has 'forgiven him in the Christian sense', adding that she didn't want to 'carry poison in my body'. Her parents have a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot, pictured as a toddler (left) and during a family Christmas . She also has 'no hate in my heart' for the athlete's family, whom she says were 'in as much pain as I am.' The couple are both are haunted by a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot. Another extract from Mrs Steenkamp's book focuses on the athlete's public apology during the televised trial. 'It was an extraordinary moment. You could cut the atmosphere in the courtroom with a knife: silence, but for the sound of journalists tapping on their screens. It put me in an awkward position. 'Why decide to say sorry to me in a televised trial in front of the whole world? I was unmoved by his apology. 'I felt if I appeared to be sorry for him at this stage of his trial on the charge of premeditated murder, it would in the eyes of others lessen the awfulness of what he had done. 'He was in the box trying to save his own skin after he had killed my daughter and I was sitting in that courtroom wanting to hear the factual truth.' The model (centre) with her brother Adam and mother June (right) who has written about her daughter's death in her book titled: Reeva: A Mother's Story . Pistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility' Miss Steenkamp's parents said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth . The five-year sentence given to the double amputee athlete has been criticised by some as too lenient. But Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge'. They said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth. Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled the state had failed to prove Pistorius knew it was Reeva when he opened fire through the locked toilet door of his apartment in Pretoria. Throughout the trial, he said he mistook his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. 'He said pulling the trigger was 'an accident'. What? Four times an accident?' Mrs Steenkamp said in her book. 'He said Reeva did not scream, but she would definitely have screamed. I know my daughter and she was very vocal.' Pistorius, who the court heard has no income and no property after selling it during the trial, was driven away in a police van with barred windows after his sentencing on Tuesday. He is being held in the hospital section of a prison in Pretoria. Mrs Steenkamp's book is to be published on November 6.

"Much has changed in the past 20 years, but one thing that hasn't is Paris's knack for perplexing the visitor. Last Tuesday, tourists who had journeyed tens of thousands of miles from rural China, urban Brazil or remote Australia to absorb the wonders of the Louvre museum found only one marvel for their delectation: a closed sign. On Tuesdays, for reasons best known to itself, the Louvre takes the day off (most major Paris attractions close on either Monday or Tuesday). Last month Beyoncé and Jay Z paid good money to have the Louvre entirely to themselves for a visit with their daughter Blue Ivy (a Mona Lisa selfie was their highlight). Maybe they should simply have tried to sneak in on a Tuesday - they'd have saved themselves a lot of loot. This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Eurostar high-speed rail service between London and Paris . A crowning glory: The Louvre Museum is more accessible thanks to the Eurostar. Just don't go on a Tuesday . And in the area of dining out, Paris also continues to march to the beat of its own drum. In most countries in the world these days, any visitor to a capital city can bank on enjoying a meal whenever the mood takes them. Not in Paris: bars, brasseries, restaurants and cafes dish out food only when the mood takes them. Best of luck if you're looking for a meal before 7.30pm. This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Eurostar high-speed rail service between London and Paris, which can take as little as two hours 15 minutes. I find that especially extraordinary because I travelled on the very first service (along with a carriage load of Mail on Sunday readers). A changing of the guard: The Eurostar terminal has helped to revitalise London's grand old St Pancras station . Jeffrey Archer - a fellow passenger - may know a thing or two about writing bestsellers, but when it came to using a French payphone he was absolutely hopeless. One of my abiding memories of travelling on that inaugural Eurostar service on November 14, 1994 was standing with Lord Archer on the concourse at Gare du Nord, and having to show him how to make a phone call home. 'Merci, merci,' he kept saying to me, clearly labouring under the misapprehension I was a helpful local (there may well be helpful locals in Paris, but I've yet to meet one!). Back to the source: Frank Barrett travelled on the first Eurostar service in November 1994 (left); Paris's excellent Picasso Museum (right) has just reopened in the Marais district after five years of refurbishment . There were other 'celebs' on the train but the only other one I can recall was the late Jeremy Beadle. In truth the launch of Eurostar was a bit of a damp squib. The service should have begun in May that year but had to be delayed. Its inaugural journey took place in the same week as the start of the National Lottery (and shortly after peace broke out in Northern Ireland, further eclipsing the Channel Tunnel). Looking back, one might have expected the incredible engineering achievement of the Tunnel - for the first time linking the UK with the Continent - to have hogged the headlines. The sudden prospect of peace and people like you and me becoming instant millionaires proved rather more thrilling to news editors, however. Full speed ahead: The advent of the Eurostar service means that London and Paris are not just two hours apart . Iconic: Paul Day's St Pancras sculpture 'The Meeting Place' is now a recognisable part of a Eurostar journey . And over the past 20 years the Channel Tunnel has never captured the hearts of the British public in the way, for example, that another Anglo-French project did: Concorde. Both were money pits but while Concorde (about £1billion) proved an enormous commercial flop, the Channel Tunnel (about £5billion) has, albeit only in recent years, been more of a success. By the time I travelled on the inaugural service, I had already been through the Tunnel, travelling twice on a 'preview' of the clumsily titled Le Shuttle service for cars. And a few years before the start of passenger rail services, I had been through the Tunnel when it was just a hole in the ground. Invited by Eurotunnel's commercial director, Christopher Garnett, to join the then Transport Minister Roger Freeman on an unprecedented adventure, we descended to the Tunnel entrance in Folkestone via a lift. Exclusive access: Beyonce and Jay-Z were in Paris last month, and paid for a private viewing at the Louvre . At the bottom we climbed aboard a primitive workman's train for a slow ride through what was to become the service tunnel. At the halfway point, we reached a padlocked gate that marked the frontier between Britain and France. Someone was on hand to unlock it: here we left the British train to board a French one which continued to Sangatte, where a lift took us back up to the surface for a hovercraft ride home. I had seen the future of travel to the Continent and it worked. Apres moi, I might have said, le deluge. Who could fail to be excited by this major advance in foreign travel? Sadly, rather a lot of people. In pre-steam days 200 years ago, getting from London to Paris was an uncertain business: a journey that could be counted in days rather than hours. If the wind was really playing up, you wouldn't get to France at all. Even the introduction of steam ships in the mid-19th Century didn't make the journey much better. A long train journey from London, a longer rail trip on the other side of the Channel. In the post-Second World War era, the first class Golden Arrow Rail Service from Victoria to Paris took at least six hours, often much longer. That hardly compares with Eurostar's St Pancras to Gare du Nord in just over two hours. A towering attraction: Parisian sights such as the Eiffel Tower are now within day-trip range of London . My first trip to France in 1962 was on a worn-out car ferry from Dover to Dunkirk. I fell in love with Paris on that visit and, over the years, while having had plenty of reasons to abandon the relationship (the worst public row I have ever had in my life was with a ticket seller at the Louvre), I have remained steadfast. In truth, Paris has had its share of ups and downs in the past 50 years. The city began a period of reinvention with the opening of the Pompidou Centre, followed by a vigorous period of reconstruction leading up to the 200th anniversary of the Republic in 1989, which saw the building of the famous Louvre pyramid, the opening of the Musee d'Orsay and the Arche de la Defense. And the city had pointed the way towards urban regeneration with the redevelopment of Les Halles. After this frantic rebuilding, it seemed that Paris ran out of steam. During the past 20 years, it is London that has been the hotbed of reconstruction and redevelopment - including that shining star for Eurostar passengers: St Pancras. John Lewis boss Andy Street spoke an uncomfortable truth when he described France as 'a country in decline' and called the Gare du Nord 'the squalor pit of Europe'. The Paris Metro system 20 years ago felt modern and efficient; today it seems chaotic and a bit seedy. But contrary to Mr Street's view, Paris is showing many signs of recovery. Always a pleasure: Paris may not have changed much in the last 20 years - but its scenery hardly needs to . New hotels are opening at a pace - including the Shangri-La, Peninsula, Raffles, Royal Monceau, Mandarin Oriental. (The Plaza Athenee recently reopened, while two old favourites, the Crillon and the Ritz, are currently undergoing lavish refurbishments). After a five-year closure, the city's Picasso Museum has reopened. Also open again is the modern art collection of the Palais de Tokyo, a stone's-throw from the Eiffel Tower, which is celebrating its new (underwhelming) glass floor. Much more impressive is Frank Gehry's wonderful Louis Vuitton art gallery, which has opened in the Bois de Boulogne. Paris's charm, however, lies in its small things. The main one is that it is a place of manageable proportions. Paris has just two million people, a quarter the size of London. It's estimated that at any one time, for every Parisian you'll see on the streets, there are three tourists. Because of its size, you can walk everywhere: from the Pompidou Centre to the Eiffel Tower is about three miles - a stroll of less than an hour. Your walk will take longer because, inevitably, you will be sidetracked by a shop, a bar, a cafe or a marker explaining the history of a site you are passing. Twenty years ago, leaving Jeffrey Archer to his phone call, I jumped in a taxi and travelled the short distance to Montmartre and gazed across the city from the Sacre-Coeur. I was probably the first person ever to have enjoyed this view after travelling from London all the way by train. That sense of excitement has never gone away. I encourage you to discover it for yourself. Eurostar (www.eurostar.com, 08432 186186) offers return fares to Paris from £69 per person.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has released details of the video in which one of two accused terrorists made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers'. Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, were arrested in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield, western Sydney, on Tuesday afternoon, where a police raid allegedly uncovered a machete, a hunting knife, an Islamic State flag and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats of carrying out an attack. During Question Time in parliament on Thursday, Mr Abbott said he was shown the video during his security briefing with the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and the Director-General of ASIO this morning. 'Madam Speaker, kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him one of those arrested said this: ""I swear to almighty Allah, we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia,"" he said. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (right), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24 (left), were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield on Tuesday . Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim Al-Jaafari (left) shakes hands with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday. Al-Jaafari is in Australia to give a first-hand update on the battle against Islamic State . 'He went on to say, Madam Speaker, ""I swear to almighty Allah, blonde people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We owe you only stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks"". Mr Abbott made the comments while arguing that the parliament should pass the government's proposed further changes to data retention laws. This comes after social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives on Wednesday revealed he was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery. Pictures of Mohammad Kiad on his Facebook page show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces. However in person, the 25-year-old nurse who worked as a removalist has been described as a quiet man who never mentioned his religion, according to Fairfax. Both men  arrived in Australia from the Middle East seeking a better life as refugees but allegedly became radicalised in recent months, it has been claimed. On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court. Kiad popped up on screens at Central Local Court by audio visual link from Silverwater prison, where he is being held with his co-accused, Iraqi-born Omar al-Kutobi, in western Sydney. He was dressed in prison greens, wore glasses and his beard was trimmed close to his face. Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements . Bail applications by both men were set aside on a farcical day of hearings at Central when a power blackout and then a computer failure delayed proceedings. Mohammad Kiad's name was read out by the Commonwealth prosecutor and he was brought into the audio visual room at Silverwater prison by mistake. Deone Provera, a solicitor assisting Legal Aid in the two men's representation, did not require either man's appearance. Mr Provera had their release applications set down for March16. Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told the Today Show on Thursday Kiad, from Kuwait, and Al-Kutobi, from Iraq, were granted refugee status. Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse after he arrived in Australia by plane in 2009. The Daily Telegraph alleges a senior intelligence source has confirmed he arrived in the country with false documentation. A keen weight-lifter, the 25-year-old removalist also shared selfies of himself at the gym . Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. Mr Dutton told the Today Show: 'We've stopped the boats now and we need to make sure they remain stopped.’ However, Today Show host Karl Stefanovic pointed out: 'This guy came by plane though.’ Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday: 'Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL (IS) flag, with the knife and machete, making a politically-motivated statement, threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons.' A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny  pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . Pictures of the duo from mid-2013 show them poking faces and smoking shisha together. Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job. While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin. Pictured smoking shisha in mid-2013: The mens' neighbours said they mostly kept to themselves but admitted their behaviour had changed drastically in the last few months following police raids in western Sydney and the Martin Place siege . 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.' Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police. On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court.

"Voters could be forced to show their passport or driving licence to help prevent fraud . Photographic ID should be made compulsory in polling stations across the country, Britain’s elections watchdog warns today. The Electoral Commission says the rest of the UK should follow the lead of Northern Ireland, where voters have long been required to prove their identity before they can cast their ballot. The watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so-called ‘personation’ fraud, where an individual pretends to be someone else in order to use their vote. It calls for a change in the law to ensure the new system is introduced by 2019 ‘at the latest’. But sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who is in charge of electoral reform, last night said he was against the idea as it risked creating a system of ID cards by the back door. Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Clegg rejected a call from Tory MP Nick de Bois to introduce voter identification cards. He said the introduction of individual voter registration - which requires voters to provide details such as their date of birth and National Insurance numbers - would ‘stamp out the problems of fraud’. A source said: ‘We don’t believe that to vote in this country you should need an ID card. We are part of a Government that scrapped ID cards - this is slightly different, but it is not a million miles off.’ Individual voter registration replaces the traditional system where the head of the household was responsible for registering all members of the household. But the Electoral Commission warns that by tightening up on postal ballot fraud, the new system could make Britain ‘more vulnerable’ to personation fraud. ‘Polling station voting in Great Britain remains vulnerable to personation fraud because there are currently few checks available to prevent someone claiming to be an elector and voting in their name,’ the report says. The watchdog says the move is an essential step in tackling so-called ¿personation¿ fraud at polling stations . ‘This part of the system could become more vulnerable to fraud as other processes (including electoral registration and postal or proxy voting) become more secure.’ The watchdog says voters should be required to show their passport or driving licence at the polling station before they are permitted to vote. Those without either document would be eligible for a free ‘electoral identity card’. Toby James, an electoral expert at the University of East Anglia, said introducing ID requirements would lead to lower turnout, with many voters not wanting the hassle. Dr James said: ‘Requirements to produce passports and other forms of identification may sound reasonable enough, but they will have unintended consequences. 'They stop people voting. Imagine this scenario. You decide to vote on the way back from work. But after a busy day you realise that you forgot your passport. What do you do? Head back home, collect your passport and then vote? The answer for many citizens would be head home and stay there. That extra time is the difference between voting and not voting.’ Dr James said more evidence was needed about the extent of electoral fraud before such a major change is made. The Electoral Commission said there was little evidence that introducing voter ID reduced turnout.","Electoral Commission says rest of UK should follow Northern Ireland .

"Thomas Cook has come under fire after it emerged that a group of injured servicemen were denied access to aisle chairs and assistance from crew during a recent flight. War hero Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs and suffered a devastating brain injury from a bomb blast in Afghanistan, was among a group of fellow injured forces personnel on the flight from Paphos last Sunday. Parkinson is an ambassador for military charity Pilgrim Bandits, who revealed that a Thomas Cook crew member told them it was 'not my problem' when asked why there were no disabled assistance on board the aircraft. Injured servicemen from military charity Pilgrim Bandits were denied wheelchair use on a Thomas Cook flight . Ben Parkinson was among those who were unable to access to the bathroom on a four-hour flight . In an angry post on Facebook, Pilgrim Bandits wrote: 'ThomasCookUK 1st officer's arrogant reply on flight back from Paphos on Sunday to why there was no wheelchair on board for any disabled to use the toilet ""It's not my problem, thank you for flying Thomas Cook"".' Pilgrim Bandits was established in 2007 by Special Forces veterans who aim to use their'unique training and experience to help and inspire wounded soldiers to live life to the full.' Paratrooper Parkinson, who was awarded an MBE for his charity work, was returning from a Forces Families Rest and Recuperation break in Cyprus with the group, which included five injured servicemen. With no aisle chair, a wheelchair specially constructed to fit down aircraft aisles, on board, the injured servicemen were unable to use the bathroom facilities for the duration of the four and half hour flight. The Thomas Cook website clearly states its policy on special assistance for reduced mobility passengers, which includes: 'Assistance moving to and from seats on the aircraft, providing use of the on-board wheelchair, helping a passenger to and from the on-board lavatory providing this does not involve lifting or carrying the passenger, assisting a passenger with their hand luggage on board the aircraft.' Apology: Thomas Cook have apologised for the incident and have launched an investigation . War hero: Parkinson, who lost his legs and suffered a brain injury in Afghanistan, was awarded an MBE for his charity work . Following a meeting between a Thomas Cook representative and the military charity, the two are now working together to ensure the incident is not repeated. 'We have received an unreserved apology from Thomas Cook,' a spokesperson for Pilgrim Bandits told MailOnline Travel. 'Following a personal visit from the company’s head of customer complaints Pilgrim Bandits will now be working with Thomas Cook to ensure disabled facilities are provided on every aircraft.' A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told MailOnline Travel: 'We’d like to sincerely apologise to Mr Parkinson and his family and assure them that Thomas Cook Airlines takes its responsibilities to disabled customers very seriously - we immediately launched a full investigation into the issues raised by Mr Parkinson about his flight this weekend and we are contacting him as a matter of urgency.'

"Don't let that huggable exterior fool you. Underneath that furry frame their lies a bear with an attitude – just ask poor Mary Anne Forster. The South Australia woman was out walking her two dogs two weeks ago when they pulled her toward a koala near the bottom of a tree. But instead of nonchalantly ignoring her as is usually the case, this killer koala attacked the two dogs, with Forster getting caught up between them. Scroll down for video . Mary Anne Forster's bloodied leg after the koala attack . Forster said she had to pry the koala's jaw open with her hands . People should be wary of koalas especially when walking their dogs . 7News Adelaide reported that the koala snapped its jaws on to Forster's left leg and would not let go, causing a bite that required 12 stitches. It was only after she prised her fingers into its mouth that it released its grip. “Obviously the koala felt very threatened because it attached itself with its mouth, jaws, to my leg and bit very hard, bit very deeply,” she told 7News. Forster shows the scar that was left after the koala's bite . She then hobbled 2km home with her terrified pooches before finally being admitted to hospital. She ended up with a swollen and painful foot, but luckily it did not get infected.

"They're peddling porn to get bums on seats by giving away a 'free ticket' to their productions with every sale of an erotic magazine, but the all-women Spanish theatre group say it's the only way to combat a sales tax that is driving people away from the stage. After getting hold of around 300 erotic magazines Primas de Riesgo, or Risk Premium, registered as a porn distributor earlier this year. With the sales tax on porn less than a fifth of that on plays, they now give a 'free ticket' to their production of 'The Prodigious Magician' with every 16 Euro (£12.50) porn magazine they sell. The all-women Primas de Riesgo theatre group registered as a porn distributor earlier this year. Members of the audience are given a free ticket for shows when they buy a pornographic magazine to get around a sales tax hike . The group's director Karina Garantiva said it was immoral that magazine sales taxes stood at four percent, while duty on theatre tickets stands at 21 percent . The Spanish government raised sales taxes in 2012 in a bid to rein in the public deficit. Within a year audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million across Spain . The group hopes the Spanish government will lower the sales tax on tickets to 10 percent . 'If the sales tax changes, we will suspend our campaign. If not, we will pursue this until the end,' the group's director, 34-year-old Karina Garantiva told the AFP. 'We are either part of the problem or part of the solution. We shouldn't complain, we should work to change it.' Audiences at cultural events have slumped since Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government raised sales tax on tickets to films, plays and concerts from eight percent to 21 percent in September 2012. In the first 12 months after it took effect audiences fell from 13.1 million to 9.3 million, a 29 percent decline, according to figures from Spain's National Federation of Theatre and Dance Business Associations (FAETEDA). 'It's a real state of emergency,' said Jesus Cimarro, a Madrid theatre producer who heads the association. But in its bid to rein in the public deficit and rocketing unemployment, the government did not raise the sales tax on magazines, which remained at four percent, allowing Primas de Riesgo to take advantage of the loophole. 'We want people to ask what kind of a society makes this kind of decision. That they compare pornography and Calderon, who is Spain's Shakespeare, and reach their own conclusions,' said Garantiva. Pointing out that the sales tax in neighbouring France and Germany is only a fraction of the Spanish cost, the group has called the government to reduce the sales tax on theatre tickets to 10 percent, the same rate as in Italy, which is also under pressure to reduce its public deficit. But lawmakers have argued that the sales tax hike on theatre tickets is needed to balance the public accounts and has shown no sign that it is willing to lower it. Critics have also questioned the morality of distributing pornography alongside a classic Spanish playwright, but Garantiva hit back. 'What is immoral is not that women distribute porn magazines,' she said. 'But that the government offers subsidies to these publications and not to its cultural heritage.'","Primas de Riesgo registered as a porn distribution company this year .

"Anne Lakey, 54, has been charged with seven counts of indecent assault . An acclaimed headteacher has been charged with indecently assaulting a boy 25 years ago. Anne Lakey, 54, was lauded nationally for her work as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools after overseeing the biggest improvement in GCSE results in the country. She has been charged with seven counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16 said to have occurred between July 1989 and May 1990. Noelle Brockbank, Senior Crown Prosecutor at CPS North East, said: 'The decision was made in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.' Lakey will appear at Consett Magistrates' Court on December 18. The Durham Federation of Schools includes Durham Community Business College, in Ushaw Moor, and Fyndoune Community College, in Sacriston. Fyndoune has previously been named the country's most improved secondary school after the number of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs, including maths and English, rose from 26% to 80%. Both colleges were judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted school inspectors in 2011. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Chief Inspector of Schools, praised the head's 'inspiring leadership'.

"British Isis terrorist Jihadi John may be using a body double in a bid to fool military drones, according to new analysis of the video showing the murder of  Syrian officers and pilots and the decapitated head of Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig. It also appears to suggest that Kassig fought his captors before he was beheaded. In a horrifying video of the mass murder of Syrian soldiers and the American aid worker, Jihadi John appears with his face hidden, as usual - but analysts have discovered a single frame in which another man, visible for less than half a second, can been seen wearing a balaclava. British Isis terrorist Jihadi John (right) may be using a body double in a bid to fool military drones, according to new analysis of the video showing the murder of Peter Abdul-Rahman Kassig (left) They have speculated that he could be a decoy being used by Isis to lure drones away from Jihadi John. Veryan Khan, editorial director with the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC), which studied the video for over a week with Quilliam, the British anti-extremist think-tank, told The Telegraph: ‘It could be a body double or a decoy. I'm not trying to say I know the answer, but his shape and size are very similar.’ A spokesman for Quilliam told MailOnline that the other figure may also be someone other than Jihadi John, who is leading the slaughter. The teams examining the footage also discovered a large bruise above Mr Kassig’s left eye, which may have resulted from a struggle with the fanatics before he was killed. The fact that he was not shown reading a scripted message out is also evidence that he was defiant to the last. It could be that he knew his execution was coming and denied his captors the satisfaction of repeating their words on camera. Lasting 15 minutes and 53 seconds, the video – titled ‘Although the disbelievers dislike it’ – starts with a documentary-style history of Islamic State since the invasion of Iraq by western allies in 2003. There are scenes of bombings, summary executions and graphic video footage of dead civilians lying in the streets. It also shows what appears to be a dead child lying on a bed covered in blood. In the next clip, filmed in the desert, the self-declared murderer known as Jihadi John is seen leading a line of Syrian troops to their deaths. A few paces behind him – and in the middle of a 16-strong line of Islamist jihadists said to be from over six countries - is the man believed to be Nasser . Unsettling: The video also shows the mass murder of Syrian military personnel by beheading led by Jihadi John at a desert location. Unlike the murder of Western hostages, the killing of the Syrians is shown in full . Bloodthirsty: The video shows in full graphic detail how the militants saw the heads off their victims . Muthana, a 20-year-old from Cardiff. Like the other jihadists he is unmasked. John however keeps to his habit of showing only his eyes. Muthana clutches the scruff of the neck of a Syrian soldier, whose hands are bound with plastic ties. But while the other militants have expressionless faces – this young bearded man looks menacingly into the distance. Taking the lead from John and those in the line before him, he brandishes a military knife taken from a box of weapons. The chilling sound of a blade being drawn can be heard above the sound of Islamic music in the background. The prisoners are not wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits, as in previous videos, but are dressed in black trousers and shirts. Humanitarian: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the 26-year-old former Army Ranger, was committed to aid work . John, who has leather shoulder holsters for hand guns and a balaclava-style mask, takes centre stage. His appearance would seem to confirm his seniority and status as ‘chief executioner’ of Islamic State. The man thought to be Muthana stands to his right. John delivers his message to America and Britain before an eerie silence during which the camera zooms in on the faces of the killers, who remain impassive throughout. The scene then focuses on John – who begins to cut his prisoner’s neck – quelling suspicion that he himself did not actually perform the previous beheadings. Unlike the apparent murders of Western hostages, in which the camera cuts away at the moment their throats are cut, the killings of the soldiers are shown in full. The camera zooms in on Jihadi John and his victim who, in his final agonising moments, closes his eyes. John then looks threateningly into the camera while still holding the knife. The next clip shows a knife slicing into the necks of Syrian soldiers followed by a stream of blood that turns the sand red. The image after that shows the soldiers’ heads on top of their bent-over bodies. The mass beheading is a new departure because previous mass executions have been undertaken using guns. The fact that John’s accomplices revealed their identities suggests they have no intention of returning to their home countries. A caption refers to them as ‘hungry lions whose drink is blood and play is carnage’. Family and friends of Mr Kassig were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the Muslim community at a memorial service Sunday. The former Army Ranger, who was 26 at the time of his death, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University two days after his funeral services. 'We're not here because of how he passed,' said Hazem Bata, executive director Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield. 'We're because of how he lived. We're here because of the type of man he chose to be. We're here because of his selflessness.' Kassig landed in the hands of ISIS extremists last year while delivering aid to Syrians caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war. At the time he was working as part of Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping. His parents learned of his capture last year, though the information was not made public at the time. When Kassig appeared in a beheading video of a British aid worker, his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to ISIS militants. Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name from Peter during his time in captivity, inspired the Muslim community to come to his family's side. Peter Kassig is pictured while working as an aid worker in Syria before his capture. His murder is not actually shown in the latest film and he does not deliver a final message as other hostages have .","Analysts discover man in balaclava in Isis' mass beheading video .

"Dutch authorities have begun slaughtering 150,000 chickens after a highly contagious strain of bird flu was found at a huge poultry farm. The component, named H5N8, is the same strain discovered in Germany earlier this month which also led to mass poultry culls in Asia. Agricultural inspectors began destroying animals today at the farm in Hekendorp, Utrecht, following reports of an outbreak. Authorities have begun a mass poultry cull at a chicken farm in the village of Hekendorp, in the Dutch province Utrecht, following an outbreak of the highly contagious virus . While the farm sells eggs rather than poultry, produce is sold across the Netherlands and in parts of Germany. A spokesman however insisted there was 'absolutely nothing wrong' with produce that has already been exported. Authorities have imposed a 72-hour ban on transporting all poultry products in light of the outbreak, with a country-wide ban on hunting also in place. Farms within a 16km radius of the Hekendorp site have been told to refrain from hunting or exporting produce for 30 days. 'It's a highly pathogenic strain for birds,' a spokesman for the Dutch economics ministry said of the virus. 'For people it's not that dangerous: you'd only get it if you were in very close contact with the birds.' An outbreak of H5N8 saw millions of farm birds slaughtered across South Korea, Japan and China. The strain had not been reported in Europe until November 4 when inspectors discovered the virus at a farm in Germany. Agricultural inspectors were seen at the farm today. Reports of the outbreak come as cases of the same highly contagious strain were found in Germany earlier this month . A 30-day ban on transporting poultry produce is in place for farms within a 16km radius of the site . In March some 10,000 chickens were destroyed after bird flu was found at a farm in the Dutch province of Gelderland. Today's developments are the first signs of the highly contagious H5 or H7 strains in the past 10 years. In September, Russia reported the first cases of H5N1, another dangerous strain, in nearly two years. A 2004 outbreak of bird flu in Asia claimed 24 lives. Symptoms among humans are similar to those of an ordinary flu and include a high temperature, vomiting and aching joints. Earlier this year Japan was placed on bird flu alert following reports of the deadly H5N1 virus at a poultry farm. Health workers wore boiler suits and protective shoes and face masks to dispose of some 100,000 chickens in fear of an outbreak. While officials insisted there was no cause for human concern when eating cooked chicken or eggs, this particular strain of the virus is considered more dangerous than others which present themselves in typical flu-like symptoms. There are numerous forms of bird flu, or avian influenza, which can be contracted by humans. While most bear no serious health risks, H5 and H7 strains can be deadly for those who contract them. H5N1 and H7N9 are thought to pose the most serious danger. Within days of contracting the flu, potentially fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may develop. In July last year the World Health Organisation revealed more than 600 people had died after contracting H5N1 across the world. Forty-three people were killed by H7N9. The virus cannot be contracted by eating cooked meat or eggs that have come from infected birds, only through close and prolonged contact with an infected animal. Of those who have died from the virus, the majority have been middle-aged to elderly men across Asia. Health workers put on protective boots in boiler suits to destroy thousands of contaminated birds in Japan .","Highly contagious strain of virus discovered at large poultry farm .

"A woman has won compensation for sexual harassment after a work Christmas party went terribly, terribly wrong. A court heard that victim’s female manager repeatedly requested that she take part in a lesbian threesome, propositioning the employee on several occasions – including the 2011 office Christmas party. The victim was working at the café at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, ‘Connect Café’ as the supervisor when the sexual advances began. She was harassed by her manager, who told the victim that ‘her breasts were nice’ before lifting her shirt in front of the employee. The victim alleges that four deeply concerning sexual harassment incidents took place. A woman has won compensation for sexual harassment after the victim’s female manager repeatedly requested that she take part in a lesbian threesome, propositioning the employee on several occasions . The victim worked at the café at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital as the supervisor . The victim and her husband both gave evidence of the manager’s suggestive and inappropriate behaviour, explaining that it offended the victim and made her uncomfortable. The court heard that nine days before the Christmas party, the offending woman repeatedly told the victim ‘I’m not wearing any undies’. Whilst the victim drove her manager to the work function at Brisbane’s Stamford Hotel on that date, the passenger said words to the effect of, ‘I’m sitting in your leather seats with no undies on.’ Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal member, Ann Fitzpatrick, found that the interaction regarding the defendant’s underwear was ‘not sexual harassment’ as it was light-hearted and in a group context. A woman has won $9000 in compensation for sexual harassment after a work Christmas party went terribly, terribly wrong . It’s claimed that soon after, the manager began to bully the employee, acting in an ‘aggressive and abusive’ manner after her sexual advances had been rejected. The tribunal also found that Queensland Health inadequately dealt with the victim’s complaints, ‘poorly investigating’ her claims of sexual and workplace harassment. The offending manager and Queensland Health have been ordered to jointly pay the employee $9000 in compensation. The employee was seeking $80,000 to $100,000 in damages for the ‘hurt and humiliation’ she suffered. The court heard that nine days before the Christmas party, the offending woman repeatedly told the victim ‘I’m not wearing any undies’ A tribunal also found that the female victim is suffering from ‘psychological injury’ as a result of the harassment, which took place at the 2011 work Christmas party at Brisbane’s Paddington Tavern. The employee suffered so badly from the incident, as well as from her manager’s ‘aggressive and abusive management’, that she was forced to quit. Queensland Health made submissions to claim that victim’s harassment claims were a ploy to ‘deflect from her own poor work performance.’ The tribunal also found that Queensland Health inadequately dealt with the victim’s complaints, ‘poorly investigating’ her claims of sexual and workplace harassment .","A female employee was repeatedly propositioned by her female manager .

"The bloodthirsty killers of Islamic State are trying to ‘hijack’ the Arab world and ‘drag us back to the Dark Ages’ through social media, Queen Rania of Jordan believes. During a powerful address to the Abu Dhabi Media Summit in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the 44-year-old monarch spoke out against the horror videos of decapitated prisoners being promoted by ISIS on Twitter and Facebook. 'A minority of irreligious extremists is using social media to rewrite our narrative and hijack our identity,' Queen Rania said. 'That's what ISIS is doing to the Arab world and all of us'. Scroll down for video . Powerful: Queen Rania told the Abu Dhabi Media Summit that 'a minority of irreligious extremists is using social media to rewrite our narrative and hijack our identity' Anger: The monarch, 44, said that the images that ISIS promote on social media should make every Arab 'seethe' and warned moderates who are silent on the issue are complicit in ISIS' success . Hatred: Rania said that beating ISIS with 'a bullet' was not enough. She explained how Osama Bin Laden was killed, but supporters of his ideology fight on . Referring specifically to the videos of beheadings, the Queen said: 'These images don't represent me anymore than they represent you. 'They’re alien and abhorrent to the vast majority of Arabs – Muslims and Christians. And they should make every Arab across this region seethe. 'Because they're an attack on our values as a people and on our collective story. This is their version of the Arab world’s story, their plot, their narrative, their heroes, and the rest of the world is listening and watching.' Queen Rania also said the 'silence' of moderate Arabs made them complicit in ISIS' success, adding: ‘At the heart of the assault is an ideology.‘And if you think you can defeat an ideology with a bullet, think of what happened when Osama Bin Laden was killed.' Queen Rania explained: ‘Sure he died, but his legacy is an even stronger, more twisted extremist movement.’ 'We must create a new narrative and broadcast it to the world. Because if we don’t decide what our identity is and what our legacy will be, the extremists will do it for us.' Queen Rania urged people in the region to post their own positive 'profile picture of our Arab world' on social media sites. Primitive: Images such as these, which shows the mass beheading of Syrian soldiers by Jihadi John and his execution squad throw the image of the Arab world 'back to the Dark Ages' She also highlighted education and job creation as being the key to thwarting the extremists. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) now controls large swathes of those two countries as Britain and the US leads a coalition of countries carrying out airstrikes to slow the terrorist advance. Hundreds of photos and videos have been posted on social media, showing the atrocities committed by the terrorist group, including mass executions, crucifixions and the beheadings of kidnapped British and American journalists and aid workers. Queen Rania concluded: ‘We either develop our region, or we let others dismantle it – find solutions to the challenges, or watch the challenges avalanche; harness the tools to drive the Arab world forward in the 21st century, or let others use those tools to drag us back to the Dark Ages.’ More than 600 people are attending the 5th edition of the Abu Dhabi Media Summit to discuss the future of the media in the Arab world and beyond.","The 44-year-old monarch was speaking to the Abu Dhabi Media Summit .

"Lord Mayor John Thomas (pictured) was said to be upset at being told he would have to dine separately from his female consort . A Lord Mayor walked out of an Islamic charity lunch after discovering that he would have to be segregated from his female consort. Labour councillor John Thomas, 70, arrived at the function last Sunday with consort Margaret Corley, 72. But Councillor Thomas, the Lord Mayor of Leicester, was said to be upset at being told he would have to dine in an upstairs function room with male guests, while his consort would be seated downstairs with the other women. The lunch was held to mark the end of Charity Week – an annual fundraising event supported by around 20 university Islamic societies in the UK, and others in Canada and Qatar. It took place at a wedding and conference venue near Leicester railway station. Guests at the event, who paid £6 a ticket, were told that the week of fundraising to help orphaned and disadvantaged children raised £730,000. But Councillor Thomas seemed to be in no mood for celebrating and left early. It is understood Mrs Corley left with him. A source at the event said the Mayor had ‘insulted’ other guests by walking out, adding: ‘Students from universities, colleges and schools raised over £732,000 in just one week. ‘They contributed their time and efforts to raise money. The Lord Mayor should have respected this work.’ Councillor Thomas, who lives with his disabled wife Irene, 59, in Hamilton, Leicester, declined to comment on the matter. Scroll down for video . But another source with knowledge of the incident said the Mayor’s office had previously been sent some information outlining what he could expect at the function. ‘The Mayor says no such information [about sitting separately] was passed to him, so the arrangement seems to have taken him by surprise’, they said. Ticket order forms for the event on Charity Week’s website featured separate boxes for ‘sisters’ and ‘brothers’. Mrs Corley, who lives in a bungalow in the nearby village of Scraptoft, also declined to comment. She is understood to be a widow, and it is not known how she came to be selected as the Lord Mayor’s consort. Councillor Thomas was elected to Leicester City Council in 1995 and currently represents Belgrave ward, a largely ethnic Indian district in a city where more than half of the population is non-white. Councillor Thomas was elected to the city council, which is located on Charles St (pictured), in 1995 . A spokesman for Islamic Relief, Charity Week’s partner organisation, said Councillor Thomas ‘arrived at the venue but left before the event started’. He added: ‘What happened was an unfortunate misunderstanding for which I want to apologise to the Lord Mayor on behalf of Islamic Relief and Charity Week. ‘None of the Charity Week organisers told the Lord Mayor he could not sit with his partner, and if anyone else at the event did then they were mistaken. The Lord Mayor and his partner would have been more than welcome to enjoy this event together.’","Lord Mayor John Thomas was said to be upset at being segregated .

"Authorities in Florida are on the hunt for a 33-year-old man who they say went on a rampage killing his wife and two other people, including a pastor. Police on Thursday were searching for Andres 'Andy' Avalos. The Manatee County sheriff's office said he killed Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, at the Bayshore Baptist Church. A witness to the shooting told deputies at the scene about the other two victims, said sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow. Scroll down for video . Manhunt: Andres 'Andy' Avalos (left), 33, is accused of going on a rampage that has left three people dead, including his wife of 14 years, Amber (right) Slain: Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, was found dead inside his Bradenton, Florida, church. Pictured here is the clergyman's family: wife Joy and their two young children . 'We don't know exactly what transpired,' Bristow said. Investigators went to the couple's house at 1200 67th Street Northwest in Bradenton and found the bodies of 33-year-old Amber Avalos, the suspect's wife of 14 years, and a neighbor, 46-year-old Denise Potter. Investigators believe Andy Avalos first killed the two women at home and then drove across town to the church at around 1pm to kill the pastor. Manatee County deputies responded to the church on 14th Street West around 1:20pm, where they discovered James Battle's body. At the church, deputies 'learned of the possibility of other victim(s),' the Manatee County Sheriff's Office said. Amber Avalos worked at the church as its nursery and children's director. The Avaloses have six children and Bristow said they are in the custody of a relative. Happy couple: Amber and Andres got married in 2000 and had six children together . Timeline: Police believe Avalos killed his wife (left) and the neighbor first at their home, and then drove across town to kill Pastor Battle (right) Detectives say Mr Avalos was last seen near the church driving a gold-colored 2003 Chevrolet Suburban with 484VTZ plates in Bradenton. He is considered armed and dangerous. 'We don't know if whether or not he is still alive,' Bristow said. 'We presume he is.' The Bayshore Baptist website said that Andy Avalos' father also is a minister. It says Battle and his wife of seven years, Joy, who is the church's secretary, have a 5-year-old daughter, Sophie, and a 2-year-old son, Joshua. 'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart was quoted by the Bradenton Herald as saying. 'I don't know how she will get through this.' E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship. 'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said. 'It will take me days to get over this. He was in the prime of his life.' The newspaper quoted Sheriff Brad Steube as saying that Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting. 'The pastor saw this coming,' he said. Tight-knit family: Battle and his wife of seven years, Joy, worked together at the church. They have a 5-year-old daughter, Sophie, and a 2-year-old son, Joshua . Shooting: A body was found at Bayshore Baptist Church in Bradenton on Thursday afternoon . Jane Riley, a neighbor of the Avalos family, told The Associated Press that the neighborhood near the Manatee River is 'like the sweetest little community,' although she did point out that in 2008, a previous tenant of the Avaloses' home was slain during a home invasion. 'Now I'm scared,' said Riley. 'I have an alarm system, but is that enough? I hope the cops hang around for a while.' Five local schools - Manatee High School, King Middle Schoo, Miller Elementary School and Palma Sola Elementary School - were placed on lockdown in response to the shooting, but the lockdowns were lifted at 3.45pm, WFLA reported.","The Manatee County Sheriff's deputies are searching for Andres 'Andy' Avalos, 33, in connection to triple homicide .

"A judge has dropped shoplifting charges against a teenage mother caught carrying her dead baby in a shopping bag at Victoria's Secret. Tiona Rodriguez, then 17, was stopped on suspicion of stealing a $45 pair of trousers at the store in Herald Square, New York, in October last year. Police said security guards searched the girl's bags and found the remains of her infant son wrapped in a plastic bag and covered in clothes. A foetus was found in Tiona Rodriguez's shopping bag by a Victoria's Secret security guard who suspected the teenager of shoplifting . Prosecutors conceded yesterday that time had run out to try the misdemeanor theft case. But the Manhattan District Attorney's office is still trying to decide whether to  charge Rodriguez, now 18, in the death of her baby. Her attorney, Earl Ward, is hopeful there will not be further prosecution, saying it has been more than a year since she was arrested. 'I think that's a very positive sign. I have always said it's not a case of homicide, that it's the case of a baby that was stillborn,' Mr Ward said. Ms Rodriguez (right), who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before and put the remains in her bag because she didn't know what to do . The baby boy's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner in April and officials said the infant was less than a day old when he died of asphyxia. Ms Rodriguez, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before and had put the remains in her bag because she didn't know what to do. The young mother was released without bail after she pleaded not . guilty to petty larceny and possession of stolen property charges. At the time, authorities said they couldn't bring charges over the dead . baby until forensic tests determined exactly how the full-term newborn . died.

"Amir Khan's lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic are racing to get his American visa reinstated in time for him to be ringside in Las Vegas for Floyd Mayweather’s latest big-money extravaganza on Saturday night. Khan was turned back at Manchester airport on Thursday as he tried to check-in for a Virgin Atlantic flight to Sin City. No explanation was given, but the issue is likely to be a recurrence of previous difficulties which have arisen as a result of him being flagged up as being suspicious because of his name and his frequent visits to his family’s Pakistan homeland.

"It has five storeys, two kitchens and a private garage. At a first glance this period property is a steal at just £25,000. However, don't get your cheque book out just yet because this promising property is nothing more than a children's dolls' house. The extravagant toy called Walton Park has individually laid parquet flooring, Nina Campbell wallpapers, hand-crafted furniture and remote control lighting. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Puts Barbie's dream house in the shade: Walton Park has been put on the market by Savills estate agent for the grand price of £25,000 . The drawing room features gold silk curtains with a mini cream trim, an Aubusson rug, French furniture, a chandelier and dark wood flooring. There is also a dining room, library, master bedroom, three further bedrooms, a bathroom, utility room and a garage. In a Beatrix Potter themed nursery there are wooden floors, a luxury Moses basket, Dragons cot bed, toy box, chest of drawers and changer - all hand-painted in Potter's artwork. Miniature masterpiece: The property features individually laid parquet flooring, Nina Campbell wallpapers, hand-crafted furniture and remote control lighting . If Walton Park was a real home in central London experts believe that it would set the buyer back £15 million plus £1.7m in stamp duty. But the dolls' house, which took three months to make and weighs 160kg, is instead being marketed by Savills esate agents with a guide price of £25,000. Attention to detail: The intricately furnished bedroom, top, and living room . It was commissioned by Dragons of Walton Street, the children's interior specialist, and they will be donating 10 per cent of the sale proceeds to charity. To promote it, Savills has put together the same sort of brochure they produce for a £50m mansion. Charlie Bubear, head of Savills Chelsea, said that the extreme price tag of the dolls' house could be justified by the immaculate attention to detail that has gone into creating it. 'Walton Park has been finished to an exceptional standard, on a par with many of the prime properties we sell in Chelsea. If this was a real home on Gilston Road or The Little Bolton's I'd estimate it would total 4,198 sq ft with a capital value of £12.5m to £15m.' Beautifully finished: If a real property like this were to go on sale in London experts believe it would fetch around £15m . Work began on Walton Park in August 2014, with an average of 35 separate interior design decisions needed for each of the 15 rooms, totalling 525 interior design choices. The house certainly received its fair share in hours of labour with the parquet flooring alone taking 14 hours to sand, polish and complete. Lucinda Croft, managing director of Dragons of Walton Street, said the project had become all consuming over the past three months but says that it had been entirely worth it. 'This has been a complete labour of love and everyone at Dragons has lived and breathed Walton Park for months. Everything may have been in miniature but there have been some pretty big headaches,' Lucinda said. Ready for Christmas: When the house does sell, ten per cent of the proceeds will be donated to charity .","Commissioned by Dragon's of Walton Street, Walton Park is being marketed by Savills estate agents for £25,000 .

"House Speaker John Boehner seemed to nudge the U.S. one step closer to putting those elusive 'boots on the ground' in the Middle East on Sunday, saying that President Obama will ultimately have to deploy ground forces to fight ISIS if no other country steps up to do it. 'We have no choice,' Boehner said. 'These are barbarians. They intend to kill us. And if we don't destroy them first, we're gonna pay the price.' General Lord Richards, a legendary British military leader who was chief of the defence staff until last year, agrees. He said Sunday that 'the only way to defeat ISIS is to take back land they are occupying, which means a conventional military operation.' 'The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies,' Richards told the Sunday Times, 'but I understand the political resistance.' House Speaker John Boehner told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that the US will have no choice but to deploy ground troops in the Middle East if no other countries step up . President Barack Obama said Sunday on CBS that his intelligence services had underestimated ISIS, but insisted that Arab nations would ultimately band together and fight the way he doesn't want to . Obama has pursued a strategy of targeted airstrikes coupled with Special Forces on the ground in small numbers, hoping to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' ISIS, which styles itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. The president has also worked with Congress to fund a 'train and equip' program in the hope of whipping the small Free Syrian Army into fighting shape. Lord Richards, the former UK defence staff chief, said a 'conventional military operation' will be the only way to defeat ISIS . That's a process that military observers say could take a year and yield only 5,000 fighters at the outset. ISIS can field an army of up to 31,000, according to intelligence reports. Boehner said on ABC's 'This Week' program that 'if the goal is to destroy ISIS, as the president says it is, I don't believe the strategy that he outlined will accomplish that.' 'At the end of the day, I think it's gonna take more than airstrikes to drive them outta there,' he said. 'At some point, somebody's boots have to be on the ground. That's the whole point.' 'And maybe we can get enough of these forces trained to get ‘em on the battlefield,' the speaker mused. 'But somebody's boots have to be there.' Richards criticized Obama's plan to rely on airstrikes to scatter the ISIS army. 'Ultimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives we’ve set ourselves,' he said. 'All air [strikes] will do is destroy elements of ISIS; it won’t achieve our strategic goal.' Similarly, the retired general told The Australian on Monday, paying close attention to ISIS only in Iraq is a counterproductive strategy. 'You can't possibly defeat ISIS by only attacking them in Iraq,' he said. 'How the hell can you win the war when most of your enemy can end up in a country you can’t get involved in?' 'Even if you are successful in Iraq, which I doubt, they will just go into Syria, and what will you have achieved? They will just have tighter lines of communication.' Boehner chided the president for telegraphing the shrinking size of his tactical toolbox by repeatedly pledging not to deploy U.S. troop divisions into Syria or Iraq. 'If I were the president, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do,' Boehner insisted. He said he would call Congress back into session immediately if the White House proposed a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. Obama is relying on an 11-year-old AUMF, aimed at al-Qaeda, to prosecute his war against ISIS. 'I think he does have the authority to do it,' Boehner said, 'but the point I'm making is this is a proposal the Congress ought to consider.' Telegraphing moves: Boehner said that 'if I were the president, I probably wouldn't have talked about what I wouldn't do' 'The president typically in a situation like this would call for an authorization vote, and go sell that to the American people and send a resolution to [Capitol] Hill,' he told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos. 'The president has not done that.' Appearing on 'Fox News Sunday,' Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barasso said the president 'has an obligation to call us back tomorrow to start this debate.' But, he claimed, Democrats in Congress are resisting the idea of having to take a stand on going to war in the weeks leading up to an election. 'I don't think Harry Reid wants this debate or the vote,' Barasso said, but 'I think we have an obligation.' 'The prime minister of Britain called the Parliament back,' he noted. 'No member of Congress should be left off the hook.'","House speaker said Sunday that 'it's gonna take more than airstrikes' to beat the terror army .

"The teenage son of a former rock musician who travelled to Syria after marrying an Islamist extremist has been arrested over burning a Union Jack near the family's home in Kent. The 18-year-old was arrested alongside two 14-year-old's in Borough Green near Sevenoaks after allegedly climbing up the flag pole outside a library, setting fire to the Union Jack and spitting on it on October 27. Kent Police are now thought to be investigating whether the vandals were spurred on by a religious hatred of the West as it was revealed one is the son of jihadist Sally Jones who fled the UK last year. The 18-year-old's mother Sally Jones travelled to Syria last year to join ISIS militants after marrying an Islamic extremist she met on Twitter. Jones regularly posts on Twitter about her life in the northern city of Raqqa . The son of jihadi bride Sally Jones was arrested alongside two other teenagers in October for burning and spitting on a Union Jack outside the Borough Green Library in Kent . Forty-five-year-old Jones, a life-long benefit claimant, joined terrorists in the Middle East after marrying convicted computer hacker and Islamic extremist Junaid Huddsain, 20. The couple, who met on Twitter, post regular threats to the West and recite Islamic prophecies on the micro-blogging site from their new home in Raqqa, northern Syria. CCTV footage from October 27 implicated the eldest of Jones's two sons in the flag-burning incident outside Borough Green Library, the Times reports. He was released on bail with two younger alleged accomplices. A Kent Police spokesman confirmed their arrests, saying: ''Two males, aged 14 and 18, remain on police bail until 20 December following a report of criminal damage in Borough Green, in which a flag is reported to have been burnt. 'A third male, aged 14, was later arrested on 6 November and remains on bail. The three arrested people have had their bail extended until 20 December.' Jones, a life-long benefits claimant, converted to Islam and fled the UK after marrying the extremist . A photograph posted on one of the Twitter accounts Jones and her toyboy husband use from the Middle East shows the veiled 45-year-old toting an AK-47 . The flag has since been replaced by workmen in the village, with residents shocked such vandalism was carried out in the run-up to Remembrance Day. Since converting to Islam, the teenager's mother has documented her aggressive allegiance with ISIS online. Posting under the Muslim name Umm Hussain Al-Britani, the 45-year-old regularly boasts of life in Raqqa, one of the terrorist group's most significant strong-holds. Jones, who is thought to have taken her youngest son with her to the war-torn country, married toyboy terrorist Junaid Hussain after meeting the 20-year-old on Twitter. Hussain was jailed in 2012 for hacking former prime minister Tony Blair's personal details and publishing them online. At the time he admitted making nuisance phone calls to jam terrorism hotlines. His lawyer claimed his actions were nothing more than a 'teenage prank', and were no worse than those of the Bullingdon Club - an Oxford university society to which David Cameron and Boris Johnson have been linked.

"David Cameron last night urged Britain to shake off the spectre of the Iraq war and back potentially years of RAF strikes against the ‘psychopathic murderers’ of Islamic State. MPs have been scrambled for an emergency recall of Parliament tomorrow to sanction bombing raids on terrorist positions in northern Iraq. All three party leaders indicated support for air strikes, and the attacks are expected to begin as early as tomorrow night. But the Prime Minister said the fight against Islamic terrorism could last for years. Mr Cameron, who last night held talks with Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi to finalise military plans, stressed that British troops would not be sent back to Iraq. Scroll down for video . The world stage: Prime Minister David Cameron  speaks at the 69th United Nations General Assembly in New York City yesterday, where he called on his fellow national leaders to join in the campaign against Islamist extremism from Iraq and Syria to Yemen, Libya and Nigeria . And he said that any bombing raids on IS forces in Syria would have to be subject to a separate vote in Parliament. In a speech to the United Nations general assembly in New York, Mr Cameron acknowledged the long shadow cast by the disastrous legacy of the 2003 Iraq war, which left the region in near anarchy - and, some say, sowed the seeds of the rise of Islamic State. But he said it was vital to 'learn the right lessons - Yes to careful preparation; no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan'. Mr Cameron warned: 'We must not be so frozen with fear that we don't do anything at all. 'Isolation and withdrawing from a problem like Isil will only make things worse. 'We must not allow past mistakes to become an excuse for indifference or inaction.' Action against IS should be 'comprehensive, intelligent and inclusive', working with partners in the region, potentially including Iran - whose president Hassan Rouhani he met for historic talks at the UN. And he added: 'We should be uncompromising, using all the means at our disposal - including military force - to hunt down these extremists.' The struggle with extremism must be waged not only against IS in Iraq and Syria, but also against Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Ansar Al-Sharia in Libya and al-Qaida in Yemen, Mr Cameron said. While the threat would not be best solved by Western ground troops 'directly trying to pacify or reconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries', there was a place for the military in training, advising and supporting humanitarian missions, as well as in responding to the Iraqi government's request to the UN for support. 'My message today is simple,' he told the UN. 'We are facing an evil against which the whole world must unite. And, as ever in the cause of freedom, democracy and justice, Britain will play its part.' Ahead of his speech he told reporters: ‘This is completely different to 2003. Everyone can see that Isil (IS) is a direct threat to the UK. They have taken hostages, they have conducted plots to kill and maim British citizens. They are a clear and present danger to the United Kingdom. They are also clearly a massive danger to the region. RAF Tornado GR4 fighter bombers fly in formation as two refuel from a VC-10 in 2009. Six of the fighters are currently based in Cyprus . David Cameron last night urged Britain to shake off the spectre of the Iraq war and back  RAF strikes against the ‘psychopathic murderers’ of Islamic State . ‘So this organisation is a direct threat. We need to be part of a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy it. It’s right that Britain plays our part in that. ‘This is going to take time, there’s no doubt about that, but it’s right to be part of this action. The Iraqi government has requested it and we have capabilities that are needed for it and so it’s the right thing to do.’ IS has murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and is now threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning. Some relatives of Mr Henning have warned this week that air strikes could reduce the hopes of ever seeing him alive again. Mr Cameron acknowledged their plight, but insisted Britain now had to take the fight to IS.

Some 140,000 mainly Kurdish refugees have now crossed the border into Turkey after the militants moved on the town of Ain al-Arab . An IS militant firing a cannon mounted on a truck during fighting near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ain al-Arab, . He said: ‘It’s a desperate situation but let’s be clear about two things. ‘One is that we are dealing with psychopathic murderous brutal people who will stop at nothing to carry out dreadful acts on these hostages. ‘And secondly, it’s very important that we do the right thing as a country and we stick to the path that we set out about having a comprehensive strategy including all the elements at our disposal – humanitarian aid, diplomacy and also where appropriate military action.’ The Prime Minister said Britain would never give up the hunt for Jihadi John, the British extremist thought to have beheaded three hostages. Asked if he wanted him to face justice in a British court, a visibly angry Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m not sure I can describe in words what I’d like to happen to him, but I’m not going to say any more about it. He should see justice one way or another.’ He backed US and Arab air strikes against IS in Syria but said Britain would not be joining in at this stage. The wife of British hostage Alan Henning last night thanked wellwishers for their support as more than 150 people attended a multi-faith peace vigil in Bolton to pray for his release. A statement from Barbara Henning was read to the crowd by her husband’s friend Sadir Jameel, who described the taxi driver as ‘like a brother to me’. It read: ‘We are very grateful for your support and kind words at this difficult time. I ask you all to pray for Alan and all the other people unfairly imprisoned worldwide.’ Muslim, Christian and Hindu faith leaders all called for Mr Henning’s release. Sabir Khan, of the Bolton Council of Mosques, said the Muslim community ‘unreservedly and absolutely condemned’ both his kidnap and the recent murder of Briton David Haines. A vigil for captured Salford Taxi driver Alan Henning at Bolton mosque. He is currently being held by IS militants, who snatched him as he delivered aid to Syria . The wife of the British hostage has called on 'the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband', describing him as a 'peaceful, selfless man' Last night it appeared Mr Cameron had sufficient support in Parliament to win a vote on military strikes tomorrow – meaning Britain will be at war by the weekend. Labour leader Ed Miliband held an emergency meeting of his shadow cabinet at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, and spoke by telephone to the Prime Minister. He indicated that his party, which inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mr Cameron last year when it pulled its support for military strikes in Syria, is ready to back action in Iraq. But to the anger of some Conservative MPs, he said joining the US in hitting Syria, where IS is thought to be holding Mr Henning, would need to be approved by a UN Security Council resolution – something that is politically impossible given the opposition of Russia and China. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party backed the air strikes because they were requested by the Iraqis. Mr Cameron also held talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani – the first face-to-face talks between the leaders of the two countries since the Iranian revolution in 1979. Air raids eliminate top terrorist in Syria... and Obama promises to end 'the network of death' Islamic State’s ‘network of death’ will be destroyed by military force, Barack Obama vowed yesterday. Warning jihadis to leave the battlefield, the US president said the terror group understood only violence. ‘No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning – no negotiation – with this brand of evil,’ he told the UN. ‘The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.’ Attack: The  U.S. has released footage of Tomahawk missiles being fired from the USS Arleigh Burke - a guided missile destroyer stationed in the Red Sea . The president spoke after a second night of air strikes on Syria destroyed IS weapons caches and infrastructure. US officials said they believed one of the world’s most wanted terrorists was killed in the first wave of attacks. Muhsin Al Fadhli was said to have died with 50 fellow members of his Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group at a training camp near Aleppo in Syria. The Pentagon said the group was nearing the ‘execution phase’ of an attack in Europe or America, probably against airports and passenger planes. The aerial bombardment has been carried out with support from Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain and Qatar. IS has seized a huge swathe of Syria and Iraq, forcing entire communities to flee in terror. Obama: 'The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death' The threat has drawn the Obama presidency back into conflicts in the Middle East which he had sought to avoid after Washington’s lengthy involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. His officials have said the aerial campaign could last for years. ‘In this effort, we do not act alone. Nor do we intend to send US troops to occupy foreign lands,’ the president said. ‘Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back Isil (IS). We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground. ‘We will work to cut off their financing and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. Already over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. ‘Today, I ask the world to join in this effort.’ Mr Obama recounted IS atrocities against women and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria and beheadings of hostages.","MPs have been recalled to Parliament tomorrow to sanction strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq .

"An Islamic State terror attack on soldiers in their barracks in Britain is believed to be so likely, 'It's not a question of if, but when', a security specialist warned today. Threat expert Will Geddes said that reports of up to three Isis terror cells planning attacks on troops were 'highly likely', adding: 'I think three is probably a conservative figure'. And he said that a second threat was the high likelihood of a 'lone wolf' terror attack here, similar to those that killed two soldiers in Canada this week. 'Unlike the Al Qaeda-style ""big spectaculars"" such as 9/11, 7/7, and the Madrid bombings, the threat from Isis is a much more low-level, under the radar, visceral type of terrorism, often involving just one or two lone wolves operating alone,' he told MailOnline. An attack on soldiers in Britain is so likely, 'it's not a question of if but when', a terror expert said today, in the wake of the murder of Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, left,  by Muslim convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 26, in Canada . Mr Geddes said the spontaneity of 'lone wolf' terrorists, who could buy a knife and attack people in a landmark location such as Oxford Street, pictured, made them difficult for counter-terror agencies to detect in advance . Threat expert Will Geddes, right spoke out  as David Cameron ordered a review of security at British landmarks . Mr Geddes, of security and counter terrorism firm International Corporate Protection, spoke after Whitehall sources reportedly said they had discovered Isis terror cells carrying out surveillance on four barracks across the country. The worrying intelligence suggested an attack on British troops and their families - similar to the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in May last year - might be imminent. Mr Geddes said: 'Sadly it's not a question of if, but when.  I certainly think we will see something.' His warning coincided with recent arrests of terror suspects.  Last week four British men were charged with terror offences after allegedly carrying out 'hostile reconnaissance' of Shepherd's Bush Police Station and White City Territorial Army Barracks in west London using Google street view. As well as the threat from terror cells involving several terrorists working together, British security agencies are concerned about the increasing risk from radicalised individuals . Fusilier Lee Rigby, 25, was murdered outside Woolwich Barracks in south east London last May . Mr Geddes said such attacks might be planned by two types of Islamic extremists - those who wanted to join Isis in Syria but were unable to, like Ottawa gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 26, whose passport had been confiscated by authorities, and those who had been over there but had returned to home turf with the desire to carry out an attack there. The security expert said:'The lone wolf attack by just one or two people is the biggest concern to British security agencies, particularly the spontaneity of such attacks. 'You can go into Argos, buy knives, and be out on Oxford Street attacking people within an hour, which makes such attacks very difficult to predict. 'The degree of violence that is potentially being deployed by these extremists is of especial concern - they are wanting to execute someone - behead them - in the street, and the fact that these days people tend to whip out their phones and record things means the impact of such an attack would be huge.' He said the best weapon against such an attack was the vigilance of members of the public, and urged people to report any suspicious behaviour immediately. Security agencies are said to be 'working all hours' fighting the terror threat on home soil, witnessed by the high rise in the number of recent terror arrests. Military personnel and police officers, particularly those who wear uniform in the street, have been warned to be alert to the dangers, and Prime Minister David Cameron has spoken to the heads of MI5 and Scotland Yard to review security at landmark buidings in Britain. His talks with MI5 boss Andrew Parker and Met police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe came in the wake of Wednesday's fatal attack by Muslim convert Zehaf-Bibeau on Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 24, as he guarded the National War Memorial in central Ottawa.  The gunman then stormed the parliament building before being shot dead by former Mountie, sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, 58.

"A female fighter pilot yesterday led Britain’s first combat mission against Islamic State – as the RAF launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists. The unnamed officer piloted one of two heavily-armed jets that flew from a top-security RAF base in Cyprus on the dangerous sortie over IS-held territory in Northern Iraq, before returning safely to complete her 2,000-mile round trip. The sortie, lasting several hours, was the first mission for the RAF’s Operation Shader against IS militants. And last night two more Tornado GR4 aircraft took off from the Cyprus base, bound for Northern Iraq. Scroll down for video . Two of the RAF crew, clad in MK14 suits with special g-force protection, carry flight equipment with them as they head out  to fly over IS-controlled territory in Iraq . The first day of ‘Gulf War Three’, the first British combat missions over Iraq for six years, involved Tornados bristling with sophisticated weaponry flying in support of Iraqi troops engaging IS terrorists in trench warfare below. Defence sources conceded last night that neither of the Tornados in the first wave engaged the enemy and both jets returned to RAF Akrotiri with their full payloads of rockets and ammunition intact – highlighting growing concern over whether Britain is pulling its weight in the coalition arrayed against IS. Female Tornado pilots conducted hundreds of sorties over Afghanistan as part of Britain’s war against the Taliban. In early 2010, Flight Lieutenant Juliette Fleming (right) described how she was repeatedly called upon to swoop down within 100ft of rocket-wielding fanatics to disrupt their attacks on UK troops in Helmand province. Flt Lieut Fleming was based at RAF Marham, Norfolk, where many of the air crew serving as part as Operation Shader are based. There are thought to be about ten female fighter pilots cleared to fly Typhoon or Tornado jets in combat missions for the RAF. The Americans by contrast, yesterday continued their heavy bombardment of key IS strongholds around the city of Raqqa, in Northern Syria, where it is believed British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held under threat of decapitation. The Mail on Sunday was invited to witness the first Tornados taking off, as Britain finally joined the international coalition taking offensive action against IS, which has taken control of vast areas of Northern Iraq and Syria. The mission remained the subject of secrecy last night as defence sources refused to disclose whether the RAF pilots had flown in support of Iraqi or Kurdish fighters and whether the mission had been a success. The first mission was described as a ‘routine operational sortie’ with air crews using new rules of engagement approved by Parliament on Friday for the first time. A defence source said: ‘The mission involved responding to a changing situation on the ground, with moving targets rather than static positions being on the agenda. ‘The aircraft were equipped with weapon systems reflecting the operational requirements but on this occasion no rockets were fired. ‘The two Tornados then flew back to RAF Akrotiri and the crews went through their routine debriefing process. ‘It is likely that further missions will take place in the days ahead.’ The MoS understands that yesterday’s first mission was conducted by No 2 Squadron RAF and followed a request for air support received on Friday evening – only a few hours after MPs voted by an overwhelming majority of 524 votes to 43 to endorse attacks on the militants in Iraq. The requirements of the specific mission were then pieced together overnight and into yesterday morning, with officers from the RAF’s 140 Expeditionary Air Wing (EAW), which deployed to Cyprus last month, liaising with staff at Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) back in Britain. Then, at about 9.30am and in humid conditions at the base on Cyprus’s southern coast, the chosen pilots and navigators emerged from a hangar and walked casually towards their aircraft. They spent almost an hour inspecting every inch of the Tornados, checking for any fault which could compromise their safety. Then the crews climbed two-by-two inside their aircraft, strapped themselves and lowered the canopies. Until yesterday, their missions, though vital, had been benign. This was the first time they could have been called upon to extinguish human life. At around 10.30am, the Tornados rolled onto the runway and, with a deafening howl of their Rolls-Royce engines, sped across the tarmac and ascended rapidly into the overcast Eastern Mediterranean skies. They were followed minutes later by a huge RAF Voyager refuelling aircraft, used to top up aviation gas supplies for the round trip to Northern Iraq. As a diplomatic courtesy to countries who do not wish to publicise their role in the coalition against IS, defence sources declined to disclose the flight path taken by the aircraft as they flew to and from the battlefield. The pilots were guided over IS-held territory by American flight planners. The involvement of a woman RAF pilot comes after female pilot Major Mariam Al Mansouri of the UAE was revealed to have flown an F-16 jet in bombing raids against IS positions in Syria last week. Yesterday, the US and other coalition countries again conducted air strikes against known IS targets inside the enemy’s heartland of Syria. Defence experts have argued that the only way to defeat IS is to target them where they are strongest but British forces remain restricted in where they may launch attacks against the jihadis. It was with great relief to all 2,500 military and civilian personnel stationed at RAF Akrotiri that the first pair of jets touched down safely at around 3.30pm local time yesterday.

Shortly afterwards, defence sources confirmed that neither aircraft undertook offensive action and that – despite media attention – the mission had been restricted to reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering. An MoD spokesman said: ‘Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 aircraft have been flying intelligence gathering missions over Iraq for a number of weeks. Today, following the parliamentary approval given yesterday, in company with other aircraft from the international coalition, two Tornados conducted armed reconnaissance operations over areas of Iraq where the terrorists threaten the civilian population. ‘Although on this occasion no targets were identified as requiring immediate air attack by our aircraft, the intelligence gathered by the Tornados’ highly sophisticated surveillance equipment will be invaluable in developing the best possible understanding of ISIL’s disposition and help acquire potential targets for future operations. ‘Furthermore, we know that the very presence of coalition air power has a significant impact on ISIL’s efforts to attack the Iraqi people. ‘With no effective defence against air strikes, and knowing the precision with which coalition aircraft can hit them, the terrorists are forced to be much more cautious, keeping their forces dispersed and movement inhibited. A pair of Tornado GR4 jets flew in support of Iraqi troops engaging IS terrorists in trench warfare below . ‘They also know that should they concentrate to deliver an attack against Iraqi or Kurdish troops, aircraft are likely to arrive overhead very soon afterwards.’ News of the Tornados’ first sorties came as the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that US air strikes in Raqqa killed 23 IS terrorists yesterday. There was fierce fighting between Kurdish militia and the IS fanatics for the town of Kobani on the Syria-Turkey border, which has been besieged for the last ten days. Most of the local population – numbering about 150,000 people – have poured into Turkey as the IS fighters battle for control of the strategically important area. Dozens of IS extremists continued to shell the town yesterday.

"Nick Clegg has been accused of allowing Liberal Democrats to 'work to rule' Nick Clegg has been accused of allowing Liberal Democrats to ‘work to rule’ as they concentrate on trying to cling on to their Commons seats. With their party crashing in the polls, ministers are said to be failing to pull their weight in the last months of this Parliament. Lynne Featherstone, the Home Office minister, has absented herself from key Commons business, according to two senior Whitehall sources. Karen Bradley, a junior Conservative Home Office minister, had to stand in for her during a recent debate on child abuse, while a whip, Damian Hinds, was due to take her place in a discussion on anti-social behaviour. Energy Secretary Ed Davey, meanwhile, is alleged to be spending more and more time campaigning in his marginal Kingston and Surbiton constituency, which the Tories hope to win in May, rather than in his Government department. Mr Clegg himself ducked out of the Government’s Autumn Statement on Wednesday and instead went to Penzance, a marginal Lib Dem seat. ‘Taxpayers will be shocked to discover some Liberal Democrat ministers are on work to rule,’ said one senior Whitehall source. ‘Lynne Featherstone is getting paid a ministerial salary but is not doing the job properly. Apart from anything else, it’s important that the Commons gets a chance to question ministers on key issues.’ Even some Lib Dem colleagues, including former Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, criticised Mr Clegg’s absence from the Autumn Statement. The Deputy Prime Minister has also been absent from the past three sessions of Prime Minister’s Questions. Tory ministers suspect the Lib Dems are attempting to distance themselves from the Government ahead of the election. George Osborne claimed the Lib Dems agree to Coalition plans in private, ‘and then in public they slag them off’. The Chancellor was infuriated after Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable claimed his plans to dramatically reduce spending were ‘wholly unrealistic’. Miss Featherstone, who faces a tough fight to fend off Labour attempts to overturn her majority of 6,875 in Hornsey and Wood Green, north London, was moved to the Home Office from the international development department last month, after the resignation of Norman Baker. Energy Secretary Ed Davey (Left) is alleged to be spending more and more time campaigning in his marginal  constituency and Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone has been said to have been absent from key Commons business . A Lib Dem spokesman denied that Mr Clegg had given Miss Featherstone, who is paid £100,000 as minister of state, a green light to miss debates and accused Tory colleagues of ‘mischief-making’. He said she had been on the front bench several times since being appointed. ‘It is categorically untrue to say Nick has told Lynne Featherstone that she doesn’t have to do any Parliamentary business. She has done Home Office questions, a debate about drug misuse and a select committee on violence against women. Sometimes ministers have other ministers cover for them.’ Of Mr Clegg’s no-show, the spokesman added: ‘We are always being told politicians don’t understand how their policies affect ordinary people, so Nick went to speak to people in Cornwall.’","Liberal Democrat ministers accused of failing to pull their weight .

"Two-thirds of Australians support Prime Minister Tony Abbott confronting Vladimir Putin over the shooting down of MH17, a week after he pledged to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the tragedy. The latest Newspoll has found 63 per cent backed Mr Abbott taking a tough stance against President Putin at a G20 meeting in Brisbane next month, while only 27 per cent opposed it. The prime minister grabbed global headlines after pledging to shirtfront Mr Putin during the G20 leader meeting, comments he later backed away from. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he will question Russian leader Vladimir Putin face to face at the G20 summit . Australia has imposed trade bans on Russia and expressed his anger over Russia's support for separatists who shot down the Malaysia Airlines flight where 38 Australians were killed . Instead, he insisted he would hold robust talks with the Russian president over the 'murder' of 38 Australians who died when MH17 was shot down over east Ukraine. Labor's lead over the government also increased according to the poll published by The Australian on Tuesday, with its two party preferred vote rising two points to 53 per cent. But Labor leader Bill Shorten's disapproval rating hit its highest ever level at 46 per cent. The coalition's overall support fell to a three-month low, with its two party preferred vote falling to 47 per cent. Mr Abbott remained the preferred prime minister with 39 per cent support, compared to Mr Shorten on 38 per cent. Mr Abbott's vow to 'shirtfront' Mr Putin prompted a barrage of insults back from a Russian news site. The world was shocked when Malaysian Airwatys flight  MH17 was shot down by Russian separatists . After consulting with other G20 members, Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Putin would not be banned from the economic leaders' summit next month. As the G20 is an international organisation which works on consensus, Australia does not have the right to bar any member from attending, Mr Abbott said. Labor leader Bill Shorten said he would not give the time of day to Mr Putin. But Mr Abbott, who will host the summit, says it is better to engage his Russian counterpart. 'I'm going to shirtfront Mr Putin,' the prime minister said last week. 'I'm going to be saying to Mr Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment.' Speculation over the exact meaning of 'shirtfront' soon ensued on social media following the Prime Minister's comments, but was soon revealed to be a slang word for an aggressive and now illegal 'front on bump' in Australian Rules Football. Mr Abbott also said he would  demand that Russia co-operate with the criminal investigation into the MH17 disaster and if evidence is required from the nation, it should be provided. Labor leader Bill Shorten says the MH17 tragedy was 'an act of murder' and he would not give Putin the 'light of day'","Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to question Putin about MH17 .
